The court concluded application of the 2000 amendment would violate the state and federal Constitutions\u2019 equal protection clauses and prohibitions against ex post facto laws. Manuel argues there is no statutory basis on which the People may file an appeal of the order and we therefore should dismiss their appeal. Because the People do not have a statutory basis on which to appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>the order, we dismiss the appeal. Nevertheless, we treat the People\u2019s appeal as a petition for writ of mandate and grant that petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">In July 1996 a section 602 petition was filed charging Manuel with two counts of committing a forcible lewd and lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (b)). Manuel was 15 years old in December 1995 at the time of the alleged acts. After Manuel admitted one count, the court dismissed the other count and declared him a ward of the juvenile court. It granted him probation until his 18th birthday or until earlier terminated by the court. He was placed in the custody of his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">In August 1998 the court terminated Manuel\u2019s probation and wardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">In March 2001 Manuel filed a section 781 petition requesting an order sealing the records relating to his juvenile case. The probation department opposed Manuel\u2019s petition, arguing that Proposition 21\u2019s amendments to section 781, effective March 8, 2000, prohibit the sealing of records of persons who committed an offense listed in section 707, subdivision (b), including a Penal Code section 288, subdivision (b) offense, if the person was 14 years of age or older at the time of the offense. The district attorney also argued that section 781, as amended by Proposition 21, prohibits the sealing of Manuel\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">On May 8 the court granted the petition, finding that the application of amended section 781 to Manuel\u2019s case would violate the state and federal Constitutions\u2019 equal protection clauses and prohibitions against ex post facto laws. The court stayed its order to allow the district attorney to file a petition for writ of mandate challenging the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">On August 2, after we denied the district attorney\u2019s petition for writ of mandate, the court removed its stay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">On August 3 the People filed a notice of appeal of the order sealing Manuel\u2019s juvenile records.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">\n<em>The Order Is Not Appealable by the People Under Section 800</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The People\u2019s brief contends their appeal \u201cis authorized by section 800, subdivision (b)(2),\u201d which provides that the People may appeal \u201c[a]n order made after judgment entered pursuant to Section 777 or 785.\u201d Manuel argues that because the order in this case was <em>not </em>made after a judgment entered pursuant to either section <em>111 </em>or 785, section 800, subdivision (b)(2) does not apply and the People\u2019s appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">An appellate court has \u201cno authority to hear an appeal in the absence of appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(In re Almalik S. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 851, 854 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 619].) Appeals from juvenile court orders and judgments are permitted only as provided by statute. \u201cThe People\u2019s right to appeal in . . . juvenile court proceedings is conferred exclusively by statute.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Arthur </em>R.)

If, pursuant to this paragraph, the people prosecute an appeal of the decision or any review of that decision, it shall be binding upon the people and they shall be prohibited from refiling the case which was appealed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-8\">\u201c(5) The imposition of an unlawful order at a dispositional hearing, whether or not the court suspends the execution of the disposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-9\">\u201c(c) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to authorize an appeal from an order granting probation. Instead, the people may seek appellate review of any grant of probation whether or not the court imposes disposition, by means of a petition for a writ of mandate or prohibition which is filed within 60 days after probation is granted. The review of any grant of probation shall include review of any order underlying the grant of probation. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">Section 777 relates only to an order that changes or modifies a previous custody order: \u201cAn order changing or modifying a previous order by removing a minor from the physical custody of a parent, guardian, relative, or friend and directing placement in a foster home, or commitment to a private institution or commitment to a county institution, or an order changing or modifying a previous order by directing commitment to the Youth Authority shall be made only after a noticed hearing. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">Section 785 allows a petition for termination or modification of a juvenile\u2019s wardship <em>if, </em>inter alia, the juvenile is found to be unfit for treatment under juvenile court law regarding an alleged <em>subsequent </em>offense: \u201c(a) Where a minor is a ward of the juvenile court, the wardship did not result in the minor\u2019s commitment to the Youth Authority, <em>and the minor is found not to be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law with respect to a subsequent allegation of criminal conduct, </em>any parent or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>person having an interest in the minor, or the minor, through a properly appointed guardian, the prosecuting attorney, or probation officer, may petition the court in the same action in which the minor was found to be a ward of the juvenile court for a hearing for an order to terminate or modify the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The People\u2019s appeal challenges the court\u2019s section 781 order sealing Manuel\u2019s juvenile records. That order was <em>not </em>\u201cmade after [a] judgment entered pursuant to Section 777 or 785.\u201d (\u00a7 800, subd. (b)(2).) The record does not contain any order or judgment <em>changing </em>or modifying Manuel\u2019s <em>custody </em>under section <em>111. </em>On the contrary, the record shows Manuel was placed in his mother\u2019s custody and successfully completed his probation, presumably without any change in that custody. The record also does not contain any order or judgment disposing of a section 785 petition to terminate Manuel\u2019s wardship based on a finding he was unfit for juvenile court treatment regarding a <em>subsequent </em>allegation of criminal conduct. On the contrary, the record shows Manuel successfully completed his probation in this case and does not contain any document showing he committed a subsequent criminal act. Therefore, the section 781 order sealing Manuel\u2019s juvenile records is <em>not </em>appealable by the People under section 800, subdivision (b)(2). Furthermore, our review of section 800, subdivision (b) shows that none of its other provisions apply in the circumstances of this case to allow the People to appeal the section 781 order sealing Manuel\u2019s juvenile records. Because section 800, subdivision (b) provides the exclusive basis for the People\u2019s appeal of juvenile court orders and judgments, we are without jurisdiction to consider the People\u2019s appeal of the section 781 order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(People v. Chi Ko Wong, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 709; <em>In re Almalik S., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th at p. 854; <em>People v. Superior Court (Arthur R.), supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d at p. 497.) Accordingly, we must dismiss their appeal. <em>(In re Almalik S., </em>at p. 854.)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">\n<em>We Nevertheless Treat the People\u2019s Appeal as a Petition for Writ of Mandate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Although the People do not expressly request that we treat their appeal as a petition for writ of mandate, we nevertheless conclude they impliedly requested such treatment based on the district attorney\u2019s earlier petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>writ of mandate and/or prohibition (which we denied incorrectly on the ground there was an adequate remedy by way of appeal). Furthermore, we conclude the interests of justice support our treatment of this appeal as a petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">\u201cAn appellate court has discretion to treat a purported appeal from a nonappealable order as a petition for writ of mandate, but that power should be exercised only in unusual circumstances. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(H. D. Arnaiz, Ltd. v. County of San Joaquin </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1357, 1366-1367 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 71].) In juvenile wardship cases, \u201c[t]he test controlling the People\u2019s entitlement to review by writ is derived from <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Howard) </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 491, 501 [72 Cal.Rptr. 330, 446 P.2d 138]. The test employs two criteria. First, the challenged trial court order must be an act \u2018in excess of jurisdiction.\u2019 Second, upon a careful balancing, the need to correct judicial errors prejudicing the People must outweigh the conflicting threat of harassment to the accused. The second criterion must be resolved against writ review whenever granting the writ would threaten defendant with double jeopardy.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Arthur R.), supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d at p. 502.) Most courts have interpreted <em>Howard\u2019s </em>use of the phrase \u201cexcess of jurisdiction\u201d as meaning \u201cany misinterpretation, misapplication or refusal to follow applicable constitutional, statutory or case law authority.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; In re Richard C. </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 477, 484 [152 Cal.Rptr. 787] [\u201cA considerable line of authorities holds that the court\u2019s failure to either properly interpret or follow the law is in excess of its jurisdiction and reviewable on the People\u2019s petition for a prerogative writ [citations].\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Because this case involves the issue of whether the trial court correctly interpreted and applied constitutional, statutory and case law in granting Manuel\u2019s section 781 petition, there is a question whether the court acted in \u201cexcess of jurisdiction\u201d as that phrase in <em>Howard </em>has been interpreted. Therefore, the first requirement for writ review is satisfied. Furthermore, because section 781 relates to the sealing of juvenile records, granting a writ of mandate in this case would not threaten Manuel with double jeopardy. <em>(People v. Superior Court (Arthur R.), supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d at p. 502.) Therefore, the second requirement is satisfied and there is no impediment to our consideration of the People\u2019s appeal as a petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">To the extent civil writ considerations apply, we conclude the People have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law to review the trial court\u2019s order, <em>(in re Albert B. </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 361, 373 [263 Cal.Rptr. 694].) Furthermore, because we previously denied the district attorney\u2019s writ petition on the incorrect ground there was an adequate remedy by way of appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>it would \u201cfurther the interests of judicial economy to treat the appeal as a petition for [writ] relief\u2019 rather than require the People to file another writ petition setting forth the same arguments made in their brief on appeal. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Also, \u201c(1) the briefs and record before us contain in substance all the elements prescribed by rule 56 of the California Rules of Court for an original mandate proceeding^] and (2) there are extraordinary circumstances justifying the exercise of [our power to treat the appeal as a petition for writ of mandate]. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Angell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 691, 698 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 657].)  Therefore, in the unusual circumstances of this case, we conclude we should reach the merits of the People\u2019s appeal by treating the appeal as a petition for writ of mandate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Angell, </em>at p. 698; <em>H.

Ansell </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 868, 884 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 145, 24 P.3d 1174].) <em>Ansell </em>stated: \u201c[A] substantial and disadvantageous change is prohibited only if it \u2018inflicts greater <em>punishment, </em>than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.\u2019 [Citation.] Unless the consequences are penal in nature, defendants cannot rely on statutes in existence at the time of the crime, or otherwise complain of oppressive retroactive treatment. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ansell, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 884, italics added in Ansell.) <em>Castellanos </em>noted: \u201c[T]he method of analyzing what constitutes punishment varies depending upon the context in which the question arises. But two factors appear important in each case: whether the Legislature intended the provision to constitute punishment and, if not, whether the provision is so punitive in nature or effect that it must be found to constitute punishment despite the Legislature\u2019s contrary intent.\u201d <em>(Castellanos, supra, </em>at p. 795, fn. omitted.) In determining whether a law is \u201cso punitive\u201d in either purpose or effect that it raises ex post facto concerns, the United States Supreme Court \u201chas considered such factors as whether the challenged law imposes an affirmative disability or restraint; whether any such sanction has been historically regarded as punishment; whether the law promotes the traditional aims of punishment (i.e., retribution and deterrence) through means commonly used in criminal statutes (e.g., imposing culpability for proscribed acts and requiring scienter); whether the law bears a rational connection to legitimate nonpenal aims; and whether it appears excessive in relation to such aims. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ansell, supra, </em>at pp. 885-886.)</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Acuna </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1056 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 224], the court concluded \u201ca defendant who has been denied expungement of his conviction by an amendment to the Penal Code enacted after he pled guilty has not been subjected to an ex post facto law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1058, fn. omitted.) In <em>Acuna, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty in 1993 to one count of committing a lewd act on a child under age 14 in violation of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a) and was granted probation. <em>(Ibid.) </em>At the time of the defendant\u2019s plea and sentencing, Penal Code section 1203.4 allowed him on completion of his probation to apply for expungement of his conviction. <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, before completion of the defendant\u2019s probation, Penal Code section 1203.4 was amended to prohibit expungement of Penal Code section 288 convictions. <em>(Acuna, </em>at p. 1059.) On completion of his probation, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>defendant moved for expungement of his conviction and the trial court denied the motion based on the amendment to Penal Code section 1203.4. <em>(Acuna, </em>at p. 1059.) On appeal, <em>Acuna </em>rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that application of amended Penal Code section 1203.4 would violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto, laws. <em>(Acuna, </em>at pp. 1059-1060.) It reasoned the Legislature did not intend that statutory amendment to be punitive. <em>(Ibid) </em>Rather, its legislative intent appeared to be public safety, stating: \u201cOur Legislature has determined that public safety is enhanced if those having been convicted of child molestation are not able to truthfully represent that they have no such conviction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1060.) <em>Acuna </em>also concluded that the statutory amendment\u2019s nature and effect were not so punitive that it be considered punishment. <em>(Ibid) </em>Even if expungement were permitted, <em>Acuna </em>noted the defendant nevertheless would be required to register as a sex offender, would have to disclose his conviction in applying for a professional license or public office, and could not own or possess a concealable firearm. <em>(Ibid) </em>Furthermore, under Penal Code section 1203.4, subdivision (a), his conviction could still be used as a prior conviction. <em>(Ibid) Acuna </em>stated: \u201cThere is no doubt that being unable to expunge [the defendant\u2019s] conviction places some burden on him. He cannot truthfully represent to friends, acquaintances and private sector employers that he has no conviction. But such a representation from a person convicted of molesting a child might give the public a false sense of security. It is this false sense of security the statute seeks to eliminate.\u201d <em>(Acuna, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 1060.) Accordingly, because the amended statute precluding expungement of Penal Code section 288 convictions was not punitive in intent, nature or effect, <em>Acuna </em>concluded the ex post facto clause did not bar its application to the defendant. <em>(Acuna, </em>at p. 1060.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Ansell, supra, 25 </em>Cal.4th 868 reached the same conclusion regarding an amendment to Penal Code section 4852.01 that precludes convicted sex offenders from obtaining certificates of rehabilitation. <em>(Ansell, </em>at pp. 871-872, 893.) <em>Ansell </em>concluded: \u201c[T]he amendment . . . does not impose punishment or otherwise implicate ex post facto concerns. We decline to invalidate this provision insofar as it withholds the certificate of rehabilitation procedure . . . from convicted sex offenders who, like [the defendant], committed their crimes prior to the amendment\u2019s effective date.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 893.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Castellanos, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 785 also rejected an ex post facto challenge of an amendment to Penal Code section 290 that requires the defendant to register as a sex offender for certain crimes he committed before that amendment. <em>(Castellanos, </em>at pp. 788-799.) <em>Castellanos </em>concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>the Legislature did not intend the registration requirement to constitute punishment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 796.) It further concluded the registration requirement was not so punitive in nature or effect that it must be regarded as punishment, despite the substantial burden it imposed on the convicted offender. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 799,)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">In granting Manuel\u2019s section 781 petition, the trial court concluded that Proposition 21\u2019s amendments to section 781 in 2000 did not apply to his commission in 1995 of a lewd act under Penal Code section 288, subdivision (b) because those amendments are punitive in nature and therefore their application would violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws. The court declined to follow the reasoning in <em>Acuna </em>and instead relied on <em>Doe I </em>v. <em>Otte </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 259 F.3d 979, certiorari granted Feb. 19, 2002, 534 U.S. 1126 [122 S.Ct. 1062, 151 L.Ed.2d 966], which concluded Alaska\u2019s sex offender registration statute was punitive in effect and therefore violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws. The trial court also cited <em>In re S. A. </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 241, 246 [85 Cal.Rptr. 775], which concluded that section 781\u2019s provisions for sealing juvenile records showed a legislative intent to protect juveniles from future prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">We conclude the trial court erred by finding Proposition 21\u2019s amendments to section 781 violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws. Assuming arguendo that those amendments apply retroactively, Manuel has not shown that the legislative intent of those amendments was to increase punishment or that their purpose, nature or effect is so punitive that they must be considered punishment for purposes of the ex post facto clause.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although Manuel cites provisions from certain documents relating to the legislative history of Proposition 21, none of those provisions support a reasonable inference that the legislative intent of the specific amendments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>to section 781 was punitive.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Proposition 21\u2019s amendments to section 781 are only part, and in our estimation only a <em>minor </em>part, of the overall provisions of that multifaceted initiative. Proposition 21 \u2019s primary purpose is reflected in its title, Gang Violence and Juvenile Crime Prevention Act of 1998. <em>(Manduley v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 537, 574 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 168, 41 P.3d 3], citing Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) text of Prop. 21, \u00a7 1, p. 119.) Although section 2 of Proposition 21 refers to the desirability of eliminating confidentiality in some juvenile proceedings to hold juvenile offenders more accountable for their actions, it also refers to many other goals that are unrelated to section 781. <em>(Manduley, supra, </em>at p. 574.) \u201cSections 3 through 13 of the initiative are related to criminal gang activity.\u201d <em>(Ibid.). </em>In particular, \u201c[sjection 11 amends Penal Code section 190.2 to add gang-related murder as a special circumstance permitting the imposition of the death penalty or a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cSections 14 through 17 of Proposition 21 amend portions of the Three Strikes law.\u201d <em>(Ibid) </em>Sections 15 and 17 modify the lists of violent and serious offenses for which enhanced sentences are required. <em>(Ibid.) Manduley </em>describes Proposition 21\u2019s changes to the juvenile justice system as follows: \u201cIn addition to the revisions related to charging minors in criminal court and restricting juvenile court dispositions for certain minors, changes made by these sections [i.e., sections 18 through 34] include limitations on the confidentiality of juvenile criminal records, restrictions on the prehearing release of minors accused of specified offenses, and revisions to various procedures and evidentiary rules in juvenile wardship proceedings.\u201d <em>(Manduley, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 575.) <em>Manduley\u2019s </em>discussion of the wide-ranging provisions of Proposition 21 shows that the initiative\u2019s amendments to section 781 were only a minor part of its overall provisions and objectives. <em>(Manduley, </em>at pp. 574-579.) Except for general references to those amendments, <em>Manduley </em>does not specifically discuss either their substantive provisions or their legislative purpose. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 57.4-575.) In contrast, it specifically discusses the more substantive provisions regarding gang-related crime and the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law, many of which are clearly punitive. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 574-581.) Therefore, although punishment for juvenile crime may be a major purpose of Proposition 21, there is nothing in its language or legislative history that shows punishment was the legislative purpose of its amendments to section 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Manuel also does not show that the purpose, nature or effect of the amendments to section 781 is so punitive that they must be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>punishment for purposes of the ex post facto clause. The amendments do <em>not </em>impose an <em>affirmative </em>disability or restraint. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ansell, supra, 25 </em>Cal.4th at p. 885.) Rather, they merely preclude existing juvenile records from being sealed and possibly destroyed. Any indirect disability from the inability to have juvenile records sealed and possibly destroyed is a negative, not affirmative, disability. Furthermore, inability to petition for sealing of juvenile records has <em>not </em>been \u201chistorically regarded as punishment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Punishment historically consists of imprisonment and fines, not an inability to have sealed records of a past offense for which such punishment has already been imposed and completed. Also, contrary to Manuel\u2019s assertion, the inability to petition for sealing of juvenile records does <em>not </em>\u201cpromote^ the traditional aims of punishment (i.e., retribution and deterrence) through means commonly used in criminal statutes (e.g., imposing culpability for proscribed acts and requiring scienter).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 885-886.) Proposition 21\u2019s amendments to section 781 do not impose any culpability on juveniles for their past juvenile offenses (much less for a current act of filing a petition to have a juvenile record sealed). Those amendments do not appear to have any goal of retribution or deterrence. It is unlikely that a juvenile, when committing a section 707, subdivision (b) offense (e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (b), forcible lewd act on a child under age 14), would be deterred by knowledge that if he or she is found to have committed such offense and is subjected to a juvenile court wardship that he or she may not be able to have related juvenile records sealed thereafter. Also, the inability to have sealed juvenile records of a past offense cannot reasonably be viewed as retribution for that past offense. Furthermore, the amendments to section 781 appear to \u201cbear[] a rational connection to legitimate nonpenal aims.\u201d <em>(Ansell, </em>at p. 886.) The inability of juveniles to have their records of certain juvenile offenses sealed and possibly destroyed appears to serve regulatory purposes. Although such juvenile records generally may not be disclosed to the public as Manuel notes (see \u00a7 827 et seq.), those records nevertheless may provide useful information to persons authorized to receive disclosure (e.g., law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and court personnel) in future investigations and prosecutions regarding a juvenile. Also, Proposition 21\u2019s amendments to section 781 eliminate the ability of certain offenders to avoid Penal Code section 290\u2019s sex offender registration requirements by having juvenile records of past offenses sealed, which former section 781, subdivision (a) expressly allowed. By precluding the sealing of records of section 707, subdivision (b) offenses by persons who are 14 years of age or older, those amendments ensure that those persons who commit certain sex offenses (e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (b)) will remain subject to the registration provisions of Penal Code section 290 and will preclude destruction of that registration information in the future. In this manner, as in <em>Castellanos </em>and <em>Bailey, </em>the amendments further the regulatory purpose of public safety and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>are not punitive. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castellanos, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp. 791-799; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at pp. 243-244.) Finally, Proposition 21\u2019s amendments to section 781 are not excessive in relation to those legitimate nonpenal aims. <em>(Ansell, supra, </em>at p. 886.) Those amendments appear to be appropriate for accomplishment of their legitimate nonpenal goals. Considering all of the factors set forth in <em>Ansell, </em>we conclude amended section 781 is not so punitive in purpose, nature or effect to raise ex post facto concerns. <em>(Ansell, </em>at p. 885.)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">We conclude the reasoning in <em>People </em>v. <em>Acuna, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th 1056 provides substantial support for our conclusion that amended section 781 does not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Expungement of adult offenders\u2019 criminal records under Penal Code section 1203.4 is similar to sealing of juvenile offenders\u2019 records under section 781 in both nature and effect. <em>Acuna </em>concluded \u201ca defendant who has been denied expungement of his conviction by an amendment to the Penal Code enacted after he pled guilty has not been subjected to an ex post facto law.\u201d <em>(Acuna, </em>at p. 1058, in. omitted.) <em>Acuna </em>stated: \u201cThere is no doubt that being unable to expunge [the defendant\u2019s] conviction places some burden on him. He cannot truthfully represent to friends, acquaintances and private sector employers that he has no conviction. But such a representation from a person convicted of molesting a child might give the public a false sense of security. It is this false sense of security the statute seeks to eliminate.\u201d <em>(Acuna, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 1060.) Like the defendant in <em>Acuna, </em>Manuel will be precluded from truthfully representing to friends, acquaintances and private sector employers that he has no juvenile offenses under section 707, subdivision (b). To that extent, along with the Penal Code section 290 registration provisions noted <em>ante, </em>amended section 781 furthers public safety and is not punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Furthermore, <em>In re S. A., supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d 241 does not require or support a different result in this case. That case is inapposite to this case and did not involve the issue of ex post facto laws. Manuel cites it merely for the principle that section 781 shows a legislative intent to protect minors from future prejudice resulting from their juvenile records. We presume that <em>general </em>legislative intent, as discerned by <em>In re S. A. </em>in 1970, continues to apply regarding section 781\u2019s provisions allowing persons to petition for sealing of their juvenile records. However, the more recent and specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>intent underlying Proposition 21\u2019s amendments to section 781 prevail over that general intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">We conclude Proposition 21\u2019s amendments to section 781 do not violate the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">\n<em>Application of Amended Section 781 Does Not Violate the Equal Protection Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">The People also contend the trial court erred by concluding amended section 781 violates the equal protection clauses of the United States and California Constitutions. (U.S. Const., 14th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">In granting Manuel\u2019s section 781 petition, the trial court also concluded that amended section 781 violated the equal protection clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-11\">\u201c[T]he amendments [to] . . . section 781 . . . prohibit^ ever sealing all of those many crimes listed in [section] 707[, subdivision] (b), over 30 or 35 of them .... It\u2019s such a sweeping prohibition and indeed prohibits those convictions only for juveniles and not for adults.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-12\">\u201cIndeed, the <em>Acuna </em>case points out that many of the crimes that are listed in [section] 707 [, subdivision] (b) are expimgable for adults under Penal Code [section] 1203.4, but are not expungable or sealable for juveniles, which leads me to believe that [amended section 781] indeed violates the equal protection laws of the United States and of the California Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">\u201cIn order to establish a meritorious claim under the equal protection provisions of our state and federal Constitutions appellant must first show that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner. [Citation.] Equal protection applies to ensure that persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment; equal protection does not require identical treatment.\u201d <em>(People v. Green </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 921, 924 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 355].)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>The People assert, and Manuel does not refute, that he lacks, standing to assert an equal protection claim in the circumstances of this case.  \u201c \u2018One who seeks to raise a constitutional question must show that his rights are affected injuriously by the law which he attacks and that he is actually aggrieved by its operation.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Cortez </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1202, 1212 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 580], quoting <em>People v. Black </em>(1941) 45 Cal.App.2d 87, 96 [113 P.2d 746].)  In this case amended section 781 precludes sealing of Manuel\u2019s juvenile records because he committed a Penal Code section 288, subdivision (b) offense and was 14 years of age or older at the time of the offense. In that regard, Manuel is <em>not </em>treated differently than an adult who commits a Penal Code section 288, subdivision (b) offense and cannot have his conviction expunged under Penal Code section 1203.4. Therefore, Manuel lacks standing to raise an equal protection claim. <em>(People v. Garcia </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1, 11 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 114, 980 P.2d 829].) He cannot raise equal protection claims of other hypothetical juvenile offenders who may be treated more harshly than adult offenders. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Assuming arguendo Manuel has standing to raise an equal protection claim, we nevertheless conclude amended section 781 does not violate the constitutional equal protection clauses. <em>Acuna </em>rejected an equal protection claim in similar circumstances, stating: \u201cThe state may make distinctions between different groups of persons so long as the classifications created bear a rational relationship to a legitimate public purpose. [Citation.] Both the high rate of recidivism for child molesters and the particular interest society has in protecting its children justify the treatment of those convicted of violating [Penal Code] section 288 in a manner different from those who have been convicted of other heinous crimes including other kinds of sex offenses. The statutory ban on expungement of [the defendant\u2019s] conviction does not violate equal protection.\u201d <em>(People v. Acuna, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 1061.) Therefore, the fact that \u201cpersons convicted of other heinous crimes, such as murder, mayhem and rape, can still obtain the benefit of expungement\u201d did not result in a denial of equal protection for a defendant who cannot obtain expungement of a Penal Code section 288 conviction pursuant to Penal Code section 1203.4. <em>(Acuna, </em>at pp. 1060-1061.) We apply <em>Acuna\u2019s </em>reasoning to this case. Although adults convicted of certain offenses listed in section 707, subdivision (b) may be entitled to expungement under Penal Code section 1203.4, persons who commit those offenses as juveniles and were at least 14 years of age at the time may be denied sealing of their juvenile records under amended section 781 without violation of their constitutional right to equal protection of the law. Because of the differences between the juvenile and criminal justice systems, those adults are not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d with persons who cannot obtain sealing of their juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>records pursuant to amended section 781. <em>(People v.
