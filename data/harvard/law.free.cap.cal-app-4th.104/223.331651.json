When they divorced, Romelia was given sole custody. Edward was allowed monitored visitation; however, he visited only sporadically for a year or so, and then not at all. Thereafter, Romelia married Alan W. In this action, the trial court granted Romelia\u2019s petition to terminate Edward\u2019s parental rights, based on abandonment, so Alan could adopt Suzanna.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">Edward contends the trial court violated the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) because he, and hence Suzanna, were part Indian, yet proper notice was not given to their tribe. We agree. In the published portion of this opinion, we will hold that the ICWA\u2019s notice provisions applied, even if, under the \u201cexisting Indian family doctrine,\u201d its other provisions did not. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>remand, the trial court must require proper notice. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, however, we find no other prejudicial error. Accordingly, if, after proper notice has been given, the trial court determines that the ICWA does not otherwise apply, it must reinstate its order terminating Edward\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Failure to Give Notice Pursuant to the Indian Child Welfare Act</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Edward contends the trial court erred by proceeding in the absence of proper notice pursuant to the ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">A. <em>Additional Factual and Procedural Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">On April 12, 2000, Romelia filed a petition to free Suzanna from Edward\u2019s custody and control. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7800 et seq.) No ICWA issue was presented until June 29, 2001, when Edward\u2019s counsel stated to the court: \u201c. . . I just found out yesterday that my client is half Indian, half Cherokee Indian.\u201d She added: \u201c[According to the research we\u2019ve done, there should be a special Indian social worker appointed in the case.\u201d The trial court ordered Edward\u2019s counsel to file a written request for any action she wanted taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">On July 9, 2001, Edward filed an \u201cObjection to the [Ajdoption [o]f the [Mjinor [Bjased on [H]is Indian Ancestry.\u201d In it, he asserted that he was \u201c50% Indian as both of his [maternal] grandparents are full[-]blooded Indians . . . .\u201d He added that he was \u201cmaybe 50% Cherokee or Ya[qu]i Indian.\u201d He provided copies of his mother\u2019s and his mother\u2019s sister\u2019s birth certificates, which indicated that one or both of their parents (Edward\u2019s grandparents) were Indian. He asked the court to \u201callow sufficient time for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to investigate the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">On July 10, 2001, the department of children\u2019s services (the Department) advised the trial court that it was going to \u201csend the appropriate requests to the tribes.\u201d It added that the \u201ctribes in question\u201d were the \u201cPapago (four separate bands), Cherokee (three separate bands), and Yaqui (possibly one band).\u201d It requested a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">On July 13, 2001, the trial court stated: \u201c[S]hould the child fall under the provisions, the tribe could or could not choose to intervene. [|] [The Department is] recommending a continuance because they\u2019re going to contact the [tribes]. And they\u2019re going to request of the tribes to see what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>they\u2019re going to do. [f] So I think that we\u2019re going to have to put it over.\u201d Counsel for the W.\u2019s replied, \u201cI concur .... Continue it, let Social Services do their thing, and ... if the tribe wants to come here and assert their rights . . . , then the [cjourt can decide how to act at that point.\u201d Edward\u2019s counsel said, \u201cI completely concur.\u201d The trial court set a status conference for October 19, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">On October 18, 2001, the Department reported: \u201cWe are in the process of obtaining information on the Indian ancestry of the minor .... Our results as of this date are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\u201cCherokee tribe: Tahlequah, OK - Not on rol[l]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">\u201cCherokee tribe: North Carolina - Not on rol[l]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\u201cPapagos and Yaquis: No response.\u201d (Capitalization omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The court continued the matter to January 25, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">On January 25, 2002, Edward\u2019s counsel said: \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to the social worker and she had indicated she was going to be sending a request to the [cjourt for another extension because the Yaquis had not responded, neither have the Papago . . . .\u201d The court denied a further continuance. It ordered the matter trailed to January 28, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">On January 28, 2002, Edward\u2019s counsel stated: \u201c. . . I have an objection to this case even being ready for trial because we never got back information from the Indian tribes . . . .\u201d The trial court ordered her to brief the issue. It set the trial for January 30, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Edward filed a brief asserting that he was a Papago Indian. He did not clearly indicate what he believed the effect of this should be. He did argue that \u201cthe [fjederal law has exclusive jurisdiction over this matter . . . .\u201d He also argued that \u201csince the [sjtate law does not prescribe what constitutes a member of a tribe the federal government would have exclusive jurisdiction over the issue of Indian ancestry.\u201d The W.\u2019s responded with a brief claiming that, back on July 13, 2001, when it had granted a continuance, the trial court had \u201cdenied the jurisdictional objection and ruled that the tribes could participate at their election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">When trial began, on January 30, 2002, the court said to Edward\u2019s counsel: \u201cYou raised the issue but you haven\u2019t asked me for any relief. What\u2019s your request?\u201d Edward\u2019s counsel asked the court to \u201cdismiss this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>case based on the federal jurisdiction of the federal court over the matter . . . .\u201d Minor\u2019s counsel objected, \u201c[Q]nce they\u2019ve been put on notice, . . . it is up to the tribe ... if they want to assert that. If they don\u2019t, we proceed . . . .\u201d The trial court then ruled: \u201c[Tjhere\u2019s a fairly common, well-known procedure for invoking the jurisdiction of the Indian tribes and for obtaining a stay o[f] the proceedings so they can invoke their jurisdiction. You haven\u2019t done that. Your motion is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">B. <em>Analysis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">1. <em>Statutory Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u201cThe ICWA (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 et seq.) was enacted in 1978, out of an increasing concern in the mid-1970\u2019s over the consequences to Indian children, Indian families, and Indian tribes of child welfare practices that separated large numbers of Indian children from their families and tribes, and placed them in non-Indian homes through state adoption, foster care, and parental rights termination proceedings. [Citations.] ...</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\u201cThe stated purpose of the ICWA is to \u2018protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster care or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture, and by providing for assistance to Indian tribes in the operation of child and family service programs.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Santos Y. </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1274, 1299 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 692], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The ICWA defines a \u201cchild custody proceeding\u201d so as to include any proceeding for either \u201c\u2018termination of parental rights[,]\u2019 which shall mean any action resulting in the termination of the parent-child relationship\u201d or \u201c \u2018adoptive placement^]\u2019 which shall mean the permanent placement of an Indian child for adoption, including any action resulting in a final decree of adoption.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(l)(ii), (iv).) Thus, a proceeding to terminate parental rights under Family Code section 7800 et seq. is a \u201cchild custody proceeding\u201d within the meaning of the ICWA. <em>(In re Crystal K. </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 655, 660-666 [276 Cal.Rptr. 619].) The ICWA defines \u201cIndian child\u201d as \u201cany unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe . . . .\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">The ICWA also \u201clays out a dual jurisdictional scheme. Section 1911(a) establishes exclusive jurisdiction in the tribal courts for proceedings concerning an Indian child \u2018who resides or is domiciled within the reservation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>such tribe []\u2019 .... Section 1911(b), on the other hand, creates concurrent but presumptively tribal jurisdiction in the case of children not domiciled on the reservation: on petition of either parent or the tribe, state-court proceedings for . . . termination of parental rights are to be transferred to the tribal court, except in cases of \u2018good cause,\u2019 objection by either parent, or declination of jurisdiction by the tribal court.\u201d <em>(Mississippi Choctaw Indian Band v. </em>Holyfield(1989) 490 U.S. 30, 36 [109 S.Ct. 1597, 1601-1602, 104 L.Ed.2d 29], fn. omitted.) Moreover, if a proceeding for termination of parental rights is pending in state court, \u201cthe Indian child\u2019s tribe shall have a right to intervene at any point in the proceeding.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The ICWA provision most critical in this case\u2014the notice provision\u2014 states: \u201cIn any involuntary proceeding in a State court, where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the party seeking the . . . termination of parental rights to[] an Indian child shall notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child\u2019s tribe, by registered mail with return receipt requested, of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention. If the identity or location of. . . the tribe cannot be determined, such notice shall be given to the Secretary [of the Interior] in like manner, who shall have fifteen days after receipt to provide the requisite notice to . . . the tribe. No . . . termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by . . . the tribe or the Secretary: <em>Provided, </em>[t]hat... the tribe shall, upon request, be granted up to twenty additional days to prepare for such proceeding.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a); see also 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(11).) If parental rights are terminated without such notice, then either the child, the parent from whose custody the child was removed, or the tribe can petition to invalidate the termination. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">When the ICWA applies, an indigent parent has the right to appointed counsel. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(b).) Moreover, \u201c[n]o termination of parental rights may be ordered ... in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent... is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">2. <em>Analysis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">We begin by correcting several of the parties\u2019 mistaken notions regarding the ICWA. The ICWA does not give either the federal courts or the tribal courts \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d in this kind of case. It may require that such a state court proceeding be transferred to a tribal court, but not that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>it be dismissed. It does not require a trial court to continue a case indefinitely while awaiting a response from a tribe. And it never requires a \u201cspecial Indian social worker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The W.\u2019s argue notice was not required because there was insufficient evidence that Suzanna was an \u201cIndian child\u201d within the meaning of the ICWA. An \u201cIndian child\u201d is defined as \u201ceither (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) . . . eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and . . . the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe . . . .\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(4).) Notice, however, is required whenever \u201cthe court knows <em>or has reason to know </em>that an Indian child is involved . . . .\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u201cThe determination of whether a minor is, or is not, an Indian child is made exclusively by the tribe. [Citation.] \u2018[0]ne of the primary purposes of giving notice to the tribe is to enable the tribe to determine whether the child involved in the proceedings is an Indian child. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Because the question of membership rests with each Indian tribe, when the juvenile court knows or has reason to believe the child may be an Indian child, notice must be given to the particular tribe in question or the Secretary [of the Interior].\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, the Indian status of a child need not be certain or conclusive in order to trigger the Act\u2019s notice requirements. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Jonathan D. </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 105, 110 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 628], quoting <em>In re Desiree F. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 460, 470-471 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 688].)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Here, the evidence did not show that Suzanna was, in fact, an Indian child; i.e., it did not show that she was a member of, or eligible for membership in, an Indian tribe or that Edward was a member of an Indian tribe. However, it did show that Edward\u2019s maternal grandparents were Indian. Such evidence of Indian ancestry is sufficient \u201creason to know\u201d a child is an Indian child so as to trigger the notice requirement. <em>(In re Samuel P. </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1259, 1266-1267 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 820]; <em>In re Jonathan D., supra, 92 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 111; <em>In re Desiree F., supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at pp. 470-471.)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The trial court erred by finding that Edward had somehow been dilatory. The W.\u2019s do not even argue otherwise.  \u201c\u2018Notice is mandatory, regardless of how late in the proceedings a child\u2019s possible Indian heritage is uncovered. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Jonathan D., supra, 92 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 111, quoting <em>In re Kahlen W. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1414, 1424 [285 Cal.Rptr. 507].) \u201cThe notice requirements serve the interests of the Indian tribes \u2018irrespective of the position of the parents\u2019 and cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>waived by the parent. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Samuel P., supra, 99 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1267, quoting <em>In re Kahlen W., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1421.) Thus, \u201cwhere the notice requirements of the Act were violated and the parents did not raise that claim in a timely fashion, the waiver doctrine cannot be invoked to bar consideration of the notice error on appeal.\u201d <em>(In re Marinna J. </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 731, 739 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 267].)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The W.\u2019s do argue that the Department gave adequate notice. Technically, it was not the Department\u2019s job to give notice; the W.\u2019s, as \u201cthe parties] seeking the . . . termination of parental rights to[] an Indian child,\u201d should have given notice. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a).) Still, if the Department gave adequate notice, presumably this error would be harmless. It is far from clear, however, that the Department contacted the appropriate tribe(s). Given the uncertainty as to the tribe with which Edward\u2019s grandparents were affiliated, notice should have been given to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (the BIA), on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a); 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.11(c)(12) (2002); <em>In re Edward H. </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 1, 4-6 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 242].)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Moreover, the trial court was not provided with copies of the notices the Department sent or the return receipts (if any) it received. Thus, there is insufficient evidence that two of the tribes\u2014the tribes that failed to respond \u2014received actual notice. <em>(In re Samuel P., supra, 99 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1266.) There is likewise insufficient evidence that the Department properly notified the tribes, not only of the proceeding, but also of their right to intervene. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[S]peaking with various members of the tribe in an attempt to determine the minor\u2019s status does not satisfy the notice requirement. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Desiree F., supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at p. 475.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Although two tribes did respond, their actual responses are also not in the record. The Department summarized the responses as, \u201cNot on rol[l].\u201d It is not clear whether this referred to Suzanna, Edward, or Edward\u2019s grandparents.  In any event, \u201c[ejnrollment is not required in order to be considered a member of a tribe; many tribes do not have written rolls. [Citation.] While enrollment can be one means of establishing membership, it is not the only means, nor is it determinative. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Desiree F., supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at pp. 470-471.)  Moreover, the ultimate question was whether Suzanna was either a member or <em>eligible </em>for membership in a tribe. Thus, we cannot say that giving proper notice would have been fruitless.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Finally, the W.\u2019s argue that notice was not required because Suzanna was not being removed from an existing Indian family; thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>underlying purposes of the ICWA were not implicated. They did not raise this contention below. \u201cThe issue is properly before this court, however, because the facts are undisputed and the issue merely raises a new question of law. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(California Teachers Assn. v. Governing Bd. of Rialto Unified School Dist. </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 627, 642, fn. 7 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 671, 927 P.2d 1175].)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Under the so-called existing Indian family doctrine, the ICWA is not applied \u201cwhere its purpose, [preventing] the improper removal of Indian children from their Indian families, would not be served.\u201d <em>(In re Santos Y., supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 1304.) This doctrine had its genesisih <em>Matter of Adoption of Baby Boy L. </em>(1982) 231 Kan. 199 [643 P.2d 168], which involved the child of an Indian father and a non-Indian mother. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 201 [643 P.2d at p. 172].) As in this case, a proceeding was brought to terminate the father\u2019s parental rights so the child could be adopted. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 201-202 [643 P.2d at pp. 172-173].) Notice was given to the father\u2019s tribe. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 202 [643 P.2d at p. 173].) The trial court, however, denied the tribe\u2019s petition to intervene and refused to transfer the case to the tribal court; it ruled that the ICWA did not apply <em>(Baby Boy L., supra, </em>at p. 203 [643 P.2d at pp. 173-174]), in part because \u201cthe child has never been a part of any Indian family relationship.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 205 [643 P.2d at p. 174].) It then proceeded to terminate the father\u2019s parental rights. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 203 [643 P.2d at pp. 173-174].)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The appellate court agreed that the ICWA did not apply. It based its opinion on legislative intent: \u201cA careful study of the legislative history behind the Act and the Act itself discloses that the overriding concern of Congress and the proponents of the Act was the maintenance of the family and tribal relationships existing in Indian homes and to set minimum standards for the removal of Indian children from their existing Indian environment. It was not to dictate that an illegitimate infant who has never been a member of an Indian home or culture, and probably never would be, should be removed from its primary cultural heritage and placed, in an Indian environment over the express objections of its non-Indian mother.\u201d <em>(Matter of Adoption of Baby Boy L., supra, </em>231 Kan. at pp. 205-206 [643 P.2d at p. 175].)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Some California courts which have accepted the existing Indian family doctrine derive it, as <em>Baby Boy L. </em>did, from legislative intent. <em>(Crystal R. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 703, 718-723 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 414] [Sixth Dist.]; <em>In re Wanomi P. </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 156, 168 [264 Cal.Rptr. 623] [Second Dist., Div. One], cert. den. <em>sub nom. Mic Mac Nation v. Giesler </em>(1990) 498 U.S. 816 [111 S.Ct. 57, 112 L.Ed.2d 33].) Others have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>rejected the doctrine as an unwarranted judicial gloss on the ICWA. <em>(In re Alicia S. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 79, 83-92 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 121] [Fifth Dist.]; <em>In re Junious M. </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 786, 796 [193 Cal.Rptr. 40] [First Dist., Div.

Three].)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Recent California decisions, however, have reformulated the existing Indian family doctrine as a federal constitutional limitation on the ICWA. <em>(In re Santos Y., supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1306-1323 [Second Dist., Div. Two]; <em>In re Bridget R. </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1483, 1501-1512 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 507] [Second Dist., Div. Three], cert. den. <em>sub nom. Cindy R. </em>v. <em>James R. </em>(1997) 519 U.S. 1060 [117 S.Ct. 693,136 L.Ed.2d 616]; see also <em>In re Alexandria Y. </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1483, 1492-1493 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 679] [Fourth Dist., Div. Three].) They reason that, if the ICWA applied to a child who does not have an existing Indian family, it would be unconstitutional in three different respects. First, it would violate substantive due process, because it would deprive the child of the fundamental right to a stable and existing relationship with his or her de facto family without serving the governmental purposes behind the ICWA. <em>(In re Santos Y, supra, </em>at pp. 1306-1307, 1314-1317; <em>In re Bridget R., supra, </em>at pp. 1502-1508.) Second, it would violate equal protection, because it would treat Indian children differently based solely on race, rather than on the child\u2019s social, cultural, or political affiliation with a tribe. <em>(In re Santos Y., supra, </em>at pp. 1307-1308, 1317-1322; <em>In re Bridget R., supra, </em>at pp. 1508-1510.) Third, it would violate the Tenth Amendment, because jurisdiction over family relationships is traditionally reserved to the states, and because there is no substantial nexus between the Congress\u2019s power under the Indian commerce clause, on the one hand, and custody proceedings involving children with no significant relationship to Indian culture, on the other. <em>(In re Santos Y., supra, </em>at pp. 1308-1309, 1322-1323; <em>In re Bridget R., supra, </em>at pp. 1510-1511.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">On tfie facts before us, however, we need not decide whether to accept the existing Indian family doctrine\u2014much less whether to accept it as a matter of legislative intent or constitutional imperative. We may assume, without deciding, that it is established law on one rationale or the other. We may further assume, without deciding, that the record before us conclusively establishes that Suzanna has no existing Indian family. Even if so, the trial court was required to give notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">This is true under the legislative intent version of the existing Indian family doctrine. A court in Kansas, where the existing Indian family doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>originated, has so held. In <em>In the Interest of H.D. </em>(1986) 11 Kan.App.2d 531 [729 P.2d 1234], the mother was part Cherokee. The trial court terminated parental rights without giving notice to her tribe. However, it was unclear whether the ICWA applied, because she did not become a member of the tribe until six weeks after the termination. <em>(In the Interest of H.D., supra, </em>at p. 532 [729 P.2d at p. 1236].)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The appellate court held: \u201cAlthough we do not decide the question of the applicability of the Act, we agree that the court\u2019s failure to direct that proper notice be served upon the tribe or Secretary of the Interior renders the termination order invalid.\u201d <em>(In the Interest of H.D., supra, </em>11 Kan.App.2d at p. 532 [729 P.2d at p. 1236].) It found that there were \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe that the children were \u201cIndian children].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 536 [729 P.2d at p. 1239].) It distinguished <em>Baby Boy L. </em>as follows: \u201cUnlike the case of <em>In re Adoption of Baby Boy L. . </em>. . , we are not concerned with a determination of whether the Act applies. In this decision, we are concerned with the tribe\u2019s right to notification of involuntary proceedings where the court has reasonable grounds to believe a child subject to the proceeding is or may be an Indian child. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In the Interest of H.D., supra, </em>at p. 534 [729 P.2d at p. 1237].) The court noted that in <em>Baby Boy L. </em>notice had been given to the tribe; \u201c[i]n this case, however, the Cherokee Tribe was never notified of the pendency of state court proceedings. Consequently, the tribe was denied the opportunity to be heard on the issue of whether the Act applied to the state court proceedings.\u201d <em>(In the Interest of H.D., supra, </em>at p. 534 [729 P.2d at p. 1237].)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The same result follows under the federal constitutional version of the existing Indian family doctrine. The cases which have held the application of the ICWA to be unconstitutional did not involve the notice provisions of the ICWA. Rather, they involved provisions of the ICWA which deprived the child directly and immediately of his or her fundamental right to an established family relationship. For example, in <em>In re Santos Y., supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th 1274, a juvenile dependency proceeding, a boy had been placed with prospective adoptive parents when he was three months old. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1279, 1283.) Notice was given to his mother\u2019s tribe <em>(id. </em>at pp. 1280, 1282), and eventually the tribe intervened. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1288-1289.) When the boy was two and a half years old, the trial court, applying the placement preference of the ICWA (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)), ordered the boy removed from his prospective adoptive parents and placed with a member of the tribe. <em>(Santos Y, supra, </em>at pp. 1281, 1298.) The appellate court held this <em>\u201capplication </em>of the ICWA . . . unconstitutional. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1282, italics added; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 1312.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Similarly, in <em>In re Bridget R., supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th 1483, the biological parents had voluntarily relinquished their parental rights, and their twin daughters had been placed with a prospective adoptive family since birth. Two years later, the trial court ruled that the voluntary relinquishment did not comply with the voluntary termination standards of the ICWA (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913(a)); it therefore ordered the girls removed from their adoptive family and placed with their biological father. <em>(Bridget R., supra, </em>at pp. 1490-1491, 1493-1495.) Thus, once again, this particular application of the ICWA interfered directly with the girls\u2019 fundamental right to an established family relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Applying the notice requirements of the ICWA, even to a child who has no existing Indian family, does no such thing. It does not take the child out of his or her existing placement. All it does is prevent the termination of parental rights for perhaps 25 days. The tribe may respond that the child is not an Indian child. Alternatively, the tribe may not respond at all; in that case, it will be barred from subsequently invalidating the termination of parental rights based on lack of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Admittedly, if the tribe responds that the child <em>is </em>an Indian child, the trial court may have to decide whether to apply other provisions of the ICWA, such as the placement preference, which <em>would </em>threaten the child\u2019s existing family relationship. That, however, would be the perfect time to invoke the existing Indian family doctrine. Here, for example, the record before us strongly suggests that Suzanna has no existing Indian family. She was bom in 1990. She has lived with her non-Indian mother, Romelia, all her life, and with Romelia\u2019s non-Indian husband, Alan, since 1993. The W.\u2019s have four other non-Indian children, Suzanna\u2019s half siblings, to whom she is bonded. The trial court found that Edward had \u201chad only sporadic and infrequent contacts with Suzanna\u201d; he has not challenged this finding. His last visit with her was in 1992. Moreover, even though Edward is genetically half Indian, he is so lacking in any Indian cultural affiliation that he is not even sure what tribe he comes from. Thus, if a tribe does claim Suzanna is an Indian child, as long as the trial court follows the \u201cexisting Indian family doctrine,\u201d it seems most likely that her placement will not change.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Giving notice, however, at least permits the tribe to be heard on the question of whether the child does have an existing Indian family. The tribe\u2019s interests are not necessarily congruent with the parents\u2019. Thus, the tribe may have an interest in proving that the child has an existing Indian family, even when the parents do not. Under those circumstances, compliance with the notice provisions of the ICWA, even though the child does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>appear </em>to have an existing Indian family, does promote the federal policies underlying the ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Because the notice provisions of the ICWA promote a substantial governmental interest without impinging upon a child\u2019s existing family relationships, they do not violate due process. Moreover, because the notice provisions assist in determining whether the child has a social, cultural, or political affiliation with a tribe, they do not violate equal protection. Finally, there is a substantial nexus between the notice provisions and Congress\u2019s constitutional power over Indian affairs. Accordingly, they do not violate the Tenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We conclude that the trial court erred by terminating Edward\u2019s parental rights, since there had not been substantial compliance with the notice requirements of the ICWA. But this does not mean the trial court must go back to square one. It simply means the trial court must see to it that proper notice is given. If, after giving proper notice, it finds insufficient evidence that Suzanna is, in fact, an Indian child, it must reinstate its order terminating Edward\u2019s parental rights. (See <em>In re IEM </em>(1999) 233 Mich.App. 438, 449-450 [592 N.W.2d 751, 757-758], and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">II-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">The order terminating Edward\u2019s parental rights is reversed. On remand, the trial court must require the W.\u2019s to give notice to the BIA, in accordance with the ICWA and its implementing regulations. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a); 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.11 (2002).) If there is no timely response, or if the response raises no substantial question as to whether Suzanna is an Indian child, the trial court must reinstate its original order. If, however, the response does raise a substantial question as to whether Suzanna is an Indian child, the trial court must hold further proceedings consistent with the ICWA. Even then, if it determines, in the course of such proceedings, that the ICWA does not otherwise apply, it must reinstate its original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Costs on appeal are not awardable in this proceeding.
