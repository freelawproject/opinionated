The parties were codefendants in an earlier lawsuit involving a third party seriously injured while driving a vehicle manufactured by Ford and sold and repaired by the Dealer. The parties entered into separate settlements of that lawsuit, and then commenced this action for indemnity. The trial court ruled that; (1) under the express terms of the agreement between the parties, Ford\u2019s obligation to defend the Dealer was broader than its obligation to indemnify; (2) even if the terms of the agreement could not be so construed, a broad duty to defend whenever the underlying lawsuit was potentially covered by the indemnification provision should be implied; (3) an indemnitee who settles a lawsuit after the indemnitor breaches its duty to defend and obtains a good faith determination under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, is entitled, without further proof, to recover its defense costs and the settlement amount from the indemnitor; (4) the Dealer could recover its defense costs and the settlement amount from Ford whether it paid these sums personally or they were paid by its liability insurer; and (5) a decision could be made concerning good faith settlement based on the allegations of the complaint alone, without review of the facts relating to the parties\u2019 respective liabilities known by the parties at the time of the settlement. The court was incorrect in these rulings, and we, therefore, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\n<em>Indemnity Clause of Parties \u2019 Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Ford and the Dealer entered into an agreement governing their relationship which included a separate indemnity provision. Among other things, Ford agreed to \u201cdefend, indemnify, hold harmless and protect the Dealer from any losses, damages or expense, including costs and attorney\u2019s fees, resulting from or related to lawsuits, complaints or claims commenced against the Dealer by third parties concerning: ffl] (1) . . . bodily injury or property damage arising out of an occurrence caused solely by a \u2018production defect\u2019 in that product (i.e., due to defective materials or workmanship utilized or performed at the factory), except for any \u2018production defect\u2019 in tires and diesel engines made by others, provided, however, that the \u2018production defect\u2019 could not have been discovered by the Dealer in the reasonable pre-delivery inspection of the VEHICLE, FOREIGN VEHICLE, TRUCK or HEAVY DUTY TRUCK (as applicable) as recommended by the Company, [f] (2) . . . bodily injury or property damage arising out of an occurrence caused solely by a defect in the design of that product. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Ford further agreed that \u201c[i]n the event that any legal action arising out of any of these causes is brought against the Dealer, [Ford] shall undertake, at its sole expense, to defend said action on behalf of the Dealer when requested to do so by the Dealer, provided that the Dealer promptly notifies [Ford] in writing of the commencement of the action against the Dealer and cooperates fully in the defense of the action in such manner and to such extent as [Ford] may reasonably require .... Should [Ford] refuse to undertake the defense on behalf of the Dealer, or fail to undertake an adequate defense, the Dealer may conduct its own defense and [Ford] shall be liable for the cost of such defense, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, together with any verdict, judgment or settlement paid by the Dealer (provided, however, that the Dealer shall notify [Ford] within a reasonable period of any such settlement).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">\n<em>Parker Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">In May 1998, David Parker filed an action against Ford and the Dealer arising from an incident involving a 1989 Ford F250 truck purchased from the Dealer. The complaint alleged that Parker had been driving the truck on May 20, 1997, when it erupted into flames, seriously burning him. The complaint contained four causes of action. The first cause of action for strict product liability alleged that Ford and the Dealer \u201cdesigned, manufactured, researched, tested, assembled, installed, marketed, advertised, distributed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>and sold\u201d the truck, and that the truck was \u201cdefective in design, manufacture, assembly, materials selection, research and installation, based on the location and lack of integrity of the fuel system and all of its component parts, including but not limited to the mid-ship fuel tank, fuel tank structure and fuel lines.\u201d In the second cause of action for negligence, the complaint alleged that Ford and the Dealer breached a duty of care to \u201cmanufacture, assemble, design, test, research, market, advertise and distribute a vehicle free of defects.\u201d In the third cause of action, the complaint alleged that Ford and the Dealer breached a duty to warn \u201cof the inherent danger embodied in said product, based on the lack of integrity of the fuel system and all of its component parts, including but not limited to the mid-ship fuel tank, fuel tank structure and fuel lines.\u201d The fourth cause of action for breach of warranty alleged that Ford and the Dealer expressly and impliedly warranted that their product was free from material defect, including defects in design, assembly, and manufacture.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">In July 1999, the Dealer\u2019s attorneys sent a letter to Ford tendering the defense of the <em>Parker </em>matter. The letter stated: \u201c[T]he plaintiff has sued the dealer ... on passive negligence, \u2018stream of commerce\u2019 theories, as well as theories of direct or active negligence in the maintenance of the vehicle. We now know that the plaintiff has no evidence of any such active or direct negligence based on improper maintenance or anything else.\u201d The letter discussed the evidence which had come to light through discovery and otherwise. It noted that the Dealer had last worked on the truck\u2019s fuel pump 40 months and 20,000 miles previously. It discussed the possibility that a pin-sized hole located in the fuel filter, caused by either a defective product or corrosion, had led to a fuel leak that started the fire in the engine compartment. The plaintiff\u2019s experts had apparently theorized that a defect in the fuel tank led to an explosion or fireball in the passenger compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Ford\u2019s response denied any obligation to defend or indemnify the Dealer. The letter from Ford\u2019s counsel stated: \u201c[0]ur experts . . . identify the source of the fire as being in the area of the frame rail where [the Dealer\u2019s] mechanics did their work in the replacement of the high pressure fuel pump. This and other work which [the Dealer] performed, (including replacement of the frame rail mounted fuel filter) are all in the area where the fire apparently developed. Also, the catalytic converter and exhaust system had holes which should have been repaired by the dealership. Heat and flames from the exhaust could have set the spare tire on fire\u2014another possible source of the fire initially seen by following motorists. Circumstantially, this indicates that something which the dealer did or failed to do later occasioned the fire.\u201d The letter demanded that the Dealer commit its insurance policy limits to settle the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\n<em>Complaint and Cross-complaint Herein</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The parties settled with Parker in 1999. Ford paid $3.5 million. The Dealer paid $175,000. In November 1999, the Dealer brought a complaint against Ford for declaratory relief and breach of express indemnity contract. Ford cross-claimed for equitable indemnification, contribution, and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\n<em>First Motion for Summary Adjudication</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The Dealer moved for summary judgment on the declaratory relief cause of action, seeking resolution of the issue of whether Ford had a duty to defend it in the <em>Parker </em>action. The Dealer\u2019s summary adjudication motion was based on five undisputed facts: (1) \u201c[Ford] and [the Dealer] entered into a written agreement which contained] a provision for [the Dealer\u2019s] defense and indemnity by [Ford]\u201d; (2) \u201cThe Dealer Agreement requires [the Dealer] to tender its defense to [Ford] when sued for manufacturing or design defects\u201d; (3) \u201c[The Dealer] was sued for manufacturing and design defects\u201d; (4) \u201c[The Dealer] tendered its defense to [Ford]\u201d;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (5) \u201c[Ford] repeatedly refused to accept the tender of defense by [the Dealer].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The Dealer argued that the issue presented did not require resolution of the cause of the accident. Citing a number of cases involving insurance companies and their insureds, the Dealer contended that \u201c \u2018[t]he existence of a duty to defend turns not upon the ultimate adjudication of coverage under its policy of insurance, but upon those facts known by the insurer at the inception of a third party lawsuit. [Citation.] Hence, the duty \u2018may exist even where coverage is in doubt and ultimately does not develop.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>Montrose Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 287, 295 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153].)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">In its opposition, rather than disputing the facts put forth by the Dealer, Ford sought to establish additional facts, including that the <em>Parker </em>action did not arise solely out of a production defect or design defect; that the Dealer negligently serviced the vehicle; and that Ford was entitled to indemnification from the Dealer. Ford supported the allegations with testimony from experts that indicated there was no design defect in the vehicle, and that the source of the fire was the fuel pump or fuel filter which had been serviced by the Dealer or the muffler and exhaust system which had holes and leaks from rust and should have been replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">The court granted the motion for summary adjudication, finding that Ford had a duty to defend the Dealer in the <em>Parker </em>action. The court essentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>interpreted the parties\u2019 agreement to require Ford to provide a defense whenever \u201cat least one\u201d of the contentions or claims the plaintiff is making is that the vehicle suffered from a design and/or manufacturing defect that was the sole cause of his or her injury. According to the court, \u201cA complaint which espouses such a theory as one of the grounds for potential recovery is clearly a complaint or claim which \u2018is concerning\u2019 something \u2018caused solely by a design or other manufacturing defect.\u2019 \u201d (Italics omitted.) It seemed to the court that \u201cthe three paragraphs of the indemnity agreement . . . read together are intended to tell the reader what the complaint or lawsuit must \u2018concern\u2019 before the duty to defend will attach, and that is the only reasonable reading of it\u2014reasonable because it is when the complaint or lawsuit is made or filed that everyone must look to see what the duty to defend encompasses and whether or not the duty to defend which is the crux of this part of the agreement will attach, and that can be judged only by looking to what the complaint or lawsuit \u2018concerns,\u2019 not something to be determined in hindsight by what will someday ultimately be proven or not proven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The court stressed that the contract before it was not \u201cpure indemnification\u201d but also included \u201ca right of defense . . . .\u201d The court expressed concern that a different interpretation \u201cwould mean that, Ford would never have a duty to defend\u2014as opposed to possibly later indemnifying for the Dealer\u2019s costs of suit\u201d since the court deemed it \u201chighly unlikely that Ford will ever at the outset of litigation or early on admit. . . that everything was its fault. . . .\u201d (Italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The court stated that although it did not have to reach this issue, \u201cif called upon to so decide, the court would further determine that this is an adhesion contract and that it should and must be construed against its framer, Ford, where any ambiguities are concerned\u201d and that \u201cindemnification case law is not the sole body of law to look to here\u201d because the contract was \u201clike an insurance contract\u201d in that it required the indemnitor (Ford) \u201cto both defend and to later indemnify.\u201d The court further indicated that, although not sought by the Dealer in its motion for summary adjudication on the declaration relief cause of action, liability for the full amount of fees, costs, and settlement monies paid \u201cwould appear to follow this determination . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\n<em>Second Motion for Summary Adjudication/Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Taking the court\u2019s advice, the Dealer filed a new motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication, on the contract cause of action. In the statement of undisputed facts, the Dealer sought to establish that it had incurred $142,789.31 in attorney\u2019s fees in defense of the <em>Parker </em>action and $175,000 in settlement costs. Ford disputed that the Dealer had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>incurred these costs, presenting evidence that the fees and the settlement had been paid by the Dealer\u2019s insurer. The court granted the motion for summary judgment, finding that the Dealer \u201cpresented substantial competent and undisputed evidence of [Ford\u2019s] wrongful refusal to defend [the Dealer] and competent and undisputed evidence of [the Dealer\u2019s] defense of the <em>Parker </em>action and the settlement incurred therein.\u201d The court ruled that even if the Dealer\u2019s insurer had paid for the defense and/or settlement, the result would be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\n<em>Third Motion for Summary Adjudication/Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The Dealer next filed an application for determination of good faith settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, subdivision (a)(2). The supporting declaration of Attorney Molly K. Zurflueh stated that Parker never alleged dealer negligence; that the Dealer \u201cmade an economic decision to buy its peace in the <em>[Parker] </em>matter [and] agreed to pay $175,000.00 to [Parker] in exchange for a release\u201d; and that \u201c[t]he aforementioned settlement was reached after discussions which were conducted at arms length.\u201d She further stated that \u201c[t]he settlement [arose] out of no action of fraud and/or tortious conduct or conspiracy between this moving applicant and settling parties or any other parties in this action or the Parker action that would have the effect of injuring any of the non-settling parties as a result thereof.\u201d The court initially denied the motion on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to make the finding requested, stating that the motion should have been made in the <em>Parker </em>action, but invited the Dealer to \u201cfile[] authorities to persuade the Court to the contrary . . . .\u201d The Dealer submitted further briefing, bringing the case of <em>Regal Recovery Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 693 [255 Cal.Rptr. 34], to the court\u2019s attention to support the position that the court had jurisdiction to decide the issue of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The Dealer then moved for summary judgment on Ford\u2019s cross-claim on the ground that the (expected) finding of good faith settlement precluded Ford from seeking equitable indemnity or contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The court granted the motion for a finding of good faith settlement, stating that \u201c[w]hile . . . $175,000 is not a large percentage of what Ford Motor settled for, ... the complaint also alleges little to suggest that any negligent service on [the Dealer\u2019s] part caused the accident or that [Parker] believed that to be the case. Even [Ford\u2019s] \u2018experts\u2019 cannot now state that an inspection of the car showed that this accident was the dealer\u2019s fault\u2014they offer nothing but \u2018maybes\u2019 and speculation in this regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The court also granted the motion for summary judgment on the cross-complaint on the ground that the good faith settlement barred any action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>equitable indemnity and the contract between Ford and the Dealer gave Ford no contractual right to obtain indemnification. Since this resolved all of the issues in the case, the court granted judgment for the Dealer in the amount of $351,342. Ford appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u201cIndemnity is a contract by which one engages to save another from a legal consequence of the conduct of one of the parties, or of some other person.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2772.) \u201cA collection of rules, developed primarily in insurance and construction cases, governs actions to enforce indemnity agreements. Paramount is the rule that \u2018[wjhere ... the parties have expressly contracted with respect to the duty to indemnify, the extent of that duty must be determined from the contract and not by reliance on the independent doctrine of equitable indemnity.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Peter Culley &amp; Associates </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1492 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 624], quoting <em>Rossmoor Sanitation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pylon, Inc. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 622, 628 [119 Cal.Rptr. 449, 532 P.2d 97].)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The burden of proof on an indemnitee (such as the Dealer) seeking to establish the liability of an indemnitor (such as Ford) under an express contract of indemnity where the indemnitee has settled the underlying claim is generally set forth as follows: \u201c[W]hen the indemnitee settles without trial, . . . the indemnitee must show the liability is covered by the contract, that liability existed, and the extent thereof.\u201d <em>(Peter Culley &amp; Associates v. Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at p. 1497; accord, <em>Collins Development Co. v. D. J. Plastering, Inc. </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 771, 776 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 83].)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The trial court did not require the Dealer to establish that the underlying liability was covered by the indemnity provision. Instead, the court concluded that the parties\u2019 agreement required Ford to defend the Dealer regardless of the Dealer\u2019s negligence whenever a claim for strict product liability was included in a complaint filed by a third party. It then awarded the Dealer the cost of the defense and settlement of the <em>Parker </em>action based on the belief that a failure to defend requires such amounts to be awarded automatically, as long as the indemnitee can establish that the settlement was in good faith. The court disregarded the evidence which showed that the Dealer\u2019s insurer paid the cost of the defense or the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">As we will explain, the trial court misconstrued the liability of an indemnitor, and treated Ford <em>worse </em>than an insurer, applying a presumption that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>does not make sense in this situation and requiring Ford to reimburse the Dealer for amounts that an insurer who breached a duty to defend would not have had to pay. Moreover, the court misinterpreted the parties\u2019 agreement. The indemnity provision required Ford to defend the Dealer only where the occurrence was caused <em>solely </em>by a production defect, and not whenever product liability was one of the allegations of the underlying complaint. We address the interpretation issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">A, B<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">In <em>Isaacson v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 775 [244 Cal.Rptr. 655, 750 P.2d 297], the Supreme Court acknowledged the rule that where an insurer breaches a contractual duty to defend and the insured settles the underlying lawsuit on its own behalf, a rebuttable evidentiary presumption arises: \u201cIn a later action against the insurer for reimbursement based on a breach of its contractual duty to defend the action, a reasonable settlement made by the insured to terminate the underlying claim against him may be used as presumptive evidence of <em>the insured\u2019s </em>liability on the underlying claim, and the amount of such liability. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 791-792, italics added.) According to the court, the presumption operates \u201cwhere the insurer has wrongfully refused to cover or defend a claim, leaving the insured to mount his own defense or suffer a default. In order to recover reimbursement from the insurer, the insured must demonstrate that the claim was covered under the policy in question, or that the insurer breached its duty to defend. Once a breach of contract is proved, the insured\u2019s act of settling the claim is said to raise the presumption that the third party\u2019s claim against him was legitimate, and that he was liable in the amount which he agreed to pay in settlement. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 793-794.) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">These rules derive from statements of law first set forth in <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Belt Casualty Co. </em>(1935) 3 Cal.App.2d 624, 631 [40 P.2d 311]. The insurer in <em>Lamb </em>had undisputedly committed breach of duty to defend. Complaints based on the alleged negligent operations of the insured\u2019s truck and the policy obligated the insurer to defend such actions. The court considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>two potential outcomes of the underlying litigations and their ramifications on the liability of the insurer for breaching its duty to defend. If the underlying actions proceeded to trial, the court held, the insurer \u201cis bound by the result of [the] litigation\u201d provided it \u201chad notice of the suit and an opportunity to control and manage it.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In other words, \u201c[t]he judgment recovered in such a case is the mode by which <em>the insured proves to the insurer that the intrinsic character of the accident was such that he was liable for the consequences of it, </em>and the judgment is conclusive evidence that the insured was liable, and to the extent of the amount of the judgment. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The rule was different if the underlying case settled: \u201c[W]here there is no trial and no judgment establishing the liability of the insured, but a settlement of the litigation has been made, <em>the question whether the liability of the insured was one which the contract of insurance covered is still open, as is also the question as to the fact of liability and the extent thereof, and these questions may be litigated and determined in the action brought by the insured to recover the amount so paid in settlement. </em>The settlement, or a judgment rendered upon a stipulation of such a settlement, becomes presumptive evidence only of the liability of <em>the insured </em>and the amount thereof, which presumption is subject to being overcome by proof on the part of the insurer. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Lamb v. Belt Casualty Co., supra, </em>3 Cal.App.2d at pp. 631-632, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">As should be obvious, applying a presumption that <em>the indemnitee </em>is liable to the third party makes sense only in the situation where the indemnitor had agreed to compensate the indemnitee for the consequences of <em>the indemnitee\u2019s </em>own negligence. Unless rebutted, the presumption establishes that the indemnitee was truly liable on the underlying claim and did not pay the injured party as a volunteer. Such a presumption is not particularly helpful here, where Ford is <em>not </em>liable to indemnify the Dealer if the accident was caused by the Dealer\u2019s active negligence. Put another way, assuming a broad duty to defend could be read into the agreement and assuming Ford breached the duty, the Dealer would be entitled to a presumption that it was liable on the <em>Parker </em>claim. That presumption would not resolve the crucial question here: Whether the Dealer was passively negligent as a link in the chain of commerce on a product liability suit, or actively negligent for improperly making repairs on the vehicle. In the former case, Ford would be liable under the indemnity agreement; in the latter, it would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">At least one recent appellate court has noted the error of attempting to apply the <em>Isaacson </em>presumption in a non-insurance context. In <em>Heppler v. J.M. Peters Co. </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1265 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 497], a developer, J.M. Peters Company, Inc., settled with a class of homeowners by, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>among other things, assigning its indemnification rights against nonsettling subcontractors. The agreement between the developer and certain of the subcontractors contained language providing that \u201cthe subcontractor \u2018agree[s] to indemnify and save [Peters] harmless against all claims for damages to persons or to property growing out of the execution of the work, and at his own expense to defend any suit or action brought against [Peters] founded upon the claim of such damage ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Id, </em>at p. 1278.) In a pretrial ruling, the trial court \u201c[ojbtained stipulations from the parties that Peters had tendered its defense in the underlying complaints to the subcontractors and received rejections.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1274.) The plaintiffs in <em>Heppler </em>sought a jury instruction that \u201cplaintiffs were entitled to a rebuttable evidentiary presumption that Peters [the developer] was liable for the amount it paid to settle the claims against it and the allocations of the good faith settlement were reasonable . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1275.) The trial court refused that instruction, and instead ruled \u201cthat the indemnity provisions at issue did not apply unless plaintiffs proved the subcontractors were at fault.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs attacked the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction and its \u201clegal determination that subcontractor fault (negligence plus causation) was a prerequisite to trigger the contractual obligation to indemnify under [the] subcontracts . . . .\u201d <em>(Heppler </em>v. <em>J.M. Peters Co., supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at p. 1275.) The appellate court found no error, noting: \u201cIt appears what plaintiffs in fact wanted was an instruction that they were entitled to a rebuttable presumption that <em>nonsettling subcon</em>tractors\u2014not Peters\u2014were liable for the amounts Peters paid to settle the claims. But the law does not so provide.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Heppler, </em>at p. 1282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The decision in <em>Heppler </em>has further significance here because the plaintiffs also sought a ruling that the trial court\u2019s earlier finding under Code of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Civil Procedure section 877.6 that the settlement between the developer and the homeowners was in good faith could be used to conclusively establish the amount owed by the subcontractors. The plaintiffs in <em>Heppler </em>appeared to believe\u2014much as the Dealer does here\u2014that the good faith finding could be used offensively to establish the amount due under a contract for indemnity. The trial court \u201crefused to tell the jury the court had previously issued an order finding the settlement and allocations were in good faith,\u201d and ruled that \u201cthe only effect of the good faith settlement order would be to establish the allocations as the \u2018cap\u2019 of the indemnity obligation.\u201d <em>(Heppler </em>v. <em>J.M. Peters Co. supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at p. 1274.)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial court. The plaintiffs\u2019 requested ruling had \u201cblurred and confused the distinctions between good faith confirmation hearings, which address equitable indemnity issues, and proceedings to enforce contractual indemnity, where \u2018reasonableness, \u2019 does not equate with \u2018good faith.\u2019\u201d <em>(Heppler </em>v. <em>J.M. Peters Co. supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at p. 1283.) \u201cAn adjudication that a settlement was made in \u2018good faith\u2019 under Code of Civil Procedure sections 877 and 877.6 bars cross-complaints against the settling parties and provides an offset to nonsettling tortfeasors against their remaining liability. [Citation.] Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 allows a settling tortfeasor to insulate itself from contribution and equitable indemnity claims. [Citation.] Thus, these statutes provide a <em>\u2018defensive \u2019 </em>procedure by which a joint tortfeasor may extricate itself from a lawsuit and bar actions for equitable indemnity by the remaining joint tortfeasors. [Citation.] Hf] The fundamental inquiry in a good faith hearing pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 877 and 877.6 is whether the settling defendant is paying the plaintiff an amount that is so far below defendant\u2019s proportionate share of liability as to be completely \u2018 \u201cout of the ball park.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Tech-Bilt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Woodward-Clyde &amp; Associates </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499 [213 Cal.Rptr. 256, 698 P.2d 159].) In an indemnity action, the crucial question is whether the settling indemnitee acted unreasonably by paying too much, thereby acting as a volunteer.\u201d <em>(Heppler </em>v. <em>J.M. Peters Co., supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1283-1284.) Because of these \u201ccrucial distinctions,\u201d the trial court\u2019s earlier finding under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 that the developer had settled in good faith \u201chad no relevance in the indemnity trial\u201d <em>(Heppler, </em>at p. 1284), and the appellate court was \u201cnot persuaded by plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to use the earlier good faith adjudication [of the settlement agreement] as a punitive \u2018hammer\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1284-1285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In this regard, the court was following an earlier decision in <em>Peter Culley &amp; Associates v. Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th 1484. There, an architectural firm sued a condominium developer to collect payments owed on the project. The developer cross-complained, alleging that design flaws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>caused construction delays and increased costs. The developer and architectural firm settled the cross-complaint, and the architectural firm assigned to the developer its rights under an indemnity agreement with the structural engineer. The developer then brought an action to enforce the indemnity agreement against the structural engineer. The trial court entertained the developer\u2019s motion to determine whether the settlement between it and the architect was in good faith and, after so finding, determined that it was conclusive against the structural engineer. The court in <em>Peter Culley </em>rejected the notion that a trial judge can resolve the issues presented in a contractual indemnity case by way of a motion to determine the good faith of a settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, and held that an indemnitee\u2019s right to contractual indemnity must be resolved by trial rather than by abbreviated proceedings. Noting that \u201cCode of Civil Procedure section 877.6 provides a <em>defensive </em>procedure by which a settling joint tortfeasor or co-obligor may extricate itself from a lawsuit and bar actions for equitable indemnity by remaining joint tortfeasors or co-obligors\u201d and that the case before it \u201cillustrates some of the problems caused by blurring the distinction between the role of good faith in <em>defensive </em>section 877.6 proceedings and its role in <em>offensive </em>actions to enforce indemnity agreements,\u201d the Court of Appeal granted a writ directing the trial court to vacate its good faith settlement order and to conduct further proceedings. <em>(Peter Culley &amp; Associates v. Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1488, fn. omitted, 1499.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The developer in <em>Peter Culley </em>argued that a good faith settlement was conclusive based on language in Civil Code section 2778, which provides specific rules for the interpretation of an indemnity contract. Among other things, section 2778 provides: \u201c4. The person indemnifying is bound, on request of the person indemnified, to defend actions or proceedings brought against the latter in respect to the matters embraced by the indemnity . . . ; [if] 5. If, after request, the person indemnifying neglects to defend the person indemnified, a recovery against the latter suffered by him in good faith, is conclusive in his favor against the former.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cinsofar as Civil Code section 2778, subdivision 5 makes a \u2018recovery\u2019 suffered in good faith conclusive, the statute refers only to a recovery by judgment against the indemnitee. We also conclude the indemnification for either a recovery by judgment or a settlement presupposes that other contractual conditions for indemnity, such as the indemnitor\u2019s negligence, have been proven.\u201d <em>(Peter Culley &amp; Associates v. Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1495-1496, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The holdings in <em>Heppler </em>and <em>Peter Culley </em>make clear that there are no shortcuts in this area. If the parties\u2019 agreement provides for indemnification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>and defense only where the indemnitee is not negligent, then the indemnitee must prove through admissible evidence in the action for reimbursement that it was not negligent in the underlying matter, or was at most passively negligent. Tempting as it may be to rely on good faith motions and conclusive presumptions, they simply have no place where the indemnitee has never litigated the issue of negligence, and is seeking to use a prior settlement offensively to conclusively establish the amount owed by the indemnitor under an express indemnity contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">D<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The judgment is reversed.

The insurer had allegedly breached its duty to accept a reasonable settlement offer, and the issue was whether the insurer should bear the burden of proving that a settlement offer within policy limits was unreasonable or whether the burden should be on the insured to prove that it was reasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In reaching that conclusion, the court in <em>Heppler </em>stated: \u201cContrary to plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, these subcontractors, who promised to indemnify Peters against damages caused by their negligent work, did not assume the role of liability insurers. Liability insurers protect insureds against damage or liability from generally defined risks in exchange for a premium. [Citation.] Insurers have a distinct and free-standing duty to defend their insureds [citation] as opposed to indemnitors, whose duty to defend is not triggered until it is determined that the proceeding against the indemnitee is \u2018embraced by the indemnity.\u2019 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2778, subd. 4 . . . .) Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on a line of insurance coverage cases (e.g., <em>Isaacson </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn.[, supra,] </em>44 Cal.3d 775 . . .) is misplaced.\u201d <em>(Heppler v. J.M. Peters Co., supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at p. 1282.) That statement by the court creates the impression that had the litigants in <em>Heppler </em>been an insurance company and its insured rather than a developer and a group of subcontractors, the law would have granted the presumption of liability sought by the plaintiffs for breach of the duty to defend. In fact, as a comprehensive treatise on insurance law explained, it is by no means clear that \u201cin cases where it turns out there was in fact <em>no coverage, </em>the insurer who wrongfully refused to defend a claim against its insured should be liable for: [U] . . . [j|] a settlement negotiated by the insured in good faith, and free of fraud or collusion, in order to avoid the uncertainty of an adverse judgment in a greater amount.\u201d (Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation (The Rutter Group 2002) H 7:692.4, p. 7B-54, some italics omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b72-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 46.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
