J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_e\">Richard L. Guillemin purports to appeal from the</p>\n<p id=\"AfU\">judgment of dismissal of his cross-complaint that the trial court entered after sustaining the demurrer of Paul Stein and Ray Waller to the only counts of the pleading naming them as cross-defendants. He also appeals from two postjudgment orders awarding costs and sanctions. We shall dismiss the appeal from the judgment and from an award of discovery sanctions as untimely. We shall affirm the award of costs, but will vacate the associated sanctions. In doing so, we construe Government Code section 6103.5 as authorizing the recovery of costs for filing fees when a judgment is entered in favor of public officials acting in their official capacity. Guillemin\u2019s argument to the contrary is neither frivolous nor otherwise a proper basis for imposing sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The trial court entered judgment dismissing the cross-complaint against cross-defendants Stein and Waller on August 16, 2001, and they served notice of entry on Guillemin the next day. Sixty-one days later (Oct. 17), Guillemin filed his notice of appeal. The cross-defendants contend the notice of appeal is untimely. Guillemin concedes the point in his reply brief, but asks \u201cby separate motion, relief to consider his late filed appeal on the grounds that the late filing was due to circumstances beyond his control.\u201d This is the entirety of his response.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">Guillemin had 60 days from the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment to file his notice of appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2(a)(2).) Not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>only is his invocation of unspecified \u201ccircumstances beyond his control\u201d merely conclusory, it is irrelevant. The 60-day period here pertinent in which to file a notice of appeal is mandatory, and we do not have jurisdiction to consider an appeal filed even one day after it expires. <em>(Hollister Convalescent Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Rico </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 660, 674 [125 Cal.Rptr. 757, 542 P.2d 1349]; <em>Janis </em>v. <em>California State Lottery Com. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 824, 828-829 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 549].) We must therefore deny his motion to permit consideration of late-filed notice of appeal and request for judicial notice and dismiss the appeal from the judgment without reviewing Guillemin\u2019s claim that he has stated a cause of action under Civil Code section 52.1 in the eighth count of the cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Before entry of the judgment dismissing the cross-complaint against Stein and Waller, the trial court granted the motion of the cross-defendants to compel further responses to their interrogatories and awarded sanctions of $1,643. In issuing a postjudgment order denying Guillemin\u2019s motion to tax costs, the trial court included a \u201cconfirmation\u201d of its earlier award of discovery sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Sanctions for discovery abuse are not separately appealable unless they exceed $5,000. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (b); see <em>Estrada </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 618, 621 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 73].) They otherwise can be reviewed only in the appeal from the final judgment in the main action. <em>(Russell </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1119 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 750].) The order awarding discovery sanctions was thus part of the judgment in the present matter, and is beyond our review for want of a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">It is immaterial that the trial court later \u201cconfirmed\u201d its sanctions award in a postjudgment order from which there is a timely appeal. In order to be appealable, a postjudgment order must also raise an issue different from those embraced in the judgment; otherwise it would give a party two chances to appeal the same ruling and thus (as in the present case) circumvent the time limit on appealing from the judgment. <em>(Lakin v. Watkins Associated Industries </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 651 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 863 P.2d 179].) As a result, the inclusion of the award of discovery sanctions in the postjudgment order is a nullity. We will dismiss that part of the appeal from the postjudgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The sole issues on which our jurisdiction is properly invoked are a $364 cost item and $690 in sanctions. We now turn to these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The judgment of dismissal did not specify the amount of costs to which the cross-defendants were entitled. They subsequently filed a memorandum of costs of $364 for fees for their first appearance. Mr. Guillemin filed his notice of motion to tax this cost. He argued that neither cross-defendant had paid filing costs because they were \u201cgovernmental defendants.\u201d (Cross-defendant Stein apparently was a member of the Calaveras County Board of Supervisors, while cross-defendant Waller was the director of the county\u2019s planning department.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The cross-defendants\u2019 opposition asserted that Government Code section 825<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> required Calaveras County to assume their defense because their actions arose out of the scope of their employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, section 6103 exempted them from paying a filing fee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They contended that they then were entitled under section 6103.5 to recover the costs as part of the judgment in order to pay the fees to the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The cross-defendants also moved for sanctions against Guillemin and his attorney for a frivolous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>motion. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 128.7.) Guillemin replied that cross-defendants were not entitled to recover filing fees as costs because they never incurred the expense, and were individuals rather than public agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In the trial court\u2019s order denying the motion to tax costs, it awarded what it termed the \u201cdeferred filing fees.\u201d Following a subsequent hearing on the request for sanctions, the trial court also granted the motion for sanctions, awarding $690. In its order, the trial court stated, \u201cIt was absolutely clear that. . . \u00a7 6103.5 authorized deferral of filing fees for public officials and that the costs claimed by Cross-Defendants were incurred and will have to be paid to the Court Clerk if recovered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Section 6103 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[n]either the state nor any county, city, district, or other political subdivision, nor any public officer or body, acting in [an] official capacity . . . , shall pay . . . any fee for the filing of any document. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Guillemin contends this statute exempts public officials from paying filing fees, thus public officials do not incur any costs in this regard. He asserts that they therefore cannot recover filing fees under one of the general requirements of costs set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5: \u201cCosts are allowable <em>if incurred, </em>whether or not paid.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1033.5, subd. (c)(1), italics added.) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">We are not persuaded. The language of section 6103 does not say the fees do not <em>accrue. </em>Rather, it says only that the state, counties, cities, districts, political subdivisions, and public officers or bodies acting in an official capacity are exempt from <em>payment </em>of the fees. Moreover, the argument disregards the plain language of section 6103.5, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u201c(a) Whenever a judgment is recovered by a public agency named in Section 6103 . . . in any action or proceeding . . . , which under the provisions of Section 6103 no fee for any . . . filing . . . has been paid, ... the clerk entering the judgment shall include as a part of the judgment the amount of the filing fee . . . which would have been paid but for Section 6103, designating it as such. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">\u201c(b) When an amount equal to the clerk\u2019s fees ... is collected upon a judgment pursuant to subdivision (a), those amounts shall be due and payable to the clerk.....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">It is apparent that section 6103.5 considers the filing fees to be an existing debt that simply remains unpaid. Filing fees are therefore costs incurred but not paid, which are recoverable under the general costs statute. Moreover, section 6103.5 <em>specifically prescribes </em>the inclusion of these fees as costs in a judgment; therefore a trial court does not have any discretion to tax them.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">This leaves Guillemin\u2019s argument that section 6103.5 does not pertain to public <em>officers </em>such as the cross-defendants because the statute limits itself to judgments recovered by a <em>public agency. </em>Guillemin is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">\u201c \u2018[I]n construing a statute, a court [must] ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coronado </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 145, 151 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 906 P.2d 1232] <em>(Coronado)) </em>To determine legislative intent, we first examine the words of the statute <em>(ibid), </em>applying \u201ctheir usual, ordinary, and common sense meaning based [upon the language] used and the evident purpose for which the statute was adopted.\u201d <em>(In re Rojas </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 152, 155 [151 Cal.Rptr. 649, 588 P.2d 789].) \u201cThe meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence; the words must be construed in context, and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.\u201d <em>(Lungren v. Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].) If the words of the statute are ambiguous, a court \u201cmay resort to extrinsic sources, including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.\u201d <em>(Coronado, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 151.) Applying these rules of statutory interpretation, a court \u201c \u2018must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and to avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\"><em>Public agency </em>is a term that can be reasonably interpreted to include a variety of public litigants. And the Legislature has defined <em>public </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>agency </em>differently in Government Code statutes as a means of delineating the intended coverage of the statute. (Cf. \u00a7\u00a7 6500 [joint powers agreements],<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 31478 [county employees retirement law],<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 53101 [local emergency telephone systems].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In the case of section 6103.5, the Legislature has defined <em>public agency </em>by cross-referencing the reader to section 6103. As stated <em>ante, </em>that section provides in pertinent part, that \u201c[n]either the state nor any county, city, district, or other political subdivision, nor any public officer \u00f3r body, acting in [an] official capacity . . . , shall pay . . . any fee for the filing of any document . . . .\u201d Since defendants are public officers who acted in an official capacity, they are included within the list of entities and persons delineated in section 6103, and are therefore within the meaning of <em>public agency </em>as that term is used in section 6103.5. The trial court was therefore correct in ordering that filing fees be recouped as costs in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Construing section 6103.5 in this way furthers the object to be achieved, the evil to be remedied, the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part, and legislative history. Before the enactment of section 6103.5 in 1949, the exemption to paying fees provided for in section 6103 operated to confer a special benefit (the cost of services performed by the clerk) on defendants successfully sued by public entities which was ultimately paid for by all other litigants. As enacted in 1949, section 6103.5 was sponsored by local governments as a revenue enhancement measure to address this inequity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It did not use the term <em>public agency, </em>but rather delineated its scope by stating in pertinent part: \u201cWhenever a judgment is recovered by the plaintiff or petitioner in any action or proceeding to begin which under the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Section 6103 no filing fee has been paid . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, there was no ambiguity whatsoever regarding the public litigants to which it pertained. It pertained to all those listed in section 6103, and that list included public officers who acted in an official capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Section 6103.5 was amended in 1985; in so doing, the Legislature significantly expanded its scope by including additional categories of fees that could be recoverable by a county, and by including actions in which public litigants were successful <em>defendants </em>as well as successful plaintiffs or petitioners.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Supported by county supervisors and clerks, the amendment anticipated an increase in county revenue by more comprehensively addressing the aforementioned inequity created by the exemption provided for in section 6103.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It would contravene the intent of the 1985 amendment if we were to construe the term <em>public agency </em>to reduce the categories of public litigants covered by its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Although cases are not authority for propositions not necessarily decided by them, we do note that our construction of section 6103.5 is consistent with the way this court applied the statute in <em>Townzen v. County of El Dorado </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1350 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 281]. There, a plaintiff brought an action against a county and 10 of its employees. We held that the fee for an initial appearance is determined per defendant, not per pleading. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1358.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">After the court denied the motion to tax costs, it held a subsequent hearing on cross-defendants\u2019 Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>for sanctions for the filing of a frivolous motion. The trial court awarded cross-defendants $690 in sanctions. In its order, the trial court stated, \u201cIt was absolutely clear that . . . \u00a7 6103.5 authorized deferral of filing fees for public officials and that the costs claimed by Cross-Defendants were incurred and will have to be paid to the Court Clerk if recovered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 imposes a lower threshold for sanctions than is required under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5. This is because Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 requires only that the conduct be \u201cobjectively unreasonable,\u201d while Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 also requires \u201ca showing of subjective bad faith.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Reese &amp; Guy </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1221 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 339].)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 was adopted to apply rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C.) (hereinafter rule 11), as amended in 1993, to cases brought on or after January 1, 1995. (See Assem. Com. on Judiciary, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3594 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 23, 1994, pp. 1-2; Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3594 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 23, 1994, pp. 3-5; Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3594 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 23, 1994, p. 2; <em>Goodstone v. Southwest Airlines Co. </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 406, 423 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 655] <em>(Goodstone).) </em>Because of this intent and the fact that the wording of Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, subdivisions (b)(2) and (c) is almost identical to that found in rule 11(b)(2) and (c), federal case law construing rule 11 is persuasive authority with regard to the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7. <em>(Goodstone, supra, </em>63 Cal.App.4th at p. 422; <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>Cummings </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th Supp. 10, 14, fn. 6 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 171].)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Under both Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 and rule 11, there are basically three types of submitted papers that warrant sanctions: factually frivolous (not well grounded in fact); legally frivolous (not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law); and papers interposed for an improper purpose. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 128.7; rule 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Here, the trial court awarded sanctions because it found the motion to tax costs legally frivolous.  We review the court\u2019s award under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>(In re Marriage of Drake </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1139, 1168 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 466].)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Writing in <em>Operating Engineers Pension Trust v. A-C Co. </em>(1988) 859 F.2d 1336, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that \u201c[r]ule 11 must not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>be construed so as to conflict with the primary duty of an attorney to represent his or her client zealously. Forceful representation often requires that an attorney attempt to read a case or an agreement in an innovative though sensible way. Our law is constantly evolving, and effective representation sometimes compels attorneys to take the lead in that evolution. Rule 11 must not be turned into a bar to legal progress.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1344.) We find that these principles are equally applicable to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The trial court was not faced with a motion that was being prosecuted for an improper motive. Its finding of ftivolousness was based solely on the conclusion that any reasonable attorney would agree that the motion is totally and completely without merit. <em>(In re Marriage of Flaherty </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 650 [183 Cal.Rptr. 508, 646 P.2d 179] [frivolousness of appeal determined if (1) appeal is taken for an improper motive; or (2) it indisputably has no merit].) In so finding, the trial court acted unreasonably and arbitrarily. The argument advanced by Guillemin that cross-defendants were not covered by section 6103.5 because they are individuals rather than public agencies is arguable. The term <em>public agency </em>does not usually connote an individual. One must read the statute with companion provisions of the Government Code and correctly interpret legislative intent in order to understand the more expansive meaning the Legislature assigned to the term. Thus, although Guillemin\u2019s contention lacks persuasive force, his motion was not frivolous and he was entitled to zealously argue the point. We will vacate the order awarding sanctions for filing the motion to tax costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Appellant\u2019s motion to permit consideration of late-filed notice of appeal and request for judicial notice is denied. The appeal from the judgment is dismissed. The appeal from the part of the postjudgment order \u201cconfirming\u201d the discovery sanctions is dismissed. The order denying the motion to tax costs is affirmed. The order awarding sanctions for filing a frivolous motion to tax costs is vacated. The parties will pay their own costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Morrison, J., and Robie, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\"> Further undesignated section references are to the Government Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Section 825, subdivision (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201c[I]f an employee or former employee of a public entity requests the public entity to defend him or her against any claim or action against him or her for an injury arising out of an act or omission occurring within the scope of his or her employment as an employee of the public entity . . . and the employee or former employee reasonably cooperates in good faith in the defense of the claim or action, the public entity shall pay any judgment based thereon or any compromise or settlement of the claim or action to which the public entity has agreed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Section 6103 provides: \u201cNeither the state nor any county, city, district, or other political subdivision, nor any public officer or body, acting in his official capacity on behalf of the state, or any county, city, district or other political subdivision, shall pay or deposit any fee for the filing of any document or paper, for the performance of any official service, or for the filing of any stipulation or agreement which may constitute an appearance in any court by any other party to the stipulation or agreement.
