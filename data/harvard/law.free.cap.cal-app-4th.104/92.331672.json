Code, \u00a7 602) entered following findings that he committed misdemeanor vandalism (Pen. Code, \u00a7 594, subd. (a); count one), and possession of an aerosol container with intent to deface while on a public place (Pen. Code, \u00a7 594.1, subd. (e)(1); count two). He was ordered placed home on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">We conclude that whether a person was on a \u201cpublic place\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 594.1, subdivision (e)(1), is determined by examining the totality of the facts and circumstances and, in the present case, there was sufficient evidence that Danny H. violated that subdivision, including sufficient evidence that he was on such a \u201cpublic place.\u201d We also hold that there is no need to decide Danny H.\u2019s contention regarding Penal Code section 654, since that issue was relevant only to the calculation of a maximum theoretical period of confinement, and he was ordered placed home on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">1. <em>People\u2019s Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Viewed in accordance with the usual rules on appeal <em>(In re Dennis B. </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 687, 697 [135 Cal.Rptr. 82, 557 P.2d 514]), the evidence established that about 5:20 p.m. on May 22, 2001, Azusa Police Corporal Randy Phillips, in response to a radio call about someone painting graffiti, was driving a marked patrol vehicle in the area of the 500 block of West Foothill. He observed Danny H. and another young man standing on the raised dirt area adjacent to railroad tracks and between two walls that paralleled the tracks. Danny H. was holding a bicycle. No one else was present. There was no sidewalk in that area, and the area was not one in which Phillips would have expected to see pedestrian traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Danny H. and his companion fled the scene, but were later apprehended by another officer, Douglas Ernst. Phillips discovered a large amount of graffiti on \u201cthe wall,\u201d some of which had just been sprayed. The graffiti which had just been sprayed consisted of black and yellow paint. Several spray paint cans were in the area in which Danny H. and the young man had been standing. One of the cans had fresh black paint along its outside edge. The freshly painted black graffiti included the words \u201cfuck school,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u201cdie.\u201d When Phillips first observed Danny H., Danny H. was about two feet from the vandalized wall, and about two feet from the \u201cblack spray paint\u201d can. There were fingerprints on the back of the can.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">After being detained, Danny H. denied any wrongdoing and claimed that he and his companion were on the trestle \u201cbecause they were waiting for a friend. He didn\u2019t show up.\u201d Officer Ernst observed fresh black paint on Danny H.\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Following his arrest, Danny H. admitted to Officer Ernst that he and his friend had picked up spray cans that had been left on the trestle and Danny H. had spray painted words on the north and south sides of the trestle. Danny H. spray painted the words \u201cDie Most,\u201d \u201cDie,\u201d \u201cEcho,\u201d and \u201cBP.\u201d Echo was Danny H.\u2019s Baldwin Park gang moniker, but he no longer associated with that gang. Danny H. said he wrote \u201cDie Most\u201d \u201con behalf\u2019 of his friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">2. <em>Defense Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In defense, Danny H. testified his friend did all the spray painting, and that he was \u201cjust standing there watching and sitting on my bike.\u201d He said that he had walked away when the police approached because he had always been told that being on the trestle was trespassing. He denied telling the police that he had spray painted the wall, but rather had told them that his friend did the spray painting. The paint on his hands came from painting model cars; however, he said that he did not tell that to the police that day because he was nervous. He said that he was not a member of the Baldwin Park gang at the time of adjudication, and was not a member on May 22, 2001.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">Danny H. contends: (1) \u201cThe true finding on count 2 must be reversed because there was no evidence [Danny H.] possessed any aerosol paint container with intent to deface \u2018while on any public highway, street, alley, or way, or other public place,\u2019 \u201d and (2) \u201cIf the true finding on count 2 is valid, the sentence for that count should be stayed pursuant to Penal Code section 654.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">1. <em>There Was Sufficient Evidence That Danny H. Violated Penal Code Section 594.1, Subdivision (e)(1).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Count two of the petition alleged in statutory language that Danny H. violated Penal Code section 594.1, subdivision (e)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following an adjudication, the court sustained counts one and two.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Danny H. presents no sufficiency claim as to count one. As to count two, he concedes there was evidence he possessed an aerosol paint can, he was immediately adjacent to the trestle wall, and he was using the can to spray paint the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Danny H. disputes only that, as to count two, the requisite possession occurred while he was \u201con <em>any . . . public </em>place\u201d within the meaning of section 594.1, subdivision (e)(1). He urges, inter alia, that there was no evidence as to the \u201cownership of the trestle, or of the ground immediately adjacent to the trestle wall. The only indication in the record as to the ownership of the location where the crimes allegedly occurred was the allegation of count 1 of the petition that the trestle belonged to Santa Fe Railway. Neither the trestle wall itself nor the area around it was proven to be a public place.\u201d The issue is one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>The rules of statutory construction are familiar. As our Supreme Court stated in <em>People v. Jefferson </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 86 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 893, 980 P.2d 441], \u201c \u2018The goal of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. [Citation.] Ordinarily, the words of the statute provide the most reliable indication of legislative intent. [Citation.] When the statutory language is ambiguous, the court may examine the context in which the language appears, adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cWhen the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation . . . , we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, . . . , and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Jefferson, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 94.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Section 594.1, subdivision (e)(1), provides, \u201cIt is unlawful for any person under the age of 18 years to possess an aerosol container of paint for the purpose of defacing property <em>while on any </em>public highway, street, alley, or way, or other <em>public place, </em>regardless of whether that person is or is not in any automobile, vehicle, or other conveyance.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The meaning of the phrase \u201cpublic place\u201d in section 594.1, subdivision (e)(1), is ambiguous. Subdivision (e)(1), does not define the phrase, and the phrase, as a matter of common parlance, bears multiple meanings. The word \u201cpublic,\u201d as an adjective, includes such meanings as \u201cof or relating to a government,\u201d \u201cof, relating to, or being in the service of the community or nation,\u201d \u201cof or relating to people in general[,]\u201d \u201cgeneral, popular,\u201d \u201cof or relating to business or community interests as opposed to private affairs[,]\u201d \u201caccessible to or shared by all members of the community,\u201d and \u201cexposed to general view: open.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Capitalization omitted.) Different meanings might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>affect this case differently.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We must look outside the text of section 594.1, subdivision (e)(1), to determine the meaning of the phrase \u201cpublic place\u201d as used in that subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The Legislature has used the phrase \u201cpublic place\u201d elsewhere in the Penal Code, sometimes with apparently conflicting meaning. Thus, section 653.22, subdivision (a), prohibits loitering in any \u201cpublic place\u201d with intent to commit prostitution. Section 653.20, subdivision (b), which defines the phrase \u201cpublic place\u201d as used in section 653.22, subdivision (a), states, in relevant part, that \u201c \u2018Public place\u2019 means an area <em>open to the public, . . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Italics added.) On the other hand, section 311.6, prohibits, inter alia, obscene live conduct \u201cin any <em>public place </em>or in any place exposed to public view, <em>or </em>in any place <em>open to the public </em>or to a segment thereof . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, under section 653.20, subdivision (b), a \u201cpublic place\u201d includes an area \u201copen to the public\u201d while, under section 311.6, a \u201cpublic place\u201d is expressly distinguished from a place \u201copen to the public.\u201d Suffice it to say that the phrase \u201cpublic place\u201d is not used throughout the Penal Code with a clear and uniform legislative meaning from which we may deduce the meaning of that phrase at section 594.1, subdivision (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The difficulty of determining the legislative meaning of the phrase \u201cpublic place\u201d at section 594.1, subdivision (e)(1), from the Legislature\u2019s uses of that phrase elsewhere in the Penal Code stems not only from apparently <em>conflicting </em>uses of that phrase by the Legislature, but from the fact that, as shown below, the Legislature has used the phrase \u201cpublic place\u201d in the Penal Code, usually without defining the phrase, and frequently distinguishing it from other terms with which, at least as a matter of common parlance, the phrase \u201cpublic place\u201d is arguably <em>synonymous.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Apart from section 594.1, there are 24 sections of the Penal Code which use the phrase \u201cpublic place\u201d (or \u201cpublic places\u201d). Eleven of those sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>simply use the phrase without defining it or otherwise shedding light on its meaning.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Of the remaining 13 sections which use the phrase \u201cpublic place,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> only two define the phrase \u201cpublic place,\u201d and one of those two definitions is not very helpful.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nine other sections do not define the phrase, but merely distinguish it from arguably synonymous concepts; <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> from what is arguably a particular type of public place;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or from both.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Two other sections make other distinctions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>The above further demonstrates that the phrase \u201cpublic place\u201d is not used in the Penal Code with a clear and uniform legislative meaning from which we may deduce the meaning of that phrase at section 594.1.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This fact encourages us to look to the legislative history of section 594.1, subdivision (e)(1), to determine the meaning of the phrase \u201cpublic place\u201d as it is used there.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Assembly Bill No. 1675 (Assembly Bill 1675) was introduced in the Assembly in March 1981. (Assem. Bill 1675 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Mar. 26, 1981; 1 Assem. Final Hist. (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) p. 1126.) In pertinent part, the bill, as introduced, would have added provisions to the Business and Professions Code requiring retailers who sold aerosol paint containers to post signs in their businesses warning that vandalism was a crime, and to label such containers with such a warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Assembly Bill 1675 was amended on May 6, 1981, to delete the reference to the Business and Professions Code, and to add proposed Penal Code section 594.1. (Assem. Bill 1675 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 6, 1981; 1 Assem. Final Hist. (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) p. 1126.) As amended, the bill, in proposed section 594.1, subdivisions (a) through (c), added new crimes relating to the purchase of aerosol paint containers by minors and retained the sign-posting requirements. In addition, as amended, the bill added proposed subdivisions (d) and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Section 594.1, subdivisions (d) and (e)(1), in effect at the time of the present offenses, originates from subdivisions (d) and (e), as proposed in Assembly Bill 1675 and amended in May 1981. When the latter two subdivisions are read together, it is unclear whether the Legislature intended that a \u201cpublic place,\u201d within the meaning of proposed subdivision (e), be a place over which the government had jurisdiction (for example, a place belonging to, or owned by, the government.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Nonetheless, other parts of the legislative history of section 594.1, reveal that the Legislature, in enacting that section, was seeking to address widespread problems resulting from the commission of vandalism upon government and privately owned property alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">An analysis by the Ways and Means Committee prepared for a June 17, 1981 hearing, and pertaining to Assembly Bill 1675 as amended May 6, 1981, comments that the bill \u201cprohibits possession of aerosol paint containers by persons under 18 for the purpose of defacing property while on any <em>public street or alley.\u201d </em>(Assem. Com. on Ways and Means, Analysis of Assem. Bill 1675 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 6, 1981, italics added.) The italicized language suggests a limited scope of places affected by the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">However, a second comment only two sentences after the first comment states, \u201cThe proposed measure responds to the serious problem in some <em>communities </em>of graffiti spray painted on walls <em>and other open spaces.\u201d </em>(Assem. Com. on Ways and Means, Analysis of Assem. Bill 1675 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 6, 1981, italics added.) This second comment provides evidence that the phrase \u201cpublic street or alley\u201d in the first comment was merely intended to be a shorthand characterization of the scope of the places affected by the proposed section 594.1, subdivision (e).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But that second comment also provides evidence that the scope of the phrase \u201cpublic place\u201d in proposed section 594.1, subdivision (e), was not intended to be limited merely to a public street or alley, or to places over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>which a government had jurisdiction, but was intended broadly to apply to the \u201copen spaces\u201d in which \u201ccommunities\u201d were finding graffiti to be a serious problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">An analysis by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and pertaining to Assembly Bill 1675 as amended May 6, 1981, notes that the source of the proposed legislation was the City of Los Angeles, supported by the City of San Diego. The analysis also states, \u201cThe purpose of this bill is to attempt to deter defacement of property with spray paint.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill 1675 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 6, 1981, p. 2.) Under the caption \u201cNeed for bill,\u201d the analysis states, \u201cProponents report that spray paint vandalism is a serious and very visible problem throughout the state, particularly in Southern California.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 3.) We note that this last statement referred to the problem of the <em>visibility </em>of spray paint vandalism, and neither of the above two quoted statements indicates that the proponents were concerned solely with vandalism to government-owned property, as opposed to private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Indeed, the committee file of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary contains a background information form pertaining to Assembly Bill 1675, and the form was prepared for, and submitted to, the committee. The form was apparently filled out by the City of Los Angeles. The form, under the section entitled \u201cPurpose,\u201d asks, \u201cWhat problem or deficiency under existing law does the bill seek to remedy?\u201d The reply states, \u201cGraffiti, in the Los Angeles <em>area </em>is still a serious problem. This measure is drafted so that it will not interfere with the legitimate use of paints, but will make it more difficult for individuals to deface <em>public/private </em>properties.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Background Information Form re: Assem. Bill 1675 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 6, 1981, p. 1, italics added.) Following additional amendments, Assembly Bill 1675 was, on September 19, 1981, enrolled and sent to the Governor. (Assem. Bill 1675 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) as amended Sept. 15, 1981; 1 Assem. Final Hist. (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) p. 1126.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Various legislative documents confirm that the enrolled Assembly Bill 1675 was intended to address the widespread impact of graffiti on public and private property alike. A letter from the City Council of the City of Los Angeles to the Governor, dated September 18, 1981, stated, \u201cAB 1675 is an attempt to alleviate the increasing problem of graffiti caused by the use of spray paint cans by minors.\u201d The letter later stated, \u201cThe ever-increasing problem of graffiti caused by the use of spray paint cans by minors is evident throughout Los Angeles. <em>Governmental entities and private property owners, </em>as a consequence, are faced with the expense of eradicating the graffiti and restoring the property damaged by the vandals. The City of Los Angeles\u2019 budget in 1978 was over $600,000 to eradicate the graffiti from <em>public structures and certain private structures </em>if the graffiti is obnoxious.\u201d (City Council of the City of Los Angeles, letter to Governor Brown (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 18, 1981, italics added.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The letter later stated, \u201cThe City of Los Angeles feels that AB 1675 is a very necessary step if we are to stem the tide of degradation of our inner city neighborhoods.\u201d (Letter to Governor Brown, <em>supra, </em>at p. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">A letter dated September 23, 1981, from Assemblyman Richard Alatorre, who sponsored Assembly Bill 1675, to the Governor, stated, \u201cWe all know that the blight caused by graffiti is [detrimental] to both the <em>individual property owner </em>and the <em>community which must view it\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Assemblyman Richard Alatorre, letter to Governor Brown, Sept. 23, 1981, p. 1, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The widespread nature of the problem caused by graffiti was reflected in an enrolled bill report from the legal affairs department of the Governor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Office dated September 24, 1981, and pertaining to Assembly Bill 1675, which states, \u201cJuvenile vandalism with spray paint is a widespread problem causing thousands of dollars in damages each year. However, the most serious use of paint is by youth gangs to establish their territory. These individuals will literally fight and die over their monikers.\u201d (Governor\u2019s Office, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill. 1675 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 24, 1981.) The report also noted that the provisions of the proposed section 594.1 were \u201cbroad.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>(Ibid.) </em>On October 1, 1981, Assembly Bill 1675 was approved by the Governor and, the next day, it was chaptered by the Secretary of State as Statutes 1981, chapter 1125.) (1 Assem. Final Hist. (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) p. 1126.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The above legislative analyses, reports, records, and correspondence, part of the legislative history of section 594.1, as enacted in 1981, reveal that Assembly Bill 1675 was intended broadly to address the increasing and widespread problems, shared by the state and Southern California community, of blight, eyesores, and costly property damage to our communities and \u201copen spaces\u201d caused by graffiti sprayed on government and privately owned property. Section 594.1, as enacted in 1981, was intended as a preliminary crime designed to deter such defacement of property and, thus, the commission of a completed act of spray paint vandalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">We note that in 1988, section 594.1, subdivision (e), was amended (with other subdivisions) by the deletion of the requirement that the aerosol container of paint be \u201clarger than 6 ounces (net weight of contents)\u201d (\u00a7 594.1, subd. (e), as amended by Stats. 1988, ch. 925, \u00a7 1, pp. 2950-2951), effecting a further legislative broadening of the reach of subdivision (e).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In light of our above discussion, and mindful of the innumerable ways in which spray paint vandalism, and thus the preliminary crime proscribed by section 594.1, subdivision (e)(1), can be committed, we believe the legislative history of that subdivision supports a broad construction of the phrase \u201cpublic place\u201d found therein. Accordingly, we reject the notion that whether a place is a \u201cpublic place\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (e)(1), is determinable by some bright-line rule, or that a single factor is dispositive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>and look instead to the totality of the facts and circumstances presented in the record, viewed in light of the usual rules on appeal <em>(In re Dennis B., supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 697), to determine whether there was sufficient evidence satisfying the \u201cpublic place\u201d element of subdivision (e)(1), in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">There is no dispute that Danny H. was \u201con any . . . place\u201d for purposes of section 594.1, subdivision (e)(1); the issue is whether that place was a \u201cpublic place.\u201d We conclude that it was and substantial evidence supports that conclusion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The trestle on which he stood was private property but that fact is not controlling; the property did not belong to him and he had no ownership or possessory interest in the property. The trestle was readily accessible; no member of the public wishing to access the trestle was prevented from doing so by any physical barrier. There were several spray cans in the area where Danny H. had been standing, and Officer Phillips\u2019s testimony established that, even before Danny H. vandalized the wall, there was graffiti there; these facts provided evidence that one or more persons already had accessed the trestle.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The trestle was unenclosed, visible to the public, and exposed to general view. Thus, an anonymous caller had been able to see Danny H. and his companion while they were on the trestle. Officer Phillips, still in his vehicle and about 75 to 80 feet from Danny H., observed him standing on the raised area of the trestle. The fact that there were walls on either side of the tracks does not alter the fact that the location where Danny H. was standing was substantially an \u201copen space\u201d of a type with which section 594.1, subdivision (e)(1), according to its legislative history, is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Danny H. obviously wanted his graffiti sprayed at a place where it would be visible. The record permits the inference that he wrote it for gang members to see; a segment of the public, fellow vandals, previously had accessed the location to spray graffiti; and he anticipated that his graffiti would be visible at least to such members of the public. We note that one of the reasons section 594.1, subdivision (e)(1), was enacted was to prevent gang graffiti. The graffiti also would have been visible to any persons being transported on the railroad tracks. Moreover, we note that Foothill was a major boulevard in a largely industrial area. There is no dispute that Danny H. committed vandalism while on the trestle (count one); it seems incongruous, on the above facts, to accept that he committed a completed act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>vandalism but not, seconds before, a preliminary offense designed to deter that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Thus, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence that Danny H. violated section 594.1, subdivision (e)(1), including sufficient evidence that he possessed an aerosol container of paint \u201cwhile on any . . . public placef]\u201d within the meaning of that subdivision. None of the cases cited by Danny H., or his argument, compels a contrary conclusion.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">2. <em>There Is No Need to Decide the Section 654 Issue or to Correct the Trial Court\u2019s Calculation of the Maximum Theoretical Period of Confinement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">At disposition, the trial court ordered that a previous order that Danny H. be placed on home on probation would remain in effect. The trial court calculated Danny H.\u2019s maximum theoretical period of confinement, which appeared to include consecutive confinement periods on counts one and two.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Danny H. claims the trial court erroneously failed to stay, pursuant to section 654, the term on count two (two months).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">There is no need to decide the issue. The section 654 issue is relevant only to the issue of whether the trial court\u2019s order calculating Danny H.\u2019s maximum theoretical period of confinement must be corrected. However, here, Danny H. was ordered home on probation in the home of his parents. The court did not order Danny H. removed from the physical custody of his parents. Only when a court orders a minor removed from the physical custody of his parent or guardian is the court required to specify the maximum term the minor can be held in physical confinement. Accordingly, there is no need to decide the section 654 issue or to correct the trial court\u2019s order calculating Danny H.\u2019s maximum theoretical period of confinement. <em>(In re Joseph G. </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1735, 1743-1744 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 902]; Welf. &amp; Inst.
