On June 30th, 1903, he Avas at Abel\u2019s hotel, at Bloomsbury, expecting to see one John-S. Pickel (whose place of abode was on the further side of the railroad) about the sale of a thresher or binder to Henry Housel, a resident in that neighborhood. After the mid-dajr dinner, or a little later, Housel, being in a hurry, undertook to convey the plaintiff in his carriage to Picket\u2019s house, or hotel. The horse was-shod in the usual manner and the carriage was an open, four-wheeled vehicle, Avith tires of metal \u2014 not rubber. In driving towards Pickel\u2019s abode they first crossed the railway tracks of the Central Eailroad Company of New Jersey, and then approached the overhead highway bridge mentioned in the declaration. This bridge Avas an ordinary country bridge, over a railway cut; was wide enough for two vehicles to pass thereon; was floored Avith planks, which were about twenty feet above the rails, and Avas open at the sides save for the iron railings or gratings. As Housel and the plaintiff approached the bridge on their outward way, they stopped, looked and listened, but saw and heard nothing. They crossed the bridge and reached Pickel\u2019s house safe; he not being at home, they soon turned about and set forth on the return to Bloomsbury. As they approached the bridge in this direction they drove down a slope, crossed a low or fiat place in the road, and then made a sharp ascent to the bridge. By reason of the side of the cut, tire men could not see the railroad tracks, - or any engine or car that might be standing thereon under the bridge or close thereto on either side, until they Avere actually upon the bridge, or nearly so. A field of growing corn upon the right or east side also interfered Avith their Ariew of the railroad. When within a feAV paces of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>bridge Housel stopped his horse or drew him down to a slow walk. Nothing being seen or heard by either man, they drove upon the bridge, and had gone a little beyond the middle o\u00a3 it when the whistle of a locomotive engine standing upon the rails beneath was blown three or four times, and the engine moved slowly eastward, emitting steam which came up in clouds through the cracks between the planks and enveloped the horse and men. The animal crouched, plunged, breaking the harness, and ran away. The plaintiff was thrown out of the carriage as they descended the slope away from the bridge and sustained, besides bruises, a fracture of his arm, a. compound fracture of the tibia and a displacement of the kneecap. He. had not recovered from his injuries at the time of the- trial \u2014 December 13th, 1904 \u2014 and doubt was expressed by the medical witnesses respecting his recovery at any later day. The plaintiff had lost his position with the harvester company bjr reason of inability to do the work which he had formerly done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b716-5\">When the plaintiff rested a motion for a nonsuit was made on behalf of the defendants, on the grounds that the defendants were not shown to have been guilty of any negligence in the operation of tire railroad, and that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. This motion was granted by the court on the former ground, for the reasons that it was not shown that the enginenran'knew that any persons were crossing the bridge, and that it was not shown that the whistle was blown where the enginenran had no right to- blow it or was not bound to blow it. To this ruling an exception was prayed and sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b716-6\">Judgment was entered upon the nonsuit, and thereupon a writ of error was sued out. Error was specially assigned in that the judgment was contrary to law because the evidence showed that the defendants were guilty of negligence, which resulted in injury to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b716-7\">For the plaintiff in error, <em>William G. Gebhardt.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b716-8\">To blow a whistle or -let off steam, under the circumstances revealed b3r the proofs, whether the engineman knew that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>plaintiff was passing over the bridge or not, was such negligence as to- require explanation or excuse from the defendants. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b717-5\">On the proofs made by the plaintiff there was a question for the jury whether the engineman must not have heard the horse and carriage upon the bridge, and thus have been aware of the presence of travelers.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b717-6\">Eor the defendants in error, <em>H. Burdett Herr.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b717-7\">No negligence was shown which would entitle the plaintiff to recover.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The opinion of the court (the foregoing statement of the case having been made) was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b717-9\">Green, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac2\">1. In our examination of the caso we are at once confronted by this portion of the judgment record: \u201cThat the jurors * * * went from the bar of the court to consider of their verdict * * * and after the said jurors had considered thereof and agreed among themselves, they returned to the said bar to give their verdict in this behalf, upon which the said Amos Mumma comes not, nor does he further prosecute his suit,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">This entry would indicate that the. plaintiff below had suffered a voluntary nonsuit after the case had been given to the jury and the jurors had retired. Such a course was permissible to a plaintiff at common law <em>(Bauman </em>v. <em>Whiteley, </em>28 <em>Vroom </em>487, 489), but was forbidden in our practice \u2014 first, by rule of the Supreme Court, and later by positive statute. See, now, <em>Pamph. L. </em>1903, <em>p. </em>580, \u00a7 160. For such error in the record, a reversal at the hands of this court would be proper. See <em>Rollins </em>v. <em>Atlantic City Railroad Co., 4</em>1 <em>Vroom. </em>664, 667 (1904). Nevertheless, were the judgment otherwise to be sustained, we. might refrain from reversing on this ground alone, because a glance at the printed case shows that the entry is untrue, the plaintiff having been nonsuited, bv order of the presiding justice, before any evidence was offered by the defendants, and, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>before the case was given to the jury. Under such, circumstances the <em>postea </em>and judgment might, and doubtless would, be amended in the Supreme Court. See 1 <em>Tidd (9th Eng. ed.) </em>713, 714; 2 <em>Id. </em>942; 1 <em>Chit. Arch. Pr. (12th Eng. ed.) </em>545, 547; <em>Apgar\u2019s Administrator </em>v. <em>Hiler, </em>1 <em>Zab. </em>808 (1854).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">2. On a closer examination of the record and of the evidence sent up with the bill of exception, we think that there are two legal principles which, singly or together, might and should have controlled the action of the learned trial justice on the motion to nonsuit. These principles may- be briefly set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\"><em>a. </em>The first is found in the maxim, <em>\u201cres ipsa </em>loquituP\u2019\u2014 literally translated, \u201cthe thing itself speaks.\u201d This principle is that when through any instrumentality or agency under the management or control of a defendant or his servants there is an occurrence, injurious to the plaintiff, which, in the ordinary course of things, would not take place if the person in control were exercising due care, the occurrence itself, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, affords <em>prima facie </em>evidence that there was want of due care. See <em>Thomp. Negl., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 15, 7635; <em>Smith Negl. </em>*246; <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Company, 5 Exch. </em>787, 789 (1850); <em>Scott </em>v. <em>London Dock. Co., </em>3 <em>Hurlst. &amp; C. </em>596, 601 (1865); <em>Excelsior Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Sweet, </em>28 <em>Vroom </em>224, 227, 229 (1894); <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>29 <em>Id. </em>230, 232, 233 (1895); <em>Consolidated Traction Co. </em>v. <em>Thalheimer, </em>30 <em>Id. </em>474, 476 (1896); <em>Bergen County Traction Co. </em>v. <em>Demarest, </em>33 <em>Id. </em>755, 756 (1898); <em>Shay </em>v. <em>Camden and Suburban Railway Co., </em>37 <em>Id. </em>334, 335 (1901); <em>Paynter </em>v. <em>Bridgeton, &amp;c., Traction Co., </em>38 <em>Id. </em>619, 625 (1902).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\"><em>b. </em>The second principle \u2014 or, better, rule \u2014 is that where fair-minded men might honestly differ as to the conclusions to be drawn from facts, whether controverted or uncontroverted, the question at issue should go to the jury. See <em>Thomp. Tr., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1664-1666; <em>Thomp. Negl., </em>\u00a7 7634; <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>7 <em>Vroom </em>531, 532 (1873); <em>Bahr </em>v. <em>Lombard &amp; Ayres Co., </em>24 <em>Id. </em>233, 236 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>(1890); <em>Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Shelton, 26 Id. </em>342, 344 (1893). This rule is particularly applicable to cases involving negligence, inasmuch as negligence is not so much a fact in itself as a logical inference from a collocation of facts. See <em>Whart. Negl., </em>\u00a7 420; <em>Thomp. Negl., </em>\u00a7 7634; <em>Thomp. Tr., </em>\u00a7 1663; <em>Central Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>1 <em>Zab. </em>824, 832 (1854); <em>Newark Passenger Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Block, </em>26 <em>Vroom </em>605, 607, 608 (1893); <em>Traction Company </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>29 <em>Id. </em>682, 685, 686 (1896).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Reviewing the evidence on the part of the plaintiff with these principles in mind, we perceive that it tended to establish this state of facts: The servant of the defendants, in charge of a locomotive engine (seemingly without cars attached), caused the whistle of the engine to give forth sound, and steam to be emitted, suddenly, while under a highway bridge, where travelers might lawfully be passing, and might be expected to be passing, with horses and vehicles; and this the servant did when no statutory or other rule, so far as the evidence disclosed, appeared to require the blowing of the whistle. Through this act of tire defendants\u2019 servant injury befell the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Such a <em>prima facie </em>ease, made by the plaintiff, properly called for explanatory evidence, at the least, on the part of the defendants. So to hold will put the present case in accord with <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>29 <em>Vroom </em>(1895) (at <em>pp. </em>232, 233); <em>Trenton Passenger Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>31 <em>Id. </em>219, 221 (1897); <em>Bergen County Traction Co. </em>v. <em>Demarest, </em>33 <em>Id. </em>(1898) (at <em>pp. </em>756, 757). If the act of the servant \u2014 the engine-driver\u2014 were unusual, and emphasis be laid upon this characteristic, then to hold that because of the unusual act or occurrence the defendants were required to put in explanatory, if not exculpatory, evidence, will also harmonize the present case with <em>Bahr </em>v. <em>Lombard &amp; Ayres Co., </em>24 <em>Id. </em>233, 238, 239 (1890); <em>Bittle </em>v. <em>Camden and Atlantic Railroad Co., </em>26 <em>Id. </em>615, 622 (1893); <em>McCann </em>v. <em>Consolidated Traction Co., </em>30 <em>Id. </em>481, 484 (1896); <em>Ayars </em>v. <em>Camden and Suburban Railway Co., </em>34 <em>Id. </em>416, 419 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>(1899). See, also, <em>M. S. J. &amp; A. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Fullarton, </em>14 <em>C. B. (N. S.) </em>54, 56, 58 (1863).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Furthermore, the case so made by the plaintiff was one upon which lie w\u00e1s entitled to have a finding by a <em>jury, </em>because, whether the facts proved on his part spoke of actionable negligence by the defendants or not, was at least a matter debatable by fair-minded men. See <em>Mahnken </em>v. <em>Freeholders of Monmouth, </em>33 <em>Vroom </em>404, 407 (1898). The question was not what the trial judge would infer from the evidence, but whether the jury might legitimately conclude that the proofs of the plaintiff showed the' defendants to have been negligent. See <em>Newark Passenger Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Block, </em>26 <em>Id.. </em>605, 607, 608 (1893); <em>Traction Company </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>29 <em>Id. </em>682, 685, 686 (1896).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Inasmuch as the nonsuit was not based upon the ground of contributory negligence in the plaintiff, it is scarcely necessary to say that if there were any negligence on the part of Housed, the owner and driver of the horse, such negligence was not imputable to the plaintiff, who appears to have been riding by invitation only. See <em>Noonan </em>v. <em>Consolidated Traction Co., </em>35 <em>Vroom </em>579 (1900). But, in granting the non-suit on the ground that the defendants had not been shown to&gt; be guilty of any negligence, the learned trial justice did not, as we think, allow sufficient force1 to both or either of the principles above mentioned, and therefore the nonsuit should not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">3. A' few eases arising in other jurisdictions may now be considered and applied, or distinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\"><em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>59 <em>Pa. St. </em>259, 265 (1869). In this case the plaintiff below sued for damages sustained through the negligent blowing of the whistle of an engine, drawing a passenger train on the defendant\u2019s road, while under a highway bridge over which the plaintiff 'was passing. There was a verdict, and judgment thereon for the plaintiff below, and a writ of error sued out by the railroad company. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment, and said: \u201cThe sounding of the alarm whistle, as the train was passing under the bridge, was the cause of the horses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>becoming frightened and running away, and the injury to the plaintiff was the result. This was an act ,of gross negligence and a sufficiently proximate cause of the injury to make the company liable' therefor.\u201d This case has been cited as an authority in this court, in 26 <em>Vroom </em>(at <em>p. </em>622).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\"><em>Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>David, </em>105 <em>Ill. App. </em>69, 70, 71 (1902). In this case negligence was averred in causing the blowing of the whistle and the escape of steam when an engine, with a caboose attached, was moving rapidly towards and under an overhead wagon bridge, across which the plaintiff below was driving. There was a verdict and a judgment for the plaintiff, and on error it was urged for reversal, chiefly, that the defendants had been guilty of no negligence in the management of their engine. Affirming the judgment, the court said: \u201cFrom the peculiar conditions surrounding the approach, her view of the track was obstructed until she was well on the bridge, and it was not until she was well on the bridge that she knew of the presence of the engine. All that she could then do was to keep her horse quiet and under control until the engine passed. This she could have done, because of the age of the horse and his gentle disposition, had it not been for the sharp blasts of the whistle, which the engineer recklessly sounded immediately before reaching and while under the bridge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The most noticeable difference between the facts brought out in the Illinois case and in the case under consideration lies in this \u2014 that in the one it is not certain that the engine-driver knew more than tire probable or possible, nearness of travelers, or certain that the engine was in motion, and in the other he did know of the actual presence of one upon the overhead bridge, and the engine was moving rapidly. -</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\"><em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Northern Central and St. Louis Railway Co., </em>100 <em>Tenn. </em>329, 330, 333 (1897). This was an action for damages for blowing, under a highway bridge, the whistle of a passing engine, which frightened the plaintiff\u2019s mules and caused them to run away, throwing him out and injuring him. When the plaintiff\u2019s evidence had been offered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>defendant demurred thereto, and the question of negligence went to the court, which ruled against the plaintiff. On error, in the Supreme Court, it was said, in reversing the lower court: \u201cThat a blowing under a bridge is, in the absence of some special necessity therefor, an unnatural and reckless act, likely to cause great damage. * * * The proof of such a blowing, under such circumstances, is sufficient to authorize a presumption of negligence. The- onus is shifted, to explain and excuse or -justify it, upon him who does it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Similar as these three cases are to the case in hand, it is obvious, when the underlying facts are borne in mind,, that they go even further in imposing legal liability for negligence than we now find it necessary to go-. We- might hesitate to hold that a <em>prima, facie </em>case of negligence- is made out on showing that a whistle was sounded and steam was permitted to escape under a highway bridge while an engine (especially one- drawing a train) was passing along a railroad, and yet be ready to hold negligence or not a question for a jury, in a case'like the present, wherein the proofs might justify a conclusion. that \u2022 the whistle was sounded and steam permitted to escape, suddenly, while an engine* without a train attached, was standing under, or creeping out from under a highway bridge. In the former case, the senses of sight and hearing might warn man and beast of the approach of the engine and train before the whistle was sounded; in the latter, there wo-uld be surprise without warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Clearly, the decisions, of which <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railroad Co., </em>140 <em>Mass. </em>79, 81 (1885), and <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>New York Central Railroad Co., </em>84 <em>Hun </em>412, 415 (1895), are examples, are not inconsistent with the- views which we now entertain. In these- eases the respective defendant companies were held free from liability for negligence because it was shown, either by the plaintiff\u2019s own proofs or by the defendants\u2019, that the \u201cfiring up\u201d and giving out smoke, complained of in the former case, and the blowing of the whistle, complained of in the latter, were acts necessary and lawful under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Furthermore, if the distinction between a moving train and a standing locomotive engine be kept in mind, there is nothing inconsistent with our present views in tire cases of <em>Cincinnati, Indianapolis, St. Louis and, Chicago Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Gaines, </em>101 <em>Ind. </em>526 (1885), criticised in 100 <em>Tenn. </em>(at <em>p. </em>331); <em>Farley </em>v. <em>Harris et al., Receivers, </em>186 <em>Pa. St. </em>440 (1898), and <em>Kelsey </em>v. <em>New York, &amp;c., Railroad Co., </em>181 <em>Mass. </em>64 (1901). It need only he said that these cases all hold that the sounding of the whistle of the locomotive engine of a running train, while crossing a road or street, either above or below the grade thereof, is not of itself negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\"><em>4. </em>Whether we should hold that proof of the sounding of the whistle and the emission of steam, when an engine of a running train is passing under or over a public way, is not evidence of negligence <em>per se, </em>following the three cases above mentioned, or whether we should hold that such proof presents a <em>pirima facie </em>case of negligence, following the case cited from 100 <em>Tenn., </em>is a matter not now before us, and upon it we express no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Suffice it now to say that the proofs in the c\u00e1se under review might support the conclusion that the servant of the defendants, while in charge of a locomotive engine, without cars attached, and standing under or creeping out from under a highway bridge, caused the wdiistle to be sounded and steam to be emitted, suddenly, and without reason, so -far as disclosed by the evidence, and that by or through such act a horse passing over the bridge wras frightened and a traveler suffered serious bodily injury. Wherefore, applying the principles discussed, or either of them, wre hold that a jury question was raised, and that the judgment of nonsuit should be reversed and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b723-7\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 None.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b723-8\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 The Chancellor, Chiee Justice, Garrison, Fort, Garretson, Hendrickson, Pitney, Swayze, Bogkrt, Vredenburgii, Vroom, Green, Gray. 13.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
