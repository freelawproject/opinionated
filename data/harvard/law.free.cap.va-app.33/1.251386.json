Smith (appellee). On appeal, appellant contends the commission erred in: 1) finding appellee\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of her employment and 2) determining that appellee\u2019s medical records proved ongoing temporary total disability. We find that appellee\u2019s injury did not occur in the course of her employment and, thus, we do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>not reach the issue of ongoing temporary total disability. We, therefore, reverse the award of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Appellee was employed by appellant, as a central registration clerk. On December 22, 1997, appellee parked her car on appellant\u2019s premises when she arrived at work. After working her normal shift, she clocked out and walked to her car. She moved her car to an area in front of the emergency room to pick up a colleague, Dr. Wright, who had asked for a ride. Appellee walked into the emergency room to look for Dr. Wright. Dr. Wright was not in the emergency room area, so appellee left a message for him that she was waiting for him outside in her car. As she returned to her car, appellee slipped and fell onto her right knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Initially, appellant contends the issue whether appellee\u2019s injury arose out of her employment was not addressed by either the deputy commissioner or the full commission and should be remanded for determination. We find that the deputy commissioner did address the issue. In a footnote, the deputy commissioner stated, \u201c[W]e do <em>find </em>that the claimant presented sufficient evidence from which to conclude that the claimant slipped and fell due to the wet conditions present in the area due to rain and that <em>the injury therefore arose out of the employment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The deputy commissioner denied appellee\u2019s claim for benefits because he found she did not prove that the accident occurred in the course of her employment. Appellant concedes it did not cross-appeal the \u201carising out of\u2019 issue when appellee sought review by the full commission. The full commission, in its opinion, noted that it did not address whether the injury arose out of appellee\u2019s employment because the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding on the issue was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Rule 3.1 of the Rules of the Commission states, in part, \u201cA request for review of a decision or award of the Commission shall be filed by a party in writing with the Clerk of the Commission within 20 days of the date of such decision or award.\u201d Further, Code \u00a7 65.2-705(0 provides that a party may file an independent application for review fourteen days after an application for review is filed by an opposing party. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-705(C). \u201cDecisions of a deputy commissioner that are not reviewed by the full commission cannot be brought before this Court.\u201d <em>Duncan v. ABF Freight System, Inc., </em>20 Va.App. 418, 422, 457 S.E.2d 424, 426 (1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">In this case, appellant did not request review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s determination that the injury arose out of appellee\u2019s employment within twenty days of the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision. Further, upon receipt of appellee\u2019s request for review by the full commission, appellant did not file an independent request for review within fourteen days. Thus, the commission did not consider the issue, and the issue is not properly before us. The deputy commissioner\u2019s decision that appellee proved the injury arose out of her employment will not be disturbed. We, therefore, review only the commission\u2019s determination that appellee proved the injury occurred in the course of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u201cA finding by the commission that an injury arose out of and in the course of employment is a mixed question of law and fact and is properly reviewable on appeal.\u201d <em>Wetzel\u2019s Painting and Wallpapering v. Price, </em>19 Va.App. 158, 160, 449 S.E.2d 500, 501 (1994) (citing <em>Dublin Garment Co. v. Jones, </em>2 Va.App. 165, 167, 342 S.E.2d 638, 638 (1986)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">In order to receive benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, a claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she suffered an injury by accident that arose out of and in the course of the employment. <em>See County of Chesterfield v. Johnson, </em>237 Va. 180, 183, 376 S.E.2d 73, 74 (1989) (holding that \u201carising out of\u2019 and \u201cin the course of\u2019 are separate and distinct elements).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>Bassett-Walker, Inc. v. Wyatt, </em>26 Va.App. 87, 92, 493 S.E.2d 384, 387 (1997) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cThe claimant can establish that the injury occurred \u2018during the course of the employment by showing that the injury occurred \u2018within the period of employment, at a place where the employee was reasonably expected to be, and while doing something which was reasonably incident to his employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>McFeely Hardwoods &amp; Lumber v. Miller, </em>4 Va.App. 334, 337-38, 358 S.E.2d 178, 179 (1987) (quoting <em>Hercules, Inc. v. Stump, </em>2 Va.App. 77, 79, 341 S.E.2d 394, 395 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">In <em>Brown v. Reed, </em>209 Va. 562, 165 S.E.2d 394 (1969), the Supreme Court of Virginia held that the plaintiffs common law action against the defendant was barred by the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because the accident arose out of and in the course of the parties\u2019 employment. The plaintiff was injured when he was struck by the defendant\u2019s vehicle as he was walking across the employer\u2019s parking lot to punch the time clock, beginning his workday. <em>See Brown, </em>209 Va. at 563, 165 S.E.2d at 395-96. The defendant had completed his shift, showered, and changed his clothes in the company locker room before he struck the plaintiff as he was backing his vehicle out of the employer\u2019s parking lot. <em>See id. </em>The Court held that the common law action was barred because both parties were engaging in behavior anticipated by their employer. <em>See id. </em>at 568, 165 S.E.2d at 399. The Court reasoned that \u201c[tjhere is no such thing as \u2018instantaneous exit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565, 165 S.E.2d at 397. Employees have a reasonable time to exit the employer\u2019s premises, which includes making use of fringe benefits such as showers, locker rooms, and parking lots. <em>See id. </em>at 566, 165 S.E.2d at 397-98. Furthermore, the Court held that the employer benefits by providing and encouraging use of such fringe benefits because they promote good public relations and, in the case of parking lots, reduce absenteeism, promote timely arrival at work, and make employment at the company more attractive. <em>See id. </em>The Court, therefore, held the accident arose under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because both employees were using the employer\u2019s facilities at a time and in a manner encouraged and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>anticipated by the employer; thus, the plaintiffs injury arose out of and in the course of his employment. <em>See id. </em>at 568, 165 S.E.2d at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">In <em>Fouts v. Anderson, </em>219 Va. 666, 250 S.E.2d 746 (1979), the Supreme Court of Virginia held that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act did not bar a common law action based on an accident that occurred in the employer\u2019s parking lot after the plaintiff initially exited the employer\u2019s premises. The plaintiff exited the employer\u2019s parking lot after completing his workday, but, while exiting the lot, he remembered he needed to get a used carburetor from a fellow employee. <em>See Fouts, </em>219 Va. at 668, 250 S.E.2d at 747. He drove down the highway, turned around, and drove back to the employer\u2019s parking lot. <em>See id. </em>The defendant\u2019s car struck the plaintiffs vehicle while the plaintiff was stopped in the employer\u2019s parking lot. <em>See id. </em>The plaintiff argued that his tort action was not barred by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because he returned to the employer\u2019s parking lot on a purely personal mission. <em>See id. </em>The defendant, however, relied on <em>Brown </em>to support his argument that plaintiffs injuries were compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>See id. </em>at 670, 250 S.E.2d at 748. The Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument, distinguishing <em>Brown </em>on the facts. <em>See id. </em>The Court reasoned that there was no causal connection between the plaintiffs injuries and his employment because the plaintiff had successfully exited the parking lot at the completion of his workday. <em>See id. </em>He re-entered the lot on a personal mission, and, thus, incurred the risk of injury. <em>See id. </em>Consequently, he was not using the employer\u2019s parking lot for a purpose anticipated by the employer. Therefore, the accident did not arise out of or in the course of the plaintiffs employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In <em>Briley v. Farm Fresh, Inc., </em>240 Va. 194, 196-99, 396 S.E.2d 835, 836-37 (1990), the Supreme Court of Virginia held that the plaintiffs exclusive remedy was under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because she was injured on the employer\u2019s premises during a \u201c \u2018brief deviation from a direct departure for personal shopping.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff was a cake decorator in the employer\u2019s bakery department. <em>See id. </em>at 196, 396 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>at 886. On the day of the accident, the plaintiff completed her work in the bakery and told a co-worker that she was leaving. <em>See id. </em>She removed her uniform jacket, but instead of exiting the building and going to her car, she decided to do some personal shopping. <em>See id. </em>While shopping, she fell next to the store\u2019s salad bar and was injured. <em>See id. </em>Plaintiff argued she should be permitted to maintain her tort action against the employer because she was not performing work-related duties at the time of the accident and was, instead, a business invitee. <em>See id. </em>at 197, 396 S.E.2d at 836. The Court rejected the plaintiffs argument and held that the plaintiffs injuries were covered under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because the accident occurred on the employer\u2019s premises and \u201cit is to be anticipated that employees of a supermarket would purchase merchandise ... after completing assigned work duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 396 S.E.2d at 837. The Court reasoned that the plaintiffs injuries arose out of and in the course of her employment because \u201cthe plaintiff was injured at a place where she was reasonably expected to be while engaged in an activity reasonably incidental to her employment by [the employer].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><em>Briley </em>merely restates the rule in <em>Brown,. </em>In <em>Brown, </em>the Court held that the plaintiffs injuries were compensable under the Workers\u2019. Compensation Act because they occurred on the employer\u2019s premises and were the result of actions by the employees that were anticipated and were beneficial to the employer. Therefore, the employer incurred the risk for the plaintiffs injuries. In <em>Briley, </em>the Court reasoned that the plaintiffs injuries arose out of and in the course of her employment because the employer\u2019s premises was the situs of the accident and the plaintiff was engaging in anticipated behavior which was beneficial to the employer and reasonably incidental to the employment. The employer, therefore, bore the risk of the plaintiffs injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In this case, appellee successfully exited the hospital at the conclusion of her workday and successfully traversed appellant\u2019s parking lot to her vehicle. Instead of exiting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>premises, she returned to the emergency room entrance to give a ride to a colleague, a personal errand and a personal favor. While the commission held that the appellee was performing an act expected by appellant, we find no evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There was no evidence that appellant encouraged ride-sharing or carpooling or anticipated personal favors by its employees. Furthermore, no evidence in the record proved that appellant benefited from such activities. On the facts of this case, we find that appellant did not bear the risk of appellee\u2019s injuries because the task that she was performing was not during the course of her employment. We, therefore, reverse the commission\u2019s award of benefits to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-11\">. Findings of fact made by the commission are binding on appeal if they are supported by credible evidence. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-706; <em>Armstrong Furniture v. Elder, 4 </em>Va.App. 238, 247, 356 S.E.2d 614, 619 (1987). Finding no evidence in the record to support the commission's conclusion, we are not bound by it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
