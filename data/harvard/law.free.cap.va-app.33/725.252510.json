He contends the trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict him. Concluding the defendant waived the error he now asserts when he pled guilty, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">The defendant was charged with committing murder in the first degree on April 29, 1998. The juvenile and domestic relations district court found probable cause on July 16, 1998, and a grand jury indicted on August 10, 1998. In February 1999, the Commonwealth recognized the trial court would not have jurisdiction under the ruling in <em>Baker v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 306, 313, 504 S.E.2d 394, 398 (1998), because the defendant\u2019s father had not been notified of the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">While the <em>Baker </em>case was pending before the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial court remanded this case to the juvenile court. It gave the required notice, conducted a new preliminary hearing on February 26, 1999, and certified the case to the circuit court. The grand jury indicted on March 1, 1999, and a jury trial commenced on March 5, 1999. After the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Commonwealth presented a part of its evidence, the defendant moved to change his plea. He unconditionally pled guilty to second degree murder pursuant to a plea agreement, agreed that he had thoroughly discussed the plea with his attorney, and acknowledged that he was waiving his right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The defendant contends a violation of Code \u00a7 16.1-277.1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> divested the trial court of jurisdiction to convict him. We conclude Code \u00a7 16.1-277.1 was inapplicable. The defendant was 16 years old and charged with murder. Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> limited the juvenile court to conducting a preliminary hearing and certifying the charge to the grand jury. Once the juvenile court found probable cause and certified the charge, it lost jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-277.1 applies when the juvenile court has authority to adjudicate the matter or decide whether to transfer it for trial under adult procedures. The statute protects juveniles when held in secure detention,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and its remedy is limited to release from detention. In this case, the defendant was transferred to jail after his first preliminary hearing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>was no longer held in juvenile detention. Code \u00a7 16.1-277.1 did not apply while he was in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The indictment cured any error of which the defendant now complains that arose in the juvenile proceedings. \u201cAn indictment in the circuit court cures any error or defect in any proceeding held in the juvenile court except with respect to the juvenile\u2019s age.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1(E). <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 405, 410, 527 S.E.2d 415, 418 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Further, the guilty plea waived any contention that the speedy trial provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-243 were violated. Protections granted by Code \u00a7 19.2-243 may be waived. <em>Stephens v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 224, 230, 301 S.E.2d 22, 25 (1983); <em>Brooks v. Peyton, </em>210 Va. 318, 321, 171 S.E.2d 243, 246 (1969); <em>Butts v. Commonwealth, </em>145 Va. 800, 806, 133 S.E. 764, 766 (1926). A guilty plea waives all objections to non-jurisdictional defects that occurred before the plea. <em>Terry v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 192, 197, 516 S.E.2d 233, 235-36 (1999). <em>(en </em>banc) (violation of right to counsel claim waived by plea); <em>Cardwell v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 563, 566, 507 S.E.2d 625, 627 (1998) (double jeopardy claim barred by plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-13\">.
