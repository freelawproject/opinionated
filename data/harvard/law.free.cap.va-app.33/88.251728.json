On appeal, defendant contends that he cannot be guilty of such offenses because the subject residence was jointly owned by defendant and his wife. He further argues that the court erroneously permitted wife to testify in violation of the marital privilege afforded by Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2. Finding no error, we affirm both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The substantive evidence is uncontroverted. Defendant and wife separated in early 1997, with wife and the infant daughter born to the marriage remaining in the former marital residence, a mobile home, and defendant \u201cstaying\u201d elsewhere, despite joint ownership of the trailer with wife. On December 15, 1997, the Buckingham County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (J &amp; D court) convicted defendant of an assault and battery upon wife and, as a condition of suspending the attendant sentence, ordered \u201cno contact or violence toward her\u201d by defendant. Wife subsequently \u201cswitched the locks\u201d on the trailer and shared keys only with her daughter and mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">During the evening hours of February 21, 1998, defendant telephoned wife \u201cfive or ten times,\u201d threatening \u201cto kill [her].\u201d Following the final call, \u201caround 12:30 a.m.,\u201d wife and child retired for the evening but were soon awakened by the sounds of \u201cpounding\u201d on the \u201cbedroom window\u201d and defendant shouting, \u201copen the m... f... door or I\u2019ll kick it open.\u201d Wife immediately attempted to telephone her mother, a resident of a nearby trailer, but the \u201cline was dead.\u201d Meanwhile, defendant \u201ckicked the door in\u201d and entered the kitchen area of the trailer. Fearful, wife \u201cran by him,\u201d with the child \u201crunning behind,\u201d and escaped to her mother\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">On February 23, 1998, defendant approached wife at her place of employment, \u201cwalked into the lobby\u201d and declared, \u201cyou don\u2019t believe me; I\u2019m going to kill you, and ... left.\u201d At the conclusion of the workday, wife returned to the trailer, accompanied by an acquaintance, Clarence Taylor. When the two entered the residence, defendant, hidden inside and armed with a shotgun, fired the weapon at Taylor and wife, injuring both. Although wounded, Taylor escaped, but defendant \u201cgrabbed\u201d wife, threatening, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d and held her captive for \u201cfour or five hours\u201d before surrendering to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Relying upon the \u201cmarital privilege\u201d established by Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2, defendant unsuccessfully objected at trial to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>wife\u2019s testimony relating to the events of February 21, 1998. Later, at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief and, again, following the presentation of all evidence, defendant moved the court to strike, arguing that, as \u201cowner of this residence\u201d jointly with wife, he could not be convicted of breaking and entering his \u201cown property.\u201d Defendant pursues both theories on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-89 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that, \u201c[i]f any person break and enter the dwelling house of another in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony or any larceny therein, he shall be guilty of burglary ...\u201can offense identical to common law burglary, save that the element of intent is expanded to include intent to commit a larceny.\u201d <em>Rash v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 22, 24, 383 S.E.2d 749, 750 (1989). The dual elements, \u201cdwelling house\u201d and \u201cof another,\u201d \u201cwere essential because common-law burglary found its theoretical basis in the protection of man\u2019s right of habitation,\u201d 2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 8.13(c) (1986), an embodiment of \u201cthe ancient notion that a man\u2019s home was his castle and ... he had the right to feel safe therein.\u201d <em>Rash, </em>9 Va.App. at 25, 383 S.E.2d at 751; <em>see Clarke v. Commonwealth, </em>66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 908 (1874). Thus, \u201cthe term \u2018dwelling house\u2019 in Code \u00a7 18.2-89 means a place which human beings regularly use for sleeping[,]\u201d and the crime was, \u201c \u2018at common law, primarily an offense against the security of [another\u2019s] habitation, and that is still the general conception of it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rash, </em>9 Va.App. at 26, 25, 383 S.E.2d at 751 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-90 and 18.2-91<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> expand traditional burglary to include entry without breaking in the nighttime or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>breaking in the daytime of any dwelling house and \u201cany automobile, truck or trailer, if such ... is used as a dwelling or place of human habitation, with intent to commit murder ...\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-90, \u201cor ... assault and battery ... [.]\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-91; <em>see Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 441, 445, 444 S.E.2d 559, 561-62 (1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In enacting Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-90 and -91, the legislature, therefore, modified the common law to safeguard both conventional dwelling houses and other specified structures, \u201cused as a dwelling or place of human habitation,\u201d from unlawful invasion. <em>Allard v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 57, 64, 480 S.E.2d 139, 142 (1997); <em>see Graybeal v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 736, 739, 324 S.E.2d 698, 699-700 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Defendant contends that the right of habitation protected by both the common law and related burglary statutes is subordinate to title or ownership interests. He asserts that the crime first offends the security of the property owner and, therefore, reasons that \u201ca person cannot break and enter a structure in which he has a proprietary interest.\u201d Defendant\u2019s argument, however, discounts the sanctity of habitation, upending the gravamen of the offense, a view that has been rejected by jurisdictions throughout the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In <em>Commonwealth v. Majeed, </em>548 Pa. 48, 694 A.2d 336 (1997), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania addressed a simi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>lar argument on review of a burglary conviction resulting from Majeed\u2019s forcible entry into a home owned exclusively by him, although occupied solely by his estranged wife and children. The couple had been separated for approximately one year, and a court order prohibited Majeed\u2019s \u201cpresen[ce] on the premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337. In affirming the conviction, the court concluded that \u201can owner of property may relinquish his or her license or privilege to enter\u201d and, therefore, \u201clegal ownership is not synonymous with license or privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338. Finding that \u201cMrs. Majeed and her children, alone, occupied the home,\u201d the court reasoned \u201cthat [Majeed\u2019s] license or privilege to enter the premises had expired.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">A similar rationale persuaded the Court of Appeals of Ohio, in <em>State v. Herrin, </em>6 Ohio App.3d 68, 453 N.E.2d 1104 (1982), to affirm Herrin\u2019s burglary conviction for \u201cblast[ing] his way into the side door\u201d of a home jointly owned with his estranged wife. <em>Id. </em>at 1105. At the time of the offense, defendant was \u201cliving elsewhere,\u201d wife had \u201cchanged the door locks so [Herrin] was unable to get in\u201d and \u201cwas in control and had custody of the premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under such circumstances, \u201c[w]hen [Herrin] forcibly entered the residence without his wife\u2019s permission, ... he committed ... a burglary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1006; <em>see also State v. Singletary, </em>344 N.C. 95, 472 S.E.2d 895, 899 (1996) (estranged husband has no marital or proprietary right to re-enter former family residence exclusively occupied by wife); <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>820 P.2d 819, 821-22 (Okla.Crim.App. 1991) (lawful possession of property, not ownership, is dispositive issue in burglary prosecution); <em>State v. Harold, </em>312 N.C. 787, 325 S.E.2d 219, 222 (1985) (prohibition of burglary protects habitation, not ownership); <em>Knox v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 504, 507, 304 S.E.2d 4, 6 (1983) (husband\u2019s right to consortium with wife is no defense to invasion of her possessory right in property).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Here, wife and daughter enjoyed sole occupancy of the trailer home following the separation of defendant and wife a year prior to the offenses, with defendant continuously residing elsewhere. As a result of subsequent criminal conduct against wife, defendant had been ordered by the J &amp; D court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>to have no contact with her, a restriction that clearly precluded his habitation of the trailer. Thereafter, wife changed the locks in an effort to further keep husband from the premises. Defendant\u2019s return, which resulted in the instant prosecutions, was for criminal purposes, and was attended by violence and forceful entry into the residence. Under such circumstances, defendant\u2019s proprietary interest was relegated to wife\u2019s superior possessory interest and right to exclusive habitation. Thus, defendant\u2019s acts in breaking and entering the home, accompanied by the requisite unlawful intent, offended wife\u2019s right of habitation and constituted burglary in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-90 and -91, notwithstanding his joint ownership of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">At trial, defendant relied upon former Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 to support his claim of marital privilege to preclude wife\u2019s testimony relative to the incident of February 21, 1998. However, the pertinent provision of former Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2, \u201cneither [husband or wife] shall be compelled, nor, without the consent of the other, allowed, to be called as a witness against the other, except\u201d in those instances specified by statute, was amended by the General Assembly in 1996 to delete the language, \u201cnor, without the consent of the other, allowed.\u201d Thus, the legislature \u201celiminated the defendant spouse\u2019s privilege to bar the witness spouse from testifying against the defendant[,]\u201d while preserving in the \u201cwitness spouse ... the privilege\u201d to avoid compelled testimony, subject to certain statutory exceptions. Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Virginia Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 17-12 (4th ed.1999); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2. Here, wife willingly testified, leaving defendant\u2019s argument without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Thus, on the facts before us in this appeal, we find defendant\u2019s conduct violative of both Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-90 and -91 and, further, that wife was properly permitted to present related evidence against him. Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\">.
