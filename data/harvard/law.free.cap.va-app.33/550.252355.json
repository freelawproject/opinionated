On appeal, appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to establish the woman he was convicted of assaulting and battering was a \u201cfamily or household member\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We hold the evidence was sufficient to bring appellant\u2019s victim within the statutory definition, and we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">On March 18, 1999, appellant \u201chit\u201d and \u201csmacked\u201d Yvonne Brickey, \u201cjerked [her] shirt,\u201d and pushed her to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">According to Brickey, appellant was residing with her on the date of the offense, and they had resided together for \u201ca couple months.\u201d Appellant repeatedly told one of the officers who responded to the scene that he and Brickey \u201chad lived together for about three months.\u201d Appellant worked out of town on an intermittent basis and stayed with Brickey \u201coff and on, when [he] would come into town.\u201d Although Brickey testified that appellant sometimes stayed with her and sometimes stayed with his ex-wife, appellant testified that he and his wife were not \u201cliving together\u201d during March 1999 and that some of his furniture was in storage. Brickey said she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>and appellant started living together in this \u201coff and on\u201d fashion \u201ca long time ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Other evidence established that when appellant was in Brickey\u2019s home, she and appellant were \u201cboyfriend and girlfriend,\u201d slept in the same bed and had sexual relations. Although Brickey would not take money appellant offered her for living expenses, appellant bought food and \u201ctried to just help out.\u201d While appellant was at Brickey\u2019s, he stored clothes and other items of personal property there. Brickey\u2019s mother, who lived next door to Brickey, washed appellant\u2019s clothes for him, and appellant used the telephone at Brickey\u2019s mother\u2019s home because Brickey did not have a phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Appellant admitted to staying with Brickey \u201coff and on\u201d but said he did not reside there. He considered the trailer he and his wife owned as his residence during that time but admitted he was not actually living there. He said that most' of the time he was in town, he stayed with his cousin Wanda, but he admitted that both his wife and Brickey also would come to Wanda\u2019s to stay. He denied having a contemporaneous sexual relationship with Brickey but admitted the March 13 altercation arose because Brickey became jealous when her daughter told her appellant had been out with a younger woman. Appellant said Brickey\u2019s daughter, a minor, became angry with him when he asked her and her Mends not to consume alcohol or use illegal drugs in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Appellant' moved to strike at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and again at the close of all the evidence. In denying the motions, the trial court made the following observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">It is the finding of this Court that [appellant] was as much a member of the household where Ms. Brickey resides as he was of any household.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">... [C]ertainly, the intent of the General Assembly in passing this legislation was to cover circumstances such as this where he was residing [in even an] on again and off again relationship with Ms. Brickey----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>The court found, in addition, the evidence was sufficient to prove that appellant assaulted and battered Brickey, a household member, and that he had two previous convictions for the same offense. It convicted him of a Class 6 felony pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The fact finder is not required to believe all aspects of a witness\u2019 testimony; it may accept some parts as believable and reject other parts as implausible. <em>See Pugliese v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 82, 92, 428 S.E.2d 16, 24 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The version of Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2 applicable to these proceedings provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">A. Any person who commits an assault and battery against a family or household member shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">B. On a third or subsequent conviction for assault and battery against a family or household member, where it is alleged in the warrant, information, or indictment on which a person is convicted, that (i) such person has been previously convicted twice of assault and battery against a family or household member ... within ten years of the third or subsequent offense, and ... (ii) each such assault and battery occurred on different dates, such person shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-11\">5k sk sk &amp; sk</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-12\">D. As <em>used in this section, \u201cfamily or household member\u201d means </em>... <em>(vi) any individual who cohabits or who, within the previous twelve months, cohabited with the de</em>fendant____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2 (1995 Repl.Vol. (version effective July 1, 1997)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">What constitutes cohabiting under Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2 is a question of first impression in Virginia. \u201c[W]e construe a statute to promote the end for which it was enacted, if such an interpretation can reasonably be made from the language used.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 533 (1994). \u201cThe plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). \u201cAlthough penal laws are to be construed strictly [against the Commonwealth], they \u2018ought not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intent of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Willis v. Commonwealth, 10 </em>Va.App. 430, 441, 393 S.E.2d 405, 411 (1990) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Our prior consideration of the meaning of the term \u201ccohabitation\u201d has been limited mainly to the civil arena in the context of divorce and spousal support. Interpreting a property settlement agreement in <em>Schweider v. Schweider, </em>243 Va. 245, 415 S.E.2d 135 (1992), the Virginia Supreme Court noted that, \u201c[w]hile engaging in sexual relations is a factor in determining cohabitation, \u2018 \u201cmatrimonial cohabitation\u201d consists of more than sexual relations. It also imports the continuing condition of living together and carrying out the mutual responsibilities of the marital relationship.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248, 415 S.E.2d at 137 (quoting <em>Petachenko v. Petachenko, </em>232 Va. 296, 299, 350 S.E.2d 600, 602 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">We revisited this issue in <em>Frey v. Frey, </em>14 Va.App. 270, 416 S.E.2d 40 (1992), noting that financial support is \u201ca factor which tends to prove the assumption of duties or obligations attendant to marriage\u201d but that \u201cother factors exclusive of support may be sufficient to establish that a relationship is analogous to marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 416 S.E.2d at 43. We acknowledged the holding of the Supreme Court in <em>Schweider </em>that phrases such as \u201ccohabitation, analogous to marriage,\u201d have been \u201cconsistently interpreted ... as encompassing both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>a permanency or continuity and an assumption of marital duties.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Appellant contends these principles are applicable to his conviction for domestic assault and battery and preclude a finding that he cohabited with Brickey because the evidence failed to establish the necessary permanence or any other characteristics of a marital relationship or common law marriage. Although we find <em>Schweider </em>and <em>Frey </em>instructive, we disagree that they control our interpretation of Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2. While we look to these interpretations for guidance, we are not bound by them because \u201c \u2018cohabitation\u2019 takes on different meanings in different contexts.\u201d <em>State v. Yaden, </em>118 Ohio App.3d 410, 692 N.E.2d 1097, 1100 (1997); <em>see also </em>Elizabeth Trainor, Annotation, <em>\u201cCohabitation\u201d For Purposes of Domestic Violence Statutes, </em>71 A.L.R.5th 285, 294 (1999). <em>Compare Colley v. Colley, </em>204 Va. 225, 228-29, 129 S.E.2d 630, 632-33 (1963) (under divorce jurisdiction statute, construing \u201ccohabiting\u201d to mean \u201chaving dwelled together under the same roof with more or less permanency\u201d), <em>with Tarr v. Tarr, </em>184 Va. 443, 448, 35 S.E.2d 401, 403-04 (1945) (in assessing what acts amount to condonation of adultery, construing \u201ccohabiting\u201d to mean \u201csingle voluntary act of sexual intercourse\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">We also seek guidance from the interpretations other courts have given \u201ccohabitation\u201d in the domestic abuse context. These courts acknowledge the obvious conclusion of their legislatures that \u201cassault involving a family or household member deserves further protection than assault on a stranger.\u201d <em>See, e.g. State v. Williams, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 459, 683 N.E.2d 1126, 1129 (1997). In Virginia, the legislature also has concluded that assault on a family or household member is more serious than assault on a stranger. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-57, 18.2-57.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>In surveying the varying definitions of cohabitation in this context, the Ohio Supreme Court noted the prevailing view that \u201cdomestic violence arises out of the nature of the relationship itself, rather than the exact living circumstances of the victim and perpetrator.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>683 N.E.2d at 1129.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">[T]he essential elements of \u201ccohabitation\u201d are (1) sharing of familial or financial responsibilities and (2) consortium. Possible factors establishing shared familial or financial responsibilities might include provisions for shelter, food, clothing, utilities, and/or commingled assets. Factors that might establish consortium include mutual respect, fidelity, affection, society, cooperation, solace, comfort, aid of each other, friendship, and conjugal relations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1130 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Other factors appropriate for consideration include the length and continuity of the relationship. <em>See, e.g., State v. Kellogg, </em>542 N.W.2d 514, 518 (Iowa 1996). Although \u201ca person may have only one legal domicile at one time, ... he may have more than one residence\u201d for purposes of a statute proscribing domestic assault. <em>State v. Archuletta, </em>85 Hawai\u2019i 512, 946 P.2d 620, 622 (Ct.App.1997).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">[A] defendant may cohabit simultaneously with two or more people at different locations, during the same time frame, if he maintains substantial ongoing relationships with each and lives with each for significant periods. A defendant who physically abuses a cohabitant cannot immunize himself from criminal liability merely by living part-time elsewhere with one or more other persons while continuing to reside the rest of the time with the first partner and maintaining a substantial relationship with that person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-9\"><em>People v. Moore, </em>44 Cal.App.4th 1323, 52 Cal.Rptr.2d 256, 264 (1996). The factors to be applied \u201care unique to each ease and how much weight, <em>if any, </em>to give to each of these factors must be decided on a case-by-case basis by the trier of fact.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>Williams, </em>683 N.E.2d at 1130 (emphasis added); <em>see Kellogg, </em>542 N.W.2d at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">In construing Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2 to achieve the obvious intent of the legislature, we apply these same factors to a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis in appellant\u2019s case. Under this analysis, we hold the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant and Brickey cohabited as that term is used in Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2. Under the first prong of the Ohio. Supreme Court\u2019s test, the sharing of familial or financial responsibilities, the evidence established that appellant desired to contribute money to cover a portion of Brickey\u2019s household expenses and gave her grocery money whenever he stayed at the residence. Brickey\u2019s mother, who lived next door, washed appellant\u2019s laundry and allowed appellant to use her phone. Appellant also felt comfortable enough in Brickey\u2019s home to ask her daughter, a minor, not to consume alcohol or illegal drugs in Brickey\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Under the second prong, consortium, the evidence supported a finding that Brickey and appellant slept in the same bed and had a sexual relationship. Although appellant insisted their relationship was platonic, he admitted they were very close and said they fought because Brickey thought he had been out with a younger woman and became jealous.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Finally, in addressing the duration, continuity and permanency of the relationship, as the holdings in <em>Schweider </em>and <em>Frey </em>suggest we should, <em>see also Kellogg, </em>542 N.W.2d at 518, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, supported a finding that appellant had resided with Brickey continuously for three months prior to March 13, 1999 and that he had stayed with her sporadically before that for \u201ca long time,\u201d as well. Although appellant said he remained married to another woman, he reported that some of his furniture was in storage and that he was not living with his wife during that period of time. Based on this evidence, the trial court concluded that appellant \u201cwas as much a member of the [victim\u2019s] household ... as he was of any household\u201d and that this was sufficient to establish cohabitation under Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>\u00a7 18.2-57.2. We agree and hold the fact that appellant sometimes worked out of town and may periodically have stayed elsewhere when in town did not preclude a finding that he cohabited with Brickey. <em>See Archuletta, </em>946 P.2d at 622. The evidence supported the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that appellant maintained a \u201csubstantial ongoing relationship[ ]\u201d with Briekey during this period of time. <em>Moore, </em>52 Cal.Rptr.2d at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">For these reasons, we hold the evidence of cohabitation was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2. Therefore, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\">. Although the first and second offenses of assault and battery of a family or household member are punished as Class 1 misdemeanors in Virginia \u2014 the same punishment imposed for assault and battery on a non-family member who does not belong to any other special class \u2014 a third offense for assault and battery of a family or household member <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>within ten years is subject to heightened punishment as a Class 6 felony. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-57, 18.2-57.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
