On appeal, Pughsley contends the trial court erred by permitting the Commonwealth to introduce during the sentencing phase of the trial prejudicial rebuttal evidence, consisting of unadjudicated criminal behavior and other specific bad acts and institutional infractions while in juvenile detention. He contends the Commonwealth\u2019s rebuttal evidence should have been limited to rebutting the specific character evidence to which his witnesses testified and limited to the time period about which they testified. We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">David Robertson, the victim, and Larry Clingempeel, Robertson\u2019s Mend who had been riding with him in Robertson\u2019s car, encountered Pughsley and his Mend, \u201cNugget,\u201d at a convenience store where Robertson had stopped to purchase gas and beer. Robertson and Pughsley were not strangers to one another, allegedly having been involved in a prior drug transaction. Pughsley and Nugget entered Robertson\u2019s vehicle, with Robertson driving, Clingempeel in the front passenger\u2019s seat, Pughsley sitting behind Robertson, and Nugget sitting behind Clingempeel. Pughsley directed Robertson to drive to a specified location where Pughsley and Nugget exited the vehicle and went into a nearby house. After returning, Pughsley stood by the driver\u2019s side door, while Nugget stood beside the passenger door. According to Clingempeel, an argument or some disagreement over a drag deal occurred and Pughsley shot Robertson in the left side of his neck, killing him as he sat in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The jury convicted Pughsley of second degree murder, use of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and shooting into an occupied vehicle. At the sentencing phase, the Commonwealth introduced evidence of Pughsley\u2019s twelve prior juvenile convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In rebuttal and in mitigation of punishment, Pughsley introduced testimony from his mother, father, sister, grandfather, and the mother of a Mend. Pughsley\u2019s mother testified that when Pughsley was five years old, she left him and his father and moved to Maryland. Pughsley\u2019s mother also testified about her knowledge of Pughsley\u2019s prior convictions. Pughsley\u2019s grandfather testified that Pughsley is \u201csmart\u201d and a \u201creal fine person\u201d and that he is \u201csorry\u201d about and \u201cregretted\u201d the offense. On cross-examination, Pughsley\u2019s grandfather admitted he was unaware of many of Pughsley\u2019s juvenile convictions. Pughsley\u2019s sister testified that she had a \u201cclose\u201d relationship with her brother. Cynthia Sales, the mother of one of Pughsley\u2019s Mends, testified that Pughsley lived with her and her son for approximately one year. Sales described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Pughsley as a \u201csweet person, real respectable.\u201d Sales testified that Pughsley feels \u201creally bad\u201d about the shooting and that \u201c[i]f he could change it all he would.\u201d Pughsley\u2019s father testified that Pughsley was a \u201cvery intelligent and caring person\u201d and that the situation \u201creally hurt [Pughsley] a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In rebuttal, the Commonwealth introduced evidence to rebut Pughsley\u2019s character evidence by showing the specific circumstances surrounding several of the prior juvenile offenses and by proving facts of unadjudicated criminal behavior and other bad acts and institutional infractions while Pughsley was confined in juvenile detention. First, the Commonwealth introduced, without objection, testimony from two law enforcement officers substantiating the circumstances surrounding Pughsley\u2019s previous convictions and testimony from Pughsley\u2019s probation officer concerning Pughsley\u2019s criminal history and probation violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Next, over defendant\u2019s objection, the Commonwealth introduced the testimony of Frank Currier, Director of the Lynch-burg Juvenile Detention Center, who testified about Pughsley\u2019s behavior on the four occasions Pughsley was detained at the center. On each occasion, Pughsley\u2019s behavior at the detention center was marked by \u201cintimidation of the staff and youth,\u201d \u201ccoercion,\u201d threats toward the staff, disrespect of the staff and volunteers, including name calling, using profanity, having a negative attitude, and failing to follow directions. Currier testified that on one occasion, Pughsley had threatened the staff and he had to be physically restrained. Currier further testified that on another occasion, Pughsley \u201chad gotten out of control, started kicking and throwing chairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The Commonwealth also introduced, over defendant\u2019s objection, the testimony of Andre Parrish. Parrish testified that, on one occasion, he, Pughsley, and three other people stopped at a convenience store. While inside, Pughsley pulled out and brandished a .25 caliber semiautomatic pistol, waving it in a threatening manner in front of the cashier merely because she \u201clooked\u201d at him. Parrish said they forcibly removed Pughsley from the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Pughsley concedes the evidence is sufficient to support the convictions. He argues only that the trial court erred in permitting the Commonwealth to introduce prejudicial rebuttal evidence and evidence that went beyond and did not specifically rebut his witnesses\u2019 character evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 provides that after a defendant is found guilty of a non-capital felony, \u201ca separate proceeding limited to the ascertainment of punishment shall be held.\u201d At the sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth \u201cshall\u201d present evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions. \u201cAfter the Commonwealth has introduced such evidence of prior convictions, or if no such evidence is introduced, the defendant may introduce relevant, admissible evidence related to punishment. Nothing in ... [the statute] shall prevent the Commonwealth or the defendant from introducing relevant, admissible evidence in rebuttal.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. However, \u201cthis is not a one-way street extending only in the defendant\u2019s direction. The statute also permits the Commonwealth to introduce \u2018relevant, admissible evidence in rebuttal\u2019 to that offered by the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Shifflett, </em>257 Va. 34, 43-44, 510 S.E.2d 232, 236 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">On review, we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding the admissibility of evidence absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 44, 510 S.E.2d at 236. \u201cEvidence which \u2018tends to cast any light upon the subject of the inquiry5 is relevant.\u201d <em>Cash v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 506, 510, 364 S.E.2d 769, 771 (1988) (quoting <em>McNeir v. Greer-Hale Chinchilla Ranch, </em>194 Va. 623, 629, 74 S.E.2d 165, 169 (1953)). Evidence which tends to prove a material fact is relevant and admissible, \u201c \u2018unless excluded by a specific rule or policy consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Evans v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 118, 122, 415 S.E.2d 851, 853-54 (1992) (quoting <em>Cash, </em>5 Va.App. at 510, 364 S.E.2d at 771).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">In the guilt phase of a trial, \u201c[i]t is ... firmly established that \u2018[t]he Commonwealth is not permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>introduce evidence of the [accused\u2019s] bad character unless the accused has first offered evidence of his good character, thus placing his character into issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Irving v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 178, 183, 422 S.E.2d 471, 475 (1992) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Fields v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 300, 305-06, 343 S.E.2d 379, 382 (1986)). A defendant may, however, place his character in issue by testifying as to his character, <em>see generally Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 675, 187 S.E.2d 191 (1972) <em>(per curiam), </em>or by introducing witnesses to testify as to his good character, <em>see Gravely v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 560, 414 S.E.2d 190 (1992). Although, as a general rule, the Commonwealth may not rebut character evidence by proving specific acts of misconduct, other than by cross-examining the defendant\u2019s character witnesses as to then-knowledge of those acts, <em>see Land v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 223, 225-26, 176 S.E.2d 586, 588 (1970), the Supreme Court has uniformly held that even in the guilt phase of a trial where a defendant attempts to present evidence regarding his good character or history, which may mislead the fact finder, the Commonwealth is entitled to rebut the false impression and misleading evidence, <em>see Roy v. Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 722, 726-28, 62 S.E.2d 902, 903-04 (1951); <em>Locke v. Commonwealth, </em>149 Va. 447, 451-52, 141 S.E. 118, 120 (1928); <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>129 Va. 751, 753-54, 105 S.E. 541, 542 (1921); <em>see also Lockhart v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 184, 466 S.E.2d 740 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, the provision governing the bifurcated sentencing proceeding, goes beyond the common law rule of evidence, which disallows proof of a defendant\u2019s specific bad acts to rebut the defendant\u2019s character evidence. The Supreme Court has made clear that Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, which allows a defendant to introduce relevant evidence of his \u201chistory and background\u201d in a sentencing procedure, also allows the Commonwealth to introduce rebuttal evidence once the defendant has undertaken to put his history and background in issue. <em>See Shifflett, </em>257 Va. at 43-44, 510 S.E.2d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>We hold that where a defendant puts on evidence that he has been of good character or has a \u201chistory and background\u201d of being a good, law-abiding, caring, or remorseful person, the Commonwealth may, subject to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion, introduce evidence of specific acts in the defendant\u2019s \u201chistory and background\u201d which rebuts the defendant\u2019s contention or proves that the defendant has a history or background of criminal or bad acts or is not of good character. Prior to adopting a bifurcated sentencing proceeding in non-capital felony jury trials, only circuit judges could consider a defendant\u2019s prior history or background through a pre-sentence report. Now, however, with the bifurcated sentencing proceeding for non-capital felony convictions, a jury is entitled to consider a person\u2019s prior history and background, provided the defendant elects to make it an issue. Once the defendant has offered proof of his character, history, or background, the Commonwealth is entitled to prove, subject to the sound discretion of the trial judge, that the defendant has a history of misconduct different from the picture he or she has painted.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Here, Pughsley presented evidence of his good character. Several witnesses testified that Pughsley is a \u201csweet,\u201d \u201ccaring,\u201d \u201creal fine,\u201d \u201cvery intelligent,\u201d and \u201crespectable\u201d person, who is remorseful for the crimes he has committed. Currier\u2019s testimony that Pughsley, while confined at the juvenile detention center, repeatedly intimidated and threatened staff and other detainees was offered to rebut Pughsley\u2019s evidence of his good character and pleasant disposition. Currier also testified that Pughsley was not only disrespectful of the staff, but he was, at times, violent. Further, Parrish\u2019s testimony that Pughsley brandished a firearm in front of a store clerk because she \u201clooked\u201d at him rebuts Pughsley\u2019s evidence that he is a sweet and caring, non-threatening and non-violent person. The Commonwealth was permitted to rebut Pughsley\u2019s evidence of good character and to correct the false impression Pughsley may have given the jury about his character. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the Commonwealth\u2019s rebuttal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>As to Pughsley\u2019s claim that the trial court erred by admitting the testimony of the law enforcement officers and Pughsley\u2019s probation officer, that evidence was admitted without objection. Accordingly, Pughsley is precluded from challenging the admissibility of that testimony on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
