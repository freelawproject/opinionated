In adjudicating the cause, the court classified the former marital home of the parties and husband\u2019s \"disability retirement\u201d as marital property, apportioned certain marital debt, awarded husband retroactive child support from wife, and denied his claim to spousal support. On appeal, husband complains the court erroneously (1) \u201cfail[ed] to recognize [his] separate property component in ... the marital home\u201d; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>awarded wife a percentage of his \u201cdisability pay\u201d; (3) failed to allocate responsibility for a marital debt incurred by him; and (4) denied spousal support. Wife challenges retroactivity of the child support award. Finding no error, we affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The parties were married August 26,1984, and separated on July 20, 1997. Prior to the separation, husband filed a bill of complaint with the trial court, seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>divorce, temporary and permanent custody of the child born to the marriage, child and spousal support from wife, and a determination of the respective property interests pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3. Wife\u2019s responsive pleadings sought similar relief. The court thereafter conducted several protracted hearings, resulting in a voluminous record that embraced an array of issues, much of which is irrelevant to our determination of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">At the time of marriage, both husband and wife were gainfully employed and financially independent. Wife had earned a B.A. degree and husband a B.S. in civil engineering and masters degrees in Social Planning and City Planning. Wife then resided in a local apartment complex and husband occupied a home in Arlington, acquired by him before the marriage. At the inception of the marriage, the couple relocated to an apartment in Crystal City, and husband rented his former residence to others. Within a short time, however, they returned to husband\u2019s Arlington residence and together undertook extensive repairs and renovations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Intending to purchase a marital home with wife, husband sold his Arlington residence in 1986, depositing $66,000 from the net proceeds into the parties\u2019 joint checking account. On March 24, 1987, husband and wife contracted to purchase a new home, which required a $5,000 \u201cdown payment\u201d and an additional $41,709.55 at closing, on July 24, 1987, all of which was drawn from the joint account. The evidence does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>disclose deposits or withdrawals or continuing balances with respect to such account for the period preceding settlement on the new residence. However, \u201cpaychecks,\u201d expenditures, \u201ceverything,\u201d attributable to both parties were routinely deposited into and withdrawn from the joint account both before and after receipt of the proceeds from the sale of husband\u2019s residence into the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">During these years of marriage, the parties successfully pursued respective employment opportunities, each contributing both economically and otherwise to the marital partnership. On April 17, 1989, a son, Armun Jonathan Asgari, was born to the union, and the couple shared the attendant responsibilities, while maintaining employment, until husband was seriously injured in an automobile accident on January 5,1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Following the accident, which occurred while husband was acting in the course of employment as an engineer with the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), husband claimed permanent total disability and pursued both workers\u2019 compensation benefits and disability retirement from VDOT and an independent tort claim for \u201cpain and suffering, medical expenses and lost wages.\u201d Husband was \u201cimmediately\u201d awarded biweekly workers\u2019 compensation benefits of $941.14, a sum equaling 66.66% of his VDOT salary, for 500 weeks, in addition to the payment of all accident-related medical expenses. Later, on April 11, 1994, the Virginia Retirement System (VRS) approved husband\u2019s \u201capplication for disability retirement,\u201d resulting in an initial \u201cBasic Benefit\u201d of $2,084 per month, subject to a temporary offset for the workers\u2019 compensation award. The tort claim, settled for $300,000, provided $136,000 net to husband, after satisfaction of attendant obligations, fees and expenses, including a workers\u2019 compensation lien of $68,095.72.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">VRS documentation relating to husband\u2019s disability claim specifically referenced the \u201cRetirement Benefit\u201d as \u201cLine of Duty Disability Retirement,\u201d based upon weighted \u201cService: 17 years 10 months\u201d and a computation \u201cus[ing] salaries earned in the 60 months ... prior to ... retirement date,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u201cEffective: 7/1/94\u201d at an age of \u201c43 years 3 months.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Husband was further advised of his entitlement \u201cto receive a refund of accumulated contributions and interest in the [VES],\u201d $14,085.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The effects of the accident brought immediate and lasting changes to the household. Husband, no longer employed, assumed a significantly greater responsibility for child rearing, while wife, then age thirty-three and in good health, maintained employment as a jewelry consultant with Neiman Marcus. Understandably, wife\u2019s responsibilities \u201cgot a lot more\u201d as she alone assumed numerous tasks about the household, including \u201cgrocery shopping,\u201d \u201claundry,\u201d transportation needs and financial management, in addition to caring for husband. Despite husband\u2019s continuing disability benefits and wife\u2019s average annual income of approximately $76,462.89, the family incurred substantial credit card and consumer debt, which totaled approximately $70,000 at the time of the hearing, exclusive of a $25,000 balance on a personal loan to husband from another.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Husband testified that he remained totally disabled at the time of the hearing, a circumstance corroborated by successive annual reviews by VES and the testimony of his treating physician, Dr. Howard Hite. Husband insisted he \u201ccan\u2019t work\u201d as a result of intermittent severe pain and related physical limitations, including an inability to sit, stand or lift within normal limits, and the need for a multitude of prescription medications. However, wife\u2019s evidence established that husband often engaged in physical activities, including basketball, hunting, swimming, tennis and extended travel, both overseas and domestic. She recalled husband admitted that he had \u201cno pain,\u201d no need for medication, and was \u201cfaking\u201d disability to retain benefits. Much of wife\u2019s testimony was corroborated by independent witnesses and other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>At the hearing below, each party presented extensive economic evidence reflecting their respective needs and resources. Husband\u2019s monthly disability and workers\u2019 compensation benefits then aggregated $2,256, while his regular expenses for a like period totaled approximately $7,000, including a $2,038 mortgage payment on the marital home and an assortment of increased costs attributable to the child, then in his care. Similarly, wife reported a $4,421 monthly income shortfall, despite net earnings of $5,193. Noteworthy expenses reportedly incurred each month by wife included $1,800 for \u201cFurniture/Furnishings,\u201d $1,257 \u201cLegal Expenses,\u201d and $1,154 on \u201cCharge Account Debt\u201d of $88,346.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Immediately upon the conclusion of the evidentiary hearings, the trial court decided the substantial issues, save the determination of child support, orally announcing seriatim the rulings, with no objections then noted by either party.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequent motions, apparently later argued before the trial court, focused on the retroactivity of the child support award. The final decree, entered several months following the last evidentiary hearing, determined a host of questions, including the limited issues pertinent to the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">RETROACTIVE CHILD SUPPORT</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The trial court awarded husband $664 per month child support from wife, \u201cretroactive to October 1,1997 ... the date [he] filed [a] pendente lite petition for child support,\u201d reciting simply that the child \u201clives with the father,\u201d without otherwise addressing custody. Wife, thereafter, objected to the retroactivity of the award by motion filed with the court, contending, in pertinent part, that husband withdrew his claim for child support prior to the evidentiary hearings. No transcripts of hearings relative to wife\u2019s motion are a part of the record before this Court. Later, above her endorsement to the final decree, wife again excepted to \u201cthe court\u2019s ruling of retroactive child support and the retroactive date the court chose.\u201d On appeal, she argues that the retroactivity ruling was error, \u201cwhere procedurally the motion for child support had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>withdrawn,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> adding, for the first time, \u201cand where [husband\u2019s] financial resources were vastly different in 1997 and 1998 than at the date of trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In support of her contention that husband withdrew his prayer for retroactive child support, wife asserts that continuances or \u201cremovals\u201d of two hearings scheduled on husband\u2019s motion for <em>pendente lite </em>relief constituted an abandonment of the claim. Wife further complains, citing no authority, that husband\u2019s failure to pursue a hearing resulted in an inequitable \u201ccreat[ion] of an arrearage beyond [her] control,\u201d \u201cnot the intended use for retroactive [child] support.\u201d Her arguments are belied by the record and contrary to statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B) provides that \u201c[l]iability for [child] support shall be determined retroactively ... from the date that the proceeding was commenced by the filing of an action with the court.\u201d Here, husband commenced an action for child support at the inception of the instant cause, praying for such relief in the bill of complaint. Husband\u2019s subsequent motion for a <em>pendente lite </em>award, together with related scheduling events, did nothing to displace the underlying claim. Thus, an award of retroactive support clearly complied with statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">In adjudicating the numerous property interests of the parties pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3, the court declared husband\u2019s disability retirement and the jointly titled residence to be marital property<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and did not apportion a debt of husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>to another, allegedly incurred to reduce marital debt. Husband first argues that the VRS disability benefit was an award intended \u201cto make an injured employee \u2018whole,\u2019 \u201d distinguishable from the \u201cextra\u201d benefit of retirement \u201cearned as a result of longevity.\u201d Husband does not dispute the \u201cpropriety\u201d of the instant award, if the subject benefit constitutes \u201c \u2018retirement benefits\u2019 \u201d contemplated by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G) empowers the court to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF7\">direct payment of a percentage of the marital share of <em>any </em>pension ... or retirement benefits, whether vested or non-vested, which constitutes marital property and whether payable in a lump sum or over a period of time---- \u201cMarital share\u201d means that portion of the total interest, the right to which was earned during the marriage and before the last separation of the parties____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">(Emphasis added); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(b). In enacting Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(b) and companion Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G), the legislature clearly \u201cintended all pensions ... to be personal property and subject to equitable distribution.\u201d <em>Sawyer v. Sawyer, </em>1 Va.App. 75, 78, 335 S.E.2d 277, 280 (1985). \u201cA pension, by definition, is \u2018a retirement benefit paid regularly, with the amount of such based generally on length of employment and amount of wages or salary of pensioner. It is deferred compensation for services rendered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Banagan v. Banagan, </em>17 Va.App. 321, 324, 437 S.E.2d 229, 230-31 (1993) (citation omitted). Clearly, the \u201call inclusive language of ... \u00a7 20-107.3(G) permitting the court to direct payment of a percentage of the marital share of <em>\u2018any </em>pension\u2019 \u201d does not suggest the exclusion of \u201cdisability pensions\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> from the statutory scheme. Peter N. Swisher et al., <em>Virginia Family Law </em>\u00a7 11-17, at 451 (2nd ed. 1997) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Here, the record establishes that husband\u2019s disability award constituted a VRS retirement benefit contemplated by the statutory VRS plan, which expressly permitted \u201c[a]ny mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>ber ... [to] retire for disability\u201d upon specified terms and conditions. Code \u00a7 51.1-156. Accordingly, all related documentation referenced the benefit as a \u201cRetirement Benefit,\u201d \u201cDisability Retirement,\u201d or like characterization, including a designated \u201cretirement date.\u201d The resulting benefit received by husband, a function of his employment service, average wages and age, was earned and accrued during the marriage. Thus, governed by the clear statutory scheme and particulars of the subject award to husband, the court correctly distributed the benefit as a \u201cpension\u201d or \u201cretirement benefit\u201d within the intendment of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Husband next complains that the trial court, in declaring the jointly titled home of the parties marital property, ignored the $46,709.55 contribution of his separate property to the acquisition costs. Husband argues that the deposit of $66,000 derived from the sale of his former home, clearly separate property, into the parties\u2019 joint checking account, later withdrawn to partially fund purchase of the new residence, adequately traced such separate funds into the property. However, husband\u2019s argument is without sufficient support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3) recognizes the concept of \u201cproperty ... part marital and part separate,\u201d hybrid property. <em>See Rahbaran v. Rahbaran, </em>26 Va.App. 195, 205, 494 S.E.2d 135, 140 (1997). The statute \u201cpresupposes that separate property has not been segregated but, rather, combined with marital property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207, 494 S.E.2d at 141. When such interests are commingled through the contribution of one to another,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">resulting in the loss of identity of the contributed property, the classification of the contributed property shall be transmuted to the category of property receiving the contribution. However, to the extent the contributed property is retraceable by a preponderance of the evidence ..., such contributed property shall retain its original classification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARy\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\u201cIn order to trace the separate portion of hybrid property, <em>a party must prove </em>that the claimed separate portion is identifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>ably derived from a separate asset.\u201d <em>Rahbaran, </em>26 Va.App. at 208, 494 S.E.2d at 141 (emphasis added). \u201cWhether a transmuted asset can be traced back to a separate property interest is determined by the circumstances of each case\u201d and \u201cthe trial court\u2019s award ... will not be reversed \u2018unless it appears from the record that the chancellor ... abused his discretion, ... has not considered or has misapplied [a] statutory mandate[ ], or ... the evidence fails to support the findings of fact____\u2019\u201d <em>von Raab v. von Raab, </em>26 Va.App. 239, 248, 246, 494 S.E.2d 156, 160, 159 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Here, assuming, without deciding, husband deposited his separate funds into a joint checking account with wife, commingling separate and marital assets, unspecified sums of marital funds were thereafter deposited and withdrawn from the account, the balance regularly ebbing and flowing for months. Thus, when the parties withdrew from the account those monies necessary to acquire the marital home, the identity of husband\u2019s separate funds had been lost in countless unspecified transactions involving marital funds, resulting in the irreversible transmutation of separate into marital property. Under such circumstances, the court was unable to properly trace and preserve the integrity of husband\u2019s separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">In husband\u2019s final challenge to the trial court\u2019s decree of equitable distribution, he assails the court\u2019s failure to allocate, pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C), \u201ca $25,000 loan incurred by [him] to pay marital credit card debts.\u201d Husband testified that he \u201cborrowed $50,000 cash from [a] Mr. Jahander,\u201d interest free, received as \u201ccash in a bag.\u201d Husband contends that such loan, dating from \u201clate \u2014 1996,\u201d was applied to marital debt and \u201cpaid down to approximately $25,000 by the time of trial.\u201d However, husband\u2019s counsel advised the court, during the evidentiary hearing, that he was \u201cnot asking for any of the Jahander loans back.\u201d Husband will not be permitted to approbate and reprobate, ascribing error to an act by the trial court that comported with his representations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>See Manns v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 677, 679-80, 414 S.E.2d 613, 615 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">SPOUSAL SUPPORT</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Lastly, husband contends the trial court erroneously denied him spousal support from wife.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Husband maintains that physical and emotional disabilities render him unable to secure gainful employment, causing severe economic hardship, including a reduced standard of living and significant indebtedness. In contrast, he points to wife\u2019s gainful employment and good health, with consistent and substantial earnings in recent years. Husband, therefore, asserts that the evidence demonstrates his compelling \u201cneed,\u201d together with wife\u2019s ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u201cThe determination whether a spouse is entitled to support, and if so how much, is a matter within the discretion of the court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is clear that some injustice has been done.\u201d <em>Dukelow v. Dukelow, 2 </em>Va.App. 21, 27, 341 S.E.2d 208, 211 (1986) (citations omitted). However, the trial court\u2019s discretion must not be exercised without reference to Code \u00a7 20-107.1, which \u201ccommands that, in order to exercise its discretion, \u2018[t]he court shall ... consider\u2019 the specific factors contained therein. Failure to do so is reversible error.\u201d <em>Bristow v. Bristow, </em>221 Va. 1, 3, 267 S.E.2d 89, 90 (1980) (citation omitted). In reviewing the disputed decision, \u201c[w]e assume that the [court] followed the statutory mandate,\u201d and the trial judge need not assign a weight to each among the several factors, provided related evidence is before the court. <em>McGinnis v. McGinnis, </em>1 Va.App. 272, 277, 338 S.E.2d 159, 161 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Without undertaking to again recite the abundance of evidence relevant to the requisite statutory considerations, we find sufficient support in the record for the court\u2019s decision and, clearly, no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"AqY\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\">.
