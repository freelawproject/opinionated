Waiters of three counts of distribution of marijuana in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1(a)(2). It sentenced the defendant to two years incarceration, suspended all but ninety days in jail, placed the defendant on probation, and ordered drug treatment. As a condition of the suspended sentence, the trial court ordered restitution of $1,900 to the Fairfax County Police Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>ment. The defendant objected to paying restitution. We conclude the trial court had authority to order the restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The defendant sold marijuana to a Fairfax County Police Department undercover detective on three separate occasions. The total paid to the defendant by the police was $1,900. The defendant pled guilty to each offense and stipulated the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The defendant contends that Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-303 and 19.2-305<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> limit the authority of the trial court to ordering restitution to an \u201caggrieved party\u201d for \u201cdamages or loss\u201d only. He argues the police department was not an aggrieved party and the money used to buy drugs from the defendant was not a damage or loss. We need not address whether the trial court\u2019s action fit within the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-303 relating specifically to restitution because the specific provisions of that statute do not restrict the general authority of a trial court under the first clause of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The first clause of Code \u00a7 19.2-303 gives broad power to the trial court to determine the conditions of a suspended sentence. Sentencing statutes \u201cconfer upon trial courts Vide latitude\u2019 and much \u2018discretion in matters of suspension and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>probation ... to provide a remedial tool ... in the rehabilitation of criminals\u2019 and, to that end, \u2018should be liberally construed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Deal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 157, 160, 421 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1992) (citations omitted). The clauses that have been added to the original enactment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> have not been interpreted as limiting or restricting the original statement of the court\u2019s broad powers. <em>Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va. App. 252, 256, 450 S.E.2d 765, 767 (1994). \u201cSentencing statutes are to be liberally construed to give the trial court broad discretion.\u201d <em>Bazemore v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 466, 468, 489 S.E.2d 254, 255 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">\u201cCode \u00a7 19.2-303 empowers a trial court to place conditions on a suspended sentence. The sole statutory limitation placed upon a trial court\u2019s discretion in its determination of such conditions is one of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>256 Va. 580, 585, 507 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1998) (citation omitted). The limitation on the discretion of the trial court is that the conditions of suspension \u201cmust be reasonable, in relation to the nature of the offense, the background of the offender and the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Deal, </em>15 Va. App. at 161, 421 S.E.2d at 899 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The condition the trial court created was reasonable and an appropriate exercise of its discretion. It ordered the return of the exact sum the undercover agent had paid the defendant for illegal drugs. At a minimum, the requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>prevented the defendant from profiting from the crime he committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">The defendant asserts that the police cannot receive restitution because they participated in an illegal act by purchasing drugs from the defendant. A party to an illegal act cannot recover for damages resulting from the act. However, this argument ignores the obvious the police were acting lawfully when they purchased the marijuana from the defendant. Code \u00a7 18.2-258.1(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Ordering the defendant to repay the sums he received from his sale of drugs to the police was a proper exercise of judicial discretion under Code \u00a7 19.2-308. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\">.
