On appeal, appellant contends the trial court committed reversible error by (1) denying her proffered instruction regarding the elements of the felony murder rule, (2) overruling her exceptions to the Commonwealth\u2019s proffered instructions nine through twelve, (3) ruling that if the evidence was sufficient to find that she was a part of the abduction then she was responsible for everything which occurred during the abduction, and (4) finding sufficient evidence to support the conviction of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Appellant, Sean Harris, William Harris, and the victim were neighbors and all used illegal narcotics. The victim accused appellant of taking cocaine from Sean Harris\u2019 room. The victim, along with Sean and William Harris, went to appellant\u2019s room to confront her. During a heated conversation, appellant hit the victim and he fell to the floor. Appellant then instructed Sean Harris, William Harris, Chilief Brisbon and Taryl Barnes to beat the victim. The victim was moved to another room and beaten, as appellant had instructed. Appellant entered the room after the victim was bound and gagged. Barnes said, \u201cJust take the [victim] somewhere and leave him, don\u2019t kill him.\u201d Appellant next said, \u201cGet rid of him\u201d and, according to Sean Harris, appellant made a motion with her index finger across her throat in a slicing fashion. William Harris testified that appellant\u2019s gesture was a sweeping arm motion. Sean and William Harris testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>appellant\u2019s words, along with her hand motion, meant that she wanted the victim killed. Sean Harris, William Harris and Brisbon put the victim in the trunk of a car, drove to a remote location where Sean Harris shot the victim. Sean Harris testified that appellant was \u201cthe boss\u201d and he was carrying out her order to kill the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">ABDUCTION AND FELONY MURDER ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Appellant argues that the evidence failed to prove that she was sufficiently implicated in the abduction to support criminal responsibility for the attendant acts, including the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-32, felony murder is a killing \u201cin the commission of, or attempt to commit, arson, rape, forcible sodomy, inanimate or animate object sexual penetration, robbery, burglary or abduction, except as provided in \u00a7 18.2-31....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The crime of abduction requires proof of an asportation or detention by force, intimidation or deception. <em>See Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 519, 526, 323 S.E.2d 572, 576 (1984). \u201cAbduction is a continuing offense.\u201d <em>Berkeley v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 279, 286, 451 S.E.2d 41, 44 (1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">An accessory before the fact is an individual who must \u201cknow or have reason to know of the principal\u2019s criminal intention and must intend to encourage, incite, or aid the principal\u2019s commission of the crime.\u201d <em>McGhee v. Commonwealth, 221 </em>Va. 422, 427, 270 S.E.2d 729, 732 (1980) (citation omitted). \u201cThe amount of incitement or encouragement to commit the crime is irrelevant if the encouragement in fact induces the principal to commit the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427, 270 S.E.2d at 732-33 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">\u201cA principal in the second degree is one not the perpetrator, but present, aiding and abetting the act done, or keeping watch or guard at some convenient distance.\u201d <em>Rollston v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 535, 539, 399 S.E.2d 823, 825 (1991) (citation omitted). \u201cAs for what constitutes \u2018aiding and abetting,\u2019 ... [i]t must be shown that the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>procured, encouraged, countenanced, or approved commission of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The evidence proved that after the victim accused appellant of stealing cocaine, appellant hit the victim and knocked him to the ground. Appellant then instructed the other men to move the victim from her room and beat him. After the victim was severely beaten, appellant saw that he was bound and gagged. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was sufficient to prove that appellant was either an accessory before the fact or a principal in the second degree to the abduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Appellant also argues that the killing was not an act directly calculated to further the abduction and that it was not necessitated by the abduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u201cThe Supreme Court of Virginia has adopted the <em>res gestae </em>theory in applying the felony murder statute.\u201d <em>Montague v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 187, 190, 522 S.E.2d 379, 381 (1999) (citation omitted). \u201cUnder the <em>res gestae </em>theory, the felony murder doctrine applies when the \u2018initial felony and the homicide [are] parts of one continuous transaction, and [are] closely related in point of time, place, and causal connection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190-91, 522 S.E.2d at 381 (citation omitted). \u201cIn establishing this relationship, sufficient evidence must be presented from which the fact finder can conclude that the killing and the [underlying felony] were \u2018interdependent objects of a common criminal design.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tibbs v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 687, 706, 525 S.E.2d 579, 588 (2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">After the victim was bound and gagged, appellant made a hand motion and said, \u201cGet rid of him.\u201d The victim was immediately placed in the trunk of a car, taken to a remote location and shot. Sean and William Harris testified that they interpreted appellant\u2019s words and hand motion as meaning she wanted them to kill the victim. Sean Harris also testified that appellant was \u201cthe boss\u201d and that he was carrying out her order to kill the victim. The evidence was sufficient to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>that the <em>res gestae </em>of the abduction included the killing because the abduction and homicide were parts of one continuous transaction and were interdependent objects of a common criminal design.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Appellant objected to instructions nine through twelve, the felony murder instruction, an instruction concerning a killing in the commission of abduction, a concert of action instruction and an instruction on malice, all of which tracked the Virginia Model Jury Instructions. Appellant argues that the trial court erred in giving the felony murder instructions without also giving an instruction on the definition of causal connection, which she proffered in instruction A.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Proffered instruction A provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">The acts causing death must be so closely related to the abduction in time, place, and causal connection as to make it a part of the same criminal enterprise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">\u201cCausal connection\u201d means that the act or acts causing death must have been directly calculated to further the abduction or necessitated by the commission of the abduction. Any degree of causation is sufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Instruction nine provided in pertinent part, \u201c[t]hat the killing occurred in the commission of abduction.\u201d Instruction ten provided in pertinent part, \u201c[t]hat the killing occurs in the commission of abduction if the victim has been abducted and thereafter detained until the act causing death occurs.\u201d Instruction twelve provided in pertinent part, \u201c[a]ll participants in the initial felony may be found guilty of the murder of the victim so long as the homicide was so closely related to the felony in time, place and causal connection as to make it part of the same criminal act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">\u201cA reviewing court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is \u2018to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u2019\u201d <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 485, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988) (citation omitted). \u201cIf the principles set forth in a proposed instruction are fully and fairly covered in other instructions that have been granted, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a repetitious instruction.\u201d <em>Joseph v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 78, 90, 452 S.E.2d 862, 870 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The first sentence of paragraph two in proffered instruction A is language quoted from <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 351, 359, 368 S.E.2d 704, 708 (1988) (holding that there was no causal connection between the death and the underlying felony when the death was from circumstances coincident to the felony). The second sentence of paragraph two in proffered instruction A is language quoted from <em>Berkeley, </em>19 Va.App. at 285, 451 S.E.2d at 44 (holding that the homicide stemmed from the commission of an abduction, was a part of one continuous transaction, closely related in time, place and causal connection, and occurred within the <em>res gestae </em>of the abduction).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u201cA statement made in the course of a judicial decision is not necessarily proper language for a jury instruction.\u201d <em>Yeager v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 761, 766, 433 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u201c[T]he felony-murder statute applies where the killing is so closely related to the felony in time, place and causal connection as to make it a part of the same criminal enterprise.\u201d <em>Haskell v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 1033, 1044, 243 S.E.2d 477, 483 (1978). \u201cCausal connection\u201d means that the underlying felony must relate to the murder \u201cas to make it a part of the same criminal enterprise\u201d and this is established when the underlying felony and homicide are \u201cinterdependent objects of a common criminal design.\u201d <em>Tibbs, </em>31 Va.App. at 705-06, 525 S.E.2d at 588 (citation omitted). Instructions nine, ten and twelve clearly defined the issue of causal connection, and the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s proffered instruction A and overruling her exceptions to jury instructions nine through twelve.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>USE OF A FIREARM CONVICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction of use of a firearm in the commission of murder. Appellant concedes that she did not preserve this issue at trial. Appellant argues that if her murder conviction is reversed, then fundamental fairness requires that her firearm conviction also be reversed. Because we affirm appellant\u2019s murder conviction, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Based upon the foregoing, appellant\u2019s convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
