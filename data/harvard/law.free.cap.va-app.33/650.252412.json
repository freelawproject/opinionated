Because the trial court erred in holding that Rule 3A:9(b) applied and because Southerly\u2019s age did not excuse the notice requirements, we reverse the judgment of the trial court, vacate Southerly\u2019s convictions, and remand the case for further proceedings, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Southerly was born June 29, 1973. On July 1, 1991, petitions were filed in the Rockingham County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court charging him with committing, before his eighteenth birthday, certain offenses that would have been crimes if committed by an adult. On July 30, 1991, additional petitions were obtained, charging other such offenses. The petitions identified Southerly\u2019s mother as Linda Riggleman, but provided no identification of his father. Summonses were duly executed upon Southerly and his mother, as required by Code \u00a7 16.1-263(A). Southerly\u2019s father was never identified, and no summons was served upon him. The juvenile and domestic relations district court did not certify that the father\u2019s identity and his location or mailing address were not reasonably ascertainable as provided in the exception to required parental notice. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-263(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">By order entered January 7,1992, pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-269,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Rockingham County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court transferred all proceedings to the trial court, which by order dated August 14, 1992, convicted Southerly on all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>On July 9, 1999, citing <em>Baker v. Commonwealth, 28 </em>Va.App. 306, 504 S.E.2d 394 (1998), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>258 Va. 1, 516 S.E.2d 219 (1999), Southerly moved the trial court \u201cto set aside judgment orders on the ground that the circuit court was without jurisdiction.\u201d By order entered November 23, 1999, the trial court denied the motion, ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">[T]hat this proceeding is no longer pending, having been terminated more than twenty-one days prior to the filing of the defendant\u2019s Motion,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">Rule 3A:9(b) prohibits consideration of the defendant\u2019s Motion ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The Commonwealth correctly concedes that Rule 3A:9(b) did not bar the trial court\u2019s consideration of Southerly\u2019s motion. By its own terms, the rule excludes from its operation defenses and objections asserting that the prosecution or written charge \u201cfails to show jurisdiction in the court or to charge an offense.\u201d Rule 3A:9(b). Southerly\u2019s motion asserted a lack of jurisdiction. Thus, his motion fell outside the operation of the rule. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The Commonwealth further concedes that Southerly\u2019s motion was not time-barred. <em>See Virginia Dept. Corr. v. Crowley, </em>227 Va. 254, 316 S.E.2d 439 (1984); <em>Matthews v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 358, 359, 218 S.E.2d 538, 540 (1975); <em>Slayton v. Parrigan, </em>215 Va. 27, 205 S.E.2d 680 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(1) vests in the juvenile and domestic relations district courts \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction\u201d over \u201call cases, matters and proceedings involving\u201d a child who is alleged to be delinquent. Code \u00a7 16.1-228 defines a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d to include an adult who has committed a delinquent act (an act that would be criminal if committed by an adult) prior to his eighteenth birthday. The juvenile code uses the terms \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cjuvenile\u201d interchangeably. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-228 (defining \u201cchild,\u201d \u201cjuvenile,\u201d and \u201cminor\u201d synonymously to mean \u201ca person less than eighteen years of age\u201d). Code \u00a7 16.1-260, which governs the initiation of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>ceedings in a juvenile and domestic relations district court, uses the terms \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cjuvenile\u201d interchangeably.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1 permits, under appropriate circumstances, transfer of charges against a juvenile or delinquent child to the circuit court for trial. However, before such a transfer may take place, the summonses required by Code \u00a7 16.1-263 must be issued and served on the juvenile and, at the time of the proceedings against Southerly, upon his parents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">We have previously \u201cheld that the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and 16.1-264, \u2018relating to procedures for instituting proceedings against juveniles, are mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 and the failure to \u2018strictly follow\u2019 these notice procedures denies a juvenile defendant \u2018a substantive right and the constitutional guarantee of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker, </em>28 Va.App. at 310, 504 S.E.2d at 396 (quoting <em>Karim, v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 767, 779, 473 S.E.2d 103, 108-09 (1996) <em>(en banc)). </em>Thus, failure to give the requisite \u201cnotice of the initiation of juvenile proceedings\u201d renders \u201cthe transfer of jurisdiction ... ineffectual and the subsequent convictions ... void.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315, 504 S.E.2d at 399. <em>See also Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 431, 436, 527 S.E.2d 406, 408 (2000) (holding that the failure of the juvenile court to give notice of the juvenile court proceedings to Moore\u2019s father rendered the transfer of jurisdiction to the circuit court ineffectual and, thus, Moore\u2019s convictions void). Unless the circumstances in this case take it out of the notice requirement of Code \u00a7 16.1-263 and the holdings in <em>Baker </em>and <em>Moore, </em>those holdings control decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Noting that both Baker and Moore were juveniles when charged, but that Southerly was eighteen years old and an adult when the charges against him were initiated, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Commonwealth contends that having attained his majority, Southerly stood <em>sui juris </em>before the court and neither needed nor was entitled to the special protection afforded juveniles. It argues that his parents were neither necessary nor proper parties to the proceedings against him. This argument is contrary to the plain language of the juvenile and domestic relations law.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The law affords special protection to juveniles. It makes special concessions in its treatment of socially offensive acts committed by juveniles in the indiscretion of their tender years. Accordingly, it grants some tolerance to an adult for misconduct before he attains the competence and culpability of majority. This special leniency is reflected in the definition of a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d found in Code \u00a7 16.1-228, which includes an adult who has committed a delinquent act prior to his eighteenth birthday. This indulgence is not without limitation. Code \u00a7 16.1-242 provides that an adult who has attained the age of twenty-one years, and is charged with an offense committed while a juvenile, shall be proceeded against as an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The failure of the juvenile and domestic relations district court to summon both of Southerly\u2019s parents, as then required by Code \u00a7 16.1-263, rendered the hearing in that court ineffective to transfer jurisdiction to the trial court. As a consequence, all subsequent proceedings in the trial court were void. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and order Southerly\u2019s convictions vacated. We remand the case to the trial court for farther proceedings, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\">. At the time of the proceedings in this case, Code \u00a7 16.1-269 provided the procedures for juvenile transfer. Code \u00a7 16.1-269 was repealed in 1994 and replaced by Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-269.1 to 16.1-269.6. <em>See </em>1994 Va. Acts cc. 859 and 949.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\"><em>. </em>Although inapplicable here, effective July 1, 1999, Code \u00a7 16.1-263 was amended to permit the issuance of a summons to \u201cat least one parent\u201d in lieu of the previous requirement that summonses be served on \u201cthe parents.\u201d <em>See </em>1999 Va.
