On appeal, he complains that the trial court erroneously refused to suppress evidence seized during an unlawful detention and, additionally, challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the requisite intent to distribute the offending drugs. Finding no error, a panel of this Court affirmed the convictions. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we, likewise, affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Upon review of both a denial of a motion to suppress and a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider the record in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below, the Commonwealth in this instance. <em>Bynum v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 412, 414-15, 477 S.E.2d 750, 751-52 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">On the evening of October 4, 1996, officers of the Newport News Police Narcotics Enforcement Unit were conducting a \u201cdrug reverse [sting] operation in Fairfield Apartments,\u201d undertaken in response to \u201ca lot of complaints in reference to drug sales in that area,\u201d \u201ca high drug area.\u201d \u201c[V]ice and narcotics\u201d Officer W.L. Stokes acted as \u201csecurity for two female officers [in \u201cplain clothes\u201d] who ... were making sales of imitation cocaine to people who walked up or drove up in the area.\u201d The undercover officers were equipped with hidden communication devices and, following each transaction, notified an \u201capprehension team,\u201d assembled in the laundromat office of a nearby apartment building, to arrest the purchaser. The office, located \u201cjust inside the doorway\u201d of the building, opened directly into a foyer, which also accessed two occupied apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>In the midst of the ongoing undercover police activity, at approximately 10:15 p.m., Officer Stokes noticed someone holding a \u201cgun,\u201d walking directly toward the apartment building. Via the communication link, he quickly advised the team that a person was approaching with \u201ca gun in his hand.\u201d Alerted by Stokes, Officer T.G. Lecroy, the team member assigned \u201cto prevent anyone from getting hurt,\u201d observed the individual \u201ccome through the door, saw a gun, took the gun from him\u201d and escorted him into the \u201coffice area.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Once inside, Lecroy immediately recognized defendant and, aware he was a convicted felon, arrested him for possession of the firearm. A related search of defendant disclosed a plastic bag containing 2.3 grams of cocaine, a pager, and $935, \u201cbroken into nine $100 bundles,\u201d with the balance \u201cjust loose in his pocket.\u201d No \u201cmeans of ingesting\u201d the cocaine was found on defendant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">After advising defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Lecroy \u201casked ... how much cocaine he had started with,\u201d and defendant answered, \u201ca large eight-ball,\u201d \u201cdrug ... terminology\u201d referencing one-eighth of an ounce of cocaine, approximately 3.5 grams. Upon further inquiry, defendant stated that he obtained the cocaine from \u201cWooten,\u201d an individual known to Lecroy as \u201cinto dealing narcotics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Officer M.L. Davenport, an expert in \u201cdrug matters,\u201d opined that possession of an \u201ceightball\u201d of cocaine, together with the pager, cash and weapon, was \u201cinconsistent with personal use\u201d of the drug. Davenport explained that a pager provides communication to \u201cpersons in the drug trade\u201d and \u201cweapons ... a means of protection.\u201d He noted that \u201clarge amounts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>money\u201d derived from \u201cdrug distribution\u201d are oftentimes packaged in \u201chundred dollar increments\u201d because \u201c[i]t\u2019s easier to count.\u201d On cross-examination, Davenport added that users of cocaine will, \u201cin most cases,\u201d carry on their person \u201csome means\u201d of consuming the drug. Questioned further, he approximated the \u201cstreet value\u201d of an \u201ceightball\u201d at \u201cone fifty to two twenty-five.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Defendant testified that, on the day of arrest, he cashed his weekly \u201cpaycheck,\u201d \u201cseven hundred and some dollars, ... [and] arranged [his] money,\u201d commingling the funds with $500 already in his possession. \"He subsequently purchased \u201cabout an eight-ball\u201d of cocaine for personal use and \u201ctook [several] hits\u201d in his wife\u2019s car before approaching the apartment building. At the time of the offense, defendant was regularly earning $7.71 per hour over a forty-hour workweek, resulting in $251.28 net pay for the period.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Defendant first complains that he was unlawfully seized by Officer Lecroy, requiring suppression of all evidence subsequently obtained by police. <em>See Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1691-92, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">\u201cUltimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause to make a warrantless ... seizure involve issues of both law and fact and are reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u201d <em>Glasco v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 763, 770-71, 497 S.E.2d 150, 153 (1998) (citation and internal quotations omitted). However, \u201c[i]n performing such analysis, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted). \u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u2018the burden is upon appellant to show that this ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Glasco, </em>26 Va.App. at 770, 497 S.E.2d at 153 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">In resolving defendant\u2019s argument, we find it helpful to revisit <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), the landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that addressed the Fourth Amendment implications of the detention and pat-down of a citizen by police investigating suspicious conduct. In <em>Terry, </em>Cleveland Police Officer Martin McFadden, a detective with thirty-five years experience, was patrolling the \u201cvicinity ... downtown ... for shoplifters and pickpockets\u201d when his \u201cattention was attracted by\u201d defendant and a companion \u201cstanding on [a] corner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, 88 S.Ct. at 1871. As McFadden watched, each man in turn repeatedly \u201cwalk[ed] ... past some stores[,] ... paused for a moment and looked in a store window, ... walked on ..., turned around\u201d and returned to the corner to confer with the other, \u201clooking in the same window\u201d en route. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 88 S.Ct. at 1872. After ten or twelve minutes of such behavior, the two, then joined by a third man, \u201cwalked off.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Suspicious that the men were \u201ccasing a job, a stick up,\u201d McFadden decided \u201cthat the situation was ripe for action,\u201d approached the three, identified himself and \u201casked for their names.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6-7, 88 S.Ct. at 1872. Receiving a \u201c \u2018mumbled\u2019 ... \u2018response\u2019 \u201d and fearful \u201c \u2018they may have a gun[,]\u2019 \u201d he \u201cgrabbed [Terry], ... spun him around ..., and patted down the outside of his clothing[,]\u201d discovering a pistol.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Terry was then arrested and subsequently convicted of a weapons offense. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 88 S.Ct. at 1872. On appeal, he advanced a Fourth Amendment challenge to the constitutionality of the stop, seizure and search.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">In affirming Terry\u2019s conviction, the Court recognized that \u201ceffective crime prevention and detection\u201d often requires \u201cswift action predicated upon the on-the-spot observations\u201d of police. <em>Id. </em>at 20, 22, 88 S.Ct. at 1879, 1880. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Court cautioned that, to comport with the \u201cFourth Amendment\u2019s general proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures[,]\u201d police acting in response to such circumstances \u201cmust be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant ... intrusion\u201d upon the protected interests of citizens.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 20-21, 88 S.Ct. at 1879-80. Thus, the dispositive inquiry becomes, \u201cwould the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure or the search \u201cwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was appropriate?[,]\u201d an objective test. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880 (citation omitted). If so, \u201ca police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The \u201ccrux\u201d of <em>Terry, </em>however, was not the propriety of McFadden\u2019s \u201csteps to investigate ... suspicious behavior,\u201d but, rather, the \u201cinvasion of Terry\u2019s personal security by searching him for weapons in the course of that investigation[,]\u201d an issue related to the more \u201cimmediate interest of the police officer in taking steps to assure ... that the person ... is not armed with a weapon that could ... be used against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23, 88 S.Ct. at 1881. Unwilling to expose police to \u201cunnecessary risks[,]\u201d the Court refused to \u201cblind [itself] to the need for law enforcement officers to <em>protect themselves </em>and <em>other prospective victims of violence </em>in situations where they may lack probable cause for an arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23-24, 88 S.Ct. at 1881 (emphasis added). Accordingly, \u201c[w]hen an officer is justified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is <em>armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others, </em>it would ... be clearly unreasonable to deny ... the power to take necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>measures to determine ... and to neutralize the threat____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANP\"><em>Id. </em>at 24, 88 S.Ct. at 1881 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Thus, like the objective test for reasonable suspicion, \u201cthe issue is whether the reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that <em>his safety or that of others </em>was in danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883 (emphasis added). If so, police may undertake a search and related seizure appropriate to the \u201cconcrete factual circumstances of individual cases,\u201d \u201cconfined in scope to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover\u201d \u201chidden instruments\u201d that threaten both police and others. <em>Id. </em>at 29, 88 S.Ct. at 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Applying these companion principles to the facts in <em>Terry, </em>the Court noted that McFadden had observed Terry and his companions engage in a pattern of conduct which, <em>though lawful, </em>was \u201cunusual\u201d and reasonably supported a police officer, \u201cexperience[d] in the detection of thievery,\u201d in the \u201chypothesis that these men were contemplating a daylight robbery ... likely to involve weapons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23, 28, 88 S.Ct. at 1881, 1883. The Court, therefore, concluded that the circumstances provided sufficient justification for the encounter, seizure and \u201cpat down\u201d of Terry, limited acts \u201cnecessary for the protection of (McFadden] and others\u201d in the pursuit of an appropriate investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Several years after deciding <em>Terry, </em>the Court, in <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972), again considered the Fourth Amendment implications of an investigatory seizure and search of a citizen. There, Bridgeport Connecticut Police Sergeant John Connolly received a tip, deemed reliable by the Court, that Williams, then seated in a nearby vehicle, was \u201ccarrying narcotics and had a gun at his waist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144-45, 92 S.Ct. at 1922. Connolly, alone at 2:15 a.m. on \u201ccar patrol duty\u201d in a \u201chigh-crime area,\u201d \u201capproached the vehicle to investigate the ... report,\u201d \u201ctapped on the car window and asked ... Williams[ ] to open the door.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When Williams instead \u201crolled down the window[,]\u201d Connolly \u201creached into the car and removed a fully loaded revolver from Williams\u2019 waistband.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 92 S.Ct. at 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>In a resulting prosecution for illegal possession of the weapon, Williams challenged the admissibility of the evidence, complaining that it was the fruit of an unlawful search and seizure. <em>Id. </em>In affirming the conviction, the Supreme Court recalled the lessons of <em>Terry, </em>concluding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">[t]he Fourth Amendment does not require a policeman ... to simply shrug his shoulders and allow a crime to occur or a criminal to escape. On the contrary, <em>Terry </em>recognizes that it may be the essence of good police work to adopt an intermediate response. A <em>brief stop </em>of a suspicious individual <em>in order to determine his identity or to maintain the status quo momentarily while obtaining more information, </em>may be most reasonable in light of the facts known to the officer at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 145-46, 92 S.Ct. at 1923 (citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Moreover, the Court again emphasized that police engaged in an \u201cinvestigatory stop\u201d \u201cmay conduct a limited protective search for concealed weapons\u201d whenever justified in the belief that the subject is armed and dangerous. <em>Id. </em>at 146, 92 S.Ct. at 1923. Echoing <em>Terry, </em>the Court reasoned that such intrusion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-8\">is not to discover evidence of crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence, and thus the frisk for weapons might be equally necessary and reasonable, <em>whether or not carrying a concealed weapon violated any applicable state law. </em>So long as the officer is entitled to make a <em>forcible stop, </em>and <em>has reason to believe that the suspect is armed and dangerous, he may conduct a weapons search limited in scope to this protective purpose.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acx\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">In the years following <em>Terry, Williams </em>and their progeny,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> our Court has frequently cited such decisions with approval, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>incorporating the attendant principles as familiar guideposts in our jurisprudence. Faithful to the rationale of <em>Terry, </em>we have resolved countless fact-specific \u201cstop and frisk\u201d appeals, consistently instructing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">\u201c[tjhere is no \u2018litmus test\u2019 for reasonable suspicion. Each instance of police conduct must be judged for reasonableness in light of the particular circumstances.\u201d \u201cIn order to determine what cause is sufficient to authorize police to stop a person, cognizance must be taken of the \u2018totality of the circumstances \u2014 the whole picture.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-6\"><em>Harmon v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 440, 445, 425 S.E.2d 77, 79 (1992) (citations omitted). Circumstances we have recognized as relevant in a <em>TerryfWilliams </em>analysis include characteristics of the area surrounding the stop, the time of the stop, the specific conduct of the suspect individual, the character of the offense under suspicion,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the unique perspective of a police officer trained and experienced in the detection of crime. <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 53, 67, 354 S.E.2d 79, 86-87 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Here, police observed defendant suddenly appear, displaying a firearm, late at night, in an area notorious for \u201cdrug sales.\u201d Defendant\u2019s presence coincided with an ongoing police operation that involved several undercover officers in the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>of imitation illegal drugs, clearly an environment conducive to unlawful conduct and fraught with danger. With weapon in hand, defendant proceeded directly to an apartment building occupied both by police and residents. Confronted with such circumstances, police, experienced in the deadly mix of guns and narcotics and other violent crimes, reasonably suspected criminal activity which posed an immediate threat both to themselves and others, justifying a brief investigatory detention. In undertaking the encounter, Lecroy, the officer responsible for operational safety, was entitled to seize defendant and take control of the weapon, thereby neutralizing an imminent threat in a prudent and measured fashion. Had police ignored the full import of defendant\u2019s conduct, although perhaps facially lawful, and a tragedy resulted, the folly of such indifference would have been apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">When, during the course of the stop, defendant was identified as a person then involved in felonious activity, police properly effected his arrest and undertook the disputed search.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Defendant next contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove an intention to distribute the cocaine in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">The credibility of a witness, the weight accorded testimony, and the inferences drawn from proven facts are matters to be determined by the fact finder. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989). \u201cCircumstantial evidence may establish the elements of a crime, provided it excludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u201d <em>Lovelace v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 575, 586, 500 S.E.2d 267, 272 (1998). \u201cWhether a hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is a question of fact and a finding by the trial court is binding on appeal unless plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 586, 500 S.E.2d at 273 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>\u201c[F]or a defendant to be convicted of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant possessed the controlled substance contemporaneously with his intention to distribute that substance.\u201d <em>Stanley v.

Such evidence may include the possession of large sums of money, pagers, and firearms, \u201cregularly recognized as factors indicating an intent to distribute.\u201d <em>Glasco, </em>26 Va.App. at 775, 497 S.E.2d at 156:</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Officer Lecroy discovered 2.3 grams of cocaine, together with a pager, $935 \u201cbroken down into nine $100 bundles,\u201d and a firearm on defendant\u2019s person, an aggregation of circumstances inconsistent with personal use of the drug. Moreover, defendant possessed no paraphernalia necessary to the consumption of cocaine. Although defendant testified that he possessed the drugs for personal use and attributed the cash to wages, the evidence proved otherwise, and \u201c[t]he trial court was entitled to disbelieve [defendant\u2019s] explanation and conclude that he lied to conceal his guilt.\u201d <em>Dunbar v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 387, 394, 512 S.E.2d 823, 827 (1999).

Indeed, Officer Lecroy gave the following reason for detaining Christian:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">The reason that I did what I did, was because part of my job that evening was to prevent anyone from getting hurt, and to apprehend suspects who may have purchased illegal narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-8\">When we have undercover officers out in the parking lot which are conducting sales of illegal drugs, imitation illegal drugs, my concern is for their safety along with anyone else that I may be working with if I \u2014 and any other people who may be in the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">When I heard that a man had a gun in the middle of a high drug area which \u2014 which we wouldn\u2019t have been there if it wasn\u2019t a high drug area, then I\u2019m going to take it from him and find out what his purpose is for being there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANUV\">The officer testified, however, that Christian did not purchase any drugs and was not suspected of drug activity. The officer had no indication that Christian was or had been engaged in criminal activity. He had no objective basis to believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Christian, who was going to his home, \u201cmay have purchased illegal narcotics\u201d from the undercover officers. Moreover, it is not illegal in Virginia to carry a gun if one is lawfully permitted to do so and if the gun is not held in a reckless or threatening manner. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-56.1 and Code \u00a7 18.2-282.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Christian lived in one of the apartments in the building where he was arrested. Christian did not approach the officers who were selling the imitation cocaine, and he posed no threat to them. The evidence merely proved that he entered the apartment building where he lived. Moreover, no evidence proved that Christian was going to the laundry room or posed a threat to the officers who were waiting in the laundry room. Those officers were out of sight of persons who may have been using the apartment\u2019s entrance and lobby. Indeed, Officer Lecroy left the laundry room to confront Christian. A conclusion that Christian posed a threat to the officers or anyone else would be based on \u201csheer speculation, unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Life Ins. Co. of Va., </em>228 Va. 55, 62, 321 S.E.2d 78, 82-83 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The only objective facts upon which the police relied to seize Christian were that he was carrying a weapon in public in \u201ca high drug area.\u201d However, carrying an openly displayed firearm in public is not illegal in Virginia. Indeed, if a person desires to transport a firearm from his automobile to his residence, the firearm <em>must </em>be openly displayed. <em>Cf. </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-308 (prohibiting generally the carrying of concealed weapons). The record contains no indication that Christian was \u201cbrandishing\u201d a firearm in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-282(A). In a state that permits ownership and open display of firearms, the mere fact that a person may be armed does not provide a reason to suspect that the person is violating the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Moreover, \u201cthe characteristic of an area cannot serve to impute criminal activity to a person by virtue of that person\u2019s presence in the area.\u201d <em>Riley v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 494, 498-99, 412 S.E.2d 724, 726 (1992). In <em>Brown, </em>the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>States Supreme Court has also noted that a neighborhood\u2019s characteristic tells nothing about the conduct of the person in it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">The flaw in the State\u2019s case is that none of the circumstances preceding the officers\u2019 detention of appellant justified a reasonable suspicion that he was involved in criminal conduct. Officer Venegas testified at appellant\u2019s trial that the situation in the alley \u201clooked suspicious,\u201d but he was unable to point to any facts supporting that conclusion. There is no indication in the record that it was unusual for people to be in the alley. The fact that appellant was in a neighborhood frequented by drug users, standing alone, is not a basis for concluding that appellant himself was engaged in criminal conduct. In short, the appellant\u2019s activity was no different from the activity of other pedestrians in that neighborhood. When pressed, Officer Venegas acknowledged that the only reason he stopped appellant was to ascertain his identity. The record suggests an understandable desire to assert a police presence; however, that purpose does not negate Fourth Amendment guarantees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVC\"><em>Brown, </em>443 U.S. at 51-52, 99 S.Ct. at 2641 (footnote omitted); <em>see also Sibron v.

Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000), reaffirmed the basic principles embodied in <em>Terry </em>and held that \u201c[hjeadlong flight\u201d in an area known for criminal activity gave the police reasonable suspicion to search a suspect. 528 U.S. at 124, 120 S.Ct. at 676. Nevertheless, the Court also stated that \u201cit was not merely [the suspect\u2019s] presence in an area of heavy narcotics trafficking that aroused the officers\u2019 suspicion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such presence, standing alone, is not enough to support a reasonable, particularized suspicion that the person is committing a crime. <em>Id. </em>In this case, Christian\u2019s presence in a high crime neighborhood was the only cause for suspicion about his activities. As stated earlier, his open possession of the firearm was proof only of lawful compliance with the Virginia statute. When the circumstances objectively establish perfectly lawful activity, no cause exists for reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">To make a <em>Terry </em>stop, \u201cthe detaining officers must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417-18, 101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981). In both <em>Terry </em>and <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972), the police officers were able to articulate a particularized suspicion that the person was engaged in criminal activity. <em>See Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 6-7, 88 S.Ct. at 1872; <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. at 144-48, 92 S.Ct. at 1922-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The evidence does not prove that Christian was engaged in criminal activity or was \u201cpresently dangerous\u201d to the officers or any other person. <em>See Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 24, 88 S.Ct. at 1881. Thus, Officer Lecroy was not justified in his \u201cbelief that his safety or that of others was in danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 88 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>at 1883. For these reasons, I would hold that the trial judge erred in refusing to suppress the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Although the evidence was sufficient to prove possession of cocaine, it was insufficient to establish an intent to distribute beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">\u201cPossession with intent to distribute is a crime which requires \u2018an act coupled with a specific intent.\u2019\u201d <em>Stanley v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 867, 869, 407 S.E.2d 13, 15 (1991) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted). \u201cIt is elementary that where, as here, an indictment charges an offense which consists of an act combined with a particular intent, proof of the intent is essential to conviction.\u201d <em>Patterson v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 698, 699, 213 S.E.2d 752, 753 (1975). The Commonwealth must prove specific intent, an element of the charged offense, beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 315-16, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2787, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 363, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1072, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). Thus, \u201c[ejxistence of the intent ... cannot be based upon surmise or speculation.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>215 Va. at 699, 213 S.E.2d at 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">When the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence is wholly circumstantial, \u201c \u2018all necessary circumstances proved must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence and exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u2019\u201d <em>Dukes v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 119, 122, 313 S.E.2d 382, 383 (1984) (quoting <em>Inge v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 360, 366, 228 S.E.2d 563, 567 (1976)). \u201cWhere inferences are relied upon to establish guilt, they must point to guilt so clearly that any other conclusion would be inconsistent therewith.\u201d <em>Dotson v. Commonwealth, </em>171 Va. 514, 518, 199 S.E. 471, 473 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">The principle is well established in Virginia that a relatively small quantity of cocaine warrants the inference that an accused possessed it for personal use. <em>See Dukes, </em>227 Va. at 122-23, 313 S.E.2d at 383-84. The police seized only 2.3 grams of cocaine from Christian\u2019s person. No other evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>indicated an intent to distribute. \u201cThe mode of packaging [of the cocaine] and the way the [package was] hidden are as consistent with possession for personal use as they are with intent to distribute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123, 313 S.E.2d at 384. The cocaine was not divided into individual and separate packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Moreover, Christian made no statements and committed no acts that proved he intended to distribute the cocaine. Christian had entered the building where he lived when the officer seized him. The police officer testified that Christian said he purchased an \u201ceight-ball.\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established that an eight-ball was approximately 3.5 grams and that if Christian began with an eight-ball, he was \u201cmissing\u201d only a little over a gram of cocaine. In addition, the Commonwealth\u2019s own expert testified that it would be impossible to obtain $900 from the sale of a little over a gram of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Christian\u2019s wife testified that the day Christian was arrested (October 4, 1996), she had driven him to the bank to cash his paycheck of \u201cabout seven hundred dollars.\u201d Christian testified as follows about his check:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">I cashed my check. My check was like, seven hundred and some dollars. We worked seven days on \u2014 thirteen days on and four days off. We worked ten-hour shifts a day. So I cashed my check. I asked the teller not to give me any hundred dollar bills and as few fifties as possible. I arranged my money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">That testimony was not contradicted. The probation officer testified that Christian reported to him on September 11, that he had gotten a new job with the railroad company and showed him a paystub with a \u201cnet pay [of] 251.28\u201d for the week ending \u201c9-7-96.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Thus, only through speculation could we conclude that a connection exists between Christian\u2019s money and his intention regarding the cocaine. Likewise, proof that Christian possessed a pager, a very common device in our society, does not establish any intent regarding the cocaine. \u201c[Circumstances of suspicion, no matter how grave or strong, are not proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>guilt sufficient to support a verdict of guilty.\u201d <em>Clodfelter v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 619, 623, 238 S.E.2d 820, 822 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">For these reasons, I would also hold that the evidence failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Christian possessed the cocaine with the intent to distribute.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b765-6\">ELDER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AmAI\">concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">I concur with the majority as to Issue III, sufficiency of the . evidence, and join Judge Benton\u2019s dissent as to Issue II, the seizure of the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
