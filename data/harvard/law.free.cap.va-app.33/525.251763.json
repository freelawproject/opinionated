In a separate proceeding, Richard J. Elliott, codefendant with O\u2019Mara, was convicted by a jury for attempted cross burning, after joining with defendant O\u2019Mara in the unsuccessful challenge to the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-423 before the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Accordingly, both O\u2019Mara and Elliott (defendants) maintain on appeal \u201cthat the code section is unconstitutional as violative of the free speech and expression protections\u201d guaranteed by both the United States and Virginia Constitutions. Joining the two appeals for resolution by this Court, we affirm the respective convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The substantive facts are uncontroverted. On the evening of May 2, 1998, defendants, together with \u201capproximately fifteen individuals,\u201d were \u201cconsuming alcohol\u201d at the Virginia Beach home of David Targee. When defendant Elliott expressed unspecified \u201ccomplaint[s] ... about his neighbor,\u201d James Jubilee, and his desire to \u201c \u2018get back\u2019 at him,\u201d someone \u201csuggested that they burn a cross in [Jubilee\u2019s] yard.\u201d In response, Targee and defendants immediately constructed a crude cross in Targee\u2019s garage and proceeded in Targee\u2019s truck to the Jubilee home. Elliott \u201chanded the cross\u201d to defendant O\u2019Mara, who erected and ignited it on Jubilee\u2019s property, and the three returned to Targee\u2019s residence. The respective records do not clearly specify Jubilee\u2019s race.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Jubilee later discovered the \u201cpartially burned cross\u201d and notified police, resulting in the subject prosecutions for violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-423 and the attendant conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-423 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">It shall be unlawful for any person or persons, with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons, to burn, or cause to be burned, a cross on the property of another, a highway or other public place. Any person who shall violate any provision of this section shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Any such burning of a cross shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate a person or group of persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Defendants contend that the statute impermissibly infringes upon expressive conduct, speech protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and Article I, \u00a7 12 of the Virginia Constitution, and, therefore, is \u201cplainly unconstitutional.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\u201c \u2018In assessing the constitutionality of a statute .. .- [t]he burden is on the challenger to prove the alleged constitutional defect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 848, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994) (quoting <em>Perkins v.

Iron Belt Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>96 Va. 119, 123, 30 S.E. 440, 441 (1898). \u201cWhen the constitutionality of an act is challenged, a heavy burden of proof is thrust upon the party making the challenge. All laws are presumed to be constitutional and this presumption is one of the strongest known to the law.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Day, </em>200 Va. 764, 770, 107 S.E.2d 594, 598 (1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\"><em>Moses v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 293, 298-99, 498 S.E.2d 451, 454 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">The First Amendment declares, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\u201d The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits state action in violation of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Similarly, Article I, \u00a7 12 of the Virginia Constitution establishes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">That the freedoms of speech and of the press are among the great bulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained except by despotic governments; that any citizen may freely speak, write, and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right; that the General Assembly shall not pass any law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, nor the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for the redress of grievances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">\u201cOur courts have consistently held that the protections afforded under the Virginia Constitution are co-extensive with those in the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Bennefield v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 729, 739-40, 467 S.E.2d 306, 311 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Although \u201c[t]he First Amendment literally forbids the abridgement only of \u2018speech,\u2019 \u201d the Supreme Court has \u201clong recognized that its protection does not end at the spoken or written word.\u201d <em>Texas v. Johnson, </em>491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2539, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989). \u201c[Conduct may be \u2018sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Spence v. Washington, </em>418 U.S. 405, 409, 94 S.Ct. 2727, 2730, 41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974)). In identifying expressive conduct, the Court must determine \u201cwhether \u2018[a]n intent to convey a particularized message was present, and [whether] the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations in original) (quoting <em>Spence, </em>418 U.S. at 410-11, 94 S.Ct. at 2730). If so, a proscription of such activity by government \u201cbecause of disapproval of the ideas expressed\u201d is \u201ccontent based\u201d suppression of free speech, offensive to the First Amendment and \u201cpresumptively invalid.\u201d <em>R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, </em>505 U.S. 377, 382, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 2542, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">However, \u201cour society ... has permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas, which are \u2018of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382-83, 112 S.Ct. at 2542-43 (quoting <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942)). Thus, First Amendment protection \u201cdoes not include a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations,\u201d thereby allowing government to regulate obscenity, defamation, \u201cfighting words,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 383, 112 S.Ct. at 2543 (citing <em>Chaplinsky, </em>315 U.S. at 572, 62 S.Ct. at 769), and threats of violence. <em>See id. </em>at 383, 388, 112 S.Ct. at 2546 (citing <em>Watts v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 705, 707, 89 S.Ct. 1399, 1401, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969)); <em>see also In re: Steven S., </em>25 Cal.App.4th 598, 31 Cal.Rptr.2d 644, 647 (1994) (holding that threats and fighting words are \u201cremove[d] ... from the scope of the First Amendment\u201d); <em>Florida v. T.B.D., </em>656 So.2d 479, 480-81 (Fla.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1145, 116 S.Ct. 1014, 134 L.Ed.2d 95 (1996) (concluding that threats of violence and fighting words are proscribable because government has \u201cvalid interest\u201d in protecting citizens both from fear of violence and violence).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The \u201c \u2018true threat\u2019 \u201d doctrine articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Watts </em>permits punishment of actual speech or expressive conduct \u201cwhen a reasonable person would foresee that the threat would be interpreted as a serious expression of intention to inflict bodily harm.\u201d <em>In re: Steven S., </em>31 Cal.Rptr.2d at 647 (citing <em>U.S. v. Orozco-Santillan, </em>903 F.2d 1262, 1265-66 (9th Cir.1990)). Similarly, the Court\u2019s \u201cfighting words doctrine\u201d expressed in <em>Chaplinsky </em>removes the shield of the First Amendment from \u201cstatements \u2018which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Chaplinsky, </em>315 U.S. at 572, 62 S.Ct. at 769); <em>see Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 20, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 1785, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971) (describing fighting words as expressions likely to provoke a violent reaction when directed to another).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Here, the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-423 specifically prohibit the burning of a cross \u201con the property of another, a highway or other public place,\u201d \u201cwith the intent of intimidating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>any person or group of persons.\u201d Historically, a flaming cross is \u201cinextricably linked ... to sudden and precipitous violence \u2014 lynchings, shootings, whippings, mutilations, and home-burnings,\u201d a \u201cconnection ... [with] forthcoming violence [that] is clear and direct.\u201d <em>T.B.D., </em>656 So.2d at 481. Hence, \u201ca burning cross conveys ideas capable of eliciting powerful responses from those engaging in the conduct and those receiving the message.\u201d <em>State v. Ramsey, </em>311 S.C. 555, 430 S.E.2d 511, 514 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Manifestly, the pernicious message of such conduct, a clear and direct expression of an intention to do one harm, constitutes a true threat envisioned by <em>Watts, </em>irrespective of racial, religious, ethnic or like characteristics peculiar to the victim. Moreover, the attendant fear and intimidation subjects the victim to an immediate and calculated injury that invites a breach of the peace, fighting words within the intendment of <em>Chaplinsky. </em>Thus, although such expressive conduct doubtless constitutes speech, the prohibition of which unavoidably implicates content, the message is beyond the protection of the First Amendment and appropriately subject to proscription by government.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Defendants\u2019 reliance upon <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio, </em>395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969), to support the contention that Code \u00a7 18.2-423 unconstitutionally prohibits \u201cmerely intimidating someone,\u201d at once ignores the well-established symbolism of the burning cross and misapplies <em>Brandenburg. Brandenburg </em>addressed a challenge to the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s \u201cCriminal Syndicalism statute,\u201d which proscribed, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201c \u2018advocacy ... [of] the duty, necessity, or propriety of crime, sabotage, violence or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444-45, 89 S.Ct. at 1827. Thus, the <em>Brandenburg </em>Court was concerned with the propriety of governmental restrictions on the \u201cadvocacy of the use of force or of law violation\u201d in the context of a reform movement, an issue unrelated to the vile and malevolent expression contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-423. <em>Id. </em>at 447, 89 S.Ct. at 1829. Accordingly, the <em>Brandenburg </em>admonishment that states may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u201cforbid or proscribe [such] advocacy\u201d only if \u201cdirected to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and ... likely to incite or produce such action\u201d does not similarly delimit proscribable threats and fighting words. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Defendants\u2019 assertion that <em>R.A.V. v. St. Paul </em>\u201cmakes it clear ... \u00a7 18.2-423 is unconstitutional\u201d is, likewise, without merit. <em>R.A.V. </em>examined the constitutionality of a St. Paul, Minnesota ordinance, which provided, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">Whoever places on public or private property a symbol, object, appellation, characterization or graffiti, including, but not limited to, a burning cross ... which one knows or has reasonable grounds to know arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender commits disorderly conduct and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\"><em>R.A.V., </em>505 U.S. at 380, 112 S.Ct. at 2541 (citing Minn. Legis. Code \u00a7 292.02 (1990)). Unlike Code \u00a7 18.2-423, which proscribes cross burnings with the intent to intimidate anyone, the St. Paul ordinance prohibited such \u201cspeech solely on the basis of the subjects the speech addresses,\u201d race, color, creed, religion or gender. <em>R.A.V., </em>505 U.S. at 381, 112 S.Ct. at 2542.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">In declaring the enactment unconstitutional, the Supreme Court accepted the \u201cauthoritative statement\u201d by the Minnesota Supreme Court \u201cthat the ordinance reaches only those expressions that constitute \u2018fighting words,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 381, 112 S. Ct. at 2541, and reaffirmed the doctrine that \u201careas of speech can, consistently with the First Amendment, be regulated <em>because of their constitutionally proscribable </em>content\u2014 (obscenity, defamation, [threats, fighting words] etc.).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 112 S.Ct. at 2543 (emphasis in original). However, the Court cautioned that such \u201ccategories of speech [are not] entirely invisible to the Constitution\u201d and cannot \u201cbe made the vehicles for content discrimination unrelated to their distinctively proscribable content.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383-84, 112 S.Ct. at 2543. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Thus, when \u201cSt. Paul ... proscribed fighting words of <em>whatever </em>manner that communicates messages of racial, gender or religious intolerance,\u201d the city impermissibly engaged in \u201c[selectivity [which] creates the possibility that [it] is seeking to handicap the expression of <em>particular </em>ideas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394, 112 S.Ct. at 2549 (emphasis added); <em>see In re: Steven S., </em>31 Cal.Rptr.2d at 649 (\u201cspeech and expressive conduct may be regulated [but] such regulation may not discriminate within that category on the basis of content\u201d); <em>T.B.D., </em>656 So.2d at 481 (such regulation may not \u201cplay[ ] favorites\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In contrast, Code \u00a7 18.2-423 regulates, without favor or exception, conduct, which, despite elements of expression and content, is unprotected by the First Amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Finally, defendants challenges Code \u00a7 18.2-423, first, as overbroad, regulating both protected and unprotected speech, and, secondly, as underinclusive, ignoring other modes of proscribable speech. However, overbreadth assumes constitutional dimension only when \u201c \u2018there [is] a realistic danger that the statute ... will significantly compromise recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parker v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 681, 690, 485 S.E.2d 150, 154-55 (1997) (quoting <em>Members of City Council of City of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 U.S. 789, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>800-01, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2126, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984)). The prohibition of Code \u00a7 18.2-423 is expressly limited to a person or persons burning a cross with the specific intent to intimidate another, a threat and fighting words unworthy of First Amendment guarantees. Further, underinclusiveness is condemned by <em>R.A.V. </em>only if the result is content discrimination. <em>See R.A.V., </em>505 U.S. at 387, 112 S.Ct. at 2545. Code \u00a7 18.2-423 criminalizes a long recognized, particularly virulent and incendiary mode of proscribable expressive conduct, a prohibition free of content discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">We, therefore, conclude that Code \u00a7 18.2-423 suffers from none of the several unconstitutional infirmities advanced by defendants. The statute targets only expressive conduct undertaken with the intent to intimidate another, conduct clearly proscribable both as fighting words and a threat of violence. The statute does not discriminate in its prohibition and is neither overbroad nor underinclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-14\">. Although Judge Lowe presided at the trials of both O\u2019Mara and Elliott, defendants' constitutional challenges were decided by Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Alan E.

Post-R.A.V. decisions of other jurisdictions cited by defendants in support of a different result involve statutes substantially dissimilar from Code \u00a7 18.2-423. <em>See Pinette v. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd., </em>874 F.Supp. 791 (S.D.Ohio 1994) (statute established permit requirements to conduct public assembly); <em>State v.
