In light of the trial court\u2019s <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order clarifying the nature of appellant\u2019s convictions, we affirm the sentence imposed for malicious wounding as within the statutory range, and we reverse and dismiss the trespass conviction because trespass under Code \u00a7 18.2-119 is not a lesser included offense of statutory burglary under Code \u00a7 18.2-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Appellant originally was charged with malicious wounding in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51 and statutory burglary while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>armed with a deadly weapon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-91.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, the circuit court (trial court) held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">I am going to reduce the breaking and entering while armed with a deadly weapon to trespassing. I find the defendant guilty of trespassing____ And I think under the facts of this case, the malicious wounding has been proven, as well. So I find the defendant guilty of malicious wounding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">At the sentencing hearing on November 3, 1999, the trial court reiterated that it had found appellant guilty of malicious wounding and trespassing. It sentenced him as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">[H]aving found you guilty of the offense of trespass, I sentence you to twelve months in jail ... suspended on condition that you be on probation supervision for a period of four years, upon your release from confinement. On the charge of malicious wounding, I sentence you to ten years in prison. I will require you to serve five years. The balance of the five years will be suspended [on various conditions] ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">The trial court\u2019s original sentencing order, coupled with its <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order, confirmed appellant was convicted for (1) malicious wounding in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51 and sentenced to serve ten years with five years suspended; and (2) trespass in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-119 and sentenced to twelve months, all suspended on condition of four years supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">Appellant registered no objection in the trial court to his conviction for trespass under an indictment for statutory burglary while armed with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">UNLAWFUL VERSUS MALICIOUS WOUNDING</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Appellant contends on appeal that he was convicted for unlawful wounding and that the sentence imposed in the original sentencing order exceeds the sentence permitted for unlawful wounding. However, based on the trial court\u2019s <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order, <em>see </em>discussion <em>supra </em>note 1, the sentencing order now reflects that appellant was convicted for malicious wounding, and the sentence imposed in that order is within the range authorized by statute. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-10, 18.2-51. Therefore, assuming without deciding that Rule 5A:18 does not bar our consideration of this issue, the error of which appellant complained has ceased to exist, and we affirm the sentence imposed for appellant\u2019s malicious wounding conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">TRESPASS CONVICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">Appellant contends trespass in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-119 is not a lesser included offense of statutory burglary while armed with a deadly weapon and that this conviction, therefore, is invalid.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commonwealth contends that Rule 5A:18 bars appellant from raising this issue on appeal because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>he made no contemporaneous objection in the trial court to conviction for trespass. We previously have concluded, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">[t]he fact that the defendant did not object to ... the conviction on the ground that he was convicted for an offense with which he was not charged is of no moment. Unless an indictment is amended to conform to the proof or an accused acquiesces in being found guilty of an offense other than the one charged, a trial court lacks the authority to find an accused guilty of an offense other than the one charged or a lesser included offense---- The lack of authority of the trial court to render the judgment that it did may be raised at any time and by this Court on its own motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\"><em>Fontaine v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 156, 165, 487 S.E.2d 241, 244 (1997) (citations omitted). Acquiescence requires something more than a mere failure to object. <em>See id. </em>(holding that failing to object, coupled with statement to judge clarifying that conviction was for misdemeanor rather than felony, did not constitute acquiescence). We proceed, therefore, to examine the merits of this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The court\u2019s authority to convict appellant for trespass under Code \u00a7 18.2-119 is contingent upon whether that offense is lesser included in the offense for which appellant was charged, statutory burglary while armed with a deadly weapon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-91. <em>See Harrell v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 1, 6, 396 S.E.2d 680, 682 (1990). \u201cThe state may not accuse a person of one crime and convict him by proving another unless the offense is a lesser included one of that charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA lesser included offense is an offense which is composed entirely of elements that are also elements of the greater offense.\u201d <em>Kauffmann v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 400, 409, 382 S.E.2d 279, 283 (1989). \u201cThe lesser [included] offense is therefore always \u2018charged by implication\u2019 as part of the \u2018greater offense\u2019 and \u2018necessarily proven by the proof of the greater offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crump v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 286, 290, 411 S.E.2d 238, 241 (1991) (quoting <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 649, 652, 400 S.E.2d 794, 795 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>(1991)). \u201cAn offense is not a lesser included offense of another if each offense contains an element that the other does not.\u201d <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 203, 206, 415 S.E.2d 446, 448 (1992). \u201cThe determination of what offenses are necessarily included lesser offenses of the crime charged is based on the fundamental nature of the offenses involved, not on the particular facts of a specific case____\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>11 Va.App. at 652, 400 S.E.2d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">We take guidance from our decision in <em>Crump, </em>in which we held that trespass under Code \u00a7 18.2-121 is not a lesser included offense of statutory burglary under Code \u00a7 18.2-91. <em>See </em>13 Va.App. at 290-91, 411 S.E.2d at 240-41.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">A violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-121 is an offense against the \u201cland, dwelling, outhouse or any other building of another,\u201d its \u201ccontents\u201d or \u201cuse\u201d of \u201csuch property free from interference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-91, statutory burglary, ... relies upon Code \u00a7 18.2-90 to identify its prohibited \u201cacts.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-90 includes offenses against properties not specified in Code \u00a7 18.2-121, i.e. ships, vessels, river craft. Thus, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-91 will not invariably and necessarily include a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-121 [,] and the misdemeanor is, consequently, not a lesser included offense of either Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-90 or 18.2-91.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 291, 411 S.E.2d at 241 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">Although Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-119<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 18.2-121 are not identical, they involve similar types of property such that trespass in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-119 also is not a lesser included offense of statutory burglary under Code \u00a7 18.2-91. Code \u00a7 18.2-119 is an offense against \u201cthe lands, buildings or premises of another,\u201d whereas Code \u00a7 18.2-91, by incorporating Code \u00a7 18.2-90, \u201cincludes offenses against properties not specified in Code \u00a7 [18.2-119], i.e. ships, vessels, river craft.\u201d <em>Crump, </em>13 Va.App. at 291, 411 S.E.2d at 241. Although Code \u00a7 18.2-119 includes trespass to the \u201cpremises of another,\u201d the term \u201cpremises\u201d is not broad enough to encompass the water craft mentioned in Code \u00a7 18.2-90. Rather, the term \u201cpremises\u201d relates to <em>\u201c[l]and </em>and its appurtenances,\u201d such as \u201c[t]he area of land surrounding a house ..., a room, shop, building, or other definite area, or a distinct portion of <em>real estate.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1062-63 (5th ed. 1979) (emphasis added), <em>cited with approval in Beach Robo, Inc. v. Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp., </em>236 Va. 131, 134, 372 S.E.2d 144, 146 (1988). \u201cThus, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-91 will not invariably and necessarily include a violation of Code \u00a7 [18.2-119,] and the misdemeanor is, consequently, not a lesser included offense of ... [Code \u00a7 18.2-91].\u201d <em>Crump, </em>13 Va.App. at 291, 411 S.E.2d at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Further, Code \u00a7 18.2-119 contains at least one element which Code \u00a7 18.2-91 does not, either directly or by reference to any other Code section. Code \u00a7 18.2-119 requires proof that the accused \u201cgoes upon or remains upon the lands, buildings or premises of another ... <em>after having been forbidden to do so\u201d </em>by any of several different means, including orally, by posting or other writing, or by order of court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>(Emphasis added). For this reason also, Code \u00a7 18.2-119 is not a lesser included offense of Code \u00a7 18.2-91, and the Commonwealth, by charging a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-91, did not also charge a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-119.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the sentence imposed for appellant\u2019s malicious wounding conviction but reverse and dismiss his trespass conviction based on our holding that trespass under Code \u00a7 18.2-119 is not a lesser included offense of statutory burglary under Code \u00a7 18.2-91, the offense with which appellant was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, and reversed and dismissed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-15\">. Although the circuit court\u2019s original sentencing order contained various inconsistencies regarding the offenses for which appellant was convicted, we granted the Commonwealth's motion to allow the trial court to review that order and correct any clerical errors contained therein pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-428(B). The court entered a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order stating that it convicted appellant of malicious wounding in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51 and trespass in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-119. The record fully supports the court\u2019s entry of the <em>nunc pro tunc </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>order; therefore, we consider the merits of the appeal based on the final order entered <em>nunc pro tunc. See Davis v. Mullins, </em>251 Va. 141, 149, 466 S.E.2d 90, 94 (1996) (discussing court\u2019s authority under Code \u00a7 8.01-428(B) to correct the record to \"speak the truth\u201d by \"placing upon the record evidence of judicial action which has actually been taken ... at the proper time,\u201d action which does not require reacquisition of jurisdiction); <em>Dorn v. Dorn, 222 </em>Va. 288, 291, 279 S.E.2d 393, 394-95 (1981) (noting that entry of a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order to correct a true clerical error does not violate Rule 1:1).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">In entering the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order, the circuit court found that the designation of the offense in the final order as unlawful wounding, rather than malicious wounding, was a clerical error. That finding is supported by the record. Accordingly, the trial court correctly ruled that correction of the clerical error was a ministerial act which could be accomplished by entry of an order <em>nunc pro tunc </em>without violating the twenty-one day time limitation of Rule 1:1. Furthermore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by dispensing with Rule l:13\u2019s requirement of notice to or endorsement by counsel, nor did entry of the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order without notice and a prior opportunity to be heard violate appellant's due process rights. Rule 1:13 specifically provides \"[cjompliance with this rule ... may be modified or dispensed with by the court in its discretion.\u201d Here, no notice or hearing was necessary because the court did not reacquire jurisdiction and lacked authority to reconsider or alter its previous ruling. <em>See Davis, </em>251 Va. at 149, 466 S.E.2d at 94. The trial court was empowered only to correct possible clerical errors in the sentencing order to the extent such corrections were supported by the existing record. <em>See id. </em>Further, appellant had the opportunity to contest the lack of notice in a timely fashion after entry of the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order, but he did not do so. Under these circumstances, we hold the trial court's decision to dispense with endorsements under Rule 1:13 was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b629-12\">. Appellant also was charged with assault and battery and was found guilty. On appeal, he does not challenge the assault and battery conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b630-12\">. The record contained a clerical error in the trial court\u2019s citation to the statute under which appellant was convicted for trespass. The trial court did not make clear at trial or sentencing whether it convicted appellant of common law or statutory trespass and, if statutory trespass, under which code section the conviction was rendered. The parties agreed that Code \u00a7 18.2-152, cited by the trial court in the original sentencing order, had no relationship to the evidence adduced at trial. As set out above, <em>see </em>discussion <em>supra </em>note 1, the trial court\u2019s <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order indicates that it convicted appellant of trespass in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-119. We therefore analyze appellant's second assignment of error in light of this correction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b632-12\">. Although the legislature has amended Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-90 and 18.2-91 on multiple occasions since our decision in <em>Crump, </em>those amendments did not alter the language we analyzed in <em>Crump. See </em>1997 Va. Acts ch. 832; 1996 Va. Acts ch. 1040; 1992 Va. Acts chs. 486, 546; 1991 Va. Acts ch. 710.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b632-13\">.
