The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike the evidence because the indictment alleged that he had been \u201cadjudicated\u201d an habitual offender, while the evidence proved he had been \u201cdetermined\u201d an habitual offender.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below, granting to that evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Juares v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 154, 156, 493 S.E.2d 677, 678 (1997). So viewed, the evidence established that on September 22, 1998, appellant was stopped for driving in excess of 100 miles per hour on Interstate 395. The arresting officer learned that on April 29, 1998, appellant received a \u201cDMV Revocation Notice\u201d stating that his operator\u2019s license had been revoked because he had been \u201cdetermined\u201d an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">On January 4, 1999, the grand jury returned a three-count indictment, including the following charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">On or about the 22nd day of September, 1998, in the City of Alexandria, ENNOS MORRIS did unlawfully and feloniously drive a motor vehicle after having been <em>adjudicated </em>an Habitual Offender, such driving of itself having endangered the life, limb, or property of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">VIRGINIA CODE \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">At trial, appellant moved to strike the habitual offender charge, arguing that while the indictment stated he had been \u201cadjudicated\u201d an habitual offender, he had in fact been \u201cdeter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>mined\u201d an habitual offender. The Commonwealth argued that, consistent with Code \u00a7 46.2-357, \u201cthe Defendant simply has to have been found an habitual offender.\u201d At that point, the following colloquy occurred between counsel and the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">THE COURT: What have you been precluded from raising here before me today because of the word \u201cadjudicated\u201d in the document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">[COUNSEL]: Well, actually\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">THE COURT: Is there something you haven\u2019t been able to raise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">[COUNSEL]: On the contrary, I would say that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">THE COURT: That\u2019s what I thought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">The jury returned a verdict finding appellant \u201cguilty of habitual offender felony as charged in the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">The sole issue on appeal is whether use of the word \u201cadjudicated\u201d an habitual offender in the indictment and the proof at trial that Morris had been \u201cdetermined\u201d to be an habitual offender constituted a fatal variance between the indictment and the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">Code \u00a7 19.2-220 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-14\">The indictment or information shall be a plain, concise and definite written statement, (1) naming the accused, (2) describing the offense charged, (3) identifying the county, city or town in which the accused committed the offense, and (4) reciting that the accused committed the offense on or about a certain date. In describing the offense, ... the indictment or information may state so much of the common law or statutory definition of the offense as is sufficient to advise what <em>offense </em>is charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">(Emphasis added). \u201cThe indictment should also \u2018cite the statute or ordinance that defines the offense or, if there is no defining statute or ordinance, prescribes the punishment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sims v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 611, 619, 507 S.E.2d 648, 653 (1998) (quoting Rule 3A:6(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">\u201c \u2018[T]he function of an indictment ... is to give an accused notice of the nature and character of the accusations against him in order that he can adequately prepare to defend against his accuser.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Willis v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 430, 437-38, 393 S.E.2d 405, 409 (1990)). \u201c \u2018[M]ere matters of form [will be rejected] where no injury could have resulted therefrom to the accused.\u2019\u201d <em>Griffin v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 409, 411, 412 S.E.2d 709, 711 (1991) (quoting <em>Mitchell v. Commonwealth, </em>141 Va. 541, 558, 127 S.E. 368, 374 (1925)).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In the instant case, appellant was charged with \u201cunlawfully and feloniously drivpng] after having been adjudicated an Habitual Offender.\u201d As required by Code \u00a7 19.2-220, the indictment contained the following information: (1) appellant\u2019s name; (2) a description of the offense charged; (3) the city in which the offense occurred; and (4) the date of the offense. In addition, the indictment clearly identified the statute under which appellant was charged, <em>i.e., </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2). Sig nificantly, in response to direct questioning by the trial judge, counsel could not identify any prejudice resulting from the alleged variance between the indictment and the proof at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Additionally, we conclude that any variance between the terms \u201cadjudicated\u201d and \u201cdetermined,\u201d as applied in this case, is non-fatal. \u201cA variance is fatal ... only when the proof is different from, and irrelevant to the crime defined in the indictment and is, therefore, insufficient to prove the commission of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Hawks v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 244, 247, 321 S.E.2d 650, 652 (1984). \u201cBy statute, an indictment may use the name given to the offense by the common law or may state as much of the common law definition of the offense as is sufficient to advise what offense is charged. No indictment will be deemed invalid for the insertion of any other words or surplusage.\u201d <em>Hairston v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 211, 213-14, 343 S.E.2d 355, 357 (1986) (citations and footnote omitted). \u201cNotice to the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>of the offense charged against him is the rockbed requirement which insures the accused a fair and impartial trial on the merits and forms the key to the fatal variance rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 214, 343 S.E.2d at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In the instant case, Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2) requires simply that appellant be \u201cdetermined <em>or </em>adjudicated\u201d an habitual offender as an element of the offense. (Emphasis added). Use of the word \u201cadjudicated\u201d in the indictment did not change the nature or cause of the accusation against appellant. It did not change the offense that had been committed, nor did it alter the proof required to convict appellant of that crime. The specific method by which appellant had been deemed an habitual offender does not change the nature of the offense under Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2). Thus, the allegation in the indictment that Morris had been \u201cadjudicated\u201d an habitual offender and proof that he had been \u201cdetermined\u201d such did not constitute a fatal variance between the accusation and the proof. Appellant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-12\">. In his petition for appeal, appellant also challenged Jury Instruction 3. However, appellant did not include this issue in his questions presented or in his opening brief. Therefore, we do not address it here. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
