Stockdale (\u201cmother\u201d), to relocate to New Jersey with the parties\u2019 minor children. Father contends the trial court erred by placing on father the burden of proving substantial impairment to his relationship with the children if mother moved them to New Jersey. For the reasons which follow, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u201cWe review the evidence in the light most favorable to [mother], the party prevailing below and grant all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Anderson, </em>29 Va.App. 673, 678, 514 S.E.2d 369, 372 (1999). The parties were married on July 1, 1989, in New Vernon, New Jersey, and later moved to Virginia. Four children were born of the marriage between 1990 and 1995. The parties separated on March 20, 1998, and, thereafter, mother filed a bill of complaint seeking a fault-based divorce from father. In her bill of complaint, mother sought custody of the children, child and spousal support, equitable distribution of marital property, and other relief. The trial court entered a <em>pendente lite </em>order awarding mother, <em>inter alia, </em>custody of the children and child and spousal support. Father filed no answer or cross-bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">On November 3, 1998, still pending a final decree in the matter, mother petitioned the court to permit her to move with the children to New Jersey. Father filed no response to mother\u2019s petition. On June 21 and 22, 1999, a hearing on custody of the children was held. At this time, father filed a brief opposing mother\u2019s petition for relocation. Although the purpose of the hearing was to decide which party was to have custody of the children, the proceedings focused primarily on the issue of relocation, because the parties stipulated at the beginning of the hearing that mother\u2019s physical custody would not be challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court granted mother\u2019s petition for relocation and granted her sole legal and physical custody of the children. In reaching its decision, the court was guided by the factors set forth in Code \u00a7 20-124.3<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>assessing the best interests of the children. The court found that the children\u2019s best interests dictated that mother be permitted to remove them to New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">On July 2, 1999, father filed a petition for reconsideration. Father contended that, in the prior hearing, the court had erroneously placed on him the burden of proving that the children\u2019s relocation would not be in their best interest. The court heard oral argument on July 23, 1999, and took the matter under advisement. No new evidence was introduced at the oral argument. On August 20, 1999, the court denied father\u2019s motion to modify the court\u2019s order allowing mother to relocate with the children. In its oral opinion, the court stated that since the July 23, 1999 hearing it had \u201cused the time\u201d to \u201cget the legal framework straight\u201d and that it was \u201cnow satisfied ... that the burden of proof [on the issue of relocation] is on the moving party. It\u2019s on the [mother] to prove that the move to New Jersey would be in the best interests of the children.\u201d The court further found that, \u201c[h]aving determined that the burden is on the [mother] as the moving party to prove what\u2019s in the best interests of the children ... the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>[mother] has carried that burden by a preponderance of the evidence, which is the standard.\u201d The court further stated that it \u201cwas particularly influenced [in allowing mother to relocate with the children] by the factors in [Code \u00a7] 20-124.3\u201d and that among these, the relationship between the children and each parent, the needs of the children, and the role each parent has played in the children\u2019s lives were particularly important in deciding the case. Accordingly, the court again authorized mother to take the children to New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The court also found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">the husband has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the benefits of a beneficial relationship between himself and the children would be substantially impaired if the children were moved to New Jersey.... I can\u2019t say, given the testimony I have on this record, that the relationship would be substantially impaired____ [According to what I see in the case law, that\u2019s the standard____ That is his burden on that particular issue, and I find that he has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that there would be substantial impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">It is this statement which forms the basis of father\u2019s claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">An order embodying the trial court\u2019s ruling was entered on September 16,1999. A final decree of divorce was entered on November 19, 1999, incorporating the September 16, 1999 order. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">\u201cA court may forbid a custodial parent from removing a child from the state without the court\u2019s permission, or it may permit the child to be removed from the state.\u201d <em>Scinaldi v. Scinaldi </em>2 Va.App. 571, 573, 347 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1986) (citations omitted). \u201c[I]n a court\u2019s decision as to the propriety of relocating the children ... \u2018the welfare of the children is of primary and paramount importance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parish v. Spaulding, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>26 Va.App. 566, 572, 496 S.E.2d 91, 94 (1998), <em>aff'd, </em>257 Va. 357, 513 S.E.2d 391 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u201cIn every judicial proceeding ... the \u2018burden of proof is allocated.\u201d <em>City of Hopewell v. Tirpak, </em>28 Va.App. 100, 113, 502 S.E.2d 161, 167 (1998).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">The phrase \u201cburden of proof\u2019 refers to two related but distinct concepts: (1) the \u201cburden of production,\u201d which is the obligation to make a <em>prima facie </em>case, i.e., to introduce evidence sufficient as a matter of law to enable a rational fact finder to find that a particular proposition of fact is true and (2) the \u201cburden of persuasion,\u201d which is the obligation to introduce evidence that actually persuades the fact finder, to the requisite degree of belief, that a particular proposition of fact is true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 113-14, 502 S.E.2d at 167-68 (internal citations omitted). The burdens of production and persuasion are generally allocated to the party seeking to disturb the status quo. <em>See id. </em>at 114, 502 S.E.2d at 168. \u201cIn accordance with our prior decisions, the moving party bears the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Bostick v. Bostick-Bennett, </em>23 Va.App. 527, 535, 478 S.E.2d 319, 323 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">In the present case, father contends the trial court erred by imposing upon him the burden of persuasion on a particular issue, viz. whether his relationship with his children would be \u201csubstantially impaired\u201d by allowing mother to move them to New Jersey. He argues that mother, as the moving party, had the burden to prove that the relocation would not substantially impair that relationship. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">As we stated in <em>Bostick, </em>\u201cthe moving party bears the burden of proof.\u201d 23 Va.App. at 535, 478 S.E.2d at 323. The trial court generally agreed with this principle, stating, \u201cI am ... satisfied ... that the burden of proof is on the moving party. It\u2019s on the [mother] to prove that the move to New Jersey would be in the best interests of the children.\u201d Mother, therefore, bore the \u201cburden of proof,\u201d i.e. the burdens of production and persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>However, as father points out, the court also stated that it found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\"><em>the [father] has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence </em>that the benefits of a beneficial relationship between himself and the children would be substantially impaired if the children were moved to New Jersey.... According to what I see in the case law, that\u2019s the standard he has to [satisfy]. <em>That is his burden on that particular issue, and I find that he has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that there would be substantial impairment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">(Emphasis added). The trial court apparently derived from <em>Scinaldi </em>the view that father was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a \u201csubstantial impairment\u201d of his relationship with the children would result from their removal from Virginia. <em>See 2 </em>Va.App. at 575, 347 S.E.2d at 151. <em>Scinaldi </em>imposes no such burden. Indeed, the allocation of the burden of proof was not at issue in that case. Rather, <em>Scinaldi </em>turned upon multiple factors, chiefly the trial court\u2019s failure to address the best interests of the children and the insufficiency of the evidence on the issue. <em>See id. </em>at 574, 347 S.E.2d at 151. In this case, the trial court erroneously ruled that father was required to prove \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that there would be substantial impairment\u201d to his relationship with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We find the court\u2019s error harmless, however. \u2018When it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached, no judgment shall be ... reversed ... [f]or any ... error committed on the trial.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-678; <em>see Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en banc) </em>(\u201cCode \u00a7 8.01-678 applies to both civil and criminal cases.\u201d). \u201cThe burden is on the party who alleges reversible error to show that reversal is justified.\u201d <em>D\u2019Agnese v. D\u2019Agnese, 22 </em>Va.App. 147, 153, 468 S.E.2d 140, 143 (1996).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">[W]here a burdened party has presented evidence [sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case], the burden of proof is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>longer relevant and the fact finder must decide which party prevails based on the weight of the evidence. In such a situation, a misallocation of the burden of proof will be considered harmless error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\"><em>Erie Ins. Co./Erie Ins. Exchange v. Flood, </em>168 Pa.Cmwlth. 258, 649 A.2d 736, 740 (1994) (citations omitted); <em>see Great Coastal Exp., Inc. v. Ellington, </em>230 Va. 142, 155, 334 S.E.2d 846, 855 (1985) (trial court error regarding burden of proof was harmless because fact finder necessarily found that plaintiff had carried its burden); <em>J.B. King &amp; Co. v. C.W. Hancock &amp; Sons, </em>114 Va. 596, 606, 77 S.E. 510, 514 (1913) (even had trial court misallocated burden of proof, it would have been harmless because evidence left no doubt that plaintiff carried its burden of proof, there being no testimony in the case except its own and that of its witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The trial court found that mother met her burden of proving that removal of the children to New Jersey would serve their best interests. In particular, the court cited evidence of the quality of the schools in the community to which she planned to move; the generally good environment the community would provide; the nature of the relationship between the children and each parent, including the fact that mother was the primary caregiver for the children; the children\u2019s needs, given their young ages; the improvement of mother\u2019s ability to provide for the children financially that would result from the relocation; and the role each parent has played and would continue to play in the children\u2019s lives. The court found that, on balance, mother \u201ccarried [her] burden by a preponderance of the evidence, which is the standard. It\u2019s whatever\u2019s over 50 percent. And ... I believe that she ... prove[d] that\u201d the relocation would serve the best interests of the children. \u201cThe decree of the [c]hancellor determining questions of fact on conflicting evidence <em>ore tenus </em>has the weight of a jury verdict, and will be permitted to stand unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Carpenter v. Carpenter, </em>220 Va. 299, 302, 257 S.E.2d 845, 848 (1979). Thus, because mother established her <em>prima facie </em>case, the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>error in placing an affirmative burden of proof on father was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Moreover, father presented no evidence to controvert the mother\u2019s evidence that his relationship with the children would not be substantially impaired. Indeed, father presented no evidence at all. <em>See Redford v. Booker, </em>166 Va. 561, 569-70, 185 S.E. 879, 883 (1936) (Once \u201c[a] <em>prima facie </em>case is made out ... the burden then rests upon the [opposing party] to produce evidence if [the <em>prima facie </em>case] is to be overcome.\u201d). The court, therefore, had only mother\u2019s evidence upon which to rely in deciding the case, and that evidence clearly supported the court\u2019s decision. Thus, it plainly appears from the record that the court\u2019s error of law occurred after mother had met her burden of production to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. \u201cIn such a situation, misallocation of the burden of proof will be considered harmless error.\u201d <em>Flood, </em>649 A.2d at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\">.
