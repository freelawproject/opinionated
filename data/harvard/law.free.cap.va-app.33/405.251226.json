On appeal, he contends the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u201cOn appeal, \u2018we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 881 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">So viewed, the evidence proved that Sergeant Donnie Jordan of the Hampton University Police Department initiated a lawful traffic stop of a vehicle driven by appellant on Hampton Harbor Avenue. Hampton Harbor Avenue, which leads directly to the University library, is approximately ten yards wide and is bounded on three sides by Hampton University property. The property consists of retail shops and residential apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">During the course of Jordan\u2019s investigation, he discovered that appellant\u2019s license was suspended. As a result, Jordan advised appellant that he could not drive the vehicle. The police subsequently recovered from either Jordan or the vehicle two handguns, a bag containing marijuana, and another bag containing $5,500 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Appellant\u2019s argument is two-fold. First, he contends Code \u00a7 18.2-255.2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not apply because the property surrounding the location of his arrest, although owned by Hampton University, is not property of a \u201cschool\u201d as contemplated by subpart (i) of the statute because the property is not used for educational purposes. Second, he -argues the street where he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>was stopped is not \u201cproperty open to public use\u201d under subpart (ii) of the statute because the evidence did not show that children congregated on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In evaluating appellant\u2019s arguments, we are mindful that Code \u00a7 18.2-255.2 is a penal statute and, as such, \u201cmust be strictly construed against the state and limited in application to cases falling clearly within the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 459, 309 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1983). But, \u201ca statute should never be construed so that it leads to absurd results.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). Moreover, \u201cwords and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning unless a different intention is fairly manifest.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994) (citing <em>Huffman v. Kite, </em>198 Va. 196, 199, 93 S.E.2d 328, 331 (1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Appellant contends that \u201cproperty, including buildings and grounds,\u201d as used in subpart (i) of the statute, means property used for educational purposes, or a \u201ccampus\u201d as that term is commonly used. Here, appellant notes, Jordan testified that the property surrounding the site of the arrest is not part of Hampton University\u2019s \u201ccampus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Even if we accept for the sake of argument that the words \u201cbuildings and grounds\u201d refer only to property used for educational purposes or a \u201ccampus,\u201d the statute does not limit the word \u201cproperty\u2019 to that term. The statute merely states that \u201cbuildings and grounds\u201d are \u201cinclude[ed]\u201d in the definition of \u201cproperty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Here, it is clear that the arrest took place within 1,000 feet of Hampton University property. If the word \u201cproperty\u201d is to be given a definition other than its normal meaning, then it is the job of the General Assembly to do so. The statute we review in this case contains no such limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Appellant also contends the street where he was stopped is not \u201cproperty open to public use\u201d under subpart (ii) of the statute, as, he alleges, that term was defined or limited by us in <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 620, 496 S.E.2d 117 (1998). In <em>Smith, </em>we emphasized that the property upon which the defendant was arrested was \u201copen to public use\u201d because the evidence showed that the property was \u201cthe type of place where school age children congregate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626, 496 S.E.2d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Again, even if, for the sake of argument, we accept appellant\u2019s interpretation of our decision in <em>Smith, </em>appellant\u2019s argument fails. Appellant does not recognize the complete language of subpart (ii) of the statute. That language provides that an offense occurs if the controlled substance is possessed \u201cupon public property <em>or </em>any property open to public use\u201d that is within 1,000 feet of school property. (Emphasis added.) Here, the evidence showed, and appellant concedes in his brief, that he was \u201cstopped on a public thoroughfare.\u201d Thus, because subpart (ii) of the statute is written in the disjunctive, the conviction stands because appellant possessed the drugs on \u201cpublic property.\u201d We need not decide whether appellant was stopped on \u201cproperty open to public use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">For these reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-9\">. At the time of the offense, the statute read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">A. It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture, sell or distribute or possess with intent to sell, give or distribute any controlled substance, imitation controlled substance or marijuana at any time while (i) upon the property, including buildings and grounds, of any public or private elementary, secondary, or post secondary school, or any public or private two-year or four-year institution of higher education; (ii) upon public property or any property open to public use within 1,000 feet of such school property....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">Code \u00a7 18.2-255.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
