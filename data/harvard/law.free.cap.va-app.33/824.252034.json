Ellis sustained a compensable injury arising out of his employment on May 26,1998. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the commission\u2019s award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">Ellis worked as a truck driver at Southside Virginia Training Center from April 9, 1986 through 1999. Ellis\u2019 position as a truck driver required him to travel to various buildings on the campus and take carts filled with empty food trays to a central location. On occasion, when the people using the food trays had failed to place the empty tray on the cart, Ellis and other employees in his job position took the empty trays from the dining tables and put them on the top of the cart or in one of the lower slots if the top of the cart was full.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>On April 5, 1997, Ellis sustained a back injury when he bent to lift one of the empty trays from a cart to a nearby cabinet. This injury was found to be compensable. Ellis was taken off work for a brief period of time and then returned to work on light duty. For his light duty assignment, Ellis was given a desk job which required him to maintain records of food inventory in the storeroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">By May 1998, Ellis was returned to full duty work. On May 26, 1998, he walked into one of the campus buildings with a fellow employee to get the cart of empty trays. However, he noticed that one empty tray was left on one of the dining tables. Ellis went to the table and lifted the tray, which held an empty bowl and plate and weighed approximately ten pounds or less. He then twisted to his side and bent from the waist to place the tray in the cart. Because the top of the cart was full, he had to bend to a point approximately twelve inches above floor level to slide the tray into an empty slot. As Ellis stood up, his back went out. The employee, who was with him came to his aid and helped him get medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Ellis\u2019 claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits was initially denied. A hearing was subsequently held before the commission on May 20, 1999. Ellis sought medical benefits for the May 26, 1998 injury, which he claimed was work-related. The Commonwealth argued that the injury was not caused by an \u201caccident arising out of employment as there was no risk of employment involved.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">During the hearing, the commission considered testimony from Ellis and the employee who witnessed the incident, as well as various reports from Ellis\u2019 treating physicians. The commission found that, based on our decision in <em>Richard E. Brown, Inc. v. Caporaletti, </em>12 Va.App. 242, 402 S.E.2d 709 (1991), the injury was compensable because the activity of bending, prior to straightening, created a risk of injury result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>ing from the conditions of the workplace. The full commission affirmed this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-5\">By statutory mandate, \u201can award of the [cjommission ... shall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A). Thus, we have often expressed our standard of review as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-6\">\u201cIn reviewing the commission\u2019s decision, we are guided by well-settled principles. \u2018[I]t is fundamental that a finding of fact made by the [cjommission is conclusive and binding upon this court on review.\u2019 \u2018[TJhat contrary evidence may be in the record is of no consequence if there is credible evidence to support the [cjommission\u2019s findings.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-7\">\u201cThe scope of a judicial review of the fact finding function of a workers\u2019 compensation commission [, therefore,] is \u2018severely limited, partly in deference to the agency\u2019s expertise in a specialized field.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-8\"><em>Georgiar-Pacific Corp. v. Robinson, </em>32 Va.App. 1, 4-5, 526 S.E.2d 267, 268 (2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Here, it is not disputed that Ellis\u2019 injury was sustained during, the course of his employment. However, \u201c[i]n order to be compensable, ... the injury \u2018must also arise out of the employment; the injury must be caused by the conditions of the workplace.\u2019 The claimant must \u2018prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the accident \u201carose out of and in the course of his employment^]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Vint v. Alleghany Regional Hosp., </em>32 Va.App. 60, 63, 526 S.E.2d 295, 297 (2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Whether an injury arose out of the employment is a mixed question of law and fact properly reviewable by this Court. <em>Norfolk Community Hosp. v. Smith, </em>33 Va.App. 1, 4, 531 S.E.2d 576, 578 (2000). In making these determinations, \u201cVirginia employs the actual risk test. A claimant\u2019s injury arises out of the employment if the manner in which the employer requires the work to be performed is causally related to the resulting injury.\u201d <em>Vint, </em>32 Va.App. at 63-64, 526 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>S.E.2d at 297. As the commission noted in its opinion \u201cin <em>[Brown,\\ </em>the employee spent about five minutes in a bent over position [working on a furnace,] and sustained an injury to his back while straightening up. The Court held that the injury was compensable [, because] [although he was merely straightening up at the time of the injury, this was connected to the previous activities of the claimant [laying the 100 pound furnace on its side].\u201d We found that these activities were \u201cpeculiar to his work.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>12 Va.App. at 245, 402 S.E.2d at 711. However, we have specifically held that \u201c[a]n injury does not arise out of the employment when it \u2018cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and ... comes from a hazard to which the workmen would have been equally exposed apart from the employment. The causative danger must be peculiar to the work and not common to the neighborhood.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vint, </em>32 Va.App. at 63-64, 526 S.E.2d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">Put another way, an injury is not compensable merely because it occurred during the performance of some employment duty if the act performed by the employee is not a causative hazard of the employment. Simple acts of walking, bending, or turning, without any other contributing environmental factors, are not risks of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">\u201cOn appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the claimant, who prevailed before the commission.\u201d <em>Allen &amp; Rocks, Inc. v. Briggs, </em>28 Va.App. 662, 672, 508 S.E.2d 335, 340 (1998) (citations omitted). Here, the testimony of Ellis and his fellow employee established that Ellis was injured after bending to pick up the tray. The action of bending was neither unusual, awkward, nor something that Ellis was required to do on a repetitive basis. <em>Grove v. Allied Signal, Inc., </em>15 Va.App. 17, 21-22, 421 S.E.2d 32, 34-35 (1992); <em>see also Vint, </em>32 Va.App. at 65-66, 526 S.E.2d at 297-98. In such cases, we have held that \u201c[a]n injury resulting from merely bending over to do something does not arise out of the employment ... [because] merely bending over is a risk to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>which the general public is equally exposed.\u201d <em>Vint, </em>32 Va. App. at 65-66, 526 S.E.2d at 297-98.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Our Supreme Court has noted that in an appropriate case, \u201c[i]t is generally held ... that the words \u2018arising out of and in the course of employment\u2019 should receive a liberal construction in order to carry out the humane and beneficent purposes of the act.\u201d <em>Bradshaw v. Aronovitch, </em>170 Va. 329, 336, 196 S.E. 684, 686 (1938). However, we have recognized that these words \u201ccannot be liberalized by judicial interpretation for the purpose of allowing compensation on <em>every </em>claim asserted.\u201d <em>Vint, </em>32 Va.App. at 63, 526 S.E.2d at 297 (emphasis added). \u201c[A] claimant [must] show that the conditions of the workplace or that some significant work related exertion caused the injury.\u201d <em>Plumb Rite Plumbing Service v. Barbour, </em>8 Va.App. 482, 484, 382 S.E.2d 305, 306 (1989). The record contains no such showing, and the mere happening of an accident at the workplace, not caused by any work-related risk or significant work-related exertion, is not compensable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Accordingly, ,we reverse the commission\u2019s decision, vacate the award of benefits and render final judgment for the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\">. The Attorney General also argued that the injury was a new injury and not a change in condition. The commission found that the injury was a new injury. This finding is not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\">. We also note that the record established Ellis' duties as a truck driver required him to drive trucks to various locations and gather carts already filled with the empty trays. Although there was testimony that Ellis and his fellow employees would \u201cbus\u201d tables from time to time, the commission made no factual finding that Ellis was required to pick up trays from tables and put them into the carts, nor does the record establish, absent speculation, that this activity was related or incident to Ellis\u2019 employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
