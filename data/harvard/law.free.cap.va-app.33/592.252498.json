Because the record reflects that appellant was both charged with and convicted for violating Lynch-burg Ordinance 27-13 rather than Code \u00a7 18.2-416, we reject appellant\u2019s first assignment of error. However, we agree that the evidence, as found by the trial court, was insufficient to establish that appellant\u2019s statements were uttered under circumstances having a direct tendency to provoke an immediate breach of the peace. Therefore, we reverse and dismiss appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">At about 2:00 a.m. on June 24, 1999, Officer Hanson and Lieutenant Swisher approached appellant to question him about a vehicle registration problem. During an earlier encounter at about 1:00 a.m., appellant had denied that the vehicle in question belonged to him, and Officer Hanson had accepted appellant\u2019s representations. However, when Lieutenant Swisher saw appellant \u201cstanding at the [same] car\u201d at about 2:00 a.m., Hanson and Swisher returned to question appellant further. During the first encounter, appellant had the odor of alcohol on his breath and was belligerent, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Hanson \u201cwas intimidated by him.\u201d As a result, when the second encounter began, Hanson called for backup, and Officer Edwards arrived on the scene sometime thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">While Hanson and Swisher were attempting to talk to appellant during the second encounter, appellant walked across the street from the car and sat on the front porch steps of a residence. Three or four other people were also seated on that porch but did not make any threats or become involved in the encounter in any significant way. When the officers asked appellant to come down from the porch, he was uncooperative, telling them to come up instead, and he \u201cwouldn\u2019t answer any of [the officers\u2019] questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The officers \u2014 who had learned the vehicle did, in fact, belong to appellant and that he had lived in Virginia for six months without obtaining a Virginia driver\u2019s license or vehicle registration \u2014 decided to effect an \u201cinvestigative detention\u201d in the hope of gaining greater cooperation from appellant, and they began to place him in handcuffs. When the officers decided to place appellant in handcuffs and told him he was under arrest, they were about twenty feet away from appellant\u2019s location on the porch. As they approached the porch, appellant began to make comments, and \u201cthe comments continued [as Swisher] actually placed him in handcuffs\u201d and Hanson \u201cusher[ed] him off the front steps.\u201d In a sarcastic, \u201cslightly belligerent manner,\u201d \u201ca little louder than normal conversation, but [not] screaming,\u201d appellant \u201ccalled [the officers] fucking pigs, [and said they] were fucking jokes ... [and] should be at a fucking donut shop.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although Officer Hanson believed appellant was \u201cyelling the comments in a threatening fashion,\u201d appellant was seated when he began to make these comments and did not shake his fists, show a weapon or make any verbal threats. Appellant stiffened up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>and did not attempt \u201cto comply with [the officers\u2019] commands\u201d as they physically took him into custody and handcuffed him, but they did not have to use their mace or other weaponry, and appellant made no \u201cmotion to attack\u201d any of the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Lieutenant Swisher testified that he was not afraid of appellant and \u201cdidn\u2019t see anything that would lead [him] to believe that Officer Hanson was fearful of [appellant].\u201d Officer Edwards testified that he \u201cwas cautious as far as officer safety\u201d but \u201cwasn\u2019t afraid of [appellant]\u201d and \u201cbasically tuned [appellant] out\u201d because he \u201cdidn\u2019t care to hear what [appellant] had to say.\u201d Officer Hanson testified he was \u201cintimidated by [appellant]\u201d during the first encounter and that appellant \u201cyell[ed] the comments [in the second encounter] in a threatening fashion,\u201d but he gave no testimony that he was intimidated, felt threatened, or thought he was going to have to fight appellant during the second encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Appellant was charged with violating Lynchburg Ordinance 27-13. However, at his bench trial, the court asked appellant\u2019s counsel \u201cwhich Code section ... [appellant\u2019s breach of the peace charge was] under.\u201d Counsel responded that it was \u201c[Code \u00a7] 18.2-416, breach of [the] peace.\u201d Counsel did not indicate that appellant was charged under the corresponding local ordinance and did not object to being tried under the statute rather than the ordinance. All subsequent references at trial were to Code \u00a7 18.2-416 rather than the corresponding Lynchburg ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Appellant moved to strike at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and again at the close of all the evidence. In denying the first motion, the court held that the language in <em>Ford v. City of Newport News, </em>23 Va.App. 137, 474 S.E.2d 848 (1996), concerning First Amendment protections for verbal criticism of police officers was \u201cdicta in [appellant\u2019s] case\u201d because <em>Ford </em>involved the disorderly conduct statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-415, whereas appellant\u2019s case involved the abusive language statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-416. It also held that, even if the statements regarding the amount of verbal abuse police officers are required to absorb under the First Amendment were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>applicable, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, \u201chas ... risen above that level.\u201d In denying the second motion and convicting appellant of the charged offense, the trial court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">I find that at the time [appellant] was being cuffed he did use the language as described by Officer Swisher and that was in a slightly belligerent manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">You have to remember that police officers are human beings too. And while they do have to absorb a certain amount of abuse, they are protected by this statute also for the reason that they might sort of snap under the circumstances and do something that would cause harm to the defendant and be charged with something themselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">So these were fighting words under the circumstances. That\u2019s the whole idea under this statute. And I find [appellant] guilty of violating Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-416 in that he used the language that he did under the circumstances because [it was] reasonably calculated to cause a breach of the peace.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Although all references at trial were to Code \u00a7 18.2-416, the conviction order indicates that the court found appellant guilty of violating \u201c27-13,\u201d the Lynchburg ordinance under which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">JURISDICTION TO CONVICT UNDER VIRGINIA CODE RATHER THAN LOCAL ORDINANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">Appellant contends first that the court lacked jurisdiction to convict him of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-416 because he was originally charged under Lynchburg Ordinance 27-13 and the court did not amend the charge to reflect the similar Virginia statute. He admits he failed to object to this discrepancy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the trial court but contends the good cause and ends of justice exceptions to Rule 5A:18 compel us to consider this error.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Assuming without deciding that appellant\u2019s assignment of error is properly before us,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we nevertheless conclude that no reversible error occurred. Settled principles provide that \u201c[a] court speaks through its orders and those orders are presumed to accurately reflect what transpired.\u201d <em>McBride v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 30, 35, 480 S.E.2d 126, 128 (1997). This presumption also applies where an order conflicts with a transcript of related proceedings. <em>See Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 280-81, 257 S.E.2d 808, 822 (1979). Here, although the trial transcript indicates the court convicted appellant under Code \u00a7 18.2-416, the conviction order provides that the conviction was rendered pursuant to \u201c27-13,\u201d which is the Lynchburg ordinance under which appellant was originally charged. Because no inconsistency exists between the original charge and the order of conviction, no reversible error exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The judgment of the trial court will be disturbed only if plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Lynchburg Ordinance 27-13, which is almost identical to the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-416,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfO\">If any person shall in the presence or hearing of another curse or abuse such other person, or use any violent abusive language to such person concerning himself or any of his relatives, or otherwise use such language under circumstances briefly calculated to provide a breach of the peace, he shall be guilty of a class 3 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The Virginia Supreme Court has observed that the corresponding state statute \u201cis aimed at preventing personal, face-to-face, abusive and insulting language\u201d likely to \u201cprecipitate an immediate, forceful and violent reaction by a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Mercer v. Winston, </em>214 Va. 281, 284, 199 S.E.2d 724, 726 (1973). The statute is constitutional if its application is limited to words that \u201chave a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person at whom, individually, the remark is addressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Chaplinsky, </em>91 N.H. 310, 18 A.2d 754, 758 (1941), <em>aff'd, </em>315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942) (where accused, in custody of traffic officer on city street, encountered city marshall, who was responding to scene of riot precipitated in part by accused, and called him a \u201cGod damned racketeer\u201d and \u201cdamned Fascist\u201d and said the \u201cwhole government of Rochester are Fascists or agents of Fascists,\u201d evidence established that \u201cappellations\u201d were \u201cepithets likely to provoke the average person to retaliation, and thereby cause a breach of the peace\u201d)). By analogy, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>similar local ordinance is constitutional if interpreted in the same fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">As we noted in <em>Ford, </em>23 Va.App. at 143, 474 S.E.2d at 850-51, which involved a related statute also requiring proof that the proscribed behavior has a \u201cdirect tendency to cause acts of violence,\u201d the United States Supreme Court has emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">\u201cthe First Amendment protects a significant amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers. \u2018Speech is often provocative and challenging.... [But it] is nevertheless protected against censorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance or unrest.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 143, 474 S.E.2d at 851 (quoting <em>City of Houston v. Hill, </em>482 U.S. 451, 461, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2509, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987) (quoting <em>Terminiello v. City of Chicago, </em>337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 896, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949))) (interpreting statute proscribing interference with a police officer in the execution of his duties). \u201cThe freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>482 U.S. at 462-63, 107 S.Ct. at 2510; <em>see id. </em>at 463 n. 12, 107 S.Ct. at 2510-11 n. 12 (citing with approval 1929 case reversing conviction of individual who said to police officer, \u201cYou big muttonhead, do you think you are a czar around here?\u201d (quoting <em>Ruthenbeck v. First Crim. Judicial Court of Bergen County, 7 </em>N.J. Misc. 969, 147 A. 625, 625 (1929))). The United States Courts of Appeals for the Second, Eighth and Ninth Circuits have applied <em>Hill </em>to hold that \u201cthe \u2018fighting words\u2019 doctrine may be limited in the case of communications addressed to properly trained police officers because police officers are expected to exercise greater restraint in their response than the average citizen.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Buff-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>kins v. City of Omaha, </em>922 F.2d 465, 472 (8th Cir.1990) (holding as a matter of law that telling a police officer he was an \u201casshole\u201d while departing airport interview room did not constitute fighting words in absence of evidence that speaker became violent or threatened violence); <em>see Posr v. Court Officer Shield #207, </em>180 F.3d 409, 415-16 (2d Cir.1999); <em>Duran v. City of Douglas, </em>904 F.2d 1372, 1377 (9th Cir.1990). These requirements apply to both Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-415 and 18.2-416 because both have been interpreted to comply with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>First Amendment only if they punish specified acts or utterances that have a \u201cdirect tendency to cause acts of violence by the person at whom, individually, the [remark or conduct is addressed or directed].\u201d <em>Mercer, </em>214 Va. at 284, 199 S.E.2d at 726 (interpreting predecessor to Code \u00a7 18.2-416); <em>Squire v. Pace, </em>380 F.Supp. 269, 278-79 (W.D.Va.1974) (declaring predecessor to Code \u00a7 18.2-415 unconstitutional because not limited to acts having direct tendency to cause acts of violence), <em>aff'd, </em>516 F.2d 240 (4th Cir.1975); 1976 Va. Acts ch. 244 (amending new disorderly conduct statute, Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014415, enacted pursuant to 1975 Va. Acts chs. 14, 15, to proscribe only conduct having direct tendency to cause acts of violence).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Under this standard, we conclude, as a matter of law, that appellant\u2019s words did not have the necessary \u201cdirect tendency\u201d to cause \u201can immediate, forceful and violent reaction by a reasonable person\u201d in the position of the police officers at whom the words were directed. Although appellant stiffened up when the officers began to handcuff him, he made no threatening gestures and merely expressed contempt for the officers in a general sense when he called them \u201cfucking pigs\u201d and \u201cfucking jokes\u201d and said they \u201cshould be at a fucking donut shop.\u201d <em>See Chaplinsky, </em>18 A.2d at 762 (noting that the words, \u201cdamned Fascist,\u201d were \u201cfighting words\u201d when addressed to the average American in 1941 but might not so qualify at a different time); <em>R.I.T. v. State, </em>675 So.2d 97, 99 (Ala.Crim.App.1995) (noting that \u201c[w]ords must be evaluated in the era in which they are uttered \u2014 words that constitute fighting words change from generation to generation, or even more quickly\u201d and holding that teenager\u2019s statement to officer, \u201cfuck you,\u201d made in presence only of officer and teenager\u2019s parents and brother as teenager walked away from officer did not constitute fighting words under heightened standard applied to police officers); Christine Egan, <em>\u201cFighting Words\u201d Doctrine: Are Police Officers Held To A Higher Standard, Or Per Bailey v. State, Do We Expect No More From Our Law Enforcement Officers Than We Do From The Average Arkansan?, </em>52 Ark.L.Rev. 591, 591-92 (1999) (\u201cMuch has changed since <em>[Chaplinsky </em>was decided] in 1942. Our society is much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>coarser, both in its language and its conduct. What constituted \u2018fighting words\u2019 in 1942 is unlikely to even raise an eyebrow today.\u201d). This is precisely the type of \u201cverbal criticism [of] ... police officers\u201d that is \u201c \u2018protected against censorship or punishment\u2019 \u201d by the First Amendment because it is not, under the circumstances established by the record, \u201c \u2018likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance or unrest.\u2019\u201d <em>Hill, </em>482 U.S. at 461, 107 S.Ct. at 2509 (quoting <em>Terminiello, </em>337 U.S. at 4, 69 S.Ct. at 896). <em>Compare Mercer, </em>214 Va. at 284-87 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1, 199 S.E.2d at 726-28 &amp; n. 1 (denying habeas petition for 1971 conviction under abusive language statute where protester involved in racial disturbance that \u201capproached near riot proportions\u201d waved his hands and uttered multiple racial epithets at police officer, including \u201cyou white son of a bitch,\u201d \u201cyou honky pig,\u201d \u201cyou white mother fucker,\u201d \u201cwhite bastard\u201d and \u201cpig\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">For these reasons, we hold, as a matter of law, that the evidence was insufficient to prove appellant\u2019s statements had a direct tendency to provoke an immediate breach of the peace by reasonably trained police officers in the position of the officers to whom the remarks were addressed. Therefore, we reverse and dismiss appellant\u2019s conviction on these grounds, and we find it unnecessary to consider appellant\u2019s contention that he did not make the statements in a face-to-face encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\">. Appellant also was charged with failing to register a vehicle and having no driver\u2019s license. He pleaded guilty to those charges and does not contest them on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\">. Each of the three officers gave a slightly different account of precisely what appellant said, how close the officers were to him when he made those statements, and whether he had been handcuffed yet. Because the trial court found that appellant \u201cuse[d] the language as described by Officer Swisher\u201d \"at the time he was being handcuffed\" and that he did so \u201cin a slightly belligerent manner,\u201d we rely on these facts on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-9\">. It is arguable from the record that appellant invited or consented to being convicted under the statute rather than the local ordinance. When the trial court asked appellant\u2019s counsel at trial what code section applied, counsel responded that it was \"[Code \u00a7] 18.2-416, breach of [the] peace.\u201d Counsel did not indicate that appellant was charged under the corresponding local ordinance and did not object to appellant\u2019s being tried under the statute rather than the ordinance. Counsel\u2019s closing argument also referenced the statute rather than the ordinance. <em>Cf. Fontaine v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 156, 163-65, 487 S.E.2d 241, 244 \u2014 45 (1997) (holding that mere failure to object to conviction for offense not lesser included in charged offense does not constitute waiver of right not to be convicted for offense not charged); <em>Manns v.

To the extent <em>Burgess v. City of Virginia Beach, 9 </em>Va.App. 163, 167, 385 S.E.2d 59, 61 (1989), holds law enforcement officers are not required to exercise a higher degree of restraint than ordinary citizens, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>we view it as conflicting with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Hill, </em>482 U.S. at 461-63 &amp; n. 12, 107 S.Ct. at 2510-11 &amp; n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\"><em>Burgess </em>was briefed in this Court in 1987, the same year in which <em>Hill </em>was decided. Although the decision in <em>Hill </em>was released prior to the briefing in <em>Burgess, </em>neither Burgess nor the City of Virginia Beach cited <em>Hill </em>to the Court, and the <em>Burgess </em>opinion makes no reference to <em>Hill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">In deciding <em>Burgess, </em>we noted Justice Powell\u2019s concurrence in <em>Lewis v. New Orleans, </em>415 U.S. 130, 94 S.Ct. 970, 39 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974), and held, in essence, that we were not bound by it. <em>See 9 </em>Va.App. at 167-68, 385 S.E.2d at 61. We made no reference to <em>Hill, </em>in which the United States Supreme Court quoted Justice Powell\u2019s concurrence in <em>Lewis </em>and concluded, as discussed more fully in the text of this opinion, that \"[t]he freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>482 U.S. at 462-63, 107 S.Ct. at 2510.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">In our subsequent decision in <em>Ford, </em>23 Va.App. at 144, 474 S.E.2d at 851, we quoted extensively from <em>Hill, </em>recognizing, at least implicitly, its holding that police officers are, in fact, required to exercise a higher degree of restraint when confronted by language or conduct which is offensive but does not have a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the language or conduct is directed. Applying that standard to Ford\u2019s conviction for disorderly conduct, we held as follows: \"There is simply no evidence in the record to support the reasonable belief that the defendant\u2019s conduct would cause <em>a reasonable officer </em>to respond with physical force or violence or that the officers considered the defendant\u2019s throwing his arms in the air to be an assault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Thus, our decision in <em>Ford </em>recognized and applied Hill's holding that the First Amendment requires properly trained police officers to exercise a higher degree of restraint when confronted by disorderly conduct and abusive language. Because our holding in <em>Ford </em>interpreted and applied the United States Supreme Court\u2019s precedent from <em>Hill </em>whereas our holding in <em>Burgess </em>did not consider <em>Hill, </em>we find controlling the reasoning of <em>Hill, </em>as interpreted and applied in <em>Ford, </em>and conclude that <em>Burgess, </em>to the extent it conflicts with <em>Hill </em>and <em>Ford, </em>is not controlling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
