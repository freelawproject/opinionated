For the reasons that follow, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">\u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u2018[t]he burden is upon [the defendant] to show that th[e] ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee v.

Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 647, 652, 514 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1999) (citation omitted). \u201cIn performing such analysis, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong1 or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee, </em>25 Va.App. at 198, 487 S.E.2d at 261 (citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">On August 15, 1998, Richmond police officers, Douglas P. Vilkowski and Jason A. Yarema, were on patrol and stopped a car with no front license plate. The car was driven by Jesse Hamlin, appellant\u2019s cousin. Calvin Hamlin, the appellant, occupied the front passenger seat, and Mathew Pitchford was a passenger in the rear seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Yarema saw appellant reaching down and forward in front of his seat, and believing that appellant might have a weapon, Yarema approached the passenger side of the vehicle to ask appellant to get out of the car. When appellant complied, Yarema briefly placed handcuffs on appellant and patted him down for weapons. He found none. Officer Yarema then looked into the vehicle and found a brown paper bag containing an open bottle of beer on the floorboard in front of the passenger seat. He then looked under the passenger seat for weapons and found none. Officer Yarema next asked appellant to get back in the car, which appellant did. Yarema asked appellant and Pitchford for identification in order to investigate a possible open container violation, although he did not share his purpose with them. During this time, Vilkowski was charging Jesse Hamlin with driving on a suspended license.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>After receiving identification from appellant and Pitchford, Officer Yarema walked to the rear of the stopped vehicle where he could keep the occupants in view while he communicated their identifying information to the dispatcher. Within fifteen to twenty seconds, Yarema noticed appellant again reaching down and forward in the vehicle. Yarema then walked back to the passenger side of the vehicle and shined his flashlight inside. He saw appellant holding a clear plastic bag with a white powder substance, in the process of placing it under the seat. Yarema told appellant to put his hands up and get out of the car. When appellant failed to comply, Yarema opened the door and physically removed appellant. After a brief struggle, Yarema and Officer Vilkowski placed him under arrest. Found in appellant\u2019s hand was a red pouch containing a digital scale, razor blades, tinfoil, cut squares of paper and mannitol (a cutting agent for narcotics). The white powder later tested positive for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Appellant argues that once Yarema satisfied himself there were no weapons on appellant\u2019s person or within his reach in the vehicle, the officer had no authority to further detain him by requesting identification and asking him to be seated in the car. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\u201cThe [F]ourth [AJmendment does not proscribe all seizures, only those that are \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 Whether a seizure is unreasonable is determined by balancing the individual\u2019s right to be free from arbitrary government intrusions against society\u2019s countervailing interest in preventing or detecting crime and in protecting its law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Bethea v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 474, 476, 419 S.E.2d 249, 250 (1992) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>245 Va. 416, 429 S.E.2d 211 (1993). The validity of a seizure \u201c \u2018turns on an objective assessment of the officer\u2019s actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at the time,\u2019 and not on the officer\u2019s actual state of mind at the time the challenged action was taken.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Macon, </em>472 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>U.S. 463, 470-71, 105 S.Ct. 2778, 2783, 86 L.Ed.2d 370 (1985) (quoting <em>Scott v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 136, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 1723, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In <em>Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. 882, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997), in ruling that an officer may order a passenger from a vehicle, the United States Supreme Court noted that \u201cas a practical matter, the passengers are already stopped by virtue of the stop of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413-14, 117 S.Ct. at 886. We have held previously that officers may detain passengers until the completion of a lawful traffic stop. See <em>Hatcher v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 487, 491-92, 419 S.E.2d 256, 259 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Under these facts, the vehicle was the subject of a lawful traffic stop, and appellant was necessarily detained for the duration of that event.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Following a lawful traffic stop, the Fourth Amendment permits the police to order the passengers to get out of the car pending the completion of the stop. This authority over passengers at a lawful traffic stop is deemed a \u201creasonable\u201d seizure under the Fourth Amendment because the \u201cweighty [public] interest in officer safety\u201d during traffic stops, which \u201cmay be dangerous encounters,\u201d sufficiently outweighs the minimal additional intrusion upon the private interests of passengers, who \u201care already stopped by virtue of the [lawful] stop of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>519 U.S. at 413-14, 117 S.Ct. at 885-86; <em>see also Hatcher, </em>14 Va.App. at 490-92, 419 S.E.2d at 258-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Appellant does not contest his \u201cseizure\u201d by Yarema in asking him to leave the vehicle, placing him in handcuffs briefly and conducting a \u201cpat-down\u201d search of his clothing following appellant\u2019s movements in initially reaching down in the vehicle. He argues, however, that once the officer satisfied himself that appellant was unarmed, no reasonable, articulable suspicion existed for any further search, seizure or detention. He argues further, that in asking for and receiving appellant\u2019s identification and ordering appellant back into the vehicle, Yarema\u2019s \u201cseizure\u201d of appellant went beyond the <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>minimis </em>detention necessitated by the stop of the vehicle. He asserts that although a pat-down search for weapons might be permitted under the doctrine of <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and our holding in <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 851, 857, 434 S.E.2d 319, 322-23 (1993) , <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>18 Va.App. 454, 444 S.E.2d 275 (1994) , his detention continued after the completion of the pat-down search when Yarema asked for and received his identification and ordered appellant to return to his seat in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">To the contrary, the Commonwealth argues that notwithstanding the direction of Officer Yarema to appellant to return to the vehicle, as well as his possession of appellant\u2019s identification, a reasonable person under these circumstances would have felt that he was free to leave. We agree with appellant and disagree with the Commonwealth. We find that under these circumstances, from the point at which Yarema asked for and received appellant\u2019s identification and ordered him back into the vehicle, a reasonable person would believe that his liberty had been restrained. We find, therefore, that appellant was being detained in his own right, and not simply incidental to the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">However, under well established Fourth Amendment principles, \u201c[t]he police can stop and briefly detain a person for investigative purposes if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity \u2018may be afoot.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (citation omitted). \u201cActual proof that criminal activity is afoot is not necessary____\u201d <em>Harmon v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 440, 444, 425 S.E.2d 77, 79 (1992) (citation omitted). Officer Yarema was entitled to investigate the circumstances surrounding the presence of an open container of an alcoholic beverage in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">When \u201cevaluating whether an investigative detention is unreasonable, common sense and ordinary human experience must govern over rigid criteria.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 694, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 1580, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985) (Marshall, J., concurring). The test is whether the police methods were calculated to confirm or dispel the suspicion quickly and with minimal intrusion upon the person detained. <em>See Thomas, </em>16 Va.App. at 856-57, 434 S.E.2d at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In evaluating this investigative detention, we note that appellant was simply asked to return to the passenger seat he occupied at the time the vehicle was stopped and was not otherwise restrained. Furthermore, this investigative detention only lasted between fifteen and twenty seconds before appellant\u2019s actions in the car prompted another change in his custody status. We, therefore, cannot say that based upon the totality of the circumstances, such a brief detention to investigate possible criminal activity was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Moreover, the issue of appellant\u2019s custody status is less important when, as here, the initial seizure of the contraband is not the result of a search of his person, but rather is seized after being found in \u201cplain view\u201d in a vehicle that is necessarily stopped for the duration of the investigation of the activities of the driver. The theory of the plain view doctrine is that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in items that are in plain view. <em>See Horton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 133, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 2305-06, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">[I]n order for a seizure to be permissible under the plain view doctrine, two requirements must be met: \u201c(a) the officer must be lawfully in a position to view and seize the item, [and] (b) it must be immediately apparent to the officer that the item is evidence of a crime, contraband, or otherwise subject to seizure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-8\"><em>Conway v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 711, 718, 407 S.E.2d 310, 314 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Irrespective of his status as a detainee, appellant was a passenger in a vehicle that was the subject of a valid traffic stop. Yarema was on a public street, outside and beside the passenger door. From his position, with the aid of his flashlight, he observed appellant trying to conceal the bag <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>of white powder beneath the passenger seat. We find that appellant gave up any expectation of privacy when he brought the contraband into Yarema\u2019s \u201cplain view.\u201d The Fourth Amendment was, therefore, not implicated in the warrantless seizure of the bag of suspected cocaine. Based upon that seizure, we further find that probable cause existed for appellant\u2019s subsequent arrest. Therefore, the additional seizure of the pouch incident to his arrest was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b545-7\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AU-V\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">What is not at issue in this appeal is Officer Yarema\u2019s authority initially to order Calvin Leon Hamlin to exit the car and to perform a pat-down search upon the officer\u2019s articulable suspicion that Hamlin was armed. Hamlin concedes that <em>Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. 882, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997), gives the officer that authority. Rather, the issue is the lawfulness of the officer\u2019s conduct following the pat-down search that failed to produce evidence that Hamlin possessed weapons. I agree with the majority opinion that from this point Hamlin \u201cwas being detained in his own right, and not simply incidental to the traffic stop.\u201d I disagree, however, that the officer\u2019s further detention of Hamlin was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">\u201c[Shopping an automobile and detaining its occupants constitute a \u2018seizure\u2019 within the meaning of [the Fourth Amendment], even though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). The United States Supreme Court has never held that a police officer may detain a passenger during the period the driver is being detained, merely because the driver has committed a traffic offense. Recognizing that \u201cthere is not the same basis for ordering the passengers out of the car as there is for ordering the driver out,\u201d the Court merely ruled that in requiring a passenger to exit the car, \u201cthe additional intrusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>on the passenger is minimal.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>519 U.S. at 414-15, 117 S.Ct. at 886. The Court further noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">[T]he case for the passengers is in one sense stronger than that for the driver. There is probable cause to believe that the driver has committed a minor vehicular offense, but there is no such reason to stop or detain the passengers. But as a practical matter, the passengers are already stopped by virtue of the stop of the vehicle. The only change in their circumstances which will result from ordering them out of the car is that they will be outside of, rather than inside of, the stopped car. Outside the car, the passengers will be denied access to any possible weapon that might be concealed in the interior of the passenger compartment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anx\"><em>Id. </em>at 418-14, 117 S.Ct. at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The Supreme Court expressly declined to address the issue of a detention of a passenger beyond that inherent in the initial stop and the additional \u201cminimal\u201d intrusion when the passenger is ordered out of the vehicle. <em>See id. </em>at 415 n. 3, 117 S.Ct. at 886 n. 3. The Court held in <em>Wilson </em>only \u201cthat an officer making a traffic stop <em>may order passengers to get out </em>of the car pending completion of the stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415, 117 S.Ct. at 886 (emphasis added). Ordering a passenger out of the car pending completion of the stop is a significantly less intrusive process than ordering the passenger to remain at or in the car after the passenger has been ordered to leave the car. Clearly, any further detention of the passenger must be governed by <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Applying <em>Terry </em>principles, the officer had no basis to order Hamlin to enter the car and remain there after he determined that Hamlin possessed no weapons. <em>See id. </em>at 30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884-85. The officer testified that he took Hamlin\u2019s identification and that Hamlin was not free to leave. The officer had no reasonable basis, however, to take Hamlin\u2019s identification. He testified that he took Hamlin\u2019s identification to begin \u201crunning it ... for an information check\u201d because Hamlin \u201cwas under investigative detention for the open alcoholic beverage con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>tainer in the vehicle.\u201d He also testified, however, that he never charged Hamlin with any offense connected with the alcoholic beverage. Indeed, the officer\u2019s seizure of Hamlin for possessing the alcoholic beverage was unlawful because the officer had no reasonable basis to detain Hamlin. No city ordinance or state law bars a passenger in a vehicle from having an alcoholic beverage in an open container. The Commonwealth concedes this point but argues that \u201c[a]t most, the officer may have made a \u2018mistake of law5 \u201d and did not act in \u201cbad faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">An officer\u2019s detention of an individual based on a mistaken view that he or she has witnessed a violation of law is not objectively reasonable, however, and, therefore, is unlawful. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Valdez, </em>178 F.3d 282, 288-89 (5th Cir.1999) (holding that an officer\u2019s detention of the accused for what the officer mistakenly believed was a violation of the Code was unreasonable). An officer\u2019s good intentions cannot convert an objectively unreasonable view of the law into a lawful detention. \u201c \u2018[G]ood faith on the part of the arresting officer is not enough.... \u2019 If subjective good faith alone were the test, the protections of the Fourth Amendment would evaporate, and the people would be \u2018secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, only in the discretion of the police.\u2019 \u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880 (quoting <em>Beck v. Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 97, 85 S.Ct. 223, 229, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964)) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201c[I]f officers are allowed to stop [individuals] based upon their subjective belief that ... laws have been violated even where no such violation has, in fact, occurred, the potential for abuse of ... infractions as pretext for effecting [detentions] seems boundless and the costs to privacy rights excessive.\u201d <em>Lopez-Valdez, </em>178 F.3d at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u201cIf the initial traffic stop was illegal or the officers exceeded the stop\u2019s proper scope, the seized contraband is excluded under the \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 875 (4th Cir.1992) (citing <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 484, 83 S.Ct. 407, 415-16, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963)). The officer detained Hamlin under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>pretense that he was investigating Hamlin for possessing in a car an open alcoholic beverage container, a non-existent offense. Furthermore, the officer exceeded the proper scope of the stop by unlawfully detaining Hamlin and the other passenger \u201cfor an information check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Officer Yarema unlawfully seized Hamlin when he ordered Hamlin to return to the automobile and remain there while the officer checked the status of his identification. <em>See Deer v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 730, 736-37, 441 S.E.2d 33, 37-38 (1994). Hamlin\u2019s continuing presence in the automobile was the direct result of the officer\u2019s command that he remain in the automobile \u2014 an unlawful detention. Thus, any claim that this case merely concerns a seizure of an item in plain view fails. The officer\u2019s seizure of the cocaine was a fruit of the unlawful detention because it was a derivative of the initial illegality. <em>See id. </em>Any evidence obtained as a result of the continued seizure was inadmissible as the fruit of the poisonous tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">For these reasons, I would hold that the trial judge erred in denying the motion to suppress. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
