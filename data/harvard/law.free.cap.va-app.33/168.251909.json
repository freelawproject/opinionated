On appeal, Hucks contends the trial court erred 1) in giving a jury instruction offered by the Commonwealth to which he objected; and 2) in denying his motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence for failure to prove intent to commit larceny. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">On appeal, we \u201cexamine the evidence and all inferences reasonably deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the trial court.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 54, 64, 521 S.E.2d 293, 298 (1999) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Jenkins, </em>255 Va. 516, 521, 499 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1998)). On July 3, 1997, bookkeeper Donna Sarber arrived at her office in the Arlington law firm of Walsh, Colucci, and Stackhouse between 5:00 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. Sarber used her security key to gain access to the elevator and rode the elevator to the' firm\u2019s office suite on the thirteenth floor of the building. She entered the suite through the kitchen door and deactivated the suite\u2019s security system. The suite\u2019s exterior doors are designed to close and lock automatically upon being shut, and the main entrance to the suite remains locked until the receptionist arrives at 8:30 a.m. After entering the suite, Sarber went to her office and began working.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Attorney Shawn McMullen arrived at the firm at approximately 6:00 a.m. McMullen also entered the suite by unlocking the kitchen door, because that is the only entrance through which one may enter and deactivate the alarm system. McMullen noted the alarm system had been deactivated, indicating that someone had already entered the suite. He was aware Sarber routinely arrived at work early. McMullen walked through the suite to the reception area and observed that the main doors were closed. He noticed Sarber\u2019s office light and radio were on. He proceeded to his office and shut the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Within five to ten minutes of McMullen\u2019s arrival, Hucks opened McMullen\u2019s office door. McMullen was surprised to see a stranger in the office at that early hour. Hucks asked if there was someone named Denise in the office. McMullen replied that he knew no one by that name, and Hucks apologized for the interruption and shut the door. Hucks reopened the door and told McMullen that he appeared to be \u201cin a trinity of thought,\u201d and shut the door again. McMullen was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>concerned about the presence of the stranger in the office and decided to walk to Sarber\u2019s office to see if she was alright. As he walked to her office, he heard the suite\u2019s exit door slam shut. When he arrived at Sarber\u2019s office, he found her on the telephone, reporting the intruder to the police. Sarber had also seen Hucks as he walked past an interior window that opened onto the hallway outside her office.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">McMullen and Sarber walked through the office suite and determined that all the doors through which the suite could be entered were locked and secured. They noticed that the door to the room containing the office\u2019s telephone equipment, located just across the hall from McMullen\u2019s office, was ajar. The door was closed when McMullen arrived at work that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Officer Justin McNaul responded to Sarber\u2019s report of a possible burglary in progress and, based upon her description of the intruder, stopped Hucks as he was leaving the office building. Hucks admitted that he had been inside the Walsh, Colucci office suite. Officer McNaul conducted a pat-down to check Hucks for weapons and discovered an eight-inch slotted screwdriver tucked into his waistband. Hucks became agitated and clenched his fists, backing away from McNaul. McNaul, aided by another police officer, placed Hucks in handcuffs. Sarber and McMullen then came outside and identified him as the individual they had encountered in the office. Hucks was searched further, and a latex glove was found in his vest pocket. Hucks\u2019 car was subsequently searched, and the police discovered several screwdrivers with bent or altered tips and a kitchen knife also with a bent tip.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">An investigation of the office suite revealed no evidence of forced entry. No usable fingerprints were recovered. However, the police determined the front door to the office suite had a locking mechanism that easily could be \u201cjimmied\u201d with a flat-edged instrument, without leaving any pry marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">At the conclusion of his trial, Hucks argued that, although the evidence was sufficient to prove intent to break and enter, it was not sufficient to prove intent to commit larceny. He argued that in order to permit an inference of intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>commit larceny, the evidence had to show that a breaking and entering had occurred at night. The court decided, however, that in cases dealing -with breaking and entering of business premises, \u201cnighttime\u201d means any time outside normal business hours. On that ground, the court held the Commonwealth had presented a <em>prima facie </em>case of breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Hucks subsequently objected to the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed jury instruction 8, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">In the absence of evidence showing a contrary intent, you may infer that a defendant\u2019s unauthorized presence in a building of another was with the intent to commit larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Hucks contended that the instruction did not correctly state the law, because it omitted the words \u201cin the nighttime.\u201d The court overruled Hucks\u2019 objection, concluding that under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-90 and 18.2-91, \u201cin the nighttime\u201d means any time outside normal business hours. The jury found Hucks guilty of breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\n<em>COMMONWEALTH\u2019S CHALLENGED JURY INSTRUCTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">\u201cA reviewing court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is \u2018to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988) (quoting <em>Swisher v. Swisher, </em>223 Va. 499, 503, 290 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1982)). \u201c[A] jury must be informed as to the essential elements of the offense; a correct statement of the law is one of the \u2018essentials of a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Dowdy v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 114, 116, 255 S.E.2d 506, 508 (1979)). \u201cBoth the Commonwealth and the defendant are entitled to appropriate instructions to the jury of the law applicable to each version of the case, provided such instructions are based upon the evidence adduced.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 563, 570, 394 S.E.2d 509, 514 (1990) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-91 provides, in pertinent part, that if any person breaks and enters an office in the daytime, or enters without breaking in the nighttime, \u201cwith intent to commit larceny ... he shall be guilty of statutory burglary____\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A \u201cbreaking\u201d within the meaning of the statutes may be actual or constructive. <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 872, 876, 275 S.E.2d 592, 594 (1981). Whenever a statute establishes an offense comprised of an act combined with a particular intent, \u201cproof of such intent is as necessary as proof of the act itself and must be established as a matter of fact.\u201d <em>Ridley v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 834, 836, 252 S.E.2d 313, 314 (1979) (citing <em>Patterson v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 698, 699, 213 S.E.2d 752, 753 (1975)) (additional citation omitted). \u201cIntent is the purpose formed in a person\u2019s mind which may, and often must, be inferred from the facts and circumstances in a particular case. The state of mind of the offender may be shown by his acts and conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Hargrave v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 436, 437, 201 S.E.2d 597, 598 (1974)) (additional citation omitted). In a prosecution for statutory burglary with intent to commit larceny, the Commonwealth must prove the accused\u2019s specific intent to commit larceny beyond a reasonable doubt, although it may, and often must, prove such intent by circumstantial evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u201c[A]n unlawful entry into [the] dwelling of another [gives rise to a] presumption ... that the entry was made for an unlawful purpose, and the specific intent with which such entry was made may be inferred from the surrounding facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Tompkins v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 460, 461, 184 S.E.2d 767, 768 (1971). This principle applies equally to business premises. <em>See Ridley, </em>219 Va. at 836, 252 S.E.2d at 314. \u201cIn the absence of evidence showing a contrary intent, the trier of fact may infer that a person\u2019s unauthorized presence in another\u2019s house was with the intent to commit larceny.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>133, 137, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995) (citing <em>Ridley, </em>219 Va. at 837, 252 S.E.2d at 315).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Although we find no basis in the law to support the view that any time outside normal business hours may be equated with \u201cnighttime,\u201d we hold the Commonwealth\u2019s challenged jury instruction appropriately stated the law. \u201c[A]n appellate court may affirm the judgment of a trial court when it has reached the \u2018right result for the wrong reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bynum v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 451, 458, 506 S.E.2d 30, 34 (1998) (quoting <em>Driscoll v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 449, 451, 417 S.E.2d 312, 313 (1992)). In <em>Sandoval, </em>we held that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the trier of fact was entitled to infer the defendant\u2019s intent to commit larceny from his unauthorized presence in another\u2019s dwelling, irrespective of the time of day. We cited <em>Ridley </em>in support of our decision. Hucks correctly argues that in <em>Ridley, </em>in which this inference was first enunciated, the Supreme Court stated the fact finder was entitled to infer larcenous intent based upon the defendant\u2019s unauthorized presence in a storehouse \u201cin the nighttime.\u201d The Court incorporated that phrase into its statement of the inference because the record before it revealed the defendant to have been present in the storehouse at 9:30 p.m. However, the gravamen of the analysis was not the time at which the unlawful entry occurred but whether, upon consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, the defendant\u2019s unlawful presence could be deemed sufficient to infer an intent to commit larceny. In extending the inference of intent to commit larceny to business premises, the Court, viewing \u201cthe surrounding facts and circumstances\u201d of the case before it, held that the jury was entitled to draw such an inference from Ridley\u2019s unauthorized presence in the storehouse at night. The Court did not specifically limit the inference to situations in which the defendant\u2019s unauthorized presence on another\u2019s premises occurs at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 295, 349 S.E.2d 414 (1986), we followed <em>Tompkins </em>and <em>Ridley </em>in holding that an unlawful entry upon another\u2019s business premises allows a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>presumption that the entry was made for an unlawful purpose, and \u201cthe specific intent with which such entry was made may be inferred from the surrounding facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299, 349 S.E.2d at 417 (citing <em>Tompkins, </em>212 Va. at 461, 184 S.E.2d at 768). There, we stated that the defendant\u2019s entry of a retail store during normal business hours, and his act of concealing himself within the store until it closed, constituted a constructive breaking and entering and provided \u201csurrounding facts and circumstances\u201d sufficient to permit the fact finder to infer his specific intent to commit larceny. <em>See id. </em>at 300, 349 S.E.2d at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Here, the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case support the conclusion that Hucks entered the office suite unlawfully. He was found in the premises over two hours before the beginning of normal business hours, while the doors to the suite were all shut and locked. He possessed an altered screwdriver and a latex glove. These items provide grounds to infer forced entry, particularly given the evidence that the doors to the office suite lock automatically upon being shut and that the main door was of a type that could easily be \u201cjimmied\u201d without leaving any pry marks. This evidence permitted the fact finder to infer Hucks entered for an unlawful purpose and to infer his specific intent to commit larceny. <em>See id. </em>Thus, the trial court\u2019s instruction of the jury was supported by the analyses of <em>Ridley, Sandoval, </em>and <em>Jones, </em>and we affirm on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\n<em>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u201c When considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal of a criminal conviction, we must view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and accord to the evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. The jury\u2019s verdict will not be disturbed unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 406, 409-10, 517 S.E.2d 260, 261 (1999) (quoting <em>Traverso v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 172, 176, 366 S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988)). We find no merit in Hucks\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>contention that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that he intended to commit larceny. As noted, Hucks\u2019 unauthorized presence in the office suite before normal business hours permitted an inference that he intended to commit larceny. <em>See Ridley, </em>219 Va. at 837, 252 S.E.2d at 314; <em>Sandoval, </em>20 Va.App. at 138, 455 S.E.2d at 732. In addition to his unauthorized presence, the evidence proved Hucks possessed a screwdriver whose tip was altered sufficiently to serve as a burglary tool, and a latex glove that would prevent his fingerprints from being detected on a door he might manipulate for entry. Officer McNaul testified that several additional altered screwdrivers were found in Hucks\u2019 car. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we cannot say the jury plainly erred in concluding Hucks entered the office suite with the intent to commit larceny. Accordingly, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\">.
