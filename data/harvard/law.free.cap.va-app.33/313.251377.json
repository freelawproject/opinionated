DSS\u2019s petition was denied on the ground that Code \u00a7 16.1-266(C) required the appointment of counsel for the parents prior to the hearing held in the Fredericksburg Juvenile and Domestic Relations District (\u201cJ <em>&amp; </em>DR\u201d) Court in which the J &amp; DR court approved entrustment agreements transferring legal custody from the children\u2019s maternal aunt, Nancy Conway (\u201caunt\u201d), to DSS. DSS appeals this decision. The parents appeal the circuit court\u2019s finding that the entrustment agreements, entered into solely by aunt, were valid, as well as the court\u2019s placement of custody in DSS at the conclusion of the <em>de novo </em>appeal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm, in part, and reverse, in part, the circuit court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">On appeal, we review the facts in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>See Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 328, 387 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1990). On March 24, 1998, emergency removal petitions were filed by DSS against mother for the removal of her four children on the ground that they were abused and neglected. The whereabouts of the father were unknown at that time. For reasons unspecified in court documents, the J &amp; DR court denied the petitions and relieved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>appointed counsel for the mother and father. However, in a separate order, the court concomitantly placed temporary legal custody in the aunt, physical custody in the mother, and issued a preliminary protective order against the mother, ordering her to refrain from abusive actions and to comply with all DSS requests and service plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">On April 29, 1998, the aunt, as the children\u2019s legal custodian, signed four entrustment agreements, one for each child, entrusting the children to DSS. The agreements transferred legal custody to DSS, thus allowing it to remove the children from the mother\u2019s physical custody and place them in foster care; the agreements did not provide for the termination of parental rights or for a specific date for return of the children to their mother.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 16, 1998, the agreements were approved by the J &amp; DR court, upon DSS\u2019s petition, at a hearing at which mother and father were present but not represented, as counsel had not been appointed for them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> DSS also sought and received approval of initial sixty-day foster care service plans with a goal of \u201creturn to parent,\u201d and an initial permanency planning hearing was set for hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The mother and father did not object to the order of June 16, 1998, approving the entrustment agreements, nor did they appeal it to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">On November 16, 1998, DSS petitioned for a foster care review hearing because the mother was not in compliance with the DSS service plan and was, therefore, in violation of the J &amp; DR court\u2019s order. In the petition, DSS did not ask the court to alter the previously approved service plan; rather, it reiterated the need for the children to stay in foster care until the mother complied with the J &amp; DR court\u2019s orders. On December 3, 1998, the court again approved the original service plan, this time over the objection of counsel for the mother.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">On March 26, 1999, DSS petitioned the J <em>&amp; </em>DR court, filing new foster care plans together with petitions for permanent placement and petitions for termination of parental rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The foster care goal was changed from \u201creturn to home\u201d to adoption because, in addition to mother\u2019s failure to complete mandatory parenting classes, she became pregnant, thereby violating DSS\u2019s court-approved mandate that she use effective family planning. The parents were each appointed separate counsel to represent them in the termination proceedings. On April 22, 1999, the J &amp; DR court granted involuntary termination petitions, which were subsequently appealed to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">After argument by counsel for all parties, the circuit court found that the parents should have been appointed counsel at the J &amp; DR court hearing which resulted in its approval of the entrustment agreements. On that ground, it ruled that the foundation for the termination proceedings was defective under the provisions of Code \u00a7 16.1 \u2014 283(C), and denied the DSS\u2019s motion to terminate parental rights. It granted custody of the children to DSS at the conclusion of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AHS\">The issues raised here present mixed questions of law and fact which we review <em>de novo. See Fairfax County School Board v. Rose, </em>29 Va.App. 32, 37, 509 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1999) <em>(en banc). </em>The resolution of this case rests upon three issues: 1) whether the parents could challenge the approval of the entrustment agreements at the circuit court hearing; 2) whether the entrustment agreements entered into solely by aunt were valid; and 3) whether the circuit court could place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the children with DSS without terminating the parents\u2019 residual parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\n<em>WAIVER OF PARENTS\u2019 CHALLENGE TO THE ENTRUSTMENT AGREEMENTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">DSS contends that the parents\u2019 challenge at the termination hearing to the J &amp; DR orders approving the entrustment agreements was waived because the orders were entered as agreed orders with no objection noted to their entry, and because their entry was not appealed to the circuit court. We disagree on the ground that entry of valid entrustment agreements was a mandatory jurisdictional requirement which had to be met before the court in this case could exercise its jurisdiction to adjudicate the petition filed by DSS to terminate parental rights. As such, the question of their validity is an issue that cannot be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018subject matter jurisdiction\u2019 refers to the power granted to the courts by constitution or statute to hear specified classes of cases.\u201d <em>Dennis Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 405, 409, 527 S.E.2d 415, 417 (2000). The Supreme Court has distinguished this constitutionally or statutorily granted power from \u201c[a] court\u2019s authority to exercise its subject matter jurisdiction over a case,\u201d which \u201cmay be restricted by a failure to comply with statutory requirements that are mandatory in nature and, thus, are prerequisite to a court\u2019s lawful exercise of [its] jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. A </em>challenge to a court\u2019s exercise of its subject matter jurisdiction in a given case is not waivable if the statutory requirements violated by the court are mandatory in nature, but is waivable if the statutory requirements in. question are merely procedural. <em>See Avery v. Virginia Retirement System, </em>33 Va.App. 210, 532 S.E.2d 348 (2000) <em>(en banc); Karim v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 767, 775, 473 S.E.2d 103, 106 (1996) <em>(en banc) </em>(\u201cAn important consideration in interpreting the meaning of a statute is whether it is mandatory and jurisdictional or directory and procedural.\u201d); <em>see also Dennis Moore, </em>259 Va. at 409, 527 S.E.2d at 417 (where the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction is made dependant on compliance with certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>explicit statutory requirements, the court has no power to adjudicate the cause when those requirements are not satisfied). \u201cA mandatory provision in a statute is one that connotes a command and the omission of which renders the proceeding to which it relates illegal and void, while a directory provision is one the observance of which is not necessary to the validity of the proceeding.... \u201d <em>Karim, </em>22 Va.App. at 775, 473 S.E.2d at 106-07 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We find that the court\u2019s exercise of subject matter jurisdiction was restricted by statutory prerequisites which are mandatory in nature, <em>see Dennis Moore, </em>259 Va. at 409, 527 S.E.2d at 417, and that any challenge on that ground was therefore not waivable and may be raised at any time. <em>See Avery, </em>33 Va.App. 210, 532 S.E.2d 348. Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(4) grants jurisdiction to J &amp; DR courts in matters concerning the custody of children who are <em>\u201cthe subject of an entrustment agreement entered into pursuant to \u00a7 </em>63.1-56____\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By the plain language of this statutory provision, a valid and effective entrustment agreement which meets the requirements set forth in Code \u00a7 63.1-56 must be executed before the court may adjudicate a petition for the termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Because the jurisdiction of the circuit court to hear and decide the issues raised in DSS\u2019s petition to terminate parental rights is wholly derivative of that of the J &amp; DR court, its power to adjudicate DSS\u2019s petition is coincident with that of the lower court. <em>See Fairfax County Dept. of Family Serv\u2019s v. D.N., </em>29 Va.App. 400, 405, 512 S.E.2d 830, 832 (1999). We hold that the parents did not waive their challenge to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>validity of those agreements when the termination issue was tried <em>de novo </em>in the circuit court, because the question of whether requirements of Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(4) were met, and particularly whether the children before the court on the DSS petition to terminate appellants\u2019 parental rights were the subjects of a valid entrustment agreement, is jurisdictional in nature. <em>See Avery, </em>33 Va.App. 210, 532 S.E.2d 348 (a challenge to a court\u2019s exercise of its subject matter jurisdiction in a given case is not waivable if the statutory requirements violated by the court are mandatory in nature). Furthermore, because the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction could not be waived by the parties in this case, we hold that the validity of the entrustment agreements was properly before the circuit court even assuming the parents had entered an agreed order approving the execution of the challenged agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\n<em>VALIDITY OF THE ENTRUSTMENT AGREEMENTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The parents contend the entrustment agreements which the aunt executed were invalid, noting that 1) although she had legal custody of the children, physical custody was placed with the mother; and 2) neither parent signed the entrustment agreements. In addressing this issue, the circuit court found that the hearing at which the J &amp; DR court approved the entrustment agreements constituted the \u201ccommencement of a case\u201d in which the parents could be subjected to the loss of residual parental rights and responsibilities and, as such, the parents were entitled to counsel pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-266(C).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the parents were not represented at this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>hearing, the circuit court held that the entrustment agreements were invalid and denied the petition to terminate parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">While we affirm the court\u2019s denial of the petition to terminate parental rights, we do so on different grounds. We hold that the court erred in finding, under the facts of this case, that counsel for the parents was required at the time of the hearing in which the entrustment agreements were signed by the aunt and approved by the J &amp; DR court, because neither parent \u201ccould be subjected to the loss of residual rights and responsibilities\u201d at the time of that hearing. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-266(C). The foster care plan concomitantly submitted by DSS for approval stated as its goal \u201creturn to home,\u201d not termination of parents\u2019 rights and responsibilities. Indeed, no petition for termination of parental rights was either filed or pending at that time. In the absence of such a petition, the parents\u2019 residual parental rights could not be terminated. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-283 (setting out the requirements for termination of residual parental rights); <em>Stanley v. Dept. of Soc\u2019l Serv\u2019s, </em>10 Va.App. 596, 601-02, 395 S.E.2d 199, 202 (1990) (\u201c[bjefore the residual parental rights of an individual may be terminated, a separate proceeding must be con ducted upon the filing of a petition <em>specifically requesting such relief\u2019 </em>(emphasis added)), <em>aff'd, </em>242 Va. 60, 405 S.E.2d 621 (1991). Appellants\u2019 parental rights were placed at risk only after the hearing. The later petition to terminate those rights was based on appellants\u2019 subsequent conduct. In sum, the loss of their parental rights at the hearing in which the entrustment agreements were signed and presented to the court for approval was neither anticipated nor possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Despite the erroneous reasoning of the court, we may affirm its decision \u201cwhen it has reached the right result for the wrong reason.\u201d <em>Twardy v. Twardy, </em>14 Va.App. 651, 657, 419 S.E.2d 848, 851 (1992). Code \u00a7 63.1-56 requires that an entrustment agreement be entered by either a \u201cparent\u201d or a \u201cguardian.\u201d The aunt is clearly not the former, and under Virginia law she cannot be found to enjoy the legal status of the latter. <em>See In Re O\u2019Neil, </em>18 Va.App. 674, 679, 446 S.E.2d 475, 479 (1994) (in adjudicating legal custodians\u2019 petition to be appointed guardians of a child, while \u201c[t]he term \u2018guardian,\u2019 is not defined by any statute in this Commonwealth, nor does any statute or court decision in this Commonwealth adequately distinguish guardianship and custody ... it is certain <em>that there is a distinction between the two\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Furthermore, the distinction between the two terms is maintained in various sections of the Code where \u201clegal custodian\u201d and \u201cguardian\u201d are referred to separately. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-228 (defining an abused or neglected child, in part, as one who is without care due to the unreasonable absence of a \u201cparent, guardian, legal custodian or other person\u201d). <em>See also, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-227(3); Code \u00a7 16.1-241.2(C); Code \u00a7 16.1-247(A); Code \u00a7 16.1-250(C); Code \u00a7 16.1-250.1. \u201c[W]e ... assume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u201d <em>City of Virginia Beach v. ESG Enterprises, Inc., </em>243 Va. 149, 153, 413 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Based on the plain language of Code \u00a7 63.1-56, we hold that the aunt did not have authority to enter into an entrustment agreement with DSS and that the agreements at bar are invalid and ineffective. For this reason, we find the circuit court did not err in finding the entrustment agreements to be invalidly executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\n<em>CIRCUIT COURT\u2019S GRANT OF CUSTODY TO DSS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The parents contend the circuit court erred in granting custody of the children to DSS upon denying DSS\u2019s petition to terminate their parental rights. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>At the time of the hearing in question, DSS had custody pursuant to the entrustment agreements signed by the aunt. Because the agreements were invalid, DSS\u2019s custody of the children could not be established by those agreements, and the court could not simply reinstate custody in DSS based on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Furthermore, DSS has identified no statutory provision, and we have found none, that arguably grants authority to the circuit court to place custody of the children in DSS upon its denial of the petition to terminate parental rights under the facts of this case. The circuit court\u2019s authority, coincident with that of the J &amp; DR court, to grant legal custody of minor children to local boards of social services is specifically and expressly granted under limited circumstances, none of which is applicable here. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-277.01 (allowing transfer of custody pursuant to the approval of an entrustment agreement); Code \u00a7 16.1-277.02 (allowing court to place custody in a department of social services pursuant to a petition for relief of care and custody); Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2 (defining procedures by which court can transfer custody of abused, neglected or abandoned children or children without parental care); Code \u00a7 16.1-278.3 (defining procedures for granting custody to DSS pursuant to petition for relief of care and custody of child); Code \u00a7 16.1-278.4 (elaborating on circumstances under which legal custody of children in need of services can be transferred); Code \u00a7 16.1-278.5 (defining circumstances under which DSS can assume legal custody of children in need of supervision); Code \u00a7 16.1-283 (describing circumstances under which termination of residual parental rights can occur). We accordingly find the court erred in placing custody in DSS upon its denial of DSS\u2019s petition to terminate parental rights. Pursuant to the J &amp; DR court\u2019s order of March 24, 1998, the only remaining effective order in this case entered by a court with proper jurisdiction to adjudge the issue, legal custody of the children resides in the aunt and physical custody in the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm, in part, and reverse, in part, the decision of the circuit court, and remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>the case to the circuit court with instructions to remand to the J &amp; DR court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\n<em>Affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-6\">.
