Trial in the Superior Court, before Allen, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-9\">The plaintiffs claimed under a bill of sale, absolute in terms, for one dollar and other considerations, from one William H. Nichols, in the name of the Lawrence Brewing Company. There was evidence tending to show that Nichols, the owner of a brewery, and doing business under the name of the Lawrence Brewing \"Co., gave the bill of sale to secure the plaintiffs against loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>by reason of bonds signed by Pennock to dissolve certain attachments upon suits brought against Nichols, and also as security for the debt due or that might become due from Nichols to the plaintiffs, with the understanding and agreement that, when Pennock should be relieved from liability upon the bonds and the debt be paid, the plaintiffs\u2019 interest in the property should cease. There was no evidence, nor was it contended by the defendant, that this agreement was in writing. It further appeared that the porter mentioned in the bill, of which the 84 barrels were a part, was sent by Pennock\u2019s direction from Lawrence to Boston, and put into Nichols\u2019s possession, by whom it was sold from time to time with the plaintiffs\u2019 consent, the bills, with one exception, being made in the name of the Lawrence Brewing Co.; and that the barrels in question were sold either by Nichols himself or through one Grunberg, and delivered to the defendant by Nichols, who received the money for them; that Pennock afterward called upon the defendant, and told him that the sale had not been authorized by the plaintiffs, upon the terms upon which the defendant had purchased, and that they would not be bound by it, but should demand a return of the merchandise ; and that later in the day a formal demand for it was made, and the defendant refused to give it up. The plaintiffs then offered in evidence the letters of William H. Nichols to the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs\u2019 reply to them, to which the defendant objected, but the judge admitted them. The plaintiffs then offered in evidence what the offer of this defendant was as it was represented to them by Nichols. To this the defendant objected, but the judge admitted it. Nichols was asked this question: \u201cAfter you had communicated the offer to the plaintiffs, and heard from the plaintiffs in reply, what then did you say to Grunberg ? \u201d To this the defendant objected, but the judge permitted the witness to answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-4\">The judge ruled as a matter of law that the conveyance of the property from Nichols to the plaintiffs was not a mortgage, for the reason that there was no condition of defeasance in writing ; and refused to give to the jury certain instructions requested by the defendant, based upon its being held to be a mortgage, which it is not necessary to state. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>JI Bennett, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-4\"><em>H. J. Boardman $ O.

We cannot infer that anything was thus admitted which was in any way unfavorable to the defendant, or which tended to prejudice his case. <em>Kershaw </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>115 Mass. 361, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">As between the parties to the absolute, formal bill of sale, it could not be shown, by proof of a paroi defeasance, that the conveyance was a mortgage, and the court correctly so ruled. <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>10 Allen, 332. Evidence of a secret agreement between the parties, and conduct by them inconsistent with such a sale, was competent for the purpose of showing that the bill of sale was pretence and a fraud, intended merely to deceive creditors, or those who might deal with the parties, as to the goods, and not to express a real transaction. S\u00fach evidenc\u00e9 was admitted by the court, it may be presumed, for this purpose; but this would not alter the transaction between the parties, which, whether real, pretended or fraudulent, was still in its character an absolute sale, and not a conveyance in mortgage only.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
