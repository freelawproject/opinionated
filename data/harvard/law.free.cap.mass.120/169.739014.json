There was evidence that the indorser usually received his letters at the West Townsend post-office, and that the plaintiff knew that he lived and that there was a post-office at West Townsend, and had visited and done business with the indorser there. <em>Held, </em>that the judge, sitting without a jury, was warranted in ruling that the notice was insufficient.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-6\">Contract on two promissory notes, payable at any bank in Boston, made by N. H. White &amp; Co., payable to George Taft or order, and indorsed by him to the plaintiff. At the trial in the Superior Court, before Brigham, C. J., without a jury, the following facts were found:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">The promissory notes declared on were made by N. H. White &amp; Co. and indorsed by the defendant, as alleged in the declaration; and the plaintiff was the holder of the same, from the time when they were made and indorsed until they became payable, and neither of them was paid at maturity. On the several days when the said promissory notes became due, at- two o\u2019clock P. M., William W. Cole, notary public of Boston, presented them, \u2014 the note payable two months from date at the North National Bank, and the note payable three months from date at the Webster National Bank, \u2014 and demanded their payment, and the same was refused, the answer to the demand being \u201c No funds,\u201d and thereupon Cole mailed to the defendant notices of the demand, non-payment and protest of said promissory notes (which notices, it was agreed, were sufficient in form) addressed to the defendant at Townsend, Massachusetts. There was no evidence at the trial that these notices were received by the defendant within three days of the time when they were mailed to him by Cole, or that he otherwise, within that time, had notice of such demand, non-payment and protest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-8\">The defendant, when said notes were made, indorsed and became due, and for several years previously, was a resident of West Townsend, a village of the town of Townsend, which is a town of 2500 inhabitants, about one and a half miles distant from Townsend Centre, where the principal post-office of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>town was. There was a post-office also in the village of West Townsend and at the village of Townsend Harbor. The defend ant usually received his letters and other mail matter at West Townsend post-office. In West Townsend was the defendant\u2019s only place of business, and he was not in the habit of going to Townsend Centre post-office for letters. The plaintiff knew that the defendant\u2019s residence was in West Townsend, and had visited and transacted business with him there; he also knew that there was a post-office there. Cole, the notary, made no inquiries as to the defendant\u2019s post-office address or residence, but assumed that a memorandum upon the back of each note, namely, the word \u201c Townsend,\u201d under the name of the defendant, indicated that his residence and post-office address were at Townsend. This word \u201c Townsend \u201d was written upon one of the said notes by the plaintiff, upon information given him by the maker of said notes, and there was no evidence that the same word on the other note was written by the defendant, or by whom it was written.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-4\">Upon the foregoing facts, the judge ruled that the defendant had no notice, sufficient in law, of the non-payment of said notes at maturity, and ordered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-5\"><em>J. T. Joslin, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-6\"><em>F. A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF0\">The holder of a promissory note is bound to use reasonable diligence to give the indorser immediate notice of its dishonor. It is <em>prim\u00e9 facie </em>sufficient to address the indorser by mail at the town in which he resides, although there are several post-offices in the town, and he receives his letters at one nearer his residence and place of business than the principal post-office, unless the holder knows, or with reasonable diligence might have known, this fact. But in the case at bar, as it appears that the defendant usually received his letters at the West Townsend post-office, and that the plaintiff knew that the defendant resided in West Townsend, and had visited and done business with him there, and also knew' that there was a post-office in West Townsend, there was evidence sufficient to warrant, if not to require, a court or jury to find that the plaintiff might, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, have ascertained that the defendant was in the habit of receiving Ms letters at</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the post-office in West Townsend; and we cannot say that the judge erred in holding that a notice addressed to the principal post-office in Townsend, a mile and a half off, was insufficient. <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>8 Cush. 425. <em>Cabot Bank </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>4 Gray, 167. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
