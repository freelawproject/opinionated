Bachelder to recover $300 for work done by the plaintiff in advertising their business. At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Brigham, </em>C. J., without a jury, the following facts were found:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-10\">The plaintiff, in January, 1873, was the proprietor and pub\u00ab lisher of a monthly magazine published in the city of New York, and one Nelson was his authorized agent to make contracts for advertisements in the magazine, and as such agent on January 24, 1873, made the following contract in writing, signed \u201c A. Bachelder &amp; Co.,\u201d with the defendant Joseph C. Bachelder, acting on behalf of both the defendants, for an advertisement of \u201c bay windows \u201d manufactured by the defendants:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-11\">\u201cInsert an advertisement in Manufacturer <em>&amp; </em>Publisher for one year, commencing Feb. No. 1873, to occupy 40 lines spaces. Payable as convenient, $300. This is to include illustration of cuts and sufficient editorial matter to describe satisfactorily, all to be submitted before inserted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-12\">This contract was complied with by the plaintiff, as to time of advertisement, space of advertisement, in the magazine, illustration of cuts, editorial matter, &amp;c., to the satisfaction of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The defendants, between January 24, 1873, and this action, June 19,1874, were in a financial condition which enabled them conveniently to pay the $300 agreed upon as the price of the advertisement, and never refused to pay the same on the ground that it was inconvenient to them to do so, and the judge found that, after repeated demands by the plaintiff that the defendants should pay this sum within a reasonable time after the year\u2019s advertisement aforesaid, this action was not brought until a reasonable time- had elapsed after said advertisement was published for a year in the plaintiff\u2019s magazine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-4\">Both parties, without objection by either, offered evidence at the trial as to the significance of the words \u201c payable as convenient \u201d in the defendants\u2019 order for the publication of the advertisement, and the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the order, and publication in conformity with it. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence on this matter tended to prove that \u201c payable as convenient \u201d had this meaning: that the plaintiff\u2019s usual terms of quarterly payments for yearly advertisements would not be insisted upon, but to enable the defendants to remunerate themselves by the profits of bay windows, expected to be ordered by reason of said advertisement, for the cost of the advertisement, the $800 might be paid by them at any time during the year of its publication. On the other hand, the defendants\u2019 evidence tended to prove, and the preponderance of the whole evidence on that subject was to that effect, that if it was made to appear that bay windows sold by them on orders, which could be reasonably attributed to said advertisement, yielded profits equal to $300, that sum should be paid as the price of said publication, but not otherwise, the correspondence of the defendants to be exposed to the plaintiff\u2019s inspection for the purpose of ascertaining how many of such orders were due to such advertisement. The judge found as a fact that the defendants received no considerable number of orders and made no considerable sales of bay windows, proved to be the direct result of said advertisement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-5\">Upon these facts the judge ruled that the plaintiff\u2019s action could not be maintained, and ordered judgment for the defend ants. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-6\"><em>F. T. Gcreenh\u00e1lge, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-7\"><em>W. 3. Anderson, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>A MBS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIR\">At the trial in the Superior Court, no question was raised as to the admissibility of the evidence, and each party was allowed to offer proof as to his understanding of the contract. But although this mode of trial must be considered as a waiver of all objection to the admissibility of the evidence, its legal effect, when so admitted, is still to be considered by the court. There is nothing in the report of the case to indicate that the parties intended to make the presiding judge a mere referee, or that he was to try the case, upon the evidence, otherwise than in accordance with established rules of law. Of these rules, none is more familiar and well settled than that which decides that the terms of a written contract, not presenting a case of latent ambiguity, are not to be varied by extrinsic and paroi evidence. Whatever difficulty there may be in the interpretation of this contract arises from the obscurity of the terms in which it is expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The service requested by the defendants has been performed, and the price agreed upon, as the compensation for that service, was three hundred dollars, yet remaining unpaid. The expression \u201c payable as convenient \u201d cannot reasonably be understood as intended to excuse the defendants, in any event, from making any payment at all. The written order, when it is fulfilled, has the effect of an acknowledgment of a debt; and the phrase \u201c payable as convenient \u201d can only mean that some indulgence as to the length of credit was to be allowed to the debtors. It was still \u201c payable,\u201d and the case finds that the defendants at the close of the year were in a financial condition which enabled them to pay the debt without inconvenience. Indeed, the de fence was on the ground, not of inconvenience, but of a construction of the contract in direct contradiction of its terms. And the defendants seek to import into it a condition or contingency of which the writing furnishes no intimation whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
