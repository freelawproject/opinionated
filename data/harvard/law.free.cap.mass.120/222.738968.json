The above guaranty to remain in force until it is withdrawn by us.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-8\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Pitman, J., the defendants contended that the guaranty was not a continuing one, and put in evidence tending to show an extinguishment of the guaranty by the defendants\u2019 indorsing and paying certain notes of Wentworth. On this point the evidence was conflicting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-9\">The judge ruled that the guaranty was continuing; that the burden of proof was on the defendants to show an extinguishment or discharge of the guaranty by substitution or payment and found that the defendants had not established any such ex-tinguishment or discharge, by consent of parties, and ruled that the law did not imply such from the transaction itself. The defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-10\"><em>E.
