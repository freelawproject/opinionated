The answer contained a general denial, and alleged that the description of the building in the policy did not correspond to the building containing the lost or damaged goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-9\">The case was, by an agreement of the parties, and under a rule of court, referred to an arbitrator, whose findings on matters of fact were to be final.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-10\">The arbitrator found that the plaintiff\u2019s store, containing the property insured, was situated at No. 315 Washington Street, Boston, in the first story of a block of stores, the front of which block was granite, one end and the rear of brick, the other end granite, up one story, and brick above that, and the roof of slate; that the plaintiff\u2019s store ran through this three story block (the rear of the store having been removed for this one story, the wall above being supported by iron columns) and then through a one story building having a skylight in its tinned roof, and then into a three story brick building; the sides of the entire store were flush, and even the whole way from front to rear, one side and the rear of brick, the other side, for most of the way and perhaps all, of lathing and plaster, and the front of granite ; that the store, as above described, might ordinarily and legally be described in an insurance policy as a \u201cstore contained in three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>story granite building; \u201d that the defendant\u2019s agent examined in person the premises, when the insurance was effected, and himself wrote the policy and the description therein; that some of the goods destroyed by fire, to an amount not exceeding $200, were in the rear of the iron columns; that there were also fancy goods, such as are usually kept and sold in such a store, and that the loss on them was $100; that the total loss by fire was $6723, and that the <em>pro rata </em>amount, for which the defendant was liable, was $1620.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-4\">The Superior Court ordered judgment for the plaintiff on the award; and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-5\"><em>S.

As it does not appear that these goods consisted exclusively of wrought hair, a proportion of the sum which the arbitrator finds to have been the amount of the loss upon fancy goods must be deducted from the amount (f his award, and-there must be</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
