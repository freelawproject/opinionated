The declaration contained two counts. The first was for the conversion of certain articles of furniture. The second count alleged that the defendant forcibly and against the will of the plaintiff entered into the house, lawfully in her possession and occupation, and caused one other person also to enter forcibly said house, and that the defendant and said other person remained, contrary to the will of the plaintiff, in said house for four hours; and kept her from the use and enjoyment thereof during that time, and seized and carried off various articles of furniture belonging to her, and created great riot and disturbance in and about said house, to her great injury. The answer contained a general denial, and alleged that the defendant took the goods as constable of the city of Boston, as the property of one Jenkins, by virtue of a writ in favor of one Teller against said Jenkins; that he lawfully entered the house occupied by the plaintiff, and, finding there some goods claimed by the plaintiff intermingled with those of Jenkins, requested the plaintiff to point out to him such articles as she claimed as her own, which she refused to do, and that thereupon he took them into his possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-4\">At the first trial of this case, the defendant offered no evidence to show that any of the goods attached were in fact the property of Jenkins, but only that he attached them as his property. The judge ruled that the defendant was not justified in taking the property, and reported the case for the consideration of this court, the case to stand for trial, if the defendant was not so justified. This court held that the defendant had failed to show any legal justification, and ordered the case to stand for trial. 117 Mass. 486.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-5\">When the case came on again for trial in the Superior Court, before Putnam, J., without a jury, the plaintiff contended that she was entitled to judgment without a further hearing, and that it was not competent for the defendant to show that any of the goods attached were the property of Jenkins. The judge ruled otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-6\">It was then agreed that the facts stated in the former report of the case were true. So far as they appear to be material they are as follows: \u201c He [the defendant] testified that he went to the house, with a keeper, for the purpose of making the attach* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ment; that the plaintiff at first refused him admittance, hut that he finally gained it, as he alleged, in a peaceable manner. After entering he told her that he was an officer, showed her the writ, and said he had come to attach the furniture of Jenkins, which was there. The plaintiff replied that she owned all the goods there, and told him not to take them; if he did, he would suffer for it; to which the defendant replied that he had no desire to take her goods, that he did not come there for that purpose, and if she would be kind enough to tell him which were her goods he would not take them. She replied that she should not give him any information as to what were her goods and what were not. The defendant then said that he should use his own judgr ment, as he was satisfied that there were goods there belonging to Jenkins. He thereupon attached them, and put his keeper in possession. The plaintiff, immediately after his first entry, had locked the door through which he entered, and taken the key, and refused to let him go out, and he left the house through an open window. This was not later than half past nine in the morning. In the afternoon, between four and five o\u2019clock, he returned to the house with a horse and wagon to take away the goods, but was again refused admittance by the plaintiff, and thereupon he went and procured the services of a locksmith, who picked the lock, and he entered and removed the goods, taking with him the goods in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-4\">\u201c The goods which the defendant attached as the goods of Jenkins were in the parlor on the first floor of the house, in which were also some of the goods in controversy, all of which were taken away by the defendant. The defendant also attached, as the property of Jenkins, and took away other goods of the plain tiff, which he now concedes to be the property of the plaintiff, which were in a chamber on the second floor, being, substantially, everything in the chamber, the door of which was unlocked by the locksmith whose services had been procured by the defendant. Before he removed said goods from the chamber, he asked the plaintiff to tell him which were hers and which were Jenkins\u2019s goods, but she refused to give him any information about it, except that he must proceed at his peril. It was agreed that the plaintiff hired this house and was the only tenant of it; and that, at this time, Jenkins with his wife, a sister of the plaintiff, were temporarily residing with the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>The judge found, upon these facts and the other evidence offered, that a portion of the property attached (being all of it excepting what the plaintiff sued for as her own) was the property of Jenkins.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-4\">The defendant thereupon asked the judge to rule that the defendant was entitled to judgment upon both counts; but the judge ruled otherwise, and ordered judgment for the plaintiff upon the first count for $80.50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">Upon the second count the plaintiff asked the judge to find that the defendant kept the goods, attached by him in the plaintiff\u2019s house, an unreasonable length of time, and that the plaintiff was therefore entitled to damages upon the second count; but the judge ruled otherwise, and found for the defendant upon this count. Both parties alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-6\"><em>O. H.
