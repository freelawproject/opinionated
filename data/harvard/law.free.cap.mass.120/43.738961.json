Evidence was also introduced that the president always acted for the railroad company on its part, and that the directors when spoken to upon this subject, always referred to the president, and took no part themselves. <em>Held, </em>that upon this evidence it was a question of fact for the jury whether the president was the authorized agent of the company in making the purchase.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-6\">Contract upon an account annexed for railroad materials alleged to have been sold by the plaintiffs to'the defendant corporation, and used in the construction of the defendant\u2019s railroad. Trial in the Superior Court, before Allen, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-7\">It appeared that the plaintiffs were agents of the Bay State Iron Company, and in that capacity, on September 4, 1872, concluded with George C. Winchester, as president of the defendant corporation, the negotiations for a sale of two hundred and forty tons of railroad iron to the defendant corporation amounting to about $20,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-8\">Winchester was one of the original corporators of the defendant corporation, then recently created by the St. of 1871, <em>c. </em>251. The existence of the corporation and the connection of Winchester as president were admitted; and the weights, quantities and prices of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill were not in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-9\">It also appeared that one Lynch had undertaken to build the road by contract made with the corporation by Winchester, and was then engaged in building the road; and that by his contract he was to furnish the iron and the materials named in the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>tiffs\u2019 bill in this suit. The plaintiffs, acting for the Bay State Iron Company, had refused to sell to Lynch, his credit being insufficient ; and on the back of a broker\u2019s note of sale of the two hundred and forty tons of railroad iron, in which Lynch\u2019s name appeared to have been interlined, the following indorsement was made and signed by Winchester:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-4\">\u201c Boston, Sept. 4,1872. I, George C. Winchester, president of the Ashburnham Railroad Company, hereby guarantee payment of the within named iron as follows, viz., one half cash on delivery of the iron, and one half the Ashburnham Railroad Company\u2019s note, at four months from date of delivery, with interest added at 7 % per cent, per annum.\u201d The iron was delivered, and the note mentioned was given and paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-5\">Immediately after the completion of the negotiation above named and on the same day, one of the plaintiffs testified that he called the attention of Winchester to a memorandum which he told Winchester was a memorandum of the quantities and sizes of articles wanted for the road (being the same now sued for), which had been left by one Appleton in behalf of <em>Lynch; </em>and also told Winchester that his firm would not sell the contractor, but would sell the railroad company, if ordered by it. To which Winchester replied, \u201c Go ahead, send them along,\u201d or used similar language. Following this conversation, the witness testified that he procured the articles from several sources and caused the same to be forwarded, and entered the same upon the sales book of the plaintiffs to the Ashburnham Railroad Company, in the usual form of charges on book account. The original entries were exhibited and offered in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">. After the articles had all been forwarded, the plaintiffs wrote and mailed the following letter to Winchester, dated Boston, October 28, 1872, and signed by the plaintiffs : \u201cDear Sir, We inclose herewith our bill for spikes, splices and bolts furnished your road, indorsed with order for payment by your contractor, Mr. John Lynch. By sending us check in payment of same by return mail you will very much oblige, as we are sadly in want of money.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">The witness testified in cross-examination that he had no copy of the indorsement of Lynch, but from his best recollection ii <em>Vi </em>as simply an acknowledgment of the receipt of the articles for* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>warded as a voucher. A copy of the bill was produced in form; \u201c Ashburnham R. R. Co. Bought of John H. Reed &amp; Co.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-4\">The plaintiffs offered a letter from Winchester, dated Ashburnham, November 12, 1872. So much of it as referred to this subject was read in evidence and was as follows: \u201c Regarding the bills sent by you against the Ashburnham R. R. Co., having been brought to notice of treasurer, he will present them to directors of said Co. for their consideration at the next meeting.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\">The plaintiffs afterwards, under date of Nov. 25, 1872, wrote and mailed the following letter to Winchester, signed by them; \u201cDear Sir, We take the liberty of calling your attention to our bill against your road for spikes, splices, &amp;c. Will you be kind enough to instruct your treasurer to send us a check for the amount of same. We have some amounts to pay, and are short of funds. By giving this your early attention you will very much oblige.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-6\">In reply to the foregoing, the plaintiffs testified to the receipt of the following letter, which was read as evidence, dated Ashburnham, Dec. 4,1872, addressed to the plaintiffs, and signed by Winchester: \u201c Yours of 30th ult. is rec\u2019d. The Directors of the Asb. R. R. have not yet authorized the Treasr. to pay your bill. I will see you on Friday in regard to it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-7\">The following correspondence was also read, having been sent and received in due course of mail. The following letter, dated Boston, Dec. 18, 1872, from the plaintiffs to Winchester; \u201c Sir, Your acct. still remains unsettled. You will please settle it at once.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-8\">The following letter, dated Ashburnham, Dec. 19,1872, from \u2022 Winchester to the plaintiffs in reply: \u201c Dear Sir, Yours of 18th inst. is recti- Your account is fully settled on my books for all that I know that I have had of you. If there is anything that. I have omitted to cr. I should be pleased to know what it is.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-10\">The following letter, dated Boston, Dec. 20,1872, from the plaintiffs to Winchester: \u201c Sir, Your letter of the 19th is before us. In September last you bought of us for the Ashburnham R. R. splices \u2014 bolts &amp; spikes as per inclosed statement \u2014 you saying to us at the time that you had to furnish the money and would see that the account was paid. We supposing you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>to be a person whose word was to be relied on, took your word and delivered the goods. We will thank you to see that the account is settled.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-4\">One of the plaintiffs testified that during the period of this correspondence he had several interviews with Winchester, in Boston; that on these occasions this bill was spoken of, and that Winchester said on each occasion that money was short, that he had not been able to get his directors together, or spoke in similar language. Some time after the correspondence had ceased, and shortly before the date of the writ, he met Winchester in the street in Boston, who then said for the first time that the articles were not purchased by the railroad, and charged the plaintiff with having sold them to the contractor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">Edward Appleton, a witness called for the plaintiffs, testified that he was a civil engineer, and sometimes took contracts for building railroads; that he went with Lynch to Ashburnham to join in negotiations for the contract to build this road; that Winchester made the negotiations concerning the contract with Lynch on the part of the railroad company ; that while the work was going on during a period of about a year, disputes arose chiefly as to the monthly estimates of the work done under the contract, and that he, Appleton, acted for Lynch in adjusting these controversies; that Winchester always acted for the railroad company on its part, and that on several occasions when he spoke to other directors on the subject, they always referred him to Winchester, but took no part themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-6\">The plaintiffs rested their case upon the foregoing testimony, and the defendant declined to offer any evidence, but requested the judge to rule that the plaintiffs could not maintain this action upon this evidence, and that no sufficient evidence of any contract on the part of the defendant had been introduced; and the judge ruled as requested. The jury found for the defendant under this ruling ; and the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-7\"><em>A. Russ F. W </em>Hurd, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-8\">GF-. <em>A. </em>Torrey, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b62-9\">Ames, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATq\">Upon this bill of exceptions we are of opinion that there was evidence in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. It appeared that immediately before the alleged sale, Winchester, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>president of the defendant corporation, made a large purchase of railroad iron of the plaintiffs, and that the corporation sanctioned the proceeding, received and used the iron, and paid for it in the manner agreed to by Winchester. It also appeared that upon the application to the plaintiffs by Lynch, the contractor for the building of the defendant\u2019s road, for spikes and other railroad material to be used, and afterwards actually used, in the building of that road, the plaintiffs told Winchester that they would sell to the railroad company the articles in question, and upon its order, but would not sell to Lynch; and that thereupon Winchester used language which was sufficient (provided he had authority to do so) to make the transaction a purchase by the defendants. There w;as other evidence showing that Winchester took such a part in the business of the corporation as tended to prove that he was to some extent its authorized agent. The fact of agency may be proved by circumstantial evidence, and if there is any such evidence, even though slight, it should be submitted to the jury. <em>Forsyth </em>v.
