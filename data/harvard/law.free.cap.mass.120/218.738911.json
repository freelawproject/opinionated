The writ described the action as one of contract with a count in tort, and did not allege that they were for the same cause of action. The declaration contained two counts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-14\">The first count was as follows: \u201c And the plaintiff says the defendant owes her $45 according to the account annexed.\u201d The account annexed was for rent of a room and board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-15\">The second count was as follows: \u201c And the plaintiff further says that the defendant owes her $251, for money had and received by defendant to plaintiff\u2019s use, and $20 for interest on same.\u201d Annexed to this count was the following specification : \u201cUnder this count the plaintiff will claim two hundred and fifty-one dollars, money sent by her through the agency of the defendant, in sums of fifty dollars and twenty cents each, to New York, for the purpose of being tendered or paid to the Guardian and Orphan Life Insurance Company of New York, in the months of May, August and November, 1873, and February and May, 1874, and afterwards received back by defendant, and which defendant, though often requested, has refused to pay plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The case was referred by rule of court, and. the referee re\u00ab turned Ms award in favor of the plaintiff with interest and costs.

The words in the writ, \u201c with count in tort,\u201d no such count having been filed, are mere surplusage. The submission to arbitration by rule of court was a waiver of all defects in the pleadings. The appeal is frivolous. But the plaintiff\u2019s motion for double costs cannot be granted, because the statute upon that subject is limited to exceptions, and does not extend to appeals. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>112, \u00a7 13. <em>Delaney </em>v. Towns, 1 Allen, 407. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
