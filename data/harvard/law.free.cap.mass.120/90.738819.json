The mortgage was assigned July 8,1873, by the plaintiff to one Bean for a consideration of $4000, and on February 5, 1874, was reassigned for a consideration of $4000 by Bean to the plaintiff, who still holds it. No notice of either of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>these assignments was given to the company, nor any consent asked or given. On June 9, 1873, the policy was assigned by the plaintiff to Bigelow, and this was approved by the company. On the same date Bigelow drew an order upon the back of the policy in these words, signed by him: \u201c Boston, June 9, 1873. Please pay any loss under the within policy to T. H. Smith, as his interest may appear.\u201d This was assented to in writing by the company. A total loss occurred by fire in April, 1874, of which due proof was made to the company by Bigelow, stating that Henrietta A. Bigelow was sole owner. Subsequently to June 9,1873, and prior to the fire, the premises were again sold and conveyed by Bigelow to Henrietta A. Bigelow, and no notice was given the company, and no assent was asked or procured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-4\">If on the foregoing facts the action could be maintained, the case was to be sent to an assessor to ascertain the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s interest; otherwise judgment to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-5\"><em>N.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaK\">Upon the conveyance of the premises and the assignment of the policy, with the assent of the insurance company, from Smith to Bigelow, Bigelow became the owner of the property and the assured in the policy. The order, afterwards indorsed by him upon the policy, did not make the plaintiff the assignee of the policy, nor the party insured thereby, but merely the payee in case of loss. The subsequent conveyance and sale of the property by Bigelow, without the assent of the company, avoided the policy, so that neither the plaintiff nor any other person can maintain an action thereon. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Equitable Ins.
