Sewall, deceased, and confirming and establishing the partition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-8\">At the hearing, before <em>Morton, </em>J., it appeared that Moses B. Sewall died in March, 1872, seised of the following among other parcels of real estate: A lot of vacant land on High Street, Boston, containing 4875 square feet, valued at 197,500, and a lot of land with buildings thereon on Monument Avenue, Charles-town, containing 3177 square feet, valued at $12,500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-9\">Sewall left as his heirs four daughters, Mary F. Wales, wife of T. C. Wales, Annie L. Sewall, Linnie P. Sewall and Lilla M. Sewall, and two sons, Charles H. Sewall and George P. Sewall. Charlestown became a part of Boston, by annexation, on January 1, 1874.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-10\">Charles H. Sewall, on February 1,1873, mortgaged to David L. Marks an undivided sixth part of the estate on High Street, Boston, the same being described by metes and bounds, as security for the payment of his note for $10,000, payable in five years from date, with interest quarterly, at the rate of seven per sent, per annum, and on the same date Marks executed an initrument recorded with the mortgage, wherein he recited the mortgage and declared that the note and mortgage were held by tim in trust that Charles H. Sewall should pay him for the rapport and maintenance of Ellen M. Sewall, wife of Charles H., %nd daughter of said Marks, and for the support and maintenance of the infant daughter of Charles H. and Ellen M. Sewall, during their lives or the life of either of them, the sum of $700 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>annum in quarterly payments, and to secure to Mrs. Sewall the care and custody of their child.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-3\">On April 22, 1874, the Probate Court appointed commissioners to make partition of all the real estate of Moses B. Sewall, which any party interested should require to have included in the partition among the heirs aforesaid, and they reported as follows: \u201c Whereas the said lot of land, situated on High Street in the city of Boston, is of greater value than the share of either party, and cannot in our judgment be divided without damage to the owners, and whereas George P. Sewall, Mary P. Wales, Annie L. Sewall, Linnie P. Sewall and Lilla M. Sewall are willing to have said lot of land set off to them together, and to pay to Charles H. Sewall such sum of money as may be awarded: we have set off and assigned to the said George P. Sewall, Mary F. Wales, Annie L. Sewall, Linnie P. Sewall and Lilla M. Sewall, the said lot of land situated on High Street, in said city of Boston, to be held by them in common, but separate from the share of Charles H. Sewall, and we have awarded that they shall pay to the said Charles H. Sewall the sum of $5833.33 to make the partition just and equal. And we have set off and assigned to the said Charles H. Sewall said lot of land, situated in that part of said city of Boston which was recently the city of Charles-town, Charles H. Sewall to receive from the said George P. Sewall, Mary F. Wales, Annie L. Sewall, Linnie P. Sewall and Lilla M. Sewall, the sum of $5833.33, to make the partition just and equal.\u201d Their report was accepted, November 11, 1874, and the partition confirmed and established. From this decree David L. Marks appealed, and assigned the following reasons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-4\">\u201c Because the decree did not set off to said Marks his interest in the High Street estate, or award payment in money therefor; and because the money awarded by the commissioners had not been paid to said Marks, he being entitled thereto, or secured to his satisfaction, or to the satisfaction of the Probate Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-5\">It appeared that the heirs to whom the High Street estate was set off were able to pay the value of Charles H. Sewall\u2019s interest therein, in case partition of that estate by itself should be made, the entire estate set off to them, and it should be awarded that the value of Charles H. Sewall\u2019s interest should be paid in money. Further it appeared that Charles H. Sewall had re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>fused and still refused to agree to the substitution of any other security on the note given by him. to Marks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-4\">Upon these facts the judge affirmed the decree of the Probate Court, and upon request of Marks, reported the case for the consideration of the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-5\"><em>li. M. Morse, Jr., </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-6\"><em>13. L. Barney, </em>for Charles H. Sewall.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-7\"><em>J. B. Bullard, </em>for the other appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b192-8\">Deters, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4\">It is conceded, as a general proposition, that a tenant in common, as against his co-tenants, cannot convey his interest in a specified parcel of the lands held in common. <em>Adam </em>v. <em>Briggs Iron Co. </em>7 Cush. 361, and authorities cited. It is, however, argued that, as when the conveyance was made by Charles H. Sewall, it purported to convey his interest in the High Street estate, which was all the land then lying in the county of Suffolk, and that as it was then in the power of the judge of probate to have issued a separate warrant and caused a separate partition to have been made of the lands lying in that county, (Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>136, \u00a7 50,) the conveyance may here be treated as valid against the co-tenants. But it was in the power of the Probate\" Court then, by one commission, to have made partition of all the real estate lying within the state, (Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>136, \u00a7 48,) and at the time when the commission was actually issued, both parcels which were to be divided had, by the annexation of territory of Charlestown, become a part of the county of Suffolk. The mere fact that, but for the occurrence of this latter contingency, the Probate Court could have divided the lands of the deceased by separate commissions, does not entitle the appellant to claim that he would then have had, or that he now has, a right to have the High Street estate separately divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u25a0 If, as against the co-tenants, the mortgage made by Charles H. Sewall is invalid, the court should not refuse to confirm the decree for partition. While the court may, for sufficient reason, set aside the return of the commissioners and recommit the case, (Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>136, \u00a7 74,) yet the reason for so doing should be because there is some objection to the return as made, and not because one might be made which would facilitate other proceedings before another tribunal by the appellant against Sewall. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>treating the mortgage as invalid, the partition is a fair and just one, it should be confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Nor, if the partition is thus confirmed, is the appellant entitled to have the sum of $5833.33 (which is the amount in money to be paid to Charles H. Sewall) first paid or secured to him. It is a part indeed of the proceeds of that portion of his inheritance which Sewall assumed to convey to the appellant; but if the mortgage be invalid as to them, the co-tenants have the right here to have the partition confirmed without regard to any relations which may exist between Sewall and the appellant. <em>Decree affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
