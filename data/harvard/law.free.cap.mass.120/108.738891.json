The judge ruled that if the petitioner\u2019s estate was benefited at all, it was to be assessed according to the value of the land, independently of the buildings, and that the relative benefit, which each estate on the line of the sewer might receive, was of no consequence in determining the amount of the assessment to be laid on the estate, and rejected the evidence. The jury, under this instruction, found that the petitioner\u2019s estate was benefited by the sewer, and that the amount assessed upon it was a just proportion of the whole expense of the construction of the sewer. <em>Held, </em>that the jury, upon the appeal of the petitioner, had no authority to consider the relative benefit to other estates, and that the instruction was sufficiently favorable to the petitioner.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-8\">Petition to the Superior Court, for the abatement of an assessment laid by the city of Boston upon the petitioner\u2019s estate, situated on the corner of Shawmut Avenue and St. James Street, in Boston, for the construction of a sewer in Shawmut Avenue from Washington Street to.Circuit Street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-9\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Rockwell, J., the plaintiff offered evidence tending to prove the relative benefit received by the various estates on the line of the sewer, but the judge ruled that if the plaintiff\u2019s estate was benefited at all, iJ was to be assessed according to the value of the land, independently of the buildings, and that the relative benefit which each estate on the line of the sewer might receive was of no consequence in determining the amount of the assessment to be laid on the estate, and rejected the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-10\">The plaintiff offered paroi testimony tending to show that a culvert had been laid, from Bartlett Street to Dudley Street, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Shawmut Avenue, in 1855, for which the city of Roxbury and certain abuttors thereon paid by voluntary contributions; that no assessment was laid upon any person or estate on account thereof, and that the culvert existed at this time, and some of the abuttors on Shawmut Avenue drain their estates into the same, and in connection with this proof offered the following record from the records of the city of Roxbury: \u201c April 2, 1855. The committee on highways, bridges and sidewalks, to whom was referred the petition of Henry Bartlett and others, that a sewer may be laid in Bartlett Street, to take the water from that and other streets, and also the waters that come down the brook which crosses Bartlett Street, have considered the matter of the petition, viewed the land and obtained estimates of the cost of the work. They find that great damages have been suffered by the owners of land on Bartlett Street in consequence of the overflows occasioned by the nonconducting capacity of the present culvert. They feel confident that a sewer will be required soon in this locality, which must necessarily be made at the city\u2019s expense. Those now to be relieved are ready to contribute towards the cost of the work. This can be done for the sum of $2000. And this committee recommend that the sewer be made, provided the abuttors will contribute $1000 towards the cost. For the Committee, James Ritchie, Chairman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-4\">\u201c Read and accepted and sent down for concurrence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-5\">\u201cApril 9th came up concurred.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-6\">The plaintiff also offered paroi testimony tending to show that in 1858 a culvert was laid from Circuit Street along Shawmut Avenue, and past the plaintiff\u2019s estate, to connect with the last-\" named sewer at Bartlett Street, and in connection with said testimony offered the following record from the records of the city of Roxbury: \u201c March 22,1858.

On the part of the committee on streets, to whom was confided the important work of grading and reconstructing that part of Shawmut Avenue formerly known as the Dedham Turnpike, and also of constructing a large culvert leading from Circuit Street to Bartlett Street, I beg leave to report that the work is completed, and the road is used as a travelled highway. It has been completed to the full satisfaction of the county commissioners, who have stated that they will accept it on the part of the county so soon as the overhanging rocks are removed from the ledges. Men have accordingly been employed for some weeks in attending to that work under the direction of the superintendent of streets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-7\">\u201c The original appropriations for this work . . $15,000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-8\">\u201c Received of Mr. S.

Sent down for concurrence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-5\">There was evidence tending to show that this culvert was constructed to take the water of a natural stream or brook ; that it was constructed without any artificial bottom, the sides of stone and the top of flat stones resting thereon; that no assessment was laid upon any person on account thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">The defendant contended that the laying out of a sewer could not be proved by paroi, and that record evidence only could be received. In view of this testimony the plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the judge to instruct the jury that in deciding whether the estate was benefited by the drain the jury must take into consideration the means of draining the estate which existed when the new sewer was built. The judge refused so to charge the jury, and did charge \u201c that if the plaintiff\u2019s estate was not benefited by the new drain then his estate was not chargeable with the assessment in controversy, and that in deciding the question whether the estate was or was not benefited by said drain they were not to take into consideration any evidence concerning the old drain above referred to, because there was no evidence before them showing the existence of any drain into which the plaintiff had a right to conduct the drainage of his estate prior to the construction of the new sewer; and the plaintiff\u2019s estate was never drained into the old culvert.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-7\">It was also in evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s estate contained 7896 square feet only, and the assessment showed that it was estimated as containing 8530 square feet. The superintendent of sewers for the city of Boston testified that he made an estimate of an assessment, and reported to the board of aider-men, and that his plan was to make an accurate survey, get the number of assessable square feet in an estate, and assess it at so much per foot; that he used his own judgment in ascertaining the value, then compared his valuation with that of the assessors, and then made up the estimate and submitted it to the board of aldermen; that in estimating the plaintiff\u2019s estate he intended to estimate the whole estate owned by the plaintiff as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the same measured in square feet, and taking the number of square feet in said estate to fix upon the same, per square foot, a valuation which should be fairly proportioned to the valuation, per square foot, of the other estates estimated upon for the sewer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-4\">The plaintiff asked the judge to instruct the jury that if the petitioner\u2019s land was estimated in amount larger than he owns, then the assessment is erroneous, and must be set aside to the extent of the sum assessed upon the land not owned by him. The judge declined so to instruct the jury, but instructed them that if the assessment levied was the plaintiff\u2019s just proportion of the expense of constructing the sewer, the jury should find for the city, even though the plaintiff\u2019s estate had been estimated at a larger number of square feet than it contained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-5\">The jury found that the assessment upon the petitioner\u2019s estate was properly laid in the sum assessed; and the petitioner alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-6\"><em>E. E. Hodges </em>&lt;f- <em>J. W. </em>Keith, for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-7\"><em>J. P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKM\">There was no evidence that either of the old culverts was laid out as a sewer, or that the petitioner. drained, or had any right to drain, from his estate into it. The existence of those culverts, therefore, could not affect the question whether his estate was benefited by the new sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">An overestimate of the number of square feet in the petitioner\u2019s estate certainly did not make the assessment invalid, if that estate was assessed no more than its just proportion of the expense of constructing the sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">The jury, under the instructions of the court, have found that the petitioner\u2019s estate was benefited by the sewer; and that the amount assessed upon it was a just proportion of the whole expense of the construction of the sewer. Upon the appeal of the petitioner, they had no authority to consider the relative benefit to other estates. The rulings and instructions at the trial were sufficiently favorable to the petitioner.
