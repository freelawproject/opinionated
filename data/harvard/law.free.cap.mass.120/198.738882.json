The allegation in the sixth count of the indictment, namely, \u201c the property, goods and chattels aforesaid, so as aforesaid stolen,\u201d did not set out in sufficient legal terms, and plainly, formally and substantially as required by the practice of this Commonwealth in criminal pleading, the offence of receiving stolen goods under the statute. A <em>nolle prosequi </em>having been entered before verdict on the second and fourth counts of the indictment, the reference in said sixth count thereby became vague, uncertain and informal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>102 Mass. 487. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>1 Leach C. C. (4th ed.) 87. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lyon, </em>17 Wis. 237. The allegation should have been \u201c of the value aforesaid, so as last aforesaid stolen,\u201d or its equivalent. <em>State </em>v. Lyon, <em>ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-7\">2. The verdict as rendered is a proper ground for the motion in arrest of a judgment. The court ought not to pronounce judgment on this verdict, because there is no sufficient averment in the sixth count either of the property received or its value when received, both of which must enter into the consideration of the court in awarding punishment.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyZ\">This indictment is against the receiver only, and, though assumed on some parts of the record, and in the briefs of counsel, to contain six counts, really contains only three, each consisting of an allegation of the larceny, followed by a charge against the defendant as receiver of the goods alleged to have been stolen, and which clearly describes those goods by reference to the preceding allegation. The form is usual and sufficient. Stark. Crim. Pl. (2d ed.) 169, 170, 479. D. Davis\u2019s Justice, 451, 452. Davis\u2019s Prec. 37. <em>Commonwealth </em>v.

The validity of the last count is not affected by the <em>nolle prosequi </em>entered upon the other counts against the defendant, The motions to quash, and in arrest of judgment, for insufficiency in the indictment, were rightly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
