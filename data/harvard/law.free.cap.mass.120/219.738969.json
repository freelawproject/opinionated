The facts proved were substantially the same as at the former trial, except that the judge further found that the defendant came into the plaintiff\u2019s store about noon on November 9,1872, and took the bill of parcels of the calf skins, and asked if his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>skins were ready; was told by the plaintiff that they were ready, and they were then pointed out to him, lying in the door way of the store, near which the parties were standing, and the defendant then passed out of the door where the skins were lying, saying he would send his wagon for them. The plaintiff requested the judge to rule that this was a sufficient acceptance of the goods to take the case out of the statute of frauds; but the judge declined so to rule, and ruled \u201c that there was not such an unequivocal act of acceptance on the part of the defendant as would take the case out of the statute, and found for the defendant ; \u201d and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-4\"><em>JEL.

The only additional fact proved at the second trial was, that after the defendant was told that the skins were lying in the doorway, they were pointed out to him, and he passed out of the door where they were lying, and said he would send for them. That there was sufficient evidence of delivery has been conceded throughout this controversy; the question being whether, on the facts reported, there was evidence of acceptance within the statute of frauds. It is enough to say that the additional fact does not necessarily show an acceptance, and the presiding judge could not properly have ruled as requested by the plaintiff; and, having found for the defendant, he must necessarily have found that there was \u201c not such an unequivocal act of acceptance as would take the case out of the statute.\u201d The plaintiff therefore has no ground of exception. \u25a0 As it was part of the contract that .the defendant should send for the skins, the fact that he said he would do so, when he left the store, does not add to the effect of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
