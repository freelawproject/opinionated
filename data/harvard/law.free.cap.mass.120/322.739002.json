The answer set up the statute of frauds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-10\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Pitman, </em>J., without a jury, it appeared that the plaintiffs sold to the defendant certain goods, taking in part payment his due bill, which was reduced by subsequent payments to $200. For this balance the defendant offered to the plaintiffs the note of one Robinson, payable to their order, which they accepted, and at the same time they gave up the said due bill in settlement, and he orally promised that, ii the note was not paid by Robinson at maturity, he would pay it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>The plaintiffs, after the note became due, sent it to Robinson\u2019s place of business and residence for payment, but did not find him, and thereupon demanded payment of the defendant, who refused it. The judge found that the plaintiffs had used due diligence in attempting to collect the note of Robinson, and that there had been due demand upon the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-3\">The defendant requested the judge to rule that the plaintiffs could not recover. The judge refused so to rule, and found for the plaintiffs for the amount of the note and interest, \u201c upon and by reason solely of the verbal promise, which he found, as a fact, that the defendant did make; and held and ruled that, it appearing that the leading and immediate object of the defendant in giving and verbally guaranteeing the note of Robinson was the payment of his own debt, the promise was not to be considered as collateral to the debt of another, but as creating an original obligation from the promisor, \u2014 a part of the mode and manner in which he was to pay his own debt, \u2014 and so was not within the statute, although one effect of its performance would be to discharge Robinson\u2019s liability.\u201d The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-4\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2T\">The defendant was doubtless once liable for the goods sold and delivered to him, and upon the due bill which, upon paying part of the price of the goods, he gave to the plaintiffs for the balance. But upon his procuring and delivering to them the note of Robinson, as the bill of exceptions states, \u201c they at the same time gave up the said due bill to him in settlement,\u201d md he orally promised to pay Robinson\u2019s note at maturity, if Robinson did not. The claim of the plaintiffs, and the finding of the court, did not proceed upon the defendant\u2019s liability for goods sold, but solely upon this oral promise of his, thereby necessarily assuming that his previous liability had been settled and discharged by the giving and receiving of the note of Robinson. Upon this state of facts, the only direct liability was that of Robinson upon his note, and the oral promise of the defendant to pay that note, if Robinson did not, was a collateral promise to pay Robinson\u2019s debt, and as such within the statute of frauds.
