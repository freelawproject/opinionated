I give, devise and bequeath to the children of my brother Joseph by his present wife, and the survivors of them, and to the children of my said nephew Albert, and the survivor of them, all the rest and residue of all my property and estate, and the remainder and reversion thereof, after the decease of my wife and sister Ann aforesaid, to them, their, heirs and assigns forever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-10\">At the death of the testator there were living eight children of the testator\u2019s brother Joseph, \u201cby his present wife,\u201d and one of them has since died without issue.

This general rule is not applicable to this case; because the children of the testator\u2019s brother Joseph, and the children of his nephew Albert, do not stand in the same relation to the testator, but are of different degrees of kindred to him; and because the testator indicated by more than \u201ca very faint glimpse\u201d a different intention; that is, that the property and estate in question should be distributed <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita. </em>If the testator had intended a <em>per capita </em>distribution, he would naturally have made his gift to the children of his brother and of his nephew, and the survivors of them; but instead of so expressing his purpose, he gives to the children of his brother Joseph by the wife then liv-. ing, and the survivors of them, and to the children of his nephew Albert, and the survivor of them, thus dividing the devisees and legatees into families, and providing separately for the survivors of each family. This construction of the will, it is believed, is sustained by the current of the decisions of this court. <em>Balcom </em>v. <em>Haynes, ubi supra. Leland </em>v.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVU\">The general rule is that by a bequest to the children of A. and to the children of B., the children take <em>per capita </em>and not <em>per </em>stirpes, in the absence of words indicating a different intention. There are no such words in this will. The repetition of the words \u201c and the survivors of them \u201d only makes clear the intention of the testator not to include any children, of either person named, who did not survive the testator. Upon his death, the children who should take were ascertained, and the residue of the estate was to be equally divided among them. <em>Blackler </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>2 P.
