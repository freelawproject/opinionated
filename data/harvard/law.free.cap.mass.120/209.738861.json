There was conflicting evidence as to whether the plaintiff voluntarily terminated his employment on December 31, 1873, or by reason of the defendant\u2019s refusal to continue the same.

The objection of variance was open to the defendant, although he had not set up the statute of frauds. The case is thus distinguished from <em>Middlesex Co. </em>v.
