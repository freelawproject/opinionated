The uncontradicted evidence is that defendant warranted the horse to be kind, good-winded, and to do good work; and defendant agreed to take him back at any time if the Horse were found to be otherwise. The plaintiff claims, without any specific contradiction, that the horse balked and would not do good work, and the horse was returned to defendant\u2019s place, where it apparently still remains.'
