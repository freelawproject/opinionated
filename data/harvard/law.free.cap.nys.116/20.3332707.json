The plaintiff further alleges that the plaintiff, in reliance upon the truth of the said representations, entered into a contract for the purchase of the premises, and had paid the sum of $2,000 upon the said contract. The plaintiff seeks to recover the said sum of $2,000 on the ground that the said representations were false, in that: (a) The easterly wall bulges and encroaches upon the adjoining premises; (b) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>walls have not been properly constructed; (c) leases have been made, to tenants with the understanding that for one month out of twelve during the year the tenant need pay no rent; (d) the Lawyer\u2019s Title Insurance &amp; Trust Company had declined to pass a loan of $70,000, by reason of the construction of the easterly wall; (e) the 'fitle Guarantee &amp; Trust Company would make no loans, by reason of the construction of the easterly wall, without a license from the owner of the adjoining premises on the east. The trial justice refused to allow any evidence of oral misrepresentations on these points, stating that they would vary the written instrument, and are cognizable only in an equity tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">It is unquestionably true that, in an action to recover the amount paid upon a contract rescinded on account of alleged fraudulent misrepresentations, the plaintiff should be allowed to show that by reason of such fraudulent misrepresentations the minds of the parties have never met, even though the misrepresentations were parol; but where the contract itself contains provisions that negative the claim that these misrepresentations were relied upon, or contains other representations upon the same subject inconsistent with the alleged oral representations, then the evidence of representations is not introduced for the purpose of showing that the minds of the parties did not meet on this contract, but only to vary the written contract and is improper. In this case the contract contains clauses as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">(1) \u201cSubject to state of facts shown on survey of Chas. A. Meyer &amp; Son, dated Sept. 1, 1905. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">(2) \u201cThe party of the first part agrees to furnish the certificates of the tenement house and building departments, showing erection of the building on the premises hereby contracted to be conveyed in accordance with building laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The clauses cover the alleged misrepresentations as to the walls of the building, and any proof of these misrepresentations would vary the written instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The contract further provides that the premises shall be taken subject to monthly tenancies and leases on various apartments, and that the rents shall be apportioned. The parties have, therefore, expressly agreed that the terms of the leases are not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">The representation that the Title Insurance &amp; Trust Company accepted a loan of $70,000 is immaterial, because the contract provides that the defendant would take upon the premises a second mortgage of-$17,000 after a first mortgage of $70,000; but, in the event that plaintiff should be unable to secure a mortgage loan of $70,000, then the defendant agreed to increase the second mortgage to the extent necessary, \u201cbut in no event is said increase to be more than $5,000.\u201d Obviously, therefore, the plaintiff contemplated that he might not obtain a loan of $70,000. Moreover, the complaint does not allege that the title company had not accepted a loan, but only states that it had declined to pass a loan. \u2022 The oral representations may therefore have been true.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">\u25a0 The fifth representation is promissory in its nature, and the plaintiff had no right to rely upon the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">It would appear, therefore, that, if the evid\u00e9nce of these representations .had .been received, it would have had .the effect, as. the. trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>justice said, of reforming the contract in these particulars. The entire record shows that the plaintiff is now trying to interpolate into the contract new clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
