One of the jurors who served on the trial was over the age of 70 years. It appeared by affidavits that neither the defendant nor his counsel knew the juror was disqualified at the time of the trial. No challenge or other objection to his qualification'was made. The question presented'is whether the acceptance of the juror by the defendant was a waiver of the objection to his qualification. .</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">It was early settled that a failure to object to the qualifications of a juror was a waiver of all objections, although the disqualification was not known to the defeated party at the time of the trial. Eggleston v. Smiley, 17 Johns. 133; Hayes v. Thompson, 15 Abb. Prac. (N. S.) 220; Seacord v. Burling, 1 How. Prac. 175; Bennett v. Matthews, 40 How. Prac. 428; Stedman v. Batchelor, 49 Hun, 390, 3 N. Y. Supp. 580; Dayharsh v. Enos, 5 N. Y. 531. The following cases sustain the claim that this rule has been generally observed in criminal cases: People v. Jewett, 6 Wend. 389; People v. Rathbun, 21 Wend. 542; People v. Mack, 35 App. Div. 114, 54 N. Y. Supp. 698; Stephens v. People, 19 N. Y. 549; Pierson v. People, 79 N. Y. 424, 35 Am. Rep. 524. In People v. Mack, 35 App. Div. 114, 54 N. Y. Supp. 698, Mr. Justice Merwin .said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-8\">\u201cIn many criminal cases it has been held to be immaterial whether or not the defendant, in cases not'capital, knew before the verdict the disqualification of the juror, as long as he had an opportunity to challenge and question the juror- as to his qualifications, but neglected to do so\u201d\u2014and cited State v. Vogel, 22 Wis. 471, King v. Sutton, 8 B. &amp; C. 417, State v. Quarrel, 2 Bay (S. C.) 150, 1 Am. Dec. 637, and Williams v. State, 37 Miss. 407.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">But, aside from these considerations, the law was settled by an amendment to section 1180 of the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter 416, p. 463, of the Laws of 1877). The section as amended provides that \u201can objection to the qualification of a juror is available only upon a challenge,\u201d and this provision is made to \u201capply equally to a criminal and a civil action or special proceeding, and to a court of criminal and a court of civil jurisdiction,\u201d by subdivision 7 of section 3347 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">It follows that the order of the County Court should be affirmed. All concur;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
