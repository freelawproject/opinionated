Defendant counterclaimed $22 paid by him for books which he alleged were not in accordance with representations made at the time of their sale. The court, without a jury, gave judgment for -$22 in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The contract of October, 1908, was for Hugo\u2019s Foreign Romances, 39 volumes, $43. The contract of November, 1908, was for R. L. Stevenson, 8 volumes, and A. Lincoln, 8 volumes, $30. Defendant did not examine the books until three weeks after their delivery, and then complained of the \u201cForeign Romances\u201d and \"Stevenson,\u201d but was satisfied with the \u201cLincoln.\u201d Plaintiffs said \u201call would be fixed up.\u201d These books were not returned, and plaintiff still has them.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The evidence tends to show that, before purchasing, the books or duplicates were examined by defendant. The October contract, in evidence, shows a payment of $1.50, and a payment of $8 on the November contract. There is no other evidence of payments. It is therefore difficult to understand the calculation upon which $33 was found due to defendant. It was conceded that the $4.50 sued for had not been paid. The record furnishes no basis for the judgment rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
