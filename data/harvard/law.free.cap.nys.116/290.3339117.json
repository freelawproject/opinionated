Matter of Shaughnessy v. Fornes, 172 N. Y. 323, 65 N. E. 168. Bouvier defines legislative officers as \u201cthose whose duties relate mainly to the enactment of laws.\u201d Examination of the duties prescribed for the clerk shows that they are of this character. Sections 28, 29, 31, 32, 37, Charter. The provision in the charter that he may appoint such deputies or clerks as are necessary to the discharge of his duties (section 23) is made, of course, in contemplation of the circumstance that he alone cannot discharge the duties; but in the eye of the law the duties are discharged by him, although the volume thereof requires the aid of these agents, and if such duties are legislative they still remain legislative. The return of the city clerk and the clerk of the board of aldermen, which we must regard as true (People ex rel. P. C. Savings Bank v. Cromwell, 102 N. Y. 477, 7 N. E. 413; People ex rel. Dady v. Coler, 171 N. Y. 373, 64 N. E. 149), shows'that the services rendered by those appointees are in the main legislative.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">The contention of the learned counsel for the relator is that these appointees are without the unclassified class, because they are not appointed by the legislative body, but the city clerk. This contention is not justified by the words of the statute applicable to this case, which are: \u201cAll legislative officers and employ\u00e9s.\u201d If the Legislature intended to limit such officers and employ\u00e9s to those directly appointed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>this legislative body, it could readily have so declared. I think that the qualification of an office or place as legislative is determined by the main duties thereof, and not by the fact that the placeman is elected or appointed by the legislative body itself. A policeman of the city of New York is a policeman none the less, although he is not appointed by the Legislature, the body primarily vested with the police power. Moreover, these deputies and employ\u00e9s are appointed by a legislative officer directly chosen by the legislative body. The method of appointment is but one of convenience, and does not affect the character of the duties of the appointees. I am confirmed in the opinion that such appointees' are within the unclassified class by the expression of this court in the First department. People ex rel. Martin v. Scully, 56 App. Div. 302, 67 N. Y. Supp. 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">It is also contended that these employ\u00e9s are outside of the unclassified class for the reason that they aid the city clerk in the discharge of '\" other official duties cast upon him which are not legislative. Even if this were so, this circumstance would not determine that the duties of \u2022; these appointees were not legislative, provided they were appointed to discharge legislative duties and the work done by them was mainly legislative. The city clerk and clerk to the board of aldermen returns that, when the board of aldermen and its committees are in session, his force is not sufficient to do the work of that body; that the entire force is engaged in such work; that the board meets once a week in every .month; save fn August and September; that its committees meet daily, and that sometimes several committees meet at the same time; and .that, outside of the lull in summer, he and all helpers can only keep 'abreast of this work; and he also returns that there is no division of 'work in his office between the duties of city clerk and those of clerk to the board of aldermen. These allegations, as I have said, must be .. taken by us as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">If the relator have a grievance, it arose on January 1, 1898, at the time he came into the office of the city clerk, and so I am inclined to the opinion that the relator has shown laches in his application; See People ex rel. Miller v. Sturgis, 82 App. Div. 580, 81 N. Y. Supp. 816, appeal dismissed 178 N. Y. 632, 71 N. E. 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The order is affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
