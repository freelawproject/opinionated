J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABG\">The nonsuit was proper under the authorities. The plaintiff, accompanied by his wife, was injured in the borough of Manhattan on the evening of December 25, 1903. They had just arrived in the city of New York, on their way from Roxbury Station, Conn:, to visit a daughter in Paterson, N. J. They boarded a Fourth avenue car at Forty-Second street, and left it at the southwest corner of Twenty-Third street and Fourth avenue. They intended to take a West Twenty-Third street ferry to New Jersey, and for that purpose attempted to cross to the north side of Twenty-Third street to board a west-bound car. Standing on the sidewalk, the plaintiff looked east for the car he desired to board, but saw none. He then looked west, and saw a car east-bound. He let that car pass, looked east again, and saw a west-bound car on the north track at the northeast corner of the streets and at a distance of about <em>75 </em>or 100 feet from where he stood. He then looked west again, and, finding his way safe over the nearest or east-bound tracks, attempted to gross, walking on the crosswalk. He did not look east again after leaving the sidewalk, and when he reached the farthest or north track in Twenty-Third street was struck by the west-bound car, which he had seen while standing on the sidewalk. The car was going very rapidly.-</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In this state of facts, the counsel for the appellant insists that there should be a reversal, mainly on the theory of Lofsten v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 97 App. Div. 395, 89 N. Y. Supp. 1042. That case, however, was reversed in the Court of Appeals (184 N. Y. 148, 76 N. E. 1035); that court holding in similar circumstances that the injured person must be deemed guilty of contributory negligence as matter of law. Tully v. N. Y. City Ry. Co., 127 App. Div. 688, 111 N. Y. Supp. 919, is \u00e1 case where the plaintiff, about to cross the Bowery, in the borough of Manhattan, at Bleecker street, looked up and down before attempting to cross, and saw a car about two blocks away, coming very fast. She proceeded to cross the street without looking again, and while leaving the track was struck by the car which she had seen. It was held that a pedestrian, seeing an approaching car while attempting to cross a street, must, before stepping on the track, ascertain whether or not it was safe to do so, and that a refusal of the court to charge that she was required, after leaving the curb, to look again before she tried .to cross the track, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Under these decisions, and the cases cited in the opinions written in them, it must be deemed the settled law in this state that it was negligence on the part of the plaintiff herein to step upon the northbound track in Twenty-Third street without first looking for the car which he had seen approaching when he was on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Judgment affirmed with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
