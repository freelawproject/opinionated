From a judgment for plaintiffs, defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ANc9\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b169-19\">The following is the opinion of GREENBAUM, J., in the court below:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-20\">On May 1, 1858, one John J. Crane, who then was the owner of the premises known as No. 21 West Nineteenth street and No. 18 West Twentieth street, which, taken together, formed one parcel of land running from street to street, 25 feet in width on each street and 184 feet, in depth, conveyed the Twentieth street lot and a building thereon erected, being 25 feet wide and 92 feet in depth to the middle of the block, to one Isaac Sherman by deed containing the following restriction: \u201cWhich said last-mentioned lot [referring to the Nineteenth street lot], now owned by the said John J. Crane, shall be restricted when sold or built upon by him as follows, namely, that any building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>erected on said last-mentioned lot shall not exceed the depth of 65 feet, commencing on the line of Nineteenth street, leaving the balance of said lot 27' feet in depth as an open yard in the rear of said lot.\u201d Through various m\u00e9sne conveyances the title to No. 18 West Twentieth street became vested in the plaintiffs and the title to No. 21 West Nineteenth street in the defendant. The plaintiffs having also acquired the title-to, the premises known.as Nos. 20 and 22 West Twentieth street and to No. 23 West Nineteenth street, which is directly in the rear of No. 20 West Twentieth street, erected an 11-story fireproof store and loft building which covered 75 feet on Twentieth street to a. depth of about SO feet, excepting that the ground floor was extended to a further depth of 8 feet with a skylight, and also excepting that the middle 25 feet of the building extended through to Nineteenth street. The upper stories in the rear of the part of plaintiffs\u2019 building directly overlooking defendant\u2019s premises have three windows on each of the stories, above the ground floor, leaving a space of 12 feet on plaintiffs\u2019 premises, which, with the additional 27 feet in the rear of defendant\u2019s premises, would furnish a total air\u2019and light space of 39 feet The defendant has threatened to erect upon his Nineteenth street lot an 11-story building to the depth of 85 feet, so that instead of the open space of 27 feet in the rear of his lot, to which plaintiffs claim an easement of light and air, there would be but 7 feet. To perpetually restrain the defendant from consummating his threatened erection the plaintiffs bring this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-5\">Defendant contends that his land is not restricted to a building 65 feet in depth, and that, even if such a restriction had in fact been originally imposed, the change since 1858 in the character of buildings in the block would defeat the right to equitable relief. It is also argued in behalf of the defendant that the covenant of Crane to Sherman to restrict was purely personal in nature, and that Sherman\u2019s grantees had no enforceable claim or right thereunder. An examination of the respective chains of title to the plaintiffs and defendant to their holdings reveals that on August 1, 1858, Crane conveyed his Nineteenth street property to one Wickham Hoffman by deed; which in its habendum clause contained the following restriction: \u201cSubject also to\" the restriction that any building erected \u00f3r to be erected on the lot hereby conveyed shall not exceed the depth of 65 feet, commencing from the line of Nineteenth street, leaving the balance of said lot twenty-seven feet in depth as an open yard, and the said Wickham Hoffman hereby accepts this conveyance as aforesaid, and hereby covenants and agrees with the said John J. Crane, his heirs and assigns, at all time's, faithfully to keep and observe the covenant and restriction aforesaid.\u201d Defendant\u2019s title is deducible through a series of deeds, some of which refer to the restriction and some of which, omit any reference thereto. On July 30, 1906, the then owner of the lot, one Sarah Marion May, conveyed it to one Randolph Guggenheimer by deed subject to the restriction in question, and said Guggenheimer conveyed it to defendant on May 1, 1907, also subject to said restriction. The defendant thus took title with actual notice of the existence of the restriction. The several deeds which constitute the chain of title to plaintiffs make no specific mention of the restriction of the Nineteenth street lot, and no restrictive agreement or covenant as to the depth of building on the Twentieth street lot appears ever to have been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-6\">It thus appears that there was no mutuality of - restrictive covenants as to depth of building in favor of each lot as against the other, but that the Nineteenth street lot alone, upon the severance of title in the common, owner of the Nineteenth street and Twentieth street lots, became a servient estate With an easement in favor of the Twentieth street lot. There evidently was no mutuality because none was intended, and it may be assumed that the Twentieth street lot became the dominant estate, because the purchaser apparently paid a sufficient valuable consideration to the grantor to acquire the easement in' the Nineteenth street lot. The easement created in favor of plaintiffs\u2019 lot seems to me was in effect a grant and passes with the \u201cappurtenances.\u201d Valentine v. Schreiber, 3 App. Div. 235, 38 N. T. Supp. 417; Hills v. Miller, 3 Paige, 254, 24 Am. Dec. 218. The covenant was expressly intended as a beneficial one to plaintiffs\u2019 land, and it may therefore be regarded as one running with the land and passing to subsequent grantees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>as an incident to the fee. Norman v. Wells, 17 Wend. 136;. Nye v.' Hoyle, 120 N. Y. 195, 24 N. E. 1; Van Rensselaer v. Read, 26 N. Y. 558. It.seems to me that the questions involved in this suit require no extended consideration here, as they are sufficiently considered in the following cases: Lattimer v.- Livermore, 72 N. Y. 174; Phoenix Ins. Co. v. Continental Ins. Co., 87 N. Y. 400; Hodge v. Sloan, 107 N. Y. 250, 17 N. E. 335, 1 Am. St. Rep. 816; Kahn v. Hoge, 61 App. Div. 147, 70 N. Y.- Supp. 434; Holt v. Fleisehman, '75 App. Div. 593, 78 N. Y. Supp. 647.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-5\">I am not impressed with the force of the arguments of the learned counsel for the defendant \u201cthat a search of the records relating to the Nineteenth street lot would not have disclosed any covenant or restriction in favor of the Twentieth street lot,\u201d and that there is nothing to indicate the existence of any general plan of restriction of the several lots of land on the block. An examination of the title to the Nineteenth street lot would have revealed the restriction in the deed by Crane to Sherman, as well as in several subsequent deeds in the chain. As to the point that no general scheme of restriction existed, as has been observed, none was intended; it being expressly designed to restrict the Nineteenth in favor of the Twentieth street lot. This distinction differentiates this case from the facts appearing in some of the cases relied upon by defendant\u2019s counsel. Other cases cited in behalf of the defendant were those in which the covenant was purely personal, and therefore did not pass to subsequent grantees. That the restriction in the deed of Crane to Sherman was not intended to be personal is emphasized by the fact that it was expressly to be restricted \u201cwhen sold or built upon by him [Crane],\u201d and that as a matter of fact within a few months after the delivery of the Sherman deed Crane conveyed to Hoffman with the restrictive covenant as he had agreed to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-6\">Upon the undisputed facts there seems -to be no alternative but to grant the injunctive relief prayed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-7\">Decreed accordingly, with costs and extra allowance of $350 to plaintiffs.
