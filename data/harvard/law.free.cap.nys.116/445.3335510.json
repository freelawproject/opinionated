His employment is based upon a conversation had with the defendant\u2019s husband. He testifies as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-18\">\u201cI told him that I was doing some business in real estate. He said, \u2018I want to sell my place,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I think I can get you a customer, or sell it for .you.\u2019 He says, \u2018Go ahead.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-19\">He said that $3,500 was stated as the price for which the property could be bought. Plaintiff informed his mother-in-law of his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>versation with the defendant\u2019s husband, and advised her that in his opinion it was a good place to purchase, which she subsequently did. This conversation constitutes the effort of the plaintiff to sell the property. The defendant had, before the conversation narrated, caused the property to be placed in the hands of a real estate agent for sale. It does not appear that the defendant\u2019s husband knew that plaintiff intended making any charge for his services, or that he had any authority to employ the plaintiff, or that defendant had any knowledge of such employment, or that she ever ratified it. The plaintiff had been engaged for years in the business of buying and selling cattle and produce, and the defendant had no knowledge that he was in the \"real .estate business.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
