He bases this on section 197 of the real property law (Laws 1896, p. 589, c. 547). But that provision has npthing to do with the law of eviction. It only changes a hard rule of the common law by giving a tenant the right or option to \u201cquit and surrender possession of the leasehold premises,\u201d and thereby release himself for rent accruing after such surrender, where the \u201cbuilding which is leased or occupied is destroyed or so injured by the elements, or any other cause, as to be untenantable and unfit for occupancy,\u201d etc. In place of enlarging the law of eviction it does not provide for an eviction, but only confers an option to quit and surrender.on such injury or destruction of the building. Instead of being evicted, the tenant still has possession of the leased property, and it may be to his profit to continue to hold it. Now all that happened here was that a water pipe in the leased premises burst from freezing, and the landlord refused to repair it, although there was a provision in the lease that the landlord should do the inside repairs, \u201cincluding the plumbing.\u201d The said statute does not cover such a cas\u00e9, nor does the law' of eviction; nor was the keeping of the covenant to repair a condition to the covenant to pay rent. Huber v. Ryan, 26 Misc. Rep. 428, 56 N. Y. Supp. 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-19\">But the defense of surrender and acceptance should have been sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>mitted to the jury. When the defendant asked the plaintiff to repair the pipe he refused and told the plaintiff if he was not satisfied with that to move out', and the plaintiff told him he would move out, and he began to move out in about two weeks. While the moving was going on, the plaintiff came on the premises and told the defendant\u2019s representative to clean up the place and send him the keys when the moving was over. This is according to the evidence for the defendant. The keys were delivered to the plaintiff and he made no objection. Section '207 of the real property law, which requires a surrender of a lease for a term of more than one year to be in writing and signed by the tenant does not apply. If there be an actual surrender and acceptance that suffices. Kelly v. Noxon, 64 Hun, 281, 18 N. Y. Supp. 909; Chaplin on Landlord and Ten. c. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The defendants were not entitled to counterclaim the damage to their goods. Reiner v. Jones, 38 App. Div. 441, 56 N. Y. Supp. 423; Weinberg v. Ely, 114 App. Div. 857, 100 N. Y. Supp. 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Judgment .and order of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered ; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
