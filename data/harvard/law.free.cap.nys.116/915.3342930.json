The objections were overruled, and an order was made appointing the commissioners. An appeal was taken from the order to this court, where the order was affirmed, \u201cwith costs of said appeal to the respondent.\u201d The respondent proceeded to tax the costs and disbursements, which consisted of the following items: Before argument, $20; for argument, $40; disbursements, $7.26. The appellants, insisting that the respondent was only entitled to $10, motion costs, and disbursements, applied to the Special Term for an order directing a new taxation. The motion was denied, and this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-19\">We are decidedly of the opinion that the costs should have beqn taxed as upon an appeal from a simple order, and not at the full rate allowable in an action. The order appointing the commissioners did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>not determine the right of the parties or end the proceeding, and therefore was not a final order. Section 2550, Code Civ. Proc. It amount-' ed to a motion in the proceeding and nothing more, and it is quite manifest that the costs awarded should be in accordance with section 3239,' and not as costs upon an appeal in a special proceeding under section 3240. The hearing of the appeal to the Appellate Division is to be regarded as a motion for the purpose of costs, and the same sum might have been allowed as on the decision of a motion, $10 and disbursements. Section 3251. The amount was not fixed by the court in the order of affirmance; but the decision that the respondent have costs of the appeal may be deemed an award of the full amount of costs allowed to a prevailing part upon a motioq, under section 3251 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">It follows that the items of costs objected to should have been disallowed, and that the order denying the motion for a new taxation must be modified so as to allow the respondent to tax costs pursuant to section 3239 of the Code of Civil Procedure, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
