Morris avenue is an unpaved street, and has no curb or sewers. Jamaica avenue is pav\u2022ed with brick, and has a stone curb, but no sewers extending through it. Surface water from the latter avenue, at the point where Morris \u2022avenue intersects it, flowed into and through Morris avenue upon the plaintiff\u2019s property. The evidence tends to show that this was the natural course of drainage. There was no proof of any discharge of sewage and no satisfactory evidence tending to establish liability on the \u25a0part of the defendant for the flow of surface water complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">In Bastable v. City of Syracuse, 8 Hun, 587, and in Byrnes v. City of Cohoes, 67 N. Y. 204, cited by the appellant, and upon which he relies, there was proof that the defendants changed and diverted the \u25a0course and flow.of surface water, collecting it in the street on which \u25a0plaintiff\u2019s property was located, from which it flowed upon the premises, for which wrongful diversion, collection, and drainage the defendants were held liable. In the case at bar there is no proof that the \u25a0surface water ever flowed in any other direction or course than through Jamaica avenue to its lowest point, and thence through Morris avenue, -or across the land now occupied by that avenue, before it was laid otit as a street; and it is not shown that the defendant had anything to do with this street, or ever exercised any authority over it. There is no proof that the defendant in any manner interfered with or surcharg-ed the natural surface water course or volume. In Gravey v. City of New York, 117 App. Div. 773, 102 N. Y. Supp. 1010, the flooding was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>caused by a break in a sewer. In Noonan v. City of, Albany, 79 N. Y. 470, 35 Am. Rep. 540, the surface water and sewage of a large territory was collected and discharged through artificial channels, in a solid body, at a given point, from whence it flowed on plaintiff\u2019s land; and in Seifert v. City of Brooklyn, 101 N. Y. 136, 4 N. E. 321, 54 Am. Rep. 664, sewers were constructed within an area or district which included plaintiff\u2019s property, which were inadequate and insufficient to properly carry off the sewage and water collected in and discharged through them, by reason of which the contents were forced through the manholes and inundated plaintiff\u2019s property. The mere statement of these facts is sufficient to establish that the rules declared in the cases-cited to do not establish the liability of the defendant in the case at bar, in which the facts upon which such decisions are based are wholly lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
