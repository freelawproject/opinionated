Pen. Code, \u00a7 351. The information and the warrant against the relator accuse him of the crime of \u201cengaging in book-making.\u201d The information has to state facts which constitute book-making. Code Cr. Proc. \u00a7 742; People v. Corbalis, 178 N. Y. 516, 71 N. E. 106; People v. Pillion, 78 Hun, 74, 29 N. Y. Supp. 267; People v. Miller, 81 App. Div. 255, 80 N. Y. Supp. 1070. It does not do so. It states that the relator did on a race track \u201cquote and lay odds\u201d to many persons, specifying the said odds, \u201cthat is to say, did state and publish to said persons the terms on which\u201d he was willing to bet with the said persons against the horses on the result of races then and there to be run by such horses, and did bet $500 to $200 with a person named that a certain horse would lose. There is no allegation of the writing or recording of anything. The learned counsel for the people admits there was no writing or recording, and argues that book-making means only the making up by one of a plan or system, called a \u201cbook,\u201d of odds to be followed by him in betting with all comers, and which, though it may be written or recorded, does not need to be, but may be made up and carried in his head, and communicated or published by him orally. This is not so. There can be no book-making without writing or recording. The word in betting, and as used in the Penal Code, implies the use of a book, or sheets of paper, or a bulletin board, or some such thing. This is the genesis of the word. It is not necessary to enter upon a precise definition, no facts of writing or recording being alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">Order affirmed, without costs.
