The relief asked is, not that the defendants shall be restrained from the further \u00e9rection and alteration of buildings, but that they shall be restrained from using them for the purposes of maintaining a hospital for the insane. The defendants demurred to the complaint on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action, and, on that demurrer being overruled, appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-17\">We are of the opinion that the demurrer should have been sustained. Hospitals and insane asylums are necessities, and, while they may be so conducted in certain localities as to become nuisances, they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>not nuisances per se. Gilford v. Babies\u2019 Hospital (Sup.) 1 N. Y. Supp. 448; 29 Cyc. 1175. The plaintiffs concede that the defendants have a right to erect their buildings on their own land as they may choose, and they do not ask that their erection be restrained. By their allegations, however, they do set forth \u00e1 large number of things which they apprehend will happen when the asylum shall be established and persons of unsound mind received for treatment. If all should actually happen which the plaintiffs now imagine will happen, possibly they might have good cause for complaint. The defendants\u2019 institution, however, may be so constructed and so managed that none of the evils which the plaintiffs apprehend will ever occur. While the establishment of a lunatic asylum in the plaintiffs\u2019 neighborhood may not be a desirable thing, still the evils apprehended do not necessarily arise from its maintenance, and are not inherent to it,\"like those coming from a slaughterhouse, for example. Following the English rule, the Chancellor, in Mohawk Bridge Co. v. Utica &amp; S. R. Co., 6 Paige, 563, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">\u201cIf the thing sought to be prohibited is in itself a nuisance, the court will interfere to stay irreparable mischief, where the complainant\u2019s right is not doubtful, without waiting for the result of a trial. But where the thing sought to be restrained is not in itself noxious, but only something which may, according to circumstances, prove to be so, the court will refuse to interfere until the matter has been tried at law by an action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The rule sanctioned by the authorities and the text-books with respect to the restraining of an apprehended nuisance by temporary or permanent injunction is that an injunction will not be granted unless it is apparent or inevitable that the proposed use of the property will actually result in a nuisance. People v. Canal Board, 55 N. Y. 390; Morgan v. City of Binghamton, 102 N. Y. 500, 7 N. E. 424; Stilweil v. Buffalo Riding Academy (Sup.) 4 N. Y. Supp. 414; High on Injunctions, \u00a7 742; Wood on Nuisances, \u00a7 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The plaintiffs urge that the various things which they have alleged will happen stand admitted by the demurrer. The difficulty with applying this rule is that from the nature of the allegations they are not allegations of existing facts, but only allegations of what will transpire in the future. Where allegations of this character are made, it .cannot be that the demurrer admits that the things will actually occur as alleged; but it is left open for the court to say whether or not, from the nature of things, they probably and necessarily will happen. In our view the demurrer does not admit that all the disagreeable and dangerous things set forth in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint will actually arise. Nor does it appear to us that they will necessarily arise from the use to which the defendants propose to put their property. It follows, therefore, that the plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action entitling them to an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The defendants criticise the complaint, in that it does not allege how close to defendants\u2019 premises the plaintiffs\u2019 lands are situated, and intimate that the locality is unimproved, with plenty of room for any kind of structure or business. However that may be, in our view the demurrer to the complaint was improperly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>The interlocutory judgment overruling the demurrer should be reversed, and the demurrer sustained, with leave to the plaintiffs to amend upon payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
