Y. Supp. 799. Upon the new trial, and upon substantially the same testimony, the court submitted the questions of fact to the jury, who again found a verdict for the plaintiff, whereupon the defendants moved upon the judge\u2019s minutes to set aside the verdict and for the direction of a verdict in favor of the defendant. That' motion was granted, the court stating: \u201cI am doing this because of the decision of the Appellate Division.\u201d From the order setting aside fhat verdict, and dismissing the complaint, the plaintiffs appeal. They also appeal from the judgment entered upon such dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">Upon the former appeal there was no suggestion that there was not a question of fact to submit to the jury, or that the trial judge would have been justified in directing a verdict for the defendant. A majority of the court, considering the improbability of the contract upon which the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was based and the fact that the testimony as to the making of such contract was uncorroborated, decided that the weight of the evidence was so great in the defendants\u2019 behalf that the verdict should be set aside and a new trial ordered. The learned trial judge misapprehended the effect of this decision. There was clearly a question of fact for the jury. The order, so far as it directs a dismissal of the complaint, and the judgment thereon, should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">\u2022 The question is then presented as to whether the order setting aside the verdict upon the ground that it is against the evidence was justified. A majority of the court on the former appeal having held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>a verdict for the plaintiff was against- the weight of evidence, and the trial judge having set aside a verdict, the order, so far as it set aside the verdict, must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">The order directing a dismissal of the complaint, and the' judgment entered thereon, is reversed, with costs to the plaintiff to abide the final result; and so much of the order as sets aside the verdict and directs a new trial of the action is affirmed, with costs to-the defendant to abide the final result of the action. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
