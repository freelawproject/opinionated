The jury found for defendant. The court set aside the' verdict, and defendant .appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The jury had a right to believe those witnesses for the defendant who showed that the car was moving rapidly when plaintiff tried to get onto it, and that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. 'The mere fact that there was some difference of opinion among defendant\u2019s witnesses as to the exact rate of speed does not render defendant\u2019s evidence unworthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The order should be reversed, and the verdict reinstated, with cost's.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
