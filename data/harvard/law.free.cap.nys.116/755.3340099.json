The evidence showed that the deceased, a laborer, was employed in the nighttime in wheeling dirt along a wharf or pier and by means of a plank to a scow lying alongside. As he was walking along this plank, which was not fastened either to the wharf or the scow, it moved or tilted, and he fell into the water and was drowned.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-20\">The plank was undoubtedly a \u201cway,\u201d and it was the duty of defendant to furnish a way which was reasonably safe both as to its construction and its lighting. We are of the opinion that, upon the evidence, it was a question for the jury whether or not defendant had fulfilled his duty in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-21\">So far as concerns the question whether the deceased, knowing the insecure character of the way, assumed the risk Was certainly a question for the jury.
