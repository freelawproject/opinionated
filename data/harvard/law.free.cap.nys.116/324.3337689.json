Now, it is for you to say whether he suffered any damages at all; and, if you find that he did not suffer any damages, then you will render a verdict in favor of the defendant. If, on the other hand, you are satisfied that he did suffer injuries by reason of the occurrence which you have heard testified to, then you will render a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for such sum of damages as you think will reasonably compensate him for his pain, suffering, trouble, and inconvenience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">Counsel for defendant took an exception to this charge on the ground that it took from the jury the questions of contributory negligence and of defendant\u2019s negligence, questions which could not, under the evidence, be properly disposed of as matters of law. Counsel likewise asked the court to charge that \u201cthe question of contributory negligence is still before the jury\u201d; but this the court refused, the defendant taking an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">Clearly there can be no question of the error in this charge, and the refusal to charge. The plaintiff is bound to show affirmatively that he has been free from negligence contributing to the accident. He is an interested witness, and his testimony that he traveled upon this railroad track for several blocks without looking behind him, and that when he did look back the car was within 35 feet of him, and that he w.as just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>about to get out of the track when his wagon, was struck, presented a question for the jury. They were not bound to believe him. If they did believe him, it was still a question of fact whether he had exercised the degree of care which the circumstances demanded. It .cannot be said, as a matter of law, that a man has been free from con[tributory negligence under the facts testified to by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"A17\">The accident occurred between blocks, where the rights of the-defendant, while not exclusive, were paramount, and where the motorman had a right to assume that the plaintiff would observe the superior rights of the railroad}( and where it appears that the only excuse for the plaintiff being upon the track was to avoid the mud, which, so far as appears, was by no means impassable, it is assuming a good deal for a trial court to attempt to determine for the jury all of the real issues in an action for negligence. For these errors, as well as for the error in refusing, the request of the defendant to charge that the defendant had a paramount right to its tracks in the middle of a block, the judgment appealed from must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and a new trial granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
