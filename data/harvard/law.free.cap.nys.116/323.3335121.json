The plaintiff tripped on a loose fragment of stone lying on the sidewalk at a street corner. It was about 18 inches long, 12_ wide and 3 or 4 thick. It was a corner of a flag of the sidewalk there which city employes had recently broken off in setting a hydrant by the curb. They left it there close up to the hydrant. During two weeks it remained there, but not in the same exact spot. It was shifted from place to place, from 6 inches to about 6 feet from the hydrant, on the sidewalk and in the roadway, within a circle of a radius of about 6 feet from the hydrant as the centre. Boys moved it about and used it to jump from.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b343-18\">Appeal from Trial Term, Kings County.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-19\">Action by Mary Moriarty against the City of New York.

It cannot be held, as the learned counsel for the appellant urges, citing the recent case of Orser v. City of New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>York, 193 N. Y. 537, 86 N. E. 523, as authority, that every time the stone was shoved 6 inches, or a foot, or 6 feet, to a new position, a new question of constructive notice, dating from that time, arose, and that as there is no evidence to show how long it was,on the precise spot where it was when the plaintiff tripped on it, there is no evidence of a sufficient length of time to base such notice on. It is evident that the whole time during which the stone was being shoved about from one spot to another within the small space in which it was all the time, i. e., within a circle of a radius of about 6 feet, has to be considered in establishing constructive notice to the city, and not merely the time elapsing after it was put on the precise spot where it was when the plaintiff tripped on it. It is true that it is said in the opinion in the Orser Case that the law of constructive notice could not be applied to the plaintiff\u2019s case \u201cunless there was evidence tending to show the presence of the stone in the precise place where she fell over it\u201d long enough to impute to the city officials notice that it was there. But it is also said there that the evidence showed that the stone had been in the \u201cgeneral locality\u201d for two weeks, and that it had been \u201cremoved to the neighborhood of the telegraph pole,\u201d near which pole the plaintiff was hurt. This phrase \u201cgeneral, locality,\u201d and word \u201cneighborhood,\u201d imply, a considerable territory, and the removal of the stone from the place where it was to' another neighborhood, namely, the \u201cneighborhood\u201d in which the telegraph pole was. They cannot be understood in careful legal statement, if even in poetical or oratorical license or looseness, as describing a circle on a street of a diameter of 12 feet. We are told, however, that if the record of that case be looked into it will be found that the portable stone that caused the accident there was also all the while within a 12-foot circle, inste\u00e1d of from place to place in a territory large enough to be called a \u201cgeneral locality\u201d or a \u201cneighborhood\u201d; but the decision must be tested and interpreted as based on and applicable to the state of facts stated in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Judgment and tfrder affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
