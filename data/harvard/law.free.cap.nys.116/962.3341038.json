I said, \u2018the stock is declining, and I want to make a sale and get out of it and realize on my transaction.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, T cannot help you out. You will have to wait until we clean up a lot of affairs and until we get to it.\u2019 \u201d It was proved that delivery was made on the 13th of April, and that plaintiff made no objection to receiving the stock when it was delivered. It was proved that the stock was transferred on the books of the company on April 10, 1906, and that the difference between the highest price of 1,000 shares of the stock on March 15, 1906, and the lowest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>price on April 10, 1906, was $1,500. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, and the learned court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-5\">\u201cIt seems to me that having received the stock without protest and without objection, and having retained it ever since, it is not a waiver, but becomes an estoppel. I will grant the motion to dismiss the complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">The 'plaintiff paid .full price- for the stock to be transferred upon the books of the company and delivered to him upon a fixed future day. There was a breach of said contract, in that upon said day the stock was not transferred to his name upon the books of the company, qnd upon demand with notice that he desired delivery because the stock was declining, and he wanted to make a sale and realize on the transaction, defendants failed to cause the transfer to be made and failed to deliver until nearly a month thereafter; the value of the stock having very considerably depreciated in the meanwhile. It would seem that the plaintiff had established the essential ingredient's of a cause of action, a valid contract upon sufficient consideration, a breach upon demand, and resulting damage, with notice to the defendants of the condition of the market and that a failure to deliver would cause damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">We \u00e1re unable.to perceive in what way the subsequent acceptance of the stock operated as an estoppel. The plaintiff had the absolute right to the stock. He had paid for it in full and it belonged to him. It was to be delivered upon a day certain. If not delivered, he would have been entitled to the full value thereof by way of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">In Ripley v. \u00c6tna Life Insurance Co., 30 N. Y. 136, 86 Am. Dec. 362, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-9\">\u201cIt seems to me that a waiver to be operative must be supported by an agreement founded on a valuable' consideration, or the act relied on as a waiver must be such as to estop a party from insisting on the performance of the contract or forfeiture of the condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">In Stenton v. Jerome, 54 N. Y. 480, the court' said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-11\">\u201cIt .is a principle as old as the common law that a cause of action once vested can only be discharged by a release under seal, or the receipt of something in satisfaction\u201d\u2014citing McKnight v. Dunlop, 5 N. Y. 537, 55 Am. Dec. 370.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-12\">In New York Rubber Company v. Rothery, 107 N. Y. 310, 14 N. E. 269, 1 Am. St. Rep. 822, Judge Peckham defines an \u201cestoppel\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-13\">\u201cTo constitute it, the person sought to be estopped must do such act or make such admission, with the intention of influencing the conduct of another, or that he had reason to believe would influence his conduct, and which act or admission is inconsistent with the claim he now proposes to make. The other party too must have acted upon the strength of such admission or conduct\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-14\">And in Clark v. West, 193 N. Y. 349, 86 N. E. 1, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-15\">\u201cWe assume that no waiver could be implied from the defendant\u2019s mere acceptance of the books and his payment of the sum of $2 per page without objection. It was the defendant\u2019s duty to pay that amount in any event after acceptance of the work. The plaintiff must stand upon his allegation of an express waiver, and, if he fails to establish that, he cannot maintain his action. * * * A \u2018waiver\u2019 has been defined to be the essential relinquish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>ment of a known right. It is voluntary, and implies an election to dispense with something of value, or forego' some advantage which the party waiving it might, at its option, have demanded or insisted upon. * * * The law of waiver seems to be a technical doctrine introduced and applied by the court for the purpose of defeating forfeitures. * * * The doctrine of equitable estoppel or estoppel in pais is that a party may be precluded by his acts and conduct from asserting a right to the detriment of another party who, entitled to rely on such conduct, has acted upon it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">There is no pretense in the case at bar that the defendants had any rights which were lost or affected t'o their detriment by the act of the plaintiff in accepting the stock which clearly belonged to him, or that they were induced to make said delivery by any promises or representations of his. He merely received his own property when defendants got ready to perform their father\u2019s contract. The damages which he might otherwise have recovered, based upon their refusal to deliver, were mitigated but not wiped out. He had a right of action for damages for breach of contract. He did not waive that right, and he did nothing to estop himself from asserting that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
