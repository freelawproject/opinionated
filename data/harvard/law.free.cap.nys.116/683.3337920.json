The court found for defendant, and plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">The electricity was cut off, and plaintiff wrote demanding the reason therefor. A rather long correspondence took place, and in many letters plaintiff demanded that the electricity be supplied, while defendant insisted on plaintiff\u2019s signing a written contract prepared by defendant. Plaintiff wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-14\">\u201cI desire you to restore the connection and furnish the current, as heretofore, * * * on the same terms and under the same conditions as heretofore.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">There is no objection raised by defendant as to the terms and conditions under which the electricity had been supplied; but, as we have-said, defendant insisted upon its particular form of contract being-signed. The statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-16\">\u201cUpon the application in writing of the owner or occupant of any building on-premises * * * the corporation shall supply gas or electric light, * * * and if for the space of ten days after such application and the deposit of a reasonable sum, if required, the corporation shall refuse or neglect to supply gas or electric light, as required, such corporation shall forfeit and pay to the-applicant the sum of $10 and the further sum of $5 for every day thereafter-during which such refusal or neglect shall continue\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-17\">\u2014except under certain circumstances, which exceptions do not apply here; nor was any deposit demanded or required by defendant. The-question at issue was the sufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s demand, above quoted. Under the authority of Jones v. Rochester Gas Co., 7 App. Div. 465, 39 N. Y. Supp. 1105, Id., 7 App. Div. 474, 477, 39 N. Y. Supp. 1110, affirmed 158 N. Y. 678, <em>52 </em>N. E. 1124, and Bennett v. Eastchester Light Co., 54 App. Div. 74, 66 N. Y. Supp. 292, we think the demand in the case at bar was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-18\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
