On the appeal from that judgment to the County Court, the judgment was reversed, with costs to the defendant. The plaintiff thereupon appealed to this court, where the judgment of the County Court was affirmed, with costs. A motion was then made by the defendant in the County Court for leave to tax her costs in the action against the plaintiff individually, and from the order granting that motion the plaintiff has taken this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The cause of action sued upon was one accruing after the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and was one which might have been brought in her individual name, and need not have been prosecuted by her in her representative capacity. She, having been defeated in the action, was under the authorities individually liable for the costs, notwithstanding she sued in a representative capacity. Buckland v. Gallup, 105 N. Y. 453, 11 N. E. 843. Indeed, in such a case it was not necessary, although it was proper, to procure an order declaring her liability. Mullen v. Guinn, 88 Hun, 128, 34 N. Y. Supp. 625. The order which was made was simply declaratory of the law, as it was well settled and existed upon the subject, and, even though the order was unnecessary, it does not render the plaintiff a party aggrieved, for she was clearly liable for the costs in the absence of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">For this reason, her appeal should be dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
