The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is based upon the theory that he had contracted for two certain parcels of real estate, intending to sell them to a real estate company by which he was employed as a sales manager upon a commission basis; that for reasons of his own he employed the defendant, for a consideration of $100, to act as a dummy in the transaction, the plaintiff furnishing all of the money; that the defendant entered into the arrangement and became the nominal party to the contracts which were entered into, resulting in a profit of over $2,000, which sum the defendant has failed to pay over to the plaintiff. The theory of the defendant is that he was the real principal in the transaction; that he repaid the plaintiff the sums which the latt'er had loaned to carry out the deals, together with a commission of $300; and that the plaintiff has no standing in the action. There was a sharp conflict in the evidence; but it cannot be said that there is not evidence to support the plaintiff\u2019s version, and under such circumstances appellate courts do not, as a rule, interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-18\">It is urged with great persistency that the documentary evidence wholly contradicts the oral evidence, and that the weight of .evidence is with the defendant. While it is true that upon its face the documentary evidence, unexplained, would seeni to support the defendant\u2019s contention, we are of the opinion that in connection with the entire case there is no irreconcilable difference, and that the learned court below was fully justified in its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-19\">The suggestion that the defendant, having invested the fund in other real estate, has taken away the jurisdiction of the court to declare a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>trust in the particular fund, is hardly worthy of serious. discussion. The equitable jurisdiction rests upon the defendant\u2019s abuse of a confidential or fiduciary relation, and no action of the defendant can destroy the right of the plaintiff to follow the fund or to require such relief as the circumstances permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">' The judgment should be affirmed, with cost\u2019s. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
