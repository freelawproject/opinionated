It is conceded that the loan was obtained and the mortgage drawn. Plaintiff was in no wise responsible for the questioned lack of power in the executors to make the mortgage. If the \u25a0contract was conditioned upon the acceptance and payment of the mon&lt;ey to be loaned, if the plaintiff had undertaken to procure the loan upon the approval of title, a different contract would have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Respondent argues that plaintiff was not' restricted to obtain the loan from the title company, and that other parties should be sought by plaintiff, until one is found ready and willing to make the loan. The Lawyers\u2019 Title Insurance &amp; Trust Company was ready, able, and willing t'o furnish the loan if, under the will, the executors had power to make the mortgage. That company, however, decided that the heirs \u25a0of the testator were necessary as mortgagors, and on the failure of all ;the heirs to join declined to make the loan. The complaint avers full performance of the contract, and an excuse or cause for its nonperformance by defendant, to wit', defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure or misfortune to -obtain one of the signatures required by the said Lawyers\u2019 Title Insurance &amp; Trust Company of one of the heirs at law, * ' * * and which signature was necessary to make the title good and marketable, .\u25a0so that said loan could be consummated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In Gatling v.
