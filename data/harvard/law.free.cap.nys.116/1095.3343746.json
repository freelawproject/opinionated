The defendant denies the material allegations of the complaint, and also sets up a breach of warranty .and misrepresentation as to the quality of the paint. The affidavits of the defendant name 10 witnesses, including its president, all of whom reside in Onondaga county, except one, who resides in an adjoining county. The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit names 11 witnesses residing in Greene county.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-19\">It is urged on behalf of the plaintiff that one of the defendant\u2019s witnesses is an expert, and that four of the other witnesses are employes of the defendant, and therefore that none of these witnesses, nor the president, should be considered upon this application. We may concede, without deciding, this; but still the motion should have been granted. The plaintiff\u2019s witnesses are all on the question of the qual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>ity of the paint, which is the principal question to be tried, and it is stated that it will be shown by nine of them that they have purchased or used paint identical with the paint in question. It is not pretended that any of these nine witnesses ever saw or had any of the paint which was shipped to the defendant, but that they had purchased or used paint man\u00fcfactured by the defendant and shipped to others. It is not apparent how they could know anything concerning the paint in question. Two only of the defendant\u2019s witnesses are shown to be in a position to give material evidence on the issues involved here, one of whom, it is claimed, Went to Syracuse and purchased from the defendant a portion of the paint which it received from the Tropical Oil Company, and another that he formerly worked for that company, and that he was familiar with the composition and manufacture of the paint in question. They are, therefore, material witnesses on the question of quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">This being the situation, there is no preponderance in the number of material witnesses in favor of the plaintiff over those of the defendant. All the transactions took place in Onondaga county. This sales agent, who is now the plaintiff, and the defendant, made the contract there, and the paint was delivered there. Such of it as had been sold has been used there. If the claim had not been assigned to the plaintiff, the action would necessarily have been required to be brought there. Under such circumstances, we think the action should be tried there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">The order should be reversed with $10 costs and disbursements; and motion granted, with $10 costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
