It will not be seriously claimed that the General Assembly can constitutionally try, condemn and impose penalties upon a body of people aggregated as a municipal corporation, without notice, and a hearing and judicial determination. <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>44 Conn. 296; <em>Westbrook\u2019s Appeal, </em>57 id. 95; <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>45 id. 142; <em>Lothrop </em>v. <em>Steadman, </em>42 id. 592. The Special Act is unconstitutional in that it confers upon a railroad company, and three persons arbitrarily selected bjr the legislature, absolute power to make a contract for the city of Bridgeport, to which the city of Bridgeport, is not a party. This is not due process of law. It makes the railroad company one of the judges in a question of property rights between the company and the city. <em>Windham Cotton Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>23 Conn. 373; <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>12 id. 391. Moreover, the Act violates the constitutional provision against municipal aid to railway companies ; it authorizes the issue of city bonds to raise money for the payment of the expenses of the work. That certainly is a \u201c loan \u201d of the city\u2019s \u201c credit \u201d for that purpose. <em>People </em>v. <em>Salem; </em>20 Mich. 452; <em>Bay City </em>v. <em>Treasurer, </em>23 id. 500; <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>111 Mass. 454; <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Coggeshall, </em>12 R.

S. 121; <em>Samis </em>v. <em>King, </em>40 Conn. 310. It is a mistake to view the agreement in question as a contract between the city and the railroad company. It is merely a means adopted by the State to determine the plans and apportion the expense for the removal of grade crossings in the city. Having been entered into, when approved by the railroad commissioners, it becomes an order of the railroad commissioners, and is then the State\u2019s method of dealing with the matter, which the railroad commissioners must carry out. The plaintiff, however, says that the legislature has no power to pass the resolution in question, because it is in violation of the Constitution of the State and of the United States. There are no facts alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and exhibits that point out the unconstitutional features of the agreement, and we are left to judge of it upon its face. It appears that every one of its provisions is included within the terms of the resolution authorizing it, and consequently the plaintiff must attack the power of the legislature to pass the resolution. This he cannot do successfully because every conceivable phase of the subject has been passed upon by this court adversely to his claims, in the long series of decisions growing out of the removal of grade crossings, under Special Acts of the General Assembly, or under the general railroad law. The police and taxing powers of the State are ample to authorize the resolution in question. <em>Westbrook\u2019s Appeal, </em>58 Conn. 95; <em>Woodruff v. N. Y. &amp; N. E. R.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AN1\">The plaintiff, in his complaint, prayed for an injunction to restrain the city authorities of Bridgeport from taking certain action which he alleged they were about to take, and which would subject the taxpayers of that city to heavy, illegal taxes. The Superior Court refused the injunction and dismissed the complaint. From that judgment the plaintiff has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"AOY\">If it were true that the consequences of the action complained of would \"follow, as asserted by the plaintiff, then his complaint was not prematurely brought. <em>Obsta </em>prineipiis, is an exceedingly good maxim to act upon in eases where illegal taxation is threatened. But we think the consequences feared by the plaintiff will not follow, and that there is no error in the judgment of the Superior Court. To make this view entirely plain we must examine the case with some care, both as to the action itself and its legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The defendants are the common council of Bridgeport. On the 20th day of April, 1896, Frank E. Clark, William E. Seeley and Frederick S. Stevens, who were appointed by a resolution of the General Assembly, enacted in 1895, agents on behalf of that city to enter into an agreement with The Hew York, Hew Haven and Hartford Railroad Company, \u2022reported to the Common Council of that city that they had, pursuant to that resolution, made an agreement with the said railroad company in respect to the matters mentioned in the \u25a0resolution, and submitted the same, reading as follows:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\u201c Whereas, the General Assembly of the State of Connecticut, at its last session, passed a resolution which was approved June 22d, 1895, and which provides that in order that the safety of the public may be insured, all crossings at grade.over the main tracks of the railroad of the Hew York, Hew Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Company in the city of Bridgeport, shall be abolished, and also that said city and said railroad company may within six months after the passage of said resolution, agree upon the manner, plans, method and time in which said crossings at grade shall be abolished, and upon all other matters mentioned in Sec. 6 of said resolution, and what amount or what proportion, or what items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>of the cost thereof shall be paid by the city of Bridgeport, and for the purpose of making said agreement, empower the Mayor of said city of Bridgeport and William E. Seeley and Frederick S. Stevens, to act for said city: \u201c Now, therefore, in accordance with the provisions of said resolution of the General Assembly and subject to the approval of the board of railroad commissioners, the said city of Bridgeport acting herein by its agents, Hon. Frank E. Clark, its mayor, and the said William E. Seeley and Frederick S. Stevens, thereunto duly authorized by said resolutions, and said New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Company, acting herein by John M. Hall, its vice-president, hereunto duly authorized, do hereby agree as follows : 1. For the purpose of abolishing the crossings aforesaid, the location, grade and plan of said railroad through said city and the number of its tracks, shall be substantially as shown upon the plans marked \u2018 Plans for the abolition of grade crossings on the Main Line, New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Company, city of Bridgeport, Conn.\u2019\u2014said plan being signed by the respective agents of the parties hereto, and the work of excavation, construction, alteration, and grading of said tracks, streets, approaches, bridges and abutments, according to said plans, shall be done by said railroad company, both upon its own land and upon the highways affected by said plans, except as hereinafter specifically otherwise provided. The grades of the railroad tracks and of the highways shall be as shown upon said plans. The stone abutments of all bridges shall be of equal workmanship of the abutments of the existing bridge across Fairfield avenue (west), unless modified by the railroad commissioners. Said railroad company, during the progress of said work, shall have the free use of such streets or portions of streets and the right to temporarily close such streets as may be necessary for the convenient prosecution of the work. Crescent avenue and Railroad street are hereby extended from their present easterly termini to the westerly line of the proposed freight station yard of said railroad company east of Central avenue, and East Washington avenue shall be extended and constructed by said city to Seaview avenue, provided said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>railroad company elects to lay a siding on the north side of its main tracks as hereinafter provided, and so much of South Railroad avenue between Broad and Main streets, as is occupied by the structure of said railroad company as shown on said plan, is hereby discontinued as a highway, and Clark, Wilmot and North and South Railroad avenues, west of Fair-field avenue (west), and all streets and private ways whether existing or projected upon or across the property of said railroad company along its main line tracks, not shown upon said plans, are hereby discontinued, except the private ways between a point opposite the east end of Union street and Fairfield avenue (east). South Railroad avenue is hereby extended from Wordin avenue to Howard avenue forty feet wide. Said railroad company shall lay and maintain a track at grade upon the south side of South Railroad avenue, from Fairfield avenue eastward to the westerly line of South avenue, free from all burdens or assessments of any kind so long as said railroad company maintains the same, said track to be connected by proper switches with such side or spur tracks as now exist or as may hereafter be granted or permitted by said city. Said railroad company shall bridge, as shown upon the plans, the following named streets: Bostwick avenue, Hancock avenue, Howard avenue, Wordin avenue, Iranistan avenue, Park avenue, South avenue, Myrtle avenue, Warren street, Lafayette street, Broad street, Main street, Wall street, Fairfield avenue, Sterling street, Noble avenue, Clarence street, Kossuth street, East Main street, Pembroke street, Hallett street, Seaview avenue, Central avenue, and Bishop avenue, with the head room in each case of not less than twelve feet in the clear between the crown of the street and the bottom of the girder, unless otherwise shown on the plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u201c The location of the pipes, wires, poles or tracks of any water, gas, telephone, or electric light, telegraph or power company, or street railway company, and all public of private sewers or drain pipes, shall be changed at the expense of said several companies, whenever in any manner they interfere with the prosecution of said work or the construction or maintenance of the same according to said plans, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>such manner or in such time as the board of railroad commissioners shall order.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u201c For the accommodation of manufacturing and other shippers in East Bridgeport, said railroad company shall construct a fifth track leading from its proposed freight station in East Bridgeport, or from some point between said freight station and Seaview avenue, to the easterly line of Hallett street, and the same may be placed either on the north or south side of the main tracks, but shall cross Seaview avenue on a level with said main tracks. Such fifth track shall be considered as a part of the work herein provided for and shall be included in the cost thereof, and said railroad company shall have the right to use such portion of any street or streets immediately adjoining the railroad location as may be necessary for the location and maintenance of such fifth track, and said company shall be free from all burden and assessments on account of said fifth track-so long as it shall maintain the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u201c2. It is understood and agreed that the work herein provided for shall commence on or before the first day of April, 1896, and proceed as rapidly as possible until finished.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u201c 8. In consideration whereof said city hereby agrees to pay to said railroad company one sixth of the entire cost of constructing a four track railroad from Fairfield avenue (west) to Bruce\u2019s brook, as by the alignment and grade shown on the plans above named, including the work done on the highways as per said plans, and including all bridges ready for ties, all damages to property resulting from a change of grade of streets, or the discontinuance of the same or parts thereof, and the cost and damages to all lands which have been or may be acquired by said railroad company for the purpose of said four track construction, together with a reasonable allowance for the services and expenses to the date hereof of Frank E. Clark, William E. Seeley and Frederick S. Stevens, the persons appointed by said resolution to act for said city, and for such services as is imposed upon them by the provisions of this agreement, provided that the total cost to be paid by said city shall not exceed in the aggregate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>sum of 1400,000. Said railroad company shall keep a detailed account of the cost of said construction, excluding therefrom the cost of the passenger station and ground and approaches thereto, not required for said four track construction, and all switches and side tracks and all other items properly belonging to the superstructure of said railroad. In case any question shall arise between said city and said railroad company as to any item charged or claimed as a proper charge for the construction account, either by said railroad company or said city, and the said city and said railroad company cannot agree as to its allowance as a proper charge to said construction account, all such disputed items shall be left to the arbitrament of the board of railroad commissioners of the State of Connecticut, whose decision shall be final and conclusive in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u201c In case any question shall arise between said railroad company and said city as to the value of any land owned or acquired by the railroad company, or damages thereto, on account of the necessary use thereof, or damages thereto by the construction of said four track railroad, and said city and said railroad company shall be unable to agree as to the value or amount thereof, then the equitable value of the portion of such property used, occupied or damaged, shall be determined by the Hon. Frank E. Clark, William E. Seeley, Frederick S. Stevens, William D. Bishop, I. DeVer Warner and James Staples, or by a majority of them, under oath, and their decision shall be final and conclusive between the parties as to the amount properly chargeable to the cost of the work herein provided for. The amounts paid for all items of construction, land damages by reason of changes of grade, discontinuance of streets or parts thereof, and all damages of every kind paid on account thereof for the prosecution of said four track construction, shall be submitted to Frank E. Clark. William E. Seeley and Frederick S. Stevens, as a committee to audit the same in behalf of said city, and shall be verified if required by said committee. If said committee at any time shall neglect or refuse to audit or approve said accounts when requested to do so, the board of railroad commissioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>shall, upon the request of either party, audit such accounts, and when so audited and approved by either said committee or said railroad commissioners as above provided, the amount thereof shall be accepted by both parties as a part of the entire cost of construction. It is further agreed that said accounts shall be audited as often as once in 80 days, if required by the railroad company, and when so audited the proportion to be paid by the city to said railroad company shall be a debt due said railroad company, and shall draw interest at. the rate of 5 per cent per annum until paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In the common council it was moved that the report be accepted and approved, and that the contract be affirmed and ratified. This motion was referred to the appropriate committee. Before that committee had reported this suit was brought. These are the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The record before us does not disclose whether or not the said contract has been approved by tbe board of railroad commissioners. If it has not been so approved the plaintiff has no occasion for an injunction. The resolution<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> seems to eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>template that the contract shall not be obligatory on any one unless it receives such approval. If, however, it has been, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>shall be hereafter, approved by that board, then it becomes an order of that board and enforceable as such. It is in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>latter aspect that the legality of the contract is to be considered. We assume that the contract has been or will be approved by that board.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The policy of this State for quite a number of years has been to remove all grade crossings of railroads by highways. To accomplish this end the legislature has been constantly making efforts, sometimes by mild and permissive means, and at others with a pretty strong hand. The most notable instance, perhaps, as it applied to a case of the very highest danger, was the Asylum Street Bridge Commission, in which the legislature by direct interference sought to remove the danger of a grade crossing in the city of Hartford, by its own agents. That was in 1884. Of that Act this court, in <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Catlin, </em>54 Conn. 277, 295, said: \u201c The Act, in scope and purpose, concerns protection of life. Neither in intent nor fact does it increase or diminish the assets either of the city or of the railroad corporations. It is the exercise of the governmental power and duty to secure a safe high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>way. The legislature, having determined that the intersection of two railways with a highway in the city of Hartford at grade is a nuisance dangerous to life, in the absence of action on the part either of the city or of the railroads, may compel them severally to become the owners of the right to lay out new highways and new railways over such land and in such manner as will separate the grade of the railways from that of the highways at intersection; may compel them to use the right for the accomplishment of the desired end; may determine that the expense shall be paid by either corporation alone or in part by both; and may enforce obedience to its judgment. That the legislature of this State has the power to do all this, for the specified purpose, and to do it through the instrumentality of a commission, it is now only necessary to state, not to argue.\u201d The doctrine of that case was repeated and acted upon in the <em>N. Y. &amp; N. E. R. R. Co.\u2019s </em>Appeal, 58 Conn. 532, 541, and in <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>N. Y. &amp; N. E. R. R., </em>59 id. 63, 79. In 1889 the legislature made the board of railroad commissioners a general commission, and commanded them to act on their own motion to accomplish the removal of those grade crossings which were specially dangerous. Acting on that command the railroad commissioners ordered the removal of a grade crossing by the New York and New England Railroad Company in the town of Bristol. That order and the Act under which it was made were approved by this court in the <em>N. Y. &amp; N. E. R. R. Co.\u2019s Appeal from </em>Com\u2019rs, 62 Conn. 527, 530, where it was held, that it was competent for the legislature to act in the duty of providing safe highways, through a general commission as well as through a special one; and that decision has been sustained by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>N. Y. &amp; N. E. R. R. </em>v. Bristol, 151 U. S. 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Danger from grade crossings was as highly threatening, and in some respects even more serious, in Bridgeport, than at Asylum street in the city of Hartford. The New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad extends through the entire length of the city a distance of more than four miles, and on both sides of the harbor which it crosses by a draw-bridge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>A part of the way it lies along the shore of the harbor, obstructing all passage from the business parts of the city to the steamboat landing and the docks. It appears in the agreement that there are twenty-four streets crossed at grade by the railroad, some of them, as it is stated, the most frequently traveled ones in the whole city. It is a town of 60,000 inhabitants and is rapidly growing. Its people are largely engaged in manufacturing, and their prosperity is affected in a great degree by the readiness with which they can receive and transmit goods from and by railroad. Its growth in wealth and population depends materially upon its railroad facilities. The railroad receives large amounts of freight and very many passengers from the city, and desires to extend these facilities. The railroad company has completed its four tracks from New York to New Haven, except that part which lies in the city of Bridgeport. The completion of that work awaited the adoption of some plan by which these grade crossings could be avoided. The State would not permit the danger of these crossings tobe increased by the additional tracks at grade. The city for its own welfare was not willing that such increase of danger should be allowed, and the railroad shared in the same unwillingness.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">It was this condition of things in Bridgeport which the legislature in 1895 was called on to meet, when it enacted the Special Act under which Mr. Clark and the others acted in making the contract above recited. That contract declares that in order that the safety of the public may be insured, all crossings at grade over the main tracks of the railroad of the N. Y., N. H. &amp; H. R. R. in the city of Bridgeport shall be abolished in the manner therein provided. It appoints Mr. Clark and the others to act for the city, and authorizes them to make an agreement with the railroad company as to the manner, plans, method and time in which all the said crossings at grade shall be abolished, and then declares that \u201c such agreement shall be final and conclusive upon all parties concerned when approved by the board of railroad commissioners of this State, and shall then be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>deemed to be an order of said board and enforceable in the manner provided in section seven of this resolution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Assuming now, as we do, that the agreement has received or will receive the approval of the railroad commissioners, this case comes fully within the principles laid down in the authorities we have cited. The resolution, the agreement, and the approval by the railroad commissioners, are but the parts of one governmental act to secure safe highways in the city of Bridgeport. The legislature having determined that the grade crossings of the various streets in that city constitute a nuisance dangerous to life, has proceeded, in the way pointed out in the resolution and agreement, to compel the city and the railroad to become the owners of new highways and new railroads to accomplish that end, has determined who shall do the work and who shall pay the expenses, and is doing this through the instrumentality of the persons named in the resolution and of the railroad commissioners. That the legislature of this State has the power to do this, it is now necessary only to state, not to argue. This governmental act does not increase or diminish the assets of the city or of the railroad. It only changes the form in which the assets exist. It \u201c violates no contract, takes away no property, and interferes with no vested right.\u201d <em>N. Y. &amp; N. E. R. R.

The Act of June 22d, 1895, provides for an abatement of a nuisance dangerous to life, resulting from the intersection of railroad tracks and highways at grade within the limits of the city of Bridgeport, at the expense of the municipality and railroad company responsible for its existence; and it authorizes the board of railroad commissioners to make the necessary order for this purpose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>and provides for an agreement between the company and certain persons named in the Act as representatives of the city, for the purpose of facilitating the performance by the railroad commissioners of the duty imposed upon them. In this the legislature does not exceed its powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">It was claimed on behalf of the plaintiff that the Act authorizes an agreement, not merely for the purpose of aiding the commissioners in making a proper order, but for the purpose of binding the city by obligations other than those involved in the elimination of grade crossings, and that a valid agreement for such purpose requires the action of the municipality ; also that the Act authorizes a donation by the city to the railroad corporation for the building of additional tracks and a new draw-bridge, contrary to the provisions of the XXVth article of the amendments to the Constitution. I agree that it is not necessary to pass upon these questions in order to sustain the demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint,\u2014 the only question now before us; but I deem it proper, in concurring in the opinion, to negative any implication that these questions are affected bjr the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In this opinion Hamersley, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
