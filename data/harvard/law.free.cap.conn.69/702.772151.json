Upon an appeal from this appointment it was held: \u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b712-7\">1.

That if the attempted direction and control of the action of the Court of Probate was permissible under \u00a7491 of the General Statutes relating to the appointment of testamentary trustees, it amounted to no more than a grant of power to certain individuals in a matter of private confidence, which could be exercised only by their unanimous concurrence; and on the other hand, if the provision was to be regarded as an unauthorized attempt to confer jurisdiction upon a court and dictate its proceedings, it was void; and consequently, upon either assumption, the Court of Probate proceeded properly in filling the vacancy.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b712-11\">The letters of a judge and his declarations out of court are mere hearsay, and incompetent to show the process of reasoning leading to a judgment.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b712-12\">[Argued October 7th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AfI\">decided November 3d, 1897.]</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b712-13\">Appeal from an order and decree of the Court of Probate for the district of Windsor, appointing a testamentary trustee to fill a vacancy, taken to the Superior Court in Hartford County and tried to the court, Elmer, <em>J.; </em>facts found and judgment rendered for the appellants, and appeal by one of the appellees for.alleged errors in the rulings of the court.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AVL\">Error, <em>and judgment reversed.</em></disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b712-14\">The will created a trust of residuary estate, for the bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>fit of four sisters of the testator during their lives, and of the children of two of them, during the lives of such children, with remainder thereafter to the grandchildren of said two sisters, or their issue or legal representatives. This estate was vested in five executors and the survivors or survivor of them, and their successors, as trustees, in trust for the use of the parties beneficially interested. Of the five persons named as executors, two were the husbands of two of the sisters, and three were of the immediate family of another of them, one being her husband, and two her sons-in-law. The fourth sister was unmarried. All the executors qualified and accepted the trust in 1879. In 1896 the death of one left only two surviving, Samuel H.

Should be pleased to hear from you if you have any one to suggest for the position.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b714-11\">\u201cVery truly yours, D. Ellsworth Phelps.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b714-12\">To the admission of this letter as evidence the appellee (appellant here) objected, but the court admitted the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>The appellants offered the testimony of Eustace L. Allen as to two conversations which he had had with the judge of probate, one on the 29th day of October, 1896, and the other November 11th, to both of which conversations the appellee objected, but the court admitted the same. This testimony was that on the 29th day of October, 1896, he had had a conversation with Judge Phelps in the probate office in Windsor, in relation to the reason why he had refused to appoint Julian S. Allen as a trustee to fill said vacancy. Judge Phelps in his presence then wrote the letter to his father above referred to, for the witness to take to his father, and the judge stated that he had decided to appoint one outside the family, because of the disagreement in the family; that he could not appoint Mr. Julian S. Allen, whose name had been mentioned, and much less Mr. Spalding, whose name had been mentioned ; that the objection of one of the trustees alone to the appointment of Mr. Allen would not have been sufficient to justify him to refuse to appoint at the request of the beneficiaries ; that he did not refuse on the ground that he considered him an unsuitable or an improper person, but only on account of the disagreement in the family; that subsequently, on the 11th day of November, the same witness (Eustace L. Allen) met Judge Phelps in the highway, and asked him why he refused to appoint his brother, Julian S. Allen, and the judge replied that it was because some of the beneficiaries objected. The witness then asked the judge if he would have appointed him if the}7 had not objected, and he said \u201c yes; \u201d if they had all agreed he would have appointed him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b715-5\">Upon the above evidence, to the admission of which the appellee duly objected, the court found that the said judge of probate did not refuse to appoint Julian' S. Allen because he was not a suitable person, nor did he pass upon the question whether he could appoint him with safety to the estate ; but that he declined to make said appointment on the sole ground that only a part of the beneficaries asked for his appointment, and the other beneficiaries objected to such appointment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>The appellee, upon the hearing, claimed among other things, as matter of law, that the provisions of the will did not divest the judge of probate of his power and discretion in appointing a trustee to fill a vacancy in the absence of a nomination by the existing trustees, or <em>by </em>the persons interested in the estate; that the letter of Judge Phelps was immaterial and irrelevant; that the conversations between Mr. Eustace L. Allen and the judge of probate were immaterial, irrelevant, and inadmissible, and were hearsay evidence ; that the Court of probate is a court of record, and its action can only be shown in and by its decree; and that the decree appealed from showed presumptively that sufficient reasons were given by those interested in the estate against the appointment of Julian'S. Allen, aside from the question of safety to the estate. The court did not sustain any of said claims, but rendered judgment for the appellants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b716-5\"><em>Charles P.

General Statutes, Rev. of 1866, p. 407, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 27; General Statutes, Rev. of 1888, \u00a7\u00a7 490, 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">In the will of William S. Pierson certain provisions on these subjects were made. The five executors and trustees, whom he named, were to hold in joint tenancy; but whenever their number should be reduced to two, he directed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>the judge of probate of the district to which he belonged should appoint a third, and in so doing should \u201c regard the wishes of the existing trustees, or the persons interested in the estate, as far as he believes he can with safety to the estate, but no further.\u201d Then follows a clause stating that while he did not desire the judge of probate to be governed in fixing the amount of bonds for the executors and trustees by the law with regard to the value of the personal property belonging to the trust, he wished such bonds to be given as, together with their own personal responsibility, should, as far as practicable, secure the estate from loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">This latter provision assumes that the judge of probate lias certain duties under the law as to requiring bonds from executors and trustees, which may be affected by testamentary directions. Such is the case in respect to Courts of Probate, and to judges of probate while acting officially as such a court; and it is obvious that by the term \u201c J udge of Probate \u201d the testator here meant to describe the Court of Probate for the district of Windsor.' The rule of construction that words occurring more than once in a will shall be presumed to be used always in the same sense, unless a contrary intention appear by the context or they be applied to a different subject, applies with double force where the word in question is found in two sentences in immediate succession. It was, therefore, the Court of Probate which the testator must be deemed to have had iu mind, in directing as to the exercise of the power of appointment; although his reference to the \u201cJudge of Probate of this district,\u201d had it stood alone, might have been taken to apply to that individual who, for the time being, should be occupying that office. <em>Bishop </em>v. Bishop, 54 Conn. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">This clause of the will seeks to impose a certain limitation on the action of the court in making an appointment. The imperative phrase \u201cshall regard the wishes,\u201d if taken in its natural import, is equivalent to \u201c shall be governed by the wishes.\u201d We find it unnecessary to determine whether, assuming this to be its proper construction, the manner in which the testator sought to direct and control the action of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the Court of Probate is such as, under General Statutes, \u00a7 491, the law permits. If the provision be given full effect, it would amount to no more than the grant of a power to certain individuals, by the expression of their wishes, to control within certain limits the judgment of the court in the choice of a trustee. It would, as to them, concern a matter of mere private confidence; and every power of that description, conferred upon several persons, must be exercised by their unanimous concurrence, or not at all. The testator undertook to create an alternative power. If the two surviving trustees had agreed on any nomination, and had all the beneficiaries under the trust then in being (including, in the case of minors, their guardians), agreed on another, the Court of Probate would have been left free to choose between them. As it was, the trustees expressed no wish, and the beneficiaries agreed on none ; each of those who appeared, objecting to the nominations made by any of the others. Under these circumstances, the Court of Probate properly proceeded to fill the vacancy, without regard to wishes expressed by any number of the <em>cestuis que trustent, </em>less than the whole; even if the provision made by the testator be regarded as supported by the statute in its full extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On the other hand, if it can be regarded as an unauthorized attempt to confer jurisdiction upon a court of justice and dictate its course of proceeding, then it was so far forth void, and the decree of the Court of Probate was a valid exercise of its ordinary statutory powers. This would be true, notwithstanding the general rule of equity jurisprudence that in appointing a trustee the court should always pay regard to the wishes of the person who may have constituted the trust, or of those whom he has empowered to speak in his behalf; for in this case no such wishes were ever expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The evidence received to show the reasons which led the judge of probate to pass the decree in question was, in any view of the case, totally incompetent and inadmissible. His letters and declarations out of court were mere hearsay. Judicial decrees speak for themselves, and whenever, in the rare instances when it may be permissible to inquire into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>process of reasoning leading to a judgment, no finding on that subject has been made, the facts must be proved, as in other cases, by direct testimony, and the judge put upon the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">There is error, and the judgment of the Superior Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
