The wife filed an answer, and was heard, the following facts being stated in the finding:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-14\">She was married in 1872. In 1891 she mortgaged land belonging to her, to secure the performance -by her husband of the covenants in a lease to him of a farm. Suit was after-wards brought against him on these covenants, and in the action she was made a garnishee, and certain of her personal property and choses in action were attached, as his estate. What was thus attached, while it had not been conveyed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>her for her separate use, had always been treated by both him and her as such, and his conduct in respect to it had been such as to divest him of the interest he would otherwise have had in it by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-5\">She employed the plaintiff, upon her personal credit, to defend the action and protect her interests therein. He did so successfully, and obtained judgment for the defendant, whereby all attachments were discharged. His services were reasonably worth the amount of the judgment rendered in his favor, and were rendered under a contract with her, upon her personal credit, and for the benefit of herself and her separate estate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-6\"><em>Solomon </em>L\u00faeas, with whom was <em>Charles W. </em>Comstoclc, for the appellant (defendant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-7\"><em>Charles F. </em>Thayer, for the appellee (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b481-8\">Baldwin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcD\">It is immaterial whether the mortgage security given by the defendant was or was not valid in favor of the mortgagee. Her property was afterwards taken on attachment against her husband, and she had the right to make a contract for professional assistance in securing its release, and for this purpose to pledge her personal credit. One way of regaining its possession would be to contest the cause of action of the attaching creditor. If he had none, it might well be that a judgment against him could be obtained in the attachment suit with less of delay or expense than would be incident to a new action brought for a direct vindication of her rights. She preferred this method of redress, and it proved successful. It is found that she owned what, by her husband\u2019s acts, had become in law her separate estate. <em>Jennings </em>v. Davis, 31 Conn. 134. Her contract with the plaintiff was therefore sufficient to authorize this action and support the judgment.
