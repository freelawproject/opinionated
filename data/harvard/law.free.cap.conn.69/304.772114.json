The transfer of the property was made after two months of a certain year had elapsed. <em>Held </em>that the contractor was entitled to his commission on the sales for those months, but could not sue for them before the close of the year. Nevertheless, he having brought before that time an equitable action for an accounting, and then filed amendments after the year had elapsed, stating a case which would have supported his action, if brought at the time when the amendments were filed, and the trial court having thereupon ordered an <em>accounting,\u2014held </em>that, though such order was erroneous because based on an action prematurely brought, still it ought not to be reversed, because it did substantial justice. The same facts, if pleaded in a supplemental complaint, would have been a proper foundation for the judgment, and such a merely formal slip in pleading was no sufficient ground of error.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b315-6\">An action at law can only be supported on the facts existing when it was first brought.

Wheeler, J.; </em>facts found and judgment rendered for an accounting in part, and appeal by each party for alleged errors in the rulings of the court.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AUC\">\n<em>Mo error on either appeal.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-9\">The finding showed the following state of facts: The defendant is a corporation chartered by this State, and until February 28th, 1893, was engaged in manufacturing at Hartford. Its business was conducted in several departments, one of which was known as the small tool department. On January 1st, 1889, it entered into a written contract with the plaintiff containing the following provisions : It was to maintain, develop and carry on for five years its small tool department, and the plaintiff was appointed the superintendent of this department, having the whole management thereof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>subject only to the board of directors, for said term. It was, during said term, to manufacture in, and deal in, through said department, goods similar to those that had been made by it under his superintendence, during a previous term, under a previous contract; and not otherwise to manufacture or deal in such goods; to keep an accurate account of all proper debits and credits to said department; and to give the plaintiff access to all its books and accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-5\">Debits to said department were to be, for any year, only these: five per cent of the inventory price of all patents and plant used in it, on the inventory taken in January of that year; such proportion for that year of the taxes, insurance, counsel fees and expense of lawsuits, salaries of officers, incidental expenses of gas, interest on borrowed money, water, advertising, stationery, and postage, as the inventory price of the machines, shop tools, shop fixtures, patents, and goods manufactured, in whole or in part, in said department should bear to the inventory price in January of that year, of all the company\u2019s machines, shop tools, shop fixtures, patents, and goods manufactured, in whole or in part; fifty-five dollars per horse power for the amount of power and heat used in said department for that year; one per cent of the sales of goods manufactured in said department that year, for shipping and teaming, except when the boxing should be done in said department, in which ease said percentage should be only one fifth of one per cent of the sales; the amount paid to agents, mechanics, and laborers for services rendered in or in behalf of said department for that year, and the amount paid in that year as royalty upon articles manufactured in said department; the cost of any and all materials used; also of any services not hereinbefore mentioned, regularly employed in manufacturing, displaying, selling, and delivering the goods manufactured in said department that year; and the cost of goods dealt in by said company through this department for that year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-6\"><em>All </em>these debits were to be stated in itemized bills, and then presented to the plaintiff monthly for approval. If he disapproved any bills or items, the board of directors might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>nevertheless, by its approval before or during January in the following year, make them proper debits to the department, saving his right to resort to law to determine the difference between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-5\">The credits to said department for any year were to be the entire proceeds realized from sales for that year, of goods manufactured or dealt in by said company in or through said department.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">The defendant was to pay the plaintiff each year during the term of this contract, except the last year thereof, an annual salary, to consist of $3,600, and a percentage of 10 per cent of the profits for that year; and the same said last year, provided, as was intended, another contract should be made during said year substantially a renewal of the present one. If no such renewal contract were made, owing to the neglect or refusal of the defendant, the salary during said last year was to be $5,600, in addition to said 10 per cent of the profits of that year. The plaintiff was to give his exclusive attention to the business during the term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\">This contract was duly performed until February 28th, 1893, except that the plaintiff was paid no profits on sales made in January and February, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-8\">Early in 1890, the plaintiff and two others, all three being stockholders in the defendant, became dissatisfied with the management of the company, by the president and general superintendent, and tried to find parties who would buy out the other stockholders, and put the control of the business in the hands of a different president and superintendent. They resorted to one Reed, who had had some success as a promoter of corporate organizations, and at his request the directors, in March, 1892, voted to have an inventory and valuation made by experts of the assets and accounts of the company. This was primarily intended to give Reed a basis to work on, in interesting capitalists, but the directors thought it would be worth its cost, even if Reed failed in his scheme of promotion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-9\">In May, 1892, the experts reported, and Reed proposed that he should have an option from the owners of the major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>ity of the shares in the company, for 90 days, on certain terms. The directors were advised by counsel that this was the only practical mode of reorganization. They approved the report of the experts, and gave it to Mr. Reed, and he obtained the options desired, expressed as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-5\">\n<em>\u201cShareholders\u2019 Option to Greorge W.

Mr. Reed never paid anything to the New Jersey company for said shares transferred to him except by the transfer of the stock ' of the Hartford Company, and he never himself paid a dollar to the shareholders of the Hartford company, or to the Hartford <em>company; </em>the only money paid was by A.

The executive officers, excepting the treasurer, remained the same. Contracts relating to the business were made and entered into by the New Jersey company relating to the conduct of this business. Buildings enlarging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the facilities of the New Jersey company were erected after May, 1893, and became a part of this plant, and were paid for out of the funds of the New Jersey company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\">The liabilities of the Hartford company, which the New Jersey company assumed, were upwards of $200,000, and as these became due the New Jersey company either paid or arranged for them.

He collected the bills and accounts, and put them to the credit of the New Jersey <em>company. </em>He paid all the bills, including pay-rolls, salaries, and material accounts. These bills and accounts included all of those existing February 28th, 1893, of the Hartford company, and all those thereafter of the New Jersey company, as long as the company continued. The first bills paid by the New Jersey company were paid by Reed. Under express authority of the directors he negotiated loans amounting to $150,000' during the first six months of the business of the company; all the loans, in fact, used in this business, including renewals of bills payable of the Hartford company, contracted before February 28th, 1893, he had made. He made report of the condition of the New Jersey company to its directors from the books of the companj', and included in it a report of the entire business of the concern on March 25th, 1893. All of these acts were done by Reed by virtue of the said votes of February 28th, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-8\">After February 28th, 1893, and down to the dissolution of the New Jersey company, the Hartford company transacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>none of the business it formerly did, and in fact, did no business; and after said date, from the facts herein stated, the court found that said contract with Woodbridge was terminated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-5\">The votes above mentioned were passed to carry out the entire arrangement made with Reed, as outlined in his said proposition to the New Jersey company. Their purpose was to make a complete transfer of the property, plant and good will of the Hartford company to the New Jersey company. The form of transfer was agreed upon by counsel for the New Jersey company and Hartford company, who were fully authorized, and the votes were passed in pursuance of a previous arrangement fully understood and agreed upon by the directors of each company, and by all of the stockholders of the Hartford company, and the majority of stockholders of the New Jersey company. The real estate and patents were not transferred because of the expense and complications attendant thereupon. It was proposed by all of the parties in interest that an attempt should be made to secure an amendment to the Connecticut charter of The Pratt &amp; Whitney Company, permitting an increase of stock to $3,000,000 and the issue of preferred and common shares to correspond with those of the New Jersey company, so that the New Jersey company might be then merged in the Connecticut companjn It was believed that this name, The Pratt &amp; Whitney Company of Connecticut, was much more valuable to do business with than the New Jersey company name. In furtherance of this intent, on March 3d, 1893, an amendment to the charter was introduced in the General Assembly, and on April 19th it was duly passed and approved. It provided for an exchange of shares of the New Jersey company for corresponding shares of the Hartford company, and for the merger of the existing shares of stock of the New Jersey company in said new shares. The amendment was accepted by the Hartford company September 26th, 1893. This exchange and merger was in fact made on November 22d, 1895. The New Jersey company was dissolved December 30th, 1895. After November 22d, 1895, the Hartford company conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the business of the New Jersey company. The Hartford company did, so far as it could, transfer its title to and possession of all its plant, property, and good will to the New Jersey company in consideration of the assumption by it of its debts, contracts, and obligations, and of its entire ownership of its stock, and, in order to carry out the said arrangements heretofore described, the payment of the million dollars in cash and the one million dollars in stock to the stockholders of the Hartford company was, in fact, a part of the consideration of the transfer, and these payments were, in fact, made for the New Jersey company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-5\">There was included in said transfer the small tool department and goods therein, manufactured by said Woodbridge in accordance with his said contract, of very large amount. Nearly all the items of debit referred to in said contract had already been paid for by said department, and the proceeds of these goods, when sold, would have represented in large part profits as defined in said contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-6\">What exactly appeared upon the books of the Hartford company was, by stipulation of counsel, not gone into upon this hearing, and no evidence was offered from which under the contract any profits could be determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-7\">Woodbridge knew all about and took part in the negotiations with Reed leading to the contract of November 9th, 1892. He himself was a large stockholder in the defendant and signed the contract of November 9th, 1892, and surrendered his stock upon the terms therein stated. He advised and urged others to sell their stock upon these terms, and signed with the other directors the circular letter. He expected that the new company was to assume the debts of the old company and to take possession of the plant and continue the business under a different management, and to assume his contract and all the other outstanding contracts of the old company. He expected to be a director in the New Jersey company, until sometime shortly before February 28th, 1893. He at no time ever communicated anything regarding his contract, or a claim for commission under it, to any director or officer of the defendant, or of the New Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>company, except as hereinafter stated. He continued to carry on the small tool department after February 28th, 1893, and down to July 31st, 1893, in substantially the same manner he had been doing before February 28th, 1893, and received from the New Jersey company for services at the same rate he had before received from the Hartford company for salary under his contract. The payments were made by checks, which stated they were for the salary account. He continued as a director of the Hartford company up to February 28th, 1893, and was on that day re-elected a director of the Hartford company. He was not present when the said stockholders\u2019 vote of February 28th, 1893, was considered or passed. He underwrote $10,000 of the stock of the New Jersey compan}', and received therefor, many months-after, $500 in preferred and $2,000 in common stock of the New Jersey company as commission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-5\">He had been advised by his counsel in January, 1893, that, in case the transfer to the New Jersey company was effected, he would have a claim for 10 per cent of the profits on the goods in the small tool department. He learned of the votes of February 28th shortly thereafter, and on March 3d notified Mr. Reed he would nob continue with the new company. Reed sent him to J. R. Redfield, and shortly after this, and before March 27th, 1893, he notified Mr. J. R. Redfield, through his attorney, that he should not continue his contract with the New Jersey company. Redfield was perhaps the most active among the directors of each company. At the request of Redfield made to Woodbridge\u2019s attorney, heagreed to continue with the New Jersey company temporarily, and did so continue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">On March 27th, 1893, he caused to be served upon the New Jersey company this notice :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-7\">\u201c To the directors of Pratt &amp; Whitney Company, organized and doing business under the laws of New Jersey:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-8\">\u201c Dear Sirs,\u2014I hereby give the above-named company notice that I do not desire the fact that I have been in its employ since its organization until now, or the fact that I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>may continue in its employ upon indefinite terms, until a contract may be made by and between said company and myself, or until it is decided that a contract shall not be made by and between said company and myself for my services, to be understood in any manner as indicating or admitting that I am willing to accept, or that I do accept said company in any manner to be substituted to the place of, or to perform any of the duties imposed upon The Pratt &amp; Whitney Company of Hartford, Connecticut, bjr a contract made by and between The Pratt &amp; Whitney Company of said Hartford and myself for the term of five years from the first day of January, 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-4\">\u201c James E.

C. Cuyler, the largest underwriter and one of the directors of the new company, made to him after February 28th, 1893, andbefore March 27th, 1893, to continue temporarily with the company. Woodbridge never served notice upon the Hartford company of his termination of his contract with it. He regarded the contract as terminated by the transfer of February 28th, 1893. The Hartford company and no one representing it ever said anything to him before or after February 28th, 1893, except as stated, regarding his contract or his continuance under the contract. He never communicated with the New Jersey company or any of its directors or officers regarding the continuance of his contract, except with Cuyler and Redfield. He was never formally hired or employed by or had any contract with the New Jersey company, but continued on with them as herein stated. He had intended to continue on with his contract with the New Jersey company, provided the management of the New Jersey company had not been the same as the Hartford company, but after learning of this before February 28th, 1893, he at once determined not to continue his contract with the New Jersey company, and at no time and with no persons ever agreed to continue under said contract, and no one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ever spoke to him about it or requested him to continue, except as herein stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\">After it had been determined that there was to be no change in the management of the business, Woodbridge for a while expected to be a director of the New Jersey company and intended to continue his contract with the New Jersey company, but after February 28th, 1893, he never intended to continue and never did continue his said contract with the New Jersey company, nor assent to its assumption of his contract. The New Jersey company never arranged with him to continue his contract or said anything to him about continuing his contract, nor he to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-6\">After February 28th, 1893, the Hartford company ceased to manage the business formerly conducted by it, and had in fact no business to conduct and no plant to operate a business with, and no means of carrying out its contract with Woodbridge, and the contract with Woodbridge was in fact terminated by said transfer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-7\">On June 20th, 1893, he wrote to the Hartford company asking them to state to him \u201c the sum for which the manufactured goods, made or dealt in by the small tool department of your company, were sold by your company to Pratt &amp; Whitney Company of New Jersey on or about February 28th, 1893.\u201d The company replied that \u201cthere has been no sale of manufactured goods or of any of the property or assets of the old Pratt <em>&amp; </em>Whitney Company to the New Pratt &amp; Whitney Company (of New Jersey).

The plaintiff\u2019s right under the contract for an accounting did not accrue, nor was such accounting possible until December 31st, 1893\u2014many months after this action was instituted. The contract as to commissions was an entire contract for each year. 2 Par. on Cont. 519; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>12 Met. 286; 3 Amer. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 916. The record shows that Woodbridge himself terminated the contract. Under these circumstances it is clear that he cannot claim any commissions at the date of this suit. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Dayton, </em>25 Conn. 188; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>ibid. 395. The New Jersey company, as the owner of all the stock of the Hartford company, although having no legal title, had such an interest in the assets that it had a right to take them into' its possession and treat them just as it did in this case. <em>Millsap </em>v. <em>Merchants' &amp; P. Bank, </em>71 Miss. 361. The acts done were in no sense the acts of a purchaser of the goods. There was no sale of the defendant\u2019s property. The essential elements of a sale were lacking. No pecuniary or other consideration passed from the New Jersey company to the Hartford company, unless the assumption by the New Jersey company of the obligations of the Hartford company constituted such consideration. It is essential to every sale that some pecuniary consideration shall pass. 21 Amer. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 446-7, and notes; <em>Speigel </em>v. <em>Meredith, </em>4 Biss. 123; <em>Vail </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>10 Vt. 465. The only sale claimed or shown in this case, was a sale by the shareholders of their respective holdings. This was not a sale by the defendant corporation, as a corporation, of its property. The sale of shares conveys no legal title to the assets of the corporation. Shareholders have no vested interest in the property of a corporation which they can convey. 1 Moraw. on Priv. Corp. \u00a7 233; 23 Amer. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 851 and cases cited; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hurd, </em>12 Metc. 371, 385; <em>Humphreys </em>v. <em>McKissock, </em>140 U.

Even if there were a technical sale of the property of the defendant to the New Jersey company, the plaintiff cannot recover unless he can show that there were profits received by the defendant, upon which he was entitled to a commission. But the defendant corporation never received a cent from anybody on account of the alleged sale. A contractor cannot from mere caprice or personal spite refuse to fulfill his contract duties under a reorganization, which involved no change in those duties and no change in his superior officers, especially where his contract gives him so much independence as the one before the court. But if the plaintiff could have treated the reorganization as a breach of his contract, he waived his right to claim and is now estopped\u2019 from claiming the same.

The plaintiff is not entitled to any additional salary. Nothing in the finding discloses any such refusal or neglect on the part of the defendant to renew the contract.

Co. </em>v. <em>Gridley, </em>100 id. 615; <em>Lines </em>v. <em>Flagg, </em>4 Conn. 590; <em>Bulkley </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>9 id. 8; <em>Meech </em>v. <em>Ensign, </em>49 id. 203. The Hartford company parted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>with all its interest in these goods to the New Jersey company, at a valuation. In payment therefor, and for the other property, the New Jersey company paid one million dollars in cash, and one million in stock of the new company; it received the goods as its own, and has ever since treated them as its own. The Hartford company practically ceased to exist, and incapacitated itself from ever carrying out its contract. It makes no difference that the money and stock was delivered to the stockholders, instead of to the officers of the company. The result is exactly the same as if it had been given to the corporation, and it had distributed it among its stockholders. That such a proceeding is valid, when all the stockholders agree to it, is settled in <em>Byrne </em>v. <em>Schuyler Co., </em>65 Conn. 336, and the cases there referred to. Nor can it affect this question that no bill of sale or other instrument of conveyance of these goods was executed. A sale of personal property needs no written instrument. We submit that there was here a sale within the fair meaning of the contract and understanding of the parties, as much so as if the Hartford company had sold out to the New' Jersey company all of the goods in this department which it had on hand, and that it is now bound to account, and allow Mr. Wood-bridge to show what profit it realized on the transaction. The defendant sets up a claim of estoppel, but there is nothing on which to found it. <em>Chase\u2019s Appeal, </em>57 Conn. 264. There is nothing in the facts found to show that the defendant changed or altered its position in consequence of any acts or conduct of the plaintiff. There is no pretense that this arrangement being carried out was dependent in any way on the existence of this claim of the plaintiff. By the provisions of the contract the plaintiff was to receive $2,000 addition to his salary during the \u201c last year,\u201d provided a new contract was not made, through the \u201c neglect or refusal \u201d of the defendant. It is agreed that no new contract was made. What was the reason ? The defendant was utterly incapacitated from making any contract by its own act of selling out bodily its whole plant and business. It not only did not attempt to, but could not if it had, make any new contract.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Baldwin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL5\">The contract between the parties of January 1st, 1889, made the compensation for the plaintiff\u2019s services, outside of his stated salary, dependent on the profits annually realized upon the sales for the year of goods manufactured or dealt in under his superintendence, and in his particular department of the business. He contends that the transfer of the main assets of the company, in 1893, to the New Jersey corporation, which had been organized to succeed to its business, in which transfer all the goods then in the small tool department were included, was in substance a sale of those goods, for a price which can readily be computed by the aid of the inventory and the defendant\u2019s books, out of the profits from which he is entitled by the contract to receive ten per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The Connecticut company sold nothing to the New Jersey company. Its stockholders sold their shares to certain individuals who caused them to be transferred to the New Jersey company. Thereupon (subject only to any rights of creditors) the property of the defendant, which had been held by it for the benefit of its previous shareholders in certain proportions, remained in its keeping for the benefit of its new shareholders, that is, in effect, of the shareholders in the New Jersey company.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The latter had been organized by concert between its shareholders and those of the defendant, in order to succeed to the defendant\u2019s plant and property, and to carry on its business without any break or interruption. Where all the stockholders in a corporation act together in its behalf, though there may be no regular meeting or formal vote, their action is substantially corporate action. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Wiley Construction Co., </em>56 Conn. 87, 96. So where the directors of a corporation, by the desire of all the shareholders, take corporate action which has no other end than to protect or promote the shareholding interest, the form of the transaction (if no rights of creditors are involved) is of little importance in determining its validity. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Gaylord, </em>47 Conn. 380, 383. The Hartford company, being in possession of property under a legal title, for the use of those holding the beneficial title (namely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>the New Jersey company, in its own right and as representing the nine individuals in each of whom had been vested, at its instance, one share in the Hartford company)^ transferred both its possession and its title to the real owner. No objection was interposed by any party in interest or by the State. The transfer, therefore, must be treated as effectual for the purpose for which it was planned and executed. This was the continuance of the business of the Hartford company upon a different basis of capitalization and for the benefit of a new set of stockholders. That business was to make and sell certain goods. The goods which were on hand, unsold, on February 21st, 1893, when the last share outstanding of the Hartford company was assigned to the New Jersey company, thereupon became in equity the property of the latter, and if thereafter sold, would be sold for its benefit. Their delivery to it, a week later, simply changed the hand by which any such sales would be made. It did not affect the equitable title to the proceeds, or to the goods themselves. It simply clothed the equitable owner with the legal title and the possession which was its proper incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim to an accounting of the profits derived from an alleged sale of these goods was therefore properly disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Nor was he entitled under his contract to an additional salary of $2,000, for the last year of the term. Aside from any other considerations, such addition was only to become due, if the contract were not renewed by reason of the negligence or refusal of the company. He contends that the transfer of February 28th, 1893, made any such renewal impossible. But if this be so, the transfer was the natural consequence of a reorganization actively promoted by the plaintiff, and under which he had originally intended to consent to a novation of his contract by its continuance under the New Jersey company. He cannot found a claim against the defendant, for a neglect or refusal to renew the contract, upon a course of action on which it entered by his own procurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">From the facts set forth in the finding, the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>reached the conclusion that the contract between the parties was terminated on February 28th, 1893. Before that time the plaintiff had determined not to consent to treat it as a continuing one with the New Jersey company.- After that time, so far as the Connecticut company, which is the defendant in this cause, is concerned, he had no dealings with it; while so far as the other company is concerned, he gave it prompt notice that he should not and did not consent to a novation; and to this it took no exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">It may be that his promotion of the scheme of reorganization would have given the New Jersey company, after the transfer of February 28th, an equitable right to insist on his continuance in the small tool department, during the residue of the term of his .contract with the defendant. No such right, however, was asserted in its behalf. He notified it that his services were being rendered to it \u201c upon indefinite terms \u201d until they should agree either to make a contract in respect to his further employment, or not to make one; and it did not claim that they stood to each other in any other relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">While, therefore, there are circumstances (particularly the monthly salary payments) which tend to show that the New Jersey company considered the contract as in force, the Superior Court was justified in finding from all the facts taken together, that it was terminated on February 28th, 1893.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">This termination was virtually accomplished by mutual consent. It followed from a transfer of the plant and business, made as part of a scheme which the plaintiff had been active in carrying through, and from his declining to accept a substitution of the new company as his employer. Such a rescission left the defendant under an obligation to pay him the agreed percentage of any profits realized from the January and February sales. The amount of this depended on what might remain after deducting from the proceeds of the sales for that year of goods belonging to the small tool department, certain debits specified in the contract; and of these several were to be ascertained upon a computation of the defendant\u2019s expenditures or interest charges for the entire year.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Had the contract been broken by the defendant, the plaintiff would have had a right to sue at once for whatever damages he might have thus sustained. But as it was rescinded by consent, his only right was to recover what remained unpaid of the stipulated compensation for services already performed; the amount of which was to be determined, so far as practicable, by the terms specified in the contract under which they had been rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The stipulated debit of five per cent on the value of the plant of the small tool department, as it might be fixed by the inventory of January 1st, 1893, was evidently intended as an equivalent for a year\u2019s interest on the capital thus invested ; and in stating the account for a period of only two months, it would be equitable to charge the plaintiff for the proportion due for that period only. But while such a fixed charge would be susceptible of immediate apportionment, this would not be true respecting the debit of a certain fraction of the actual expenses for the year, on such accounts as taxes, insurance, and litigation. Until the year had closed, these items would be incapable of exact computation. It follows that the action, which was instituted in July, 1893, was prematurely brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">During its pendency, however, and after the close of the year 1893, the complaint was amended by the addition of three new counts. Of these, the fourth and fifth set forth the contract of January 1st, 1889, a sale, on February 28th, 1893, to the New Jersey company, of all the goods then in the small tool department, and sales of other goods in said department during January and February, 1893; and allege that upon an accounting it will be found that the profits upon the latter sales, determined according to the provisions of the contract, will be $10,000, of which ten per cent will be found to be due to the plaintiff. The defendant met these counts with a general denial, excepting only an admission of the execution of the contract, and an averment that on its part it had been duly performed. To the sixth count, in which the additional salary of f2,000, for the year 1893, was claimed, on the ground that the defendant had terminated the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>by its sale to the New Jersey company, and hence made its renewal of the contract for another term impossible, a demurrer was interposed, founded in part on the ground that the action was prematurely instituted. No such objection having been taken in pleading to the other counts, the parties went to trial on the merits of the case presented by these and were felly heard. Under these circumstances, although the claim that the commissions could not be computed under the terms of the contract until the close of the year, and so that the suit was brought before the cause of action was complete, was made in argument before the trial court, and overruled, it is evident that no substantial injustice was thus done to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">An action at law can only be supported on the facts existing when it was first brought. It rests on the charge of a breach of duty, for which, at common law, the defendant was liable to immediate arrest and imprisonment. In such a proceeding, if it appears that the plaintiff had suffered no wrong, which would support his suit, when the process was served, there can be no recovery. Equitable proceedings rest upon different foundations, and in them the parties can always rely on new matter, if properly pleaded. The plaintiff asked for both legal and equitable relief, but the latter only was awarded him by the judgment. Had he put the allegations of the fourth or fifth count in the shape of a supplemental complaint, the accounting ordered would have been entirely proper. His failure to present his cause of action in that form, cannot invalidate the judgment unless the defendant was injuriously affected by it. General Statutes, \u00a7 1135. Nothing appears upon the record to indicate that such can have been the result. It had full opportunity, under the pleadings as they stood, to offer all testimony and present all claims of which it could have availed itself upon a trial under a supplemental complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The judgment of the Superior Court, in every other particular, is warranted by the facts found; it disposes of the whole controversy between the parties in such a manner as to do substantial justice; and it is not our duty to grant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>new trial for a mere slip in pleading by which no one has been really prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Similar considerations must govern the disposition of other well-founded assignments of error. It was held by the Superior Court, upon the facts found, that the transfer of February 28th, 1893, constituted a sale of the goods in the small tool department, though not such a sale as fell within the provisions of the contract; and that this transfer was of itself a termination of. the contract by the defendant, which the plaintiff had the right to treat as a wrongful breach of its provisions. These conclusions of law were erroneous, but the resulting judgment was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">There is no error upon either the plaintiff\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
