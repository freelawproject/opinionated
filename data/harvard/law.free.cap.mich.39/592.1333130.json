Howe, with Briggs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>as surety, conditioned for the annual payment to Mrs. Lee of $50 during her life time, and providing that if Howe should fail in making payment at the time stipulated she should give notice to Briggs within five days afterwards, but that if she did not give him notice he should be released from payment,' though only for that year. Plaintiff recovered before the justice, but the judgment was reversed in the circuit court and she brings error. Submitted October 25.

The bond on which Briggs was sued did not require the notice to him of Howe\u2019s default to be given in writing, and the evidence of verbal notice of the several defaults was ample. It is true that plaintiff\u2019s husband, when giving notice, did not expressly say to Briggs he was giving it for and in the name of the plaintiff, but what took place between them shows that the fact was assumed, and no question whatever made concerning it. Neither was any question of his authority made before the justice; and under the circumstances it operated as an unfair surprise when the point was made by the affidavit for a certiorari, that Mr. Lee did not apprise Briggs that he came by plaintiff\u2019s authority, to give the requisite notice. Briggs himself was a witness before the justice, and all the proceedings on the trial warranted the justice in supposing that the authority of Mr. Lee to make the demand was not disputed. His conclusion was right on the facts as they were presented to him; and that is sufficient to require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the affirmance of his judgment. It will be so ordered; and plaintiff in error will recover costs of the circuit and of this court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b612-4\">Campbell, C.
