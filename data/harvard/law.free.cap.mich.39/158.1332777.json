Plaintiffs recovered below and defendant brings error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-11\"><em>George Gartner </em>and <em>T. C. Prosser </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As4Z\">An unwritten collateral promise to pay the debt of another is void, Comp. L., \u00a7 4698; <em>Hall v. Soule, </em>11 Mich., 494; where the original liability is not extinguished, a promise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>to pay by a third person is collateral, Browne on Stat. of Brands [3d ed.], \u00a7 197, n. 1, 3; <em>Brown v. Hazen, </em>11 Mich., 221; <em>Corkins v. Collins, </em>16 Mich., 478; <em>Curtis v. Brown, </em>5 Cush., 488; <em>Leland v. Creyon, 1 </em>McCord, 100; 3 Kent\u2019s Com., 123; and the original liability remains, <em>Waldo v. Simonson, </em>18 Mich., 353; <em>Bresler v.

Hopkins, </em>5 Wend., 23; <em>Mallory v. Gillett, </em>21 N. Y., 427; <em>Brown v. Weber, </em>24 How. Pr., 306: 38 N. Y., 187; it is not within the Statute of Frauds as a promise to pay another\u2019s debt, 3 Pars. Cont., 24; <em>Besshears v. Rowe, </em>46 Mo., 503; <em>Dearborn v. Parks, </em>5 Greenl., 81; <em>Farley v. Cleveland, </em>4 Cow., 432; <em>Barker v. Bucklin, </em>2 Den., 45; <em>Fullam v. Adams, </em>37 Vt., 391; <em>McCreary v. Van Hook, </em>35 Tex., 631.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b177-5\">Marston, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjI\">The facts in this case resemble very closely those in <em>Welch v. Marvin, </em>36 Mich., 60, and we think the decision in that case must be here followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">If the contract between defendants in error and Caswell was still in existence and uncancelled, plaintiff in error could not be held liable upon his promise, and the jury should have been so instructed as requested. The case referred to had not been published when this one was tried. Had it been, or the attention of the learned judge been called thereto, we doubt not the ruling would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The judgment must be reversed with costs and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b177-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
