Under such a claim evidence tending to show the value of the services performed was not admissible. While there was evidence introduced tending to show promises to increase the claimant\u2019s salary after January 1st, yet the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>did not show an agreement so to increase it, while tbe evidence did show that the claimant had been working under a salary of one thousand dollars per year, and that for the services performed during the three months mentioned he had been allowed and paid the sum of $250. This under the evidence was all he was entitled to, and not having introduced any evidence fairly tending to prove an agreement to pay him fifteen hundred dollars per year, he was not entitled to recover the balance of $125 claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\">There was no error in the record, and the judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b119-4\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
