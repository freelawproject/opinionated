The facts are admitted and a mandamus is asked to require the circuit judge to rescind the order of August 13th, and all later proceedings in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The case stands on demurrer to the application, but as no one has appeared for respondent, and no brief has been offered, we are left without any knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the grounds of opposition, if in fact there are any which are relied on.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">It appears to us that the cause was regularly transferred, and that the circuit court had lost jurisdiction. If power over the cause still remained in that tribunal there would be great difficulty in the attempt to ascertain at what stage it would terminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The proceedings to remove had been in due form and in season. The court had sanctioned them and had adjudged in favor of the right, and all the steps required to consummate an actual removal had been taken and completed, and the cause had come to be one subsisting in fact in the Superior Court and with the approbation of the circuit court. It seems to us that the power of the circuit court was, in these circumstances, at an end, and that the proceedings complained of were unauthorized and should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Let the writ issue as prayed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b135-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
