Bostwick. After his decease the claim was presented against his estate, for allowance by the commissioners and was disallowed. Instead of taking an appeal a bill in chancery was filed and a decree rendered in favor of complainant. The claim in any view of the case was a proper one to be presented against the estate, and it was one which the commissioners had full power and authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>to allow. 2 Comp.
