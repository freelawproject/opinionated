No absolute rule can be laid down; each case must be determined as it arises. Facts apparently light and trivial may in one case indicate that no compensation was intended or contemplated by either party, while in another, the same or similar facts, in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, such as the degree of relationship existing, the wealth and social position of the respective parties, the services performed, and the nature and character of the same, may with more or less clearness point to an entirely different conclusion. The charge of the court must have proceeded upon the theory that the relationship existing, in the absence of an express promise, was a complete legal bar to 'the right to recover in any and all such cases. Such we think is not the law. It may raise a strong presumption, but\u2019 it is not by any means conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">The judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
