The declaration averred that defendant, at the delivery of the deed, was not' seized in fee simple of the lands and had no lawful authority to convey them, and that Henry M. Bostwick and Erastus S. Sterling held the paramount title, by virtue of which the plaintiff was afterwards evicted. Plaintiff recovered for eviction from a portion of the premises, but as the court below held that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>action on the covenants of the deed was barred by the statute of limitations, he brought error. The Supreme Court held that he had recovered more than he was entitled to, and as he had no ground of complaint affirmed the judgment.
