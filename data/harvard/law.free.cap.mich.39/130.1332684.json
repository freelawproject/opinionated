This does not apply where the note is signed in the name of a company and the defendants, being sued as co-partners doing business under that name, deny its execution and the partnership, and no evidence is given that some of them are at all connected with the company.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-10\">Error to Marquette.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"ABy\">Submitted June <em>5.</em></otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ayf\">Decided June 21.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-11\">Assumpsit.

J. Colwell, Treasurer. The defendants pleaded the general issue, and\u201d filed affidavits denying the existence of the partnership \u25a0 and of the execution of the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The plaintiff, to maintain the issrre on his part, claims to have introduced evidence on the trial tending to show that four of the defendants were members of the Michigan Iron Company, but it is not claimed or pretended that any evidence whatever was given tending to connect either of the other defendants with this company. This was fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, unless as claimed he was entitled to recover a judgment against one or more of the defendants under the provisions of section 5778 of the Compiled Laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">An examination of this section in connection with those preceding it, shows that it has no application to a case like the present, but to eases where, the holder of a \u201cbill of exchange or promissory note, instead of bringing separate suits against the drawers, makers, guarantors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>of the payment thereof, indorsers, and acceptor of such bill or note\u201d includes all or any of the said parties in one action.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Viewing the case in its most favorable\" aspects in behalf of the plaintiff, upon his own showing he was not entitled to recover, and it therefore becomes unnecessary to consider the other questions raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.'</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
