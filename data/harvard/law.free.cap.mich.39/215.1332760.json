The reason was that the false affirmation relating to the price paid for the land was not one upon which the plaintiffs had a right to rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Had the plaintiffs insisted upon their declaration as a sufficient count for money had and received by defendant to their use, probably the ruling in the circuit court would have been different. The recital of facts shows a bargain for the lands at a price measured by the cost, and an overpayment brought about by misinformation, whereby an action arises to demand and receive back what was overpaid. A good cause of action in assumpsit might be better set forth, but the substance is here.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for trial. No costs are awarded in this court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b235-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
