The other half I give and bequeath unto the relations of my late husband, to be divided among them as follows, viz.: To my brother-in-law, Thomas Beggs, one-tenth. To my sister-in-law, Mary Ann Wagoner, one-tentli. To Clara, daughter of Joseph Beggs, deceased, one-tenth. To Maria, daughter of Joseph Beggs, deceased, one-fifteenth.

Should any of the above die before me, their share shall go to their children or next of kin ; and, in order to enable my executors hereinafter named, to carry out the provisions of this will, I do hereby authorize and empower them to sell at public or private sale, as they may deem for the best advantage, all my property belonging to my husband\u2019s estate, wherever found, real, personal or mixed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">Graham Scott, who was executor under the will of both decedents, and Andrew Young, who was executor under the will of Alcy Beggs, applied to the Orphans\u2019 Court for the sale of the real estate of decedents for the purpose of distribution under their wills, and upon the court ruling that Mrs. Beggs, in directing a conversion of the real estate, had not exceeded her authority, and that her executors had power to sell without further directions, the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>estate was sold and Graham Scott subsequently filed his first account, admitting a balance of $6366.21, which constituted the fund for distribution in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-6\">\u25a0 In making distribution of this balance the Orphans\u2019 Court decided, that the fund should be paid in accordance with a schedule attached, which gave to each of the twenty-one parties named in the will of Alcy Beggs $244.01, being an equal share of the whole balance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-7\">In an opinion the court said: \u201c That Alcy Beggs was invested with a power of selection by the will of Andrew Beggs, deceased, is beyond question. She was directed to divide the estate of her testator amongst \u00a3 such\u2019 of his and her \u00a3 relations\u2019 as she might deem most worthy. The use of the word \u00a3 such\u2019 implied a power of selection: Huntley <em>v. </em>Gregson, 1 Term R. 432; Spring <em>v. </em>Biles, 2d (note). It follows that the beneficiaries named in the will of Alcy Beggs, deceased, were well appointed, whether within or without the statute of distribution. In what shares or proportions are these beneficiaries to stand ? Andrew Beggs directed that his estate should <em>\u2018 </em>be equally divided\u2019 between <em>\u2018 </em>such of his wife\u2019s and his relations as she might deem most worthy.\u2019 Whatever of difficulty there may be, appears on the face of the will, and may be solved by the application of the ordinary rules of construction in such cases: Best <em>v. </em>Hammond, 5 P. F. Smith 412. How then shall division be made ? The authorities agree that where a testator designates the objects of his bequest or devise by their relationship to living ancestors, such legatees or devisees take not by representation, but <em>immediately </em>of the testator and <em>per capita. </em>The reference to living ancestors is merely descriptive of the objects of bounty, and excludes the <em>per stirpes </em>rule: Witmer <em>v. </em>Ebersole, 5 Barr 458.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-8\">\u201c The line of argument adopted in the case of McNeilledge <em>v. </em>Galbraith, 8 S. &amp; R. 43, is peculiarly appropriate to the present case. There as here the testator had given his estate to his wife for life, and directed that at her decease said estate should \u00a3 be divided between her and my poor relations equally.\u2019 The same question was raised and discussed there as here with respect to the proper mode of distribution. The bequest was construed as though the word \u00a3 poor\u2019 had not been used, so that the two cases, so far as the question of distribution is concerned, are in <em>quatuor pedibus </em>with each other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-9\">\u00a3\u00a3 So far, therefore, as the <em>distribution </em>made by Mrs. Beggs affects the estate of Andrew Beggs, deceased, she has exceeded her powers. The division should have been made equally between the appointees. With this exception the power with which Mrs. Beggs was invested was well executed. It is well settled that the execution of a power may be good as to part: Hegarty\u2019s Appeal, 25 P. F. Smith 503 ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Bristow <em>v. </em>Warde, 2 Vesey 336. And the court will correct that in which the donee has failed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-6\">\u201c The fund in hands of the accountant, being proceeds of the sale of the real estate of Andrew Beggs, deceased, will therefore be distributed amongst the appointees named in the will of Alcy Beggs, deceased, <em>per capita.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-7\">From this decision Mary Young appealed and assigned for error this decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-8\"><em>J. C. Young </em>and <em>J. M. </em>Stoner, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUT\">The wife of decedent executed the power given in her husband\u2019s will by dividing the fund into moieties, and giving one moiety to each side of the house, and this interpretation of her husband\u2019s will should prevail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-9\">It may be admitted that when a testator designates the objects of his bounty by their relationship to a living ancestor, or where he directs it to be equally divided between them, he is in general held to mean that they shall take <em>per capita </em>and not <em>per stirpes. </em>But this mode of construction will yield to a very faint glimpse of a different intention in the context. Thus the mere fact that the annual income, until the distribution of the capital, is applicable <em>per </em>stirpes, has been held to constitute a sufficient ground for pre-, suming that a like principle was to govern the gift of the capital: 2 Jarman on Wills 112, marg. paging.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-10\">On this ground the rule has been repeatedly disregarded in Pennsylvania : Fissel\u2019s Appeal, 3 Casey 55 ; Minter\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 111; Gring\u2019s Appeal, 7 Casey 292; Risk\u2019s Appeal, 2 P. F. Smith 269. Vide also Roome <em>v. </em>Counter, 1 Halstead 111; Bool <em>et ux. v. </em>Mix, 17 Wend. 119; Alder <em>v. </em>Beall, 11 Gill &amp; Johns. 123.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-11\"><em>Slagle &amp; </em>Wiley, for appellees Rosanna, John and Andrew Brown.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai\">The construction contended for by-appellants is inconsistent with the ruling in McNeilledge <em>v. </em>Galbraith, 8 S. &amp; R. 43, where the words of the will were almost identical with those in this will. They differ only in the location of the word equally, and the addition of the words which convey a power of appointment to Alcy Beggs. That power was defective and void when she undertook to provide for an unequal distribution and did not make the division <em>per capita. </em>It was fully executed when she designated the persons to take her husband\u2019s bounty. The court will support the execution so far as the power warrants and treat the rest as surplusage: Russell <em>v. </em>Kennedy, 16 P. F. Smith 248 ; Horwitz <em>v. </em>Norris, 13 Wright 213.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b62-13\">Mr. Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"AaR\">delivered the opinion of the court, January 2d 1877.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The correctness of this decree is to be determined' by the construction given to the -will of Andrew Beggs. The clause in question is in these words:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">\u201c 3d. I will the residue of my estate, real, personal and mixed, to my beloved wife, Alcy, for and during her life; and, further, \u00cd will that at her decease such moneys or property as she may possess be equally divided between her relations and mine, or such of them as she may believe most worthy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">It may be conceded as a rule of construction in a will, that when a testator designates the objects of his gift by their relationship to a living ancestor, they take equal shares, <em>per capita: </em>McNeilledge <em>v. </em>Galbraith, 8 S. &amp; R. 43 ; Same <em>v. </em>Barclay, 11 Id. 103; Risk\u2019s Appeal, 2 P. F. Smith 269. But nevertheless, like all other constructions when applied to wills, it must be controlled by the general intention of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">In Walker <em>v. </em>Griffin\u2019s Heirs, 11 Wheat. 375, the devise was, \u201c I do request one-fourth part to be given to the families of G. Holloway, William B. Blackbowen and A. Bartlett, to those of their children that my wife may think proper; but in a greater proportion to Francis P. Holloway than to\u2019any other of G. Holloway\u2019s children ; and to Elizabeth P. Bartlett in a greater proportion than to any of A. Bartlett\u2019s children. The balance to be given to the families of Cyrus, and John T. Griffin\u2019s children, in equal proportion.\u201d It was held that each of the first-named three families took as a single devisee, without any regard to the number of persons composing the family, and also that the children of Cyrus and John T. Griffin took <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per </em>capita, and that the <em>property </em>devised to them was to be divided into two equal parts, one moiety to be assigned to each family.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">In Baskin\u2019s Appeal, 3 Barr 304, the testator left three children and four grandchildren (the children of a deceased son). After some specific devises he directed the residue to \u201c be equally divided between all the heirs.\u201d It was held that the residuary estate passed to his children and grandchildren <em>per stirpes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">In Minter\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 111, the testator distributed his property \u201c share and share alike among the children of my brother Adam, and the children of my brother Martin, and to my sister Barbara,\u201d and the latter died before the testator, leaving children : it was held that the classification was not changed by the death of his sister, and that the legatees should be divided into three classes, and each class take as their parents would have done <em>per stirp.es.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">In Risk\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra, </em>the testator made an equal division among his children, of a portion of his estate, and then ordered his real estate to be sold. After giving a specific sum therefrom to one of his two sons, he directed the residue to be \u201c equally divided between my beloved children George and Joseph and the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>of my beloved daughter Catharine (now wife of James Risk),\u201d it was held that Catharine\u2019s children took <em>per stirpes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">What then does the language of this will indicate to be the intention of the testator ? After the expiration of the life estate of his wife, he directs the property to \u201cbe equally divided between her relations and mine.\u201d He and his wife were childless. There was no issue of either to whom the property could be transmitted. It may have been the joint product of their industry and economy. This or some other moving cause prompted him to direct that the property be \u201c equally divided \u201d between families of different blood. The language clearly points to one general division, one separation of the fund. Two classes were in his mind. One class was his relations, the other class was his wife\u2019s relations. The property was to be equally divided \u201c between\u201d these two classes, and each class to take one half. His relations one half, his wife\u2019s relations the other half. Neither the language nor the spirit of the will indicates that each relation should have an equal share. To reach such a result would require all the relations of each, the testator and his wife, to be thrown together in one class, regardless of their relative number. So, if the wife had twenty and the testator two, her relations would take ten times as much as his relations. That would be a most manifest disregard of the direction for an equal division between the two families.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">It follows, therefore, that the division of the property made by Alcy Beggs, is according to the true spirit and intent of the will of Andrew Beggs, and the court erred in decreeing the distribution to be made <em>per capita.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Decree reversed, and the record is remitted with instructions to make distribution conformably with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
