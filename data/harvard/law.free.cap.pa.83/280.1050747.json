Hilt, on the 14th day of September, in the year of our Lord 1874,- at Philadelphia, made his promissory note in writing, and thereby promised to pay to the defendant\u2019s order thirty-seven hundred and fifty dollars, two months after date thereof, which period has now elapsed; and the defendant then and* there endorsed the same to the plaintiff; and the said George E. Hilt did not pay the amount thereof, although the same was there presented to him on the day when it became due; of all which the defendant then and there had notice.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-14\">The pleas were the ordinary pleas -in assumpsit. At the trial before Peirce, J., the defendant .objected to the admission of the writing in evidence, first, because it is not a promissory note; is not negotiable as such by endorsement; that its negotiability was destroyed by the endorsement under seal; and second, because it is not the instrument described in the, special count of the <em>narr.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-15\">The court overruled the objections and admitted the writing in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-16\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $2648.78, upon which judgment was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-17\">The defendant took this writ and assigned for error the admission of the note in evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-18\"><em>Henry T. </em>King, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay-\">The sealed endorsement destroyed the negotiability of the instrument as to all parties claiming subsequently thereto, and through that endorsement. The holder did not strike out that endorsement, nor, indeed, could he, and thus make negotiable that which in its inception was not so. There was a fatal variance between the instrument declared on and the writing offered in evidence. It was required that the plaintiff should state in his declaration the endorsement between himself and the party he sues, and on the trial of the cause prove that endorsement or strike it off, neither of which was done in this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-19\"><em>A. Sidney Biddle </em>and <em>R. C. McMurtrie, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU0\">The holder of a negotiable note may strike out any endorsements which are not stated in the declaration: Merz <em>v. </em>Kaiser, 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>La.

To the same effect see Mayer <em>v. </em>Jadis, 1 M. &amp; Rob. 247.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-5\">No one has as yet asserted that an endorsement of a note by a corporation makes the note a bond. The drawing does, if it is sealed, but not the transfer. The contract of endorsement may he by deed, though the primary debt be by parol.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered, January 22d 1877,</p>\n<author id=\"b282-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AuJ\">This suit was brought by Dovey, the holder of the note against Rand, the payee and endorser. Dovey does not need to trace his title through the irregular endorsement of the Safeguard Insurance Company. No question arises in this action between Rand and the insurance company, as to their relations to each other. That relation does not affect Dovey, who takes title by the endorsement of Rand as payee. The latter cannot set up the endorsement of the insurance company as an irregularity to affect Dovey. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
