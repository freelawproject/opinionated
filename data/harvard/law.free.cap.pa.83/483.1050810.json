Shoemaker <em>v. </em>Huffnagle, 4 W. &amp; S. 437, and Haldeman <em>v. </em>Haldeman, 4 Wright 29, are the only cases not overruled in which the contrary was held; but these cases are clearly distinguishable from this case. An almost unbroken current of authority from Clayton <em>v. </em>Clayton, 3 Binn. 476, to Taylor <em>v. </em>Taylor, 13 P. F. Smith 481, shows that \u201c children\u201d is a word of purchase.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-10\">Mrs. Rodney did not take an <em>estate tail, </em>as she had children living at the date of the will: Wild\u2019s Case, 6 Coke 17; Cote <em>v. </em>Von Bonnhorst, 5 Wright 243.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-11\">Nor can an estate tail be raised by implication from the. words \u201cfor want of such issue living,\u201d for the interposition of the remainder in fee to her children forbids such a construction: Curtis <em>v. </em>Longstreth, 8 Wright 297; Sheets\u2019s Estate, 2 P. F. Smith 257.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-12\">The true interpretation of the will gives a life-estate to Mrs. Rodney with a <em>contingent </em>remainder to her children. Suppose a child of Mrs. Rodney should die in her lifetime, leaving issue, and then Mrs Rodney should die, would the issue of the deceased child take by force of this will, or by descent from its parent ? To read the clause is to answer the question: clearly not by descent. It follows that the present children of Mrs. Rodney have <em>contingent </em>interests now, which depend upon their surviving their mother, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>unless violence is done to the intention of the testator, expressed in unambiguous words : Abbott <em>v. </em>Jenkins, 10 S. &amp; R. 298. Womrath <em>v. </em>McCormick, 1 P. F. Smith 504, is an extreme case and is not parallel to this case. The decision there rested upon the circumstance that the intention of the testator was to express the time when the estates of his children were to vest in <em>possession, </em>not in <em>interest. </em>And further, in that case the limitation was to the testator\u2019s own and only heirs; here it is to only a part of the testator\u2019s heirs. McBride <em>v. </em>Smyth, 4 P. F. Smith 245, is in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-6\">But even if the remainder be vested, <em>being to a class, </em>it will open and let in after-born members of the class : Minnig <em>v. </em>Batdorff, 5 Barr 503; Ross <em>v. </em>Drake, 1 Wright 373; and the law will not consider the physical impossibility of the birth of children in any case : 2 Bl.

The final'limitation is contingent on failure of issue on the \"death of Sarah, and only enures to the benefit of her heirs, or of her children\u2019s heirs ; in either case those who take under it are bound by the acts of Sarah and her <em>children </em>\u2014 \u201c <em>haeres estpars antecessoris.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-11\">The title offered to List would appear to be open to attack, only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>from any child or children that may. hereafter be born to Sarah and her husband, both being now upwards of seventy-five years of age.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-6\">While admitting that as long as life remains, the legal possibility of'issue continues, and that in the eye of the law Sarah may have a child, yet the possibility of such an event in the eye o\u00ed reason is so remote that no man of common sense would esteem it as within the range of probability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-7\">Under the contract for the sale of this real estate, the vendee has the right to have conveyed to him a good and marketable title \u2014 one that is not doubtful. \u201c But the doubts which will operate in a court of equity are not doubts made up for the occasion, nor based on captious, frivolous and astute niceties, but such as produce real, bond, fide hesitation in the mind of the chancellor. The doubts must, in the language of Lord Eldon, be <em>\u2018 </em>considerable and rational,\u2019 such as would and ought to induce a prudent man to pause and hesitate in the acceptance of a title affected by them Judge King, in Dalzell <em>v. </em>Crawford, 1 Parsons\u2019s Select Equity Cases 37. See Kilpatrick <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 7 Casey 204, and Anshutz <em>v. </em>Miller, 2 Weekly Notes 547.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-8\">In answer to the argument of the plaintiff in error, counsel argued:</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-9\">Under the second clause of the will the devise is \u201c to my daughter, Sarah Rodney, * * * to be held in trust for her children;\u201d Mrs. Rodney had two children living at the time of making the will. The case of White <em>v. </em>Williamson, 2 Grant 253, decided that \u201ca deed to A., for the use of the wiie and children of B., conveys a life-estate to the wife of B. with remainder to her children ;\u201d and in Coursey <em>v. </em>Davis, 10 Wright 29, it was held that \u201c a conveyance to a married woman and her children exclusively, and their heirs and assigns,\u201d gave a life-estate to the woman, and a vested estate in remainder to the children as a class, so that those in being at the date of the will, as well as those subsequently born, would be entitled on the termination of the life-estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-10\">It is submitted that these cases govern the construction of the 2d clause, and that an examination of all the decisions where similar words are used will establish beyond doubt that the only construction of which they are capable is \u2014 estate for life to Mrs. Rodney, vested remainder in fee to the children as a class.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-11\">Then as to the codicil, -which is merely explanatory: the testator starts by reiterating in the same, but more concise, language, the devise in the will; \u201c also, that in item No. (2) of my will, the devise to my daughter, Sarah Rodney, and to her children, is intended and shall give to her children living at her death and to the lawful issue of any of them, if dead, in right of such one deceased,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-12\">It is contended by the plaintiff in error that this definition, and the use of the words \u201cliving at her death,\u201d make the remainder to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the children contingent, and defer its vesting until the children living at the death are ascertained by the death of Mrs. Rodney, and that the issue of any deceased child surviving Mrs. Rodney would take directly under the will, and not by descent from its parent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-6\">The rifle on the subject as laid down in Hawkins on Wills 237, is: \u201cIt has long been an established rule that all estates are to be holden to be vested, except estates in the devise of which a condition precedent to the vesting is so clearly expressed that the court cannot treat them as vested without deciding in direct opposition to the terms of the will.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-7\">Certainly in this case, where the testator has, by a clause in his will, given a vested estate to children as a class, the court will not, in construing a codicil to the will which by its own very terms is directed to be explanatory merely of that clause of the will, turn the vested estate into a contingent one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-8\">But the clause itself shows that the testator intended that the children of Mrs. Rodney should have remainders vested during Mrs. Rodney\u2019s lifetime; for he says in the clause under consideration, \u201c shall give her children living at her death, and to the lawful issue of any of them, if dead, <em>in right of such one </em>deceased,\u201d showing that he contemplated such a right as existing in her children prior to Mrs. Rodney,\u2019s death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-9\">It is also respectfully submitted that the use of the words \u201c living at her death,\u201d as interposed by the testator in the codicil, is intended to define the estate of Mrs. Rodney and to confine it to a life-interest, and not to make a condition or qualification of the estate of the children, for it must be borne in mind that nowhere else in the will is there any direction that Mrs. Rodney should have only a life-estate ; it denotes the time of enjoyment of the estate of the children, ndt its quality: McBride <em>v. </em>Smyth, 4 P. F. Smith 245; Smith on Executory Interests 281; Abbott <em>v. </em>Jenkins, 10 S. &amp; R. 296. The opinion of Strong, J., in Ross <em>v. </em>Drake, 1 Wright 375, is directly in point and governs this case; Womrath <em>v. </em>McCormick, 1 P. F. Smith 504. See also Ross <em>v. </em>Drake, <em>supra; </em>Minnig <em>v. </em>Batdorff, <em>supra; </em>Manderson <em>v. </em>Lukens, 11 Harris 31; Wager <em>v. </em>Wager, 1 S. &amp; R. 374; Mull <em>v. </em>Mull, 2 Weekly Notes 538; Fetrow\u2019s Estate, 8 P. F. Smith 424.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-10\">The only possible interest which the deed tendered to List does not convey, either directly or by way of estoppel or warranty, is an interest which a possible child of Mrs. Rodney, born after the date of the deed, might take conjointly with the other children; that is to say, if there is a possibility that another child may be born to Mrs. Rodney, then there is a possibility that this deed does not convey every interest to the lot in question, and the plaintiff in error can refuse to take the conveyance. Mrs. Rodney is over seventy-five years of age.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>The doctrine laid down in 2 Bl. Com. *125, occurs in, the chapter on Estates Tail after the possibility of issue extinct. Blackstone\u2019s words are as follows: \u201cA possibility of issue is always supposed to exist in law, * * * even though the donees be each of them an hundred years old,\u201d and he quotes Coke on Littleton 28, a, who, writing on the same subject, says, \u201cfor that the law seeth no impossibility of having children.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-6\">That doctrine means only that where land is given to a man and his Avife and the issue of their bodies begotten, they having once had the probability of having issue, the laAV will not, for the purpose of altering the quality of the estate, fix any time for that probability of their having issue ceasing, and accordingly Coke and Blackstone lay it down that there is always a possibility of having children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-7\">It is respectfully submitted to the court, however, that the rule of law as to \u201cthe possibility of issue\u201d is simply a presumption governing the devolution and quality of estates, but that in a particular case where the court is asked to presume it as a question of fact from the presumption of law, they will take notice that in that particular case the so-called possibility is an impossibility.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-8\">While as applied to the general question of the quality and quantity of estate'\u201c the laAV seeth no impossibility,\u201d yet in a question of fact as presented here, the rule is but a presumption of fact, and just as in the case of the presumption of legitimacy, may be rebutted by showing an actual physical and moral impossibility that there can be children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-9\">This is not a question as to whether the testator was not influenced by the age of Mrs. Rodney, as in Jee <em>v. </em>Audley, supra, in making the will, but it is a question of fact, viz., Avhether there is any possibility of a child being born to Mrs. Rodney. It is not a question of law as to the devolution of an estate such as Blackstone\u2019s rule applies to, but is a practical, not an abstract, question of probability or possibility.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A9_Y\">Mr. Justice Mercur,</author>\n<p id=\"A6f\">delivered the opinion of the court, May 7th 1877.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">The defendants in error derived title to the real estate in controversy under the will of James S. Duval. The language, in item No. 2 of the original will, is, \u201c to my daughter, Sarah Rodney, I bequeath\u201d (the land in question) \u201c to be held by her husband John Rodney, whom I hereby appoint trustee, in trust for her children.\u201d By codicil thereto he further devised and declared \u201cthat in item No. 2 of my said will the devise to my daughter Sarah Rodney, and to her children, is intended and shall give to her children living at her death, and to the lawful issue of any of them, if dead, in right of such one deceased, and to their heirs for ever, share and share alike, the real estate of the said clause of my will so devised, and for Avant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>of such issue living, then that the real estate so devised to my daughter Sarah shall go to and vest in her husband during his natural life for his own use and benefit, subject to the trusts in the said clause mentioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">At the time of the execution of the will and codicil Sarah Rodney had two children. Two other children were born afterwards. One of the former and one of the latter died unmarried and without issue. Sarah Rodney and her husband are still surviving. They, and the two surviving children, constitute the defendants in error. Can all of them jointly convey a good and marketable title in fee simple to the land in question ? To maintain this action they must not only show their title to be good, but it must also be \u25a0 marketable. The vendee is not bound to accept a doubtful title. Every title is doubtful which exposes the party holding it to litigation : Bumberger <em>v. </em>Clippinger, 5 W. &amp; S. 311; Speakman <em>v. </em>Forepaugh, 8 Wright 363; Doebler\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 9; Swayne <em>v. </em>Lyon, 17 Id. 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">If under any contingency of the will there may be a devisee over, who is not a party to this suit, he would not be bound by anything we may now decide. As then he would nof be absolutely concluded by this judgment, the vendee would be exposed to the peril and annoyance of litigation from such devisee : Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">It is true, to justify the rejection of the 'title the doubt must be considerable or rational: Stapylton <em>v. </em>Scott, 16 Vesey 272. The possibility on which .a remainder is to depend must not be too remote : Fearne on Remainders 250. It should be a common possibility, such as death, or death Avithout issue, or coverture or the like: Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Guided by these rules, we proceed to consider whether the defendants in error can noAV convey a title clear from such a degree of doubt as to be fatal to their recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">By looking at both parts of the will it is very evident that the testator intended to give to his daughter, Sarah Rodney, a life-estate only. In the original Avill he gave her the property and appointed her husband trustee thereof, for her children. This clause on its face does not clearly express the precise estate his daughter should take, nor the time Avhen an estate should pass to her children. Under the authorities, however, the daughter would have taken a life-estate only with remainder to her children. The case of Shirlock <em>v. </em>Shirlock, 5 Barr 367, would indicate that she might have taken that as tenant in common with them. The later cases, however, establish that she would have taken a life-estate in the Avhole, Avith remainder to her children: White <em>et al. v. </em>Williamson <em>et al., </em>2 Grant 249; Cote <em>v. </em>Von Bonnhorst, 5 Wright 243; Curtis <em>v. </em>Longstreth, 8 Id. 297; Coursey <em>v. </em>Davis, 10 Id. 29. That such was the testator\u2019s intent is clearly expressed in the codicil. He therein recognises the devise previously made to his daughter and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>her children, and then hb declares his intent to be to <em>\u201c </em>give it to her children living at her death, and to the lawful issue of any of them if dead.\u201d He does not disturb her life-estate previously given. By giving no estate to her children during her life, he manifestly gives her a life-estate in the whole, and distinctly defines the time when the remainder shall take effect. Neither the words of the codicil nor its spirit indicate a present intent to give any estate to the children <em>in esse; </em>but an intent to give in the future. That future time was fixed. It was to be at the time of the death of his daughter. The class of persons who might at that time be living, and who answered the requirements of the will, were then to take. Until the death of his daughter he gave her children nothing. At her death he gave to such of her children as might then be living and to the lawful issue of any of them who were then dead. It is very clear that the testator did not intend to give, during the life of his daughter, any vested estate to her children <em>in esse </em>at the date of the will, nor to her subsequently-born children. If it vested in the children during the life of their mother they could alien the same or it might be taken from them by adverse process. It would be doing great violence to the whole language of the codicil to give that construction to the devise : Abbott <em>et al. v. </em>Jenkins, 10 S. &amp; R. 296. The intention of the testator being thus made clear, the rule in Shelley\u2019s case cannot be invoked to prevent that intention from being effective. It is only after the intention has been discovered that the rule in Shelley\u2019s case can be applied. It cannot be used as a means of discovering the intention : Fearne on Contingent Remainders *188; Hileman <em>v. </em>Bouslough, 1 Harris 351; Doebler\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 9; Yarnall\u2019s Appeal, 20 Id. 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">It is true in doubtful cases, the construction should be in favor of vested, in preference to contingent, remainders, but it does not seem to us that sufficient doubt exists in this case to give it that effect. The case of Womrath <em>v. </em>McCormick, 1 P. F. Smith 504, has been cited to prove the estate was vested as to the children <em>in esse </em>at the execution of the will. That case, however, is distinguishable in several respects from this. There, the devisees in remainder were all <em>in esse </em>and ascertained. They were the children of the devisor. There was nothing contingent as to the interest devised, more than always exists as to the immediate remainder-man. That is, he must outlive the particular tenant for the estate to vest in possession. There the testator gave the \u201c rents, income and interest\u201d of all his estate, real and personal, to his wife during her life, and directed that upon her death it should be valued and divided into as many parts as he should then have children living, the issue of any deceased child to represent their respective parent or parents. There the devise was to all the children of the testator. Not so the present case. Here the devise of the life-estate was to one only of his several children, and the remainder to the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>of that child only. Here the interest which the children <em>in esse </em>should take depended upon the contingency of children being subsequently bom. There is no gift to the whole class of children before the mother\u2019s death. Here is not merely the postponement of a division of the estate until the death of the life-tenant; but the remaindermen cannot be known until the time arrives to designate them. Prior to that time it is necessarily contingent so far as relates to the persons who are to take : Smith on Executory Interests 281; McBride <em>v. </em>Smyth, 4 P. F. Smith 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">If we are correct in the views expressed two conclusions follow:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">1. If any of the children now living should die during the life of their mother, leaving lawful issue, the title of such issue will not be barred by the deed of their parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">2. If other children should be born and survive their mother, they will be entitled to share in the estate. 'JChis cannot be denied. It is contended, however, that the advanced age of Mrs. Sarah Rodney precludes such an event. We may concede that she has passed the age to Avhich the ability to bear children usually continues; yet the law appears to have settled that there is no age beyond which it is impossible. \u201c A possibility of issue is always supposed to exist in law * * * even though the donees be each of them an hundred years old:\u201d 2 Blackstone\u2019s Com. *125. \u201cFor that the law seeth no impossibility of having childrenCoke on Littleton 28, a. Whether the rule rests upon the indelicacy of the acts to which such an inquiry might lead, or to the great uncertainty of arriving at' an accurate conclusion, we know not; but certain it is, the rule has stood the test of time, and received the sanction of ages. No case has been cited showing that it has ever before been questioned in Pennsylvania. Nature has fixed no certain age, by years, at which a child-bearing capacity shall begin or end. Any conjecture based on age is too doubtful and uncertain to result in any reliable conclusion. It was well said in Jee <em>v. </em>Audley, 1 Cox 324, \u201c if this can be done in one case it may in another, and it is a very dangerous experiment, and introductive of the greatest inconvenience to give a latitude to such sort of conjecture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">It is contended that this doctrine of possibility of issue is only applicable to cases of estate tail after possibility of issue extinct; that it is simply a presumption governing the devolution and quality of estates, and that it should not be presumed Avhen the facts show it to be impossible. This argument is fallacious. The very question before us is whether the possibility of issue is extinct. It affects the transmission of the estate. It diminishes the interests which the children noAv living may take. The presumption of Iuav is in favor of issue, notwithstanding advanced age. It is a presumption of laAV on the very fact, which Ave are requested to say destroys the presumption. The argument makes a conjectural conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>rest on a fact, when the law declares no such conclusion shall be deduced from that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The two contingencies we have considered are not too remote. They are the direct and immediate contingencies provided for by the testator, as likely to arise before the estates in remainder should vest-in his daughter\u2019s children and in their issue. Neither one is so entirely removed from doubt as to make the title of the vendors certain. They leave a cloud on the title which creates doubt and hesitation. We therefore conclude that the defendants in error cannot convey such an indubitable, marketable title as to compel its acceptance. The learned judges therefore erred in holding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Judgment reversed and judgment in favor of the plaintiff in error, on the case stated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
