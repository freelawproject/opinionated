H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>if built, or in the process of being built\u201d depends upon the construction to be given to the will now'' before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The construction of a will is governed by the intention of the testator which is a question of fact. <em>Osgood </em>v. <em>Vivada, </em>94 N. H. 222, 224. This question was submitted for decision to the Court below and its ruling that \u201cthe Central School, so-called, is not entitled\u201d was necessarily based upon its conclusion as to the testator\u2019s intention. That finding, which does not appear in its decision, is not controlling here, however, since the \u201cdetermination of the ultimate fact of the intent of the [testator] rests with the law court.\u201d <em>Sylvester </em>v. <em>Newhall, </em>97 N. H. 267, 272. The subsidiary facts concerned with the surrounding circumstances of this case, so far as the school bequest was concerned, were not found by the Trial Court but were agreed to by the parties. On those facts and on the will itself, the question of the testator\u2019s intent is brought here for determination. See <em>Pettee </em>v. <em>Chapter, </em>86 N. H. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The fact that the legatee, named as \u201cthe proposed Central School of Epsom, N. H.,\u201d is not a legal entity or person does not render the legacy void. The identity of a beneficiary is a question of fact to be determined on the basis of the testator\u2019s intention. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>82 N. H. 281, 285; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Hospital, </em>82 N. H. 260, 261. Public schoolhouses are ordinarily built by school districts which are empowered by law to do so (RSA 194:3) and may accept gifts and legacies for that purpose. See <em>Reed </em>v. <em>District, </em>91 N. H. 209. During the five years before the making of this will the Epsom school district had in fact been discussing, planning and raising money by public subscription for a new school designated as the \u201cCentral School.\u201d It seems highly probable that the testator, a resident of the adjoining town of Northwood was aware of this activity and intended by his reference to \u201cthe proposed Central School of Epsom\u201d to describe the school which the Epsom school district proposed to build. There being no evidence of any other central school in Epsom, we conclude that a finding is required that the testator intended this legacy to go to the Epsom school district for \u201cthe proposed Central School ... if built, or in the process of being built.\u201d <em>Society </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>48 N. H. 393, 397. See <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Mackie, </em>86 N. H. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The legacy in question is a conditional one. When he made his will in 1950, the testator apparently did not consider that the school was then \u201cin the process of being built,\u201d for if he had, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>presumably would not have attached the condition which he did. Between 1950 and 1953 when the testator died, more money had been raised for the school, both by taxation and by public subscription, and additional planning had been done but the building itself was no more \u201cin process\u201d than in 1950. If the testator intended that the legacy be paid only if the school was already \u201cbuilt, or in the process of being built\u201d at the time of his death, the condition of the legacy was not met. The school district contends, however, that the testator intended that a reasonable time be allowed after his death for performance of the condition. What his intention was in this respect is not stated in the will and must be determined by a balance of probabilities. <em>Langdell </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>100 N. H. 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The will plainly evidences the testator\u2019s intention to benefit the proposed new school in Epsom provided the actual construction of the building is assured. In determining whether he intended to require that this assurance be furnished at the date of his death or within a reasonable time thereafter, it is significant that the condition which he imposed upon the bequest specified no time limit for its fulfillment although it might have done so. The time of his death being unpredictable, it is unlikely, in the absence of language to the contrary, that the testator intended to require that the condition be met at the moment of his death whenever that event might occur. \u201cWhen no time is fixed for the . . . performance of a condition, it is to be . . . performed within a reasonable time.\u201d <em>Colby </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>70 N. H. 591, 592; anno. 110 A. L. R. 1354. In the circumstances of this case, the application of this rule appears to be consistent with the testator\u2019s primary intention to furnish financial assistance in the building of the new school.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Furthermore, it does not clearly appear that the testator intended the school bequest to go to others if the condition was not fulfilled. The will provides that the residue \u201cbe divided equally between the following five beneficiaries.\u201d The bequests to the four beneficiaries other than the school are unconditional and no provision is made for a gift over if the condition attached to the school bequest is not performed. See <em>Y. M. C. A. </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>97 N. J. Eq. 95. Nor did the testator intend that his heirs take by way of a partial intestacy. \u201cA testator is to be considered as intending a benefit to the object of his gift, and the presumption against partial intestacy is strong.\u201d <em>Souhegan National Bank </em>v. <em>Kenison, </em>92 N. H. 117, 120. The will in question mentions only one of the testator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>six heirs, all of whom were nephews or nieces, to the exclusion of the others. The residue clause is detailed and was clearly intended to dispose of the remainder of his estate. Both of these factors negative any intention that the heirs-at-law should benefit by intestacy. <em>Merchants &amp;c. Bank </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>93 N. H. 388; <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>99 N. H. 239, 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We conclude that the testator intended that the legacy in question be paid to the school district of Epsom if the proposed Central School was \u201cbuilt, or in the process of being built\u201d within a reasonable time after his decease.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The testator died February 7, 1953, shortly before the annual meeting of the Epsom school district for that year. At the annual meeting in March 1954, the school district committed itself to building the new school and voted the necessary funds. The fact that it could have so acted at a special meeting called for an earlier date (RSA 197:2, 3) does not require a conclusion that the delay was an unreasonable one. The executor\u2019s final account was not returnable until July 30, 1954. Before that date, the contract for building the new school had been let and by August 13, 1954, the actual construction had begun. Whether the proposed school was \u201cin the process of being built\u201d when the contract was let or when construction started a short time later, it seems apparent that the building of the school was fully assured within a reasonable time after the testator\u2019s death and that the school district is entitled to receive the bequest. See <em>In re Anderson\u2019s Estate, </em>244 Iowa 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Under this interpretation of the will, the heirs-at-law are not entitled to share in the residue of the estate and their exceptions do not require consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\n<em>Exception of Epsom school district sustained; other exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b207-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
