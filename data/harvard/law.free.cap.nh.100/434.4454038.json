RSA 458:7; <em>Desaulnier </em>v. <em>Desaulnier, </em>97 N. H. 171, 172, and authorities cited. However, the plaintiff was decreed a legal separation on the grounds of abandonment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>refusal to cohabit on his original libel as amended. RSA 458:7 IX. It therefore appears the Court found that the plaintiff did and the defendant did not have a cause for legal separation. This issue has therefore become <em>res judicata (Desaulnier </em>v. <em>Desaulnier, </em>97 N. H. 171; <em>Poulicakos </em>v. <em>Poulicakos, </em>94 N. H. 233, 235) and so the Court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">However, a different question is presented by the plaintiff\u2019s motion which asks for further equitable relief. Whether this should be granted him is clearly a matter for the Court\u2019s discretion. <em>Sandberg </em>v. <em>Sandberg, </em>81 N. H. 317. An examination of the record convinces us that the circumstances here are such that the Court has a strong duty to scrutinize \u201cthe total situation\u201d (see <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>97 N. H. 301, 303) after hearing all the evidence the parties may introduce on the question of whether justice requires that the plaintiff\u2019s motion be granted. <em>Ela </em>v. <em>Ela, </em>63 N. H. 116, 122; <em>Bussey v. Bussey, </em>95 N. H. 349. Since the plaintiff\u2019s motion was granted as a matter of law when discretion should have been exercised, there must be a new trial. <em>Vallee </em>v. <em>Company, </em>89 N. H. 285, 291.
