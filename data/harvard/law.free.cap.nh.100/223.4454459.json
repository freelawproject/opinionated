H. 107, in which this same policy provision was considered, the insured was the self-employed proprietor of an ice delivery business. At the time of the accident in which he was involved, he and his brother, who owned and operated a gravel truck, had temporarily exchanged jobs because of the insured\u2019s physical inability to make ice deliveries. The issue presented in that case was whether ice delivery or gravel delivery was the \u201cbusiness or occupation\u201d of the insured at the time of the accident. As applicable to a determination of that question, the following statement was made in the opinion: \u201cThe words \u2018business\u2019 and \u2018occupation\u2019 . . . are each commonly used in reference to the work in which one is regularly or usually engaged.\u201d This language was not intended as a conclusion that as to -work performed by an insured in connection with his employment, the words \u201cbusiness or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>occupation,\u201d as used in this policy provision, should apply only to the precise type of work in which he was regularly or usually engaged. See <em>Merchants </em>&amp;c. <em>Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>98 N. H. 349, in which the truck operated by the insured was \u201csometimes . . . used 'a couple of times in one day or it might be a couple of months before they used it again\u2019 \u201d and the same policy provision was held to be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The policy is to be given the meaning which a reasonable person in the position of the insured wmuld give to it. <em>Farm Bureau Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>94 N. H. 389, 392. The duties of an occupation are not ordinarily thought of as being limited to the performance of those acts regularly and usually required by the \"work but are generally understood to include those additional acts the need for the performance of which arises only infrequently but which are nonetheless a part of the occupation. Acts which are essential to the proper and full performance of the duty owed to the employer are a part of the occupation whether the need for their'performance arises regularly or only occasionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Capobianco\u2019s occupation was that of a general mechanic at the concentration site in the State military reservation. This was the classification in which he was employed, the activity upon which he spent the major portion of his time and out of which he made his living. <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Casualty Co., </em>99 N. H. 107, 115. His regular duties, as stated in an office memorandum from the U. S. Property and Disbursing Officer for New Hampshire, made him responsible for \u201cthe receipt of material into the concentration site, preparation for storage, storage, in-storage maintenance, operation of battery maintenance room and maintenance records connected with equipment assigned to the concentration site.\u201d At this site about five hundred military vehicles of various kinds were normally stored and maintained, subject to requisition for use off the reservation by National Guard units throughout the state. All of these vehicles were in Capobianco\u2019s charge for maintenance and storage while on the reservation. As an incidental duty not reduced to writing, Capobianco drove the vehicles on the reservation for testing and repair purposes. When vehicles were to be driven off the reservation for any purpose, they were regularly operated by truck drivers employed at the reservation for that purpose. Capobianco was not classified as a truck driver and it was not a part of his regular duty to drive these vehicles on the public highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">In addition to his responsibilities in connection with the storage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>and maintenance of equipment, however, the Trial Court found that it was \u201cCapobianco\u2019s duty in his work to obey the orders of his superior, Captain Murphy.\u201d As the Captain testified, \u201cbeing his superior, he would carry out an order that I gave him . . . He was expected to comply with my order.\u201d It was \u201cpart of his duty.\u201d The Court also found that Capobianco \u201chad a right to drive off the reservation when so ordered by his superiors\u201d and the testimony indicates that he had in fact done so about once a month, during the three years he had been employed at the reservation, the occasion for his doing so being, as he testified, \u201cwhen there is a shortage of drivers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">On the day of the accident, Capobianco was not engaged in his regular work at the concentration site because of the storm but he was on duty and being paid. All the truck drivers employed at the reservation were at summer camp with the National Guard. When the call was received from the hospital, Captain Murphy, as the Trial Court found he \u201chad a right to\u201d do, ordered \u201cCapobianco to take the generator to the . . . hospital.\u201d The emergency nature of the mission is without significance. Emergencies requiring the operation of trucks off the reservation were \u201cinfrequent\u201d according to Captain Murphy. Thus, even a classified truck driver operating the truck on the day of the accident would have been performing work other than that in which he was regularly or usually engaged. The important fact is that \u201cat the time of the accident, Capobianco was driving the army truck ... in compliance with an order of his superior,\u201d an authorized order which he had a duty to obey, and was receiving his regular pay for so doing. Under these circumstances no reasonable person in Capobianco\u2019s position would consider that such use of the truck was not a part of his occupation. The Trial Court\u2019s conclusion of law that he was using it \u201cin another line of endeavor\u201d and not in his occupation cannot be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Attached to the policy was a \u201cNew Hampshire Statutory Motor Vehicle Liability Policy Endorsement\u201d by the terms of which coverage for use of other vehicles was provided within the statutory limits, without regard to whether the use was in the business or occupation of the insured. While the plaintiff\u2019s responsibilities under this endorsement were not determined by the Trial Court, the necessary facts are before us and justice and convenience require that this phase of the case be disposed of at this time. <em>Farm Bureau Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>94 N. H. 389, 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The plaintiff's contention that no coverage is afforded by this endorsement because of the provisions of RSA 268:26 is without merit. As indicated in <em>Milwaukee Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>100 N. H. 239, the fact that the truck which Capobianco was operating was owned by the federal government does not make inapplicable the coverage afforded by the endorsement. While Capobianco was a member of the National Guard it conclusively appears from the evidence that he was not \u201cengaged in military duty pursuant to oiders from proper authority\u201d at the time of the accident and the statute does not operate to relieve the plaintiff from its obligations under the endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">A judgment should be entered that the plaintiff is required to furnish coverage under the endorsement up to the required minimum statutory limits, but is under no obligation to do so beyond those limits because of the provisions of agreement V (b) (2) of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b292-7\">Kenison, C.
