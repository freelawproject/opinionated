The plaintiff in this action was no more required to furnish evidence that a diligent search for the defendant had been made in the state where he was alleged to have last resided, as suggested by the defendant, than to show the impossibility of serving upon an \u201cagent authorized to appear for\u201d the defendant or upon \u201chis tenant on or near the land attached.\u201d While the writ recites the \u201clast known residence\u201d of the defendant to have been in Massachusetts, it describes him as being \u201cof parts unknown,\u201d thereby indicating that service could not be made upon him outside the state, either in hand or by leaving \u201cat his abode.\u201d In addition, the sheriff who attached the defendant\u2019s real estate in this state made a return of <em>non est inventus. </em>It has long been a settled construction of section 8 that this is sufficient evidence to permit the entry of an action and the issuance of an order of notice by the court. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Bradstreet, </em>99 N. H. 55, 57; <em>Therrien </em>v. <em>Scammon, </em>87 N. H. 214, 215; <em>Burney </em>v. <em>Hodgdon, </em>66 N. H. 338, 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The order of notice directed the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the pendency of the action by causing certified copies of the writ, the return thereon and the court order \u201cto be given or sent by mail in a registered letter to, or left at the last and usual place of abode of said defendant.\u201d See RSA 514:3. If the plaintiff chose to make service by registered mail, this order did not require that copies of the enumerated documents be sent to \u201cthe last and usual place of abode\u201d of the defendant, as claimed by him, but only that they be \u201csent by mail in a registered letter to . . . said defendant.\u201d This the plaintiff did.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The defendant did not personally receipt for the registered mail letter which was sent to him \u201cc/o Harvard Club, 374 Commonwealth Ave., Boston, Massachusetts\u201d but the return receipt \u201cshowed the name of Arthur J. Conlon 'by\u2019 an agent whose name is not legible.\u201d Whether the agent\u2019s signature was legible or illegible, this was sufficient service upon the defendant in this case to meet the requirements of due process. The defendant owned real estate in this state which had been attached. His whereabouts, while unknown to the plaintiff, was evidently known at the Harvard Club. Delivery of the letter to someone at that address who was willing to accept it and receipt therefor in the defendant\u2019s behalf was as reasonably certain to inform the defendant of the pending action as the circumstances of the case permitted. <em>Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Trust Co., </em>339 U.
