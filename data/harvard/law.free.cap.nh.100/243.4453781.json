H. 207, 211), confirmed by long usage and statute (RSA 311:8), requires that this court should take expeditious action for the protection of the community in cases of professional misconduct. <em>Moore\u2019s Case, </em>76 N. H. 227, 229. \u201cAs occasion arises, appropriate disciplinary measures may be taken for the protection of the public, as well as for the maintenance of public confidence in the bar as a whole.\u201d <em>Welanko\u2019s Case, </em>99 N. H. 413, 414. The misappropriation or embezzlement of clients\u2019 funds by an attorney demonstrates such lack of common honesty as to clearly justify an attorney\u2019s disbarment. <em>Delano\u2019s Case, </em>58 N. H. 5. \u201cMoney collected by an attorney for his client, while in the hands of the attorney, is the money of the client and not capital for the use of the attorney in his business.\u201d <em>Allen\u2019s Case, </em>75 N. H. 301, 302. While restitution of the misappropriated funds may be taken into consideration by the Trial Court on the question of sentence, it does not preclude disbarment for the protection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>public. <em>Allen\u2019s Case, supra. </em>The respondent\u2019s conduct is contrary to his oath of office, demonstrates his unfitness to practice as an attorney and calls for his removal from office forthwith. The tendered resignation is refused and the respondent is disbarred as an attorney in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b309-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
