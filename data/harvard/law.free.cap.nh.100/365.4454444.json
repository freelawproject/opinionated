Plaintiff cleaned his room, fixed his meals, did his mending, washing and ironing and took care of him on two different occasions when he was ill. She testified it was agreed between them that she was to receive therefor $15 per week to be paid to her in a lump sum at John\u2019s death or at the end of 1952 and that she has not been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>In her specifications she claimed $982 for board, room and care for 491 days at the rate of $2 per day, plus $15 for additional expenses, a total of $997. Her claim was submitted both on an express contract and in <em>quantum, meruit. Dedes </em>v. <em>Dedes, </em>93 N. H. 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">It was uncontradicted that the services for which payment is sought were rendered. There being no family relationship existing between the parties <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>99 N. H. 392) the evidence warranted a finding of an express contract or of an implied mutual understanding that these services were to be paid for by John Jobst. <em>Yeaton </em>v. <em>Skillings, </em>100 N. H. 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">There was evidence however that on May 1, 1951, when John Jobst took up residence in plaintiff\u2019s home he had a savings account with a balance of $4,325 in one bank and an account in another bank. Withdrawals averaging $338 were made from these accounts every month that he lived at plaintiff\u2019s home. Defendant testified that John \u201cnever owed any money\u201d and that when he lived at the defendant\u2019s home for six years preceding 1949 he paid him each week. Defendant also testified that when he requested the plaintiff for John\u2019s bank book when he was taken ill \"there was no discussion on the issue\u201d of John owing her money.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">This evidence was sufficient to support a verdict for defendant. Although there was evidence that John might have spent his money otherwise instead of using it to pay plaintiff, a verdict for her was not compelled. <em>Cf. Elwell </em>v. <em>Roper, </em>72 N. H. 254, 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The main question in controversy was whether plaintiff had been paid for her services. Deceased\u2019s bank books showing assets which he possessed during the period in question as well as withdrawals made therefrom were properly admitted on that issue. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>90 N. H. 42, 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict was properly denied and there being no further exceptions of merit appearing, the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b430-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
