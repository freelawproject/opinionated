In 1953 and for some years prior, the defendant and two neighbors operated several farms in Lyme \u201cas a cooperative,\u201d the exact nature of which was not disclosed. The defendant owned two of these farms, and the Court found that he hired David Berry to operate them. In 1953 and for several years previously, Berry and his family occupied the house on the main farm, and some twenty to twenty-five head of cattle were maintained there. The defendant occupied \u201cthe upper farm\u201d for possibly a month or two, in 1953. For the balance of the year it was unoccupied. In 1953 Berry requested the plaintiff to bale the hay \u201con the hill,\u201d and he did so. At Berry\u2019s direction he made out his bill for $202.50 to the defendant, and gave it to Berry. The bill was paid by the defendant about a month later.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">In the summer of 1954, Berry who still lived on the main farm asked the plaintiff if he would \u201cbale the hay on the hill the same as last year.\u201d The plaintiff agreed, and baled hay on the same fields with one exception, made out his bill for $172.50 to the defendant and delivered it to Berry, who said he would send it to the defendant. In May 1955 the defendant returned to Lyme, and refused to pay the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>The defendant\u2019s testimony was that in 1953 Berry was working for the cooperative, and was authorized to cut the hay and have it baled, but after October 1953 \u201cthe cooperative no longer operated the farm,\u201d and the defendant then leased his farms to Berry. He retained title to \u201can undivided half\" of the cows, and made \"a conditional sales contract on half of the cattle\u201d with Berry. Half of the milk check was paid to the defendant as \u201crent and applied against the purchase price of various things that he was buying from me.\u201d Berry was authorized to cut the hay in 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\">The defendant gave no notice to the plaintiff of any new arrangement with Berry, and the plaintiff saw no change in the operation of the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The Court found and ruled that the \u201cdefendant so conducted his farm property as to give the plaintiff the right to believe that Dave Berry was his agent and authorized to hire him to bale the hay in 1954.\u201d Thus it is clear that the defendant\u2019s liability as determined by the Trial Court was founded upon the apparent authority of Berry, his former agent. The sole issue is whether the evidence warranted the findings made.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In <em>Atto </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>77 N. H. 527, 528, 529, the question of whether a contract was within the \u201capparent scope\u201d of authority of an agent was stated to be a question of fact \u201cnot susceptible of an exact or technical definition .... In general,\u201d the opinion states \u201cit has been defined as follows: \u2018The apparent scope of an agent\u2019s authority is that authority which a reasonably prudent man, induced by the principal\u2019s acts or conduct, and in the exercise of reasonable diligence and sound discretion, under similar circumstances with the party dealing with the agent, and with like knowledge, would naturally suppose the agent to have.\u2019 \u201d Otherwise stated in <em>Davison </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>79 N. H. 262, 263, by apparent scope \u201cit is intended that the principal has either so conducted his business as to give third parties the right to believe that the act in question is one he has authorized his agent to do, or that it is one agents in that line of business are accustomed to do.\u201d See also, <em>Edelstone </em>v. <em>Company, </em>84 N. H. 315, 319. As was said in <em>Howison </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>88 N. H. 31, 40: \u201cIt is not a question of authority in fact, but of reliance on appearances.\u201d These principles control even though an agency has terminated. \u201cIt is a familiar principle of law that . . . the authority of the agent to bind his principal continues, even after an actual revocation, until notice of the revocation is given . . . . \u201d <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Lenheim, </em>66 N. Y. 301, 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Applying the law to the case before us, it is plain that the conclusion reached by the Trial Court was warranted by the evidence. By paying the 1953 bill, the defendant recognized Berry\u2019s authority to hire the plaintiff on the former\u2019s credit. Berry then resided on the defendant\u2019s farm, and was properly found the defendant\u2019s agent at that time, whether he was in fact hired by the defendant individually, or by some other member of the \u201ccooperative\u201d which could be found to have been a partnership. In 1954, Berry continued to reside on the main farm, and to all appearances was operating it in the same manner and in the same capacity. If in fact he had ceased to occupy the farm as agent, but did so as a tenant, the defendant made no effort to notify the plaintiff of the change in Berry\u2019s status.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">It could be found that in the exercise of reasonable diligence the plaintiff was justified as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct in believing that Berry had authority to pledge the defendant\u2019s credit in 1954 for the same services which the defendant recognized as a proper charge against himself in 1953. Whether in the latter year Berry\u2019s occupancy of the farm was \u201ca mere incident to his carrying on the farm\u201d <em>(Mead </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>80 Vt. 273, 278; <em>Guiel </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>100 Conn. 737) or that of a tenant is unnecessary to determine. The important fact is that the defendant permitted the outward appearances of Berry\u2019s authority to remain unchanged in 1954 from what they were in 1953, and by not notifying the plaintiff of the termination of the agency permitted the plaintiff to be misled. Having done so, he rather than the plaintiff should bear the loss. <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Kirk, </em>11 N. H. 397, 403; <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>57 N. H. 34. Under comparable circumstances before the court in <em>North Chicago Rolling Mill Co. </em>v. <em>Hyland, </em>94 Ind. 448, the defendant was held liable for an obligation incurred by a former agent after he had become the defendant\u2019s tenant without notice to the plaintiff of the change of status. The verdict in the case before us is supported by authority generally. <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Lenheim, </em>66 N. Y. 301, supra; Mechem, Outlines of Agency (4th <em>ed.) s. </em>284, and cases cited; Restatement, Agency, <em>ss. </em>27, 69, 73, 136(2), 261. We do not consider the circumstance that Berry had previously pledged the defendant\u2019s credit upon only one occasion <em>(Smith &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Company, </em>130 N. Y. S. 136) to be of controlling importance. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>74 Minn. 171. See also, <em>Rice </em>v. <em>James, </em>193 Mass. 458, 464; <em>Goldfein </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>125 Neb. 112. The evidence that no question of the agent\u2019s authority was raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>on that occasion, coupled with the evidence of the misleading circumstances of his continued occupancy and management of the farms and the cattle in the defendant\u2019s continued absence, was sufficient to warrant the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b487-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
