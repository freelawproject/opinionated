These statutory requirements apply to causes in tort for personal injuries as well as to other claims. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Brusseau, </em>100 N. H. 87. The commencement of actions within the one-year period by Leo C. Vanni and his wife, setting forth nothing more than a claim in the common counts in each case, was not a sufficient exhibit of their demands for damages on account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>of personal injuries to meet the requirements of these sections <em>(Watson </em>v. <em>Carvelle, </em>82 N. H. 453, 457) and was plainly inadequate to so qualify as to the claims now made on behalf of the minor son, Bruce D. Vanni, and those of Leo C. Vanni for consequential damages suffered by him as the husband of Feme and the father of Bruce. This failure of the plaintiffs to present a proper demand within one year does not, however, result \u201cin the complete abolition of [their] rights at law,\u201d as claimed by the defendants. Relief may be afforded, as is sought by the petition in this case, under RSA 556:28 which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">\u201cExtension <em>of </em>time. Whenever any one has a claim against the estate of a deceased person, which has not been prosecuted within the time limited by law, he may apply to the superior court, by petition setting forth all the facts; and if the court shall be of the opinion that justice and equity require it, and that the claimant is not chargeable with culpable neglect in not bringing his suit within the time limited by law, it may give him judgment for the amount due to him. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Relief under this section is not confined to those situations where suit has not been brought within the two-year period limited by RSA 556:5. \u201cThough there has been no presentation of the claim within the prescribed time, action may be brought under section 28 if justice and equity require it and the plaintiff\u2019s neglect to comply with the statutory requirements is not culpable.\u201d <em>Emerson\u2019s Sons </em>v. <em>Cloutman, </em>88 N. H. 59, 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\"Culpable neglect has been defined to be that which is censorious, faulty or blamable.\u201d It exists \u201cif no good reason, according to the standards of ordinary conduct, for the dormancy of the claim is found.\u201d <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>90 N. H. 36, 38. The issue of whether the plaintiffs acted with culpable neglect in failing to present their claims to the administratrix within one year after her appointment on November 3, 1953, was determined by the Trial Court in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor and this finding is not to be set aside if supported by any competent evidence. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>99 N. H. 226, 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The statute requiring that demand be made upon the administrator of an estate within one year after the appointment (RSA 556:3) is one of those provisions the purpose of which \u201cis to secure the orderly and expeditious settlement of estates.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>93 N. H. 456, 458. The administrator is entitled to be informed \u201cso he may decide whether or not to undertake to settle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>without suit.\u201d <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Carvelle, </em>82 N. H. 453, 456. However, when the assets of an estate are such that, as to tort claims against it, \u201cany judgment recovered . . . must be satisfied by\u201d an insurance company providing coverage for the accident and the terms of the applicable policy provide that \u201cthe company controls all negotiations for settlement,\u201d as was agreed in this case, the actions of the insurance company may provide the basis for determining whether claimants who neglect to make demand upon the administrator within one year have acted culpably or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The plaintiffs admittedly never talked or communicated in any way with the administratrix or her lawyer within the one-year period which expired November 3, 1954. However, from a time shortly after the accident on October 18, 1953, until well into the year 1954, they were visited on several occasions by a representative of the defendant Merchants Mutual Casualty Company, the insurer of the Cloutier car, who \u201ctalked about the accident and . . . said his company would settle ... He told us to keep track of our bills and he would talk with us and settle when we got better . . . He said he would talk with us whenever we were well and had our bills all together.\u201d He was given no copies of the bills \u201cbecause he gave me to understand that we all had to be well before I could do that.\u201d On one of his visits, when he was told by Leo that the Cloutier estate had a lawyer and that he, Leo, was going to get one, the representative \u201csaid he wished I wouldn\u2019t see a lawyer; he wished I would see him.\u201d After the visits of the insurance company representative stopped, no effort was made to communicate with him \u201cbecause he had led us to believe there was no use until everybody was all over their injuries.\u201d On October 7, 1954, the plaintiffs consulted a lawyer for the first time and told him \u201call the facts as to what had occurred up to that time.\u201d On October 15, 1954, service was made upon the plaintiff Leo in an action brought against him by the administratrix. On these facts, it could clearly be found that the plaintiffs and their lawyer, without fault on their part, mistakenly believed that a demand upon the administratrix in connection with their claims would not be required as a preliminary to the bringing of tort actions. Such a mistake of fact would constitute \u201cgood reason, according to the standards of ordinary conduct,\u201d <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>90 N. H. 36, 38) for the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the statute. A finding of culpable neglect is not compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Although the statute requires the filing of a \u201cpetition setting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>forth all the facts\u201d (RSA 556:28) the plaintiffs\u2019 petition alleges merely that \u201con October 18, 1953, the plaintiffs and their minor son were injured in an automobile accident caused by the negligence of Wilfred F. Cloutier.\u201d By its order of May 23, 1955 permitting the plaintiffs to bring five tort actions on or before June 15, 1955, the Court in effect granted leave to amend the petition by adding a sufficient specification of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims to permit the introduction of evidence upon which a judgment under section 28 might be entered. This it was entitled to do in its discretion. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>99 N. H. 226, 229. The defendants can hardly complain that the Court abused its discretion in establishing the method for amendment of the petition which it did. The procedure prescribed was one under which the plaintiffs\u2019 claims may be consolidated for trial with all other actions arising out of the same accident, including that of the administratrix against Leo Vanni, and their validity and amount determined. Final judgment on the petition will depend upon the outcome of that trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">During the cross-examination of Mrs. Vanni, she was questioned with regard to her deposition taken before trial in which she was asked \u201cHas any one ever told you that they would pay your claim arising out of this accident?\u201d and had answered \u201cNever.\u201d Upon redirect examination, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was permitted to call the witness\u2019 attention to three other questions and answers in the same deposition, the first two being introductory and the answer to the third being: \u201cJust about every time that I saw [the insurance company representative] ... he reassured me that everything was going to be all right as far as settling was concerned.\u201d This answer clearly tended to qualify and explain the question and answer inquired about on cross-examination and its use for this purpose was proper. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>87 N. H. 430, 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b340-8\">Duncan, J., dissented: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
