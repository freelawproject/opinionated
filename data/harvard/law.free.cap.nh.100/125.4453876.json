We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Whether the opportunity afforded to a party to exercise the peremptory challenges granted by statute (RSA 519:19) has been such as to produce a fair and impartial jury must depend upon the facts in existence when the jury was being organized, whether then known to the parties or discovered later. See <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Union-Leader, </em>99 N. H. 492, 498; <em>Hazen </em>v. <em>Corporation, </em>89 N. H. 522, 523; <em>Shulinsky </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 86, 88. Facts or circumstances first arising after the impaneling of the jury cannot affect the composition of the jury because they did not exist for consideration in the challenging of prospective jurors at the only time when that right might have been exercised. When new or additional counsel for one party in a civil action first appears after the jury has been chosen, the issue raised by a motion for a mistrial is whether, in order to prevent injustice to the moving party under the circumstances then existing, the trial must be discontinued. See <em>LePage </em>v. <em>Company, </em>97 N. H. 46, 50; <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>88 N. H. 199, 202. The determination of this issue is a question of fact for the Trial Court. See <em>In re Winslow\u2019s Will, </em>146 Iowa 67, 69; <em>Kerling </em>v. <em>Company, </em>109 Minn. 481, 483; 88 C. J. S. 304, 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">When the jury was drawn at the opening of the trial of this action, only one attorney appeared for the defendant. He was present in the courtroom and was identified to the prospective jurors as counsel for the defendant. After the impaneling of the jury, he made a pre-view statement and went with the jury on a view. The next morning, before the plaintiff\u2019s opening statement, an additional attorney appeared for the defendant. The Trial Court informed the jury of this fact and \u201casked the jury the usual questions concerning counsel and received a negative reply.\u201d On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>that basis the indifference of the jurors as determined the day-before had apparently not been affected by the appearance of additional counsel for the defendant. The plaintiff moved for a mistrial on the sole ground that he \u201cmight well have challenged differently\u201d had he known when the jury was drawn that additional counsel would later appear. When asked by the Trial Court if he had \u201cany specific references to challenges,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s counsel replied that he would \u201chave to make some study of that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">By its denial of the motion, the Court impliedly found that justice did not then require that the trial be stopped. The assertion of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, standing alone and indicating only that he <em>might </em>have challenged differently, did not require a contrary finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">After the jury\u2019s verdict, the plaintiff moved that it be set aside on the same grounds advanced in support of the motion for a mistrial. At the hearing on this motion, plaintiff\u2019s counsel indicated for the first time the names of two jurors in respect to whom he then said he would have challenged differently. However, he gave no reason as to why he would have challenged one of them and assorted that the reason why he would have challenged the other \u201cis a trade secret.\u201d These empty assertions furnished no evidence that the trial had been unfair nor is there anything in the record to indicate such a fact. The Trial Court\u2019s denial of this motion was equivalent to a finding that the plaintiff had a fair trial. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Company, </em>100 N. H. 12, 16. No reason appears why that finding should be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The question of whether the trial was rendered unfair by reason of the defendant\u2019s statement made in the hearing of the jury during the argument of plaintiff\u2019s counsel was peculiarly one which \u201cthe presiding justice has better means of deciding . . . than others can have who were not at the trial.\u201d <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>88 N. H. 199, 202. By his failure to request a mistrial immediately after the statement was made, when an opportunity to do so was afforded, plaintiff\u2019s counsel in effect elected to go on with the trial and take his chances on the verdict. <em>LePage </em>v. <em>Company, </em>97 N. H. 46, 52. Under the circumstances of the case, we cannot say that the Trial Court\u2019s denial of the motion to set aside the verdict was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b191-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
