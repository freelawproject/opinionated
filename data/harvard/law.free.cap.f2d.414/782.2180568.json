The appellant contends that the trial court committed plain error in permitting one Lindsey, who was jointly indicted with him for the same offenses, to testify that he had earlier pled guilty. We find no merit in this contention and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Lindsey\u2019s testimony met with no objection from Baete\u2019s trial counsel, nor was it the subject of a requested charge. Nevertheless, the court instructed the jury not to consider Lindsey\u2019s guilty plea in determining the innocence or guilt of Baete.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Appellant erroneously relies on our decision in Babb v. United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that case, Babb\u2019s codefendant was allowed to testify over objection that he had pled guilty, and the trial court refused to instruct the jury to disregard this testimony in determining Babb\u2019s guilt. We held that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony and refusing the charge. The case presently before us is distinguishable in two respects: (1) appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to the testimony and (2) the trial court gave the cautionary instruction. The effect of the trial court\u2019s conduct in <em>Babb </em>was to allow the jury to consider the code-fendant\u2019s guilty plea as substantive evidence against Babb. Clearly, this was error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Another case cited by appellant, Payton v. United States,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is distinguishable from the case presently before us on precisely the same grounds. There, the court not only erroneously admitted evidence of a codefendant\u2019s guilty plea but compounded the error by repeating the substance of this improper evidence while charging the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">The decision in Carter v. United States<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is strongly urged by the appellant because of the court\u2019s dual considerations in determining whether error had been injected into the case by a policeman\u2019s testimony that a eodefendant had pled guilty. The court concluded that the erroneous admission was rendered harmless by (1) the trial court\u2019s remedial instruction and (2) the fact that the \u201coverwhelming evidence of guilt outweighed any error that remained.\u201d In cases where the jury has become aware of a codefendant\u2019s guilty plea, we think the appellate court should carefully focus its attention on the sufficiency of the corrective instruction. The significance of remedial instructions in such circumstances is pointed out in Freije v. United States wherein the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-12\">It is generally held that it is proper to receive the guilty plea of a eode-fendant, even in the presence of the jury, but this <em>presupposes </em>that cautionary instructions are given.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">We recognize the fact that there may be aggravated circumstances in which the strongest corrective instruction would be insufficient, \u25a0 as, for example, where the guilty plea of one codefendant necessarily implicates another or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>others.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, in the absence of such circumstances, we think that a clear and strong cautionary instruction should be deemed sufficiently curative.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the instant case, the trial court\u2019s instruction was clearly sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\">. Pursuant to new Rule 18 of the Rules of this court, we have concluded on the merits that this ease is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the clerk to place the case <em>on </em>the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing. <em>See </em>Murphy v.
