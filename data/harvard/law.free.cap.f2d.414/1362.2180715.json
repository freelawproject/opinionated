Holladay pursuant to his agreement to purchase a certain parcel of real property (known as the Moorefield Farms in Fairfax, Virginia) \u201c * * * free and clear of all encumbrances * * Upon examination of the title to said real estate it was discovered that the property involved was servient to nine recorded easements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1419-15\">The district court held that these easements constituted encumbrances on the property, and consequently: the undertakings of the above-mentioned agreement could not be complied with in that the purchase could not be accomplished free and clear of all encumbrances; the prospective purchaser, Holladay, was entitled to rescind the agreement to purchase; and he was entitled to a refund of his deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-16\">We affirm the holding of the district court for the reasons stated in its opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1419-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1419-12\">.
