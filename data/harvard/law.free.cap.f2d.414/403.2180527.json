The defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>a major national dairy corporation and it owns and operates the division of Seal-test Foods which conducts a milk processing and sales business in southeastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, with plants and facilities at each location. At the time relevant here, Penn Fruit Company operated forty-five stores and supermarkets in Pennsylvania. Prior to November, 1961, Pennbrook supplied all of the milk purchased by eighteen of the Penn Fruit stores and Sealtest supplied the remaining twenty-seven stores; Penn Fruit was at this time the largest customer of both Pennbrook and Sealtest in the Philadelphia area. The Pennsylvania Milk Control Commission (\u201cPMCC\u201d) at all times relevant here, <em>inter alia, </em>fixed minimum prices at which Pennbrook and Sealtest and other dairies could sell milk to retail outlets in Pennsylvania. The New Jersey Office of Milk Industry (\u201cOMI\u201d) regulated milk prices in New Jersey; Delaware had no milk control law.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Prior to August, 1961, all Sealtest sales to Penn Fruit stores in Pennsylvania were made by delivery in Sealtest trucks from Sealtest plants located in Pennsylvania. These sales were subject to the PMCC price minimum (at that time) of twenty-three to twenty-five cents per quart. On August 15, 1961, pursuant to an agreement executed in April of 1961, Sealtest began to make these sales at its Camden, New Jersey plant, \u201cPlatform Delivery\u201d, with Penn Fruit taking delivery of the milk in Penn Fruit\u2019s own trucks and handling its shipment from Camden to the individual Penn Fruit stores in Pennsylvania. Under this new system, Penn Fruit personnel also took over the performance of certain \u201cin-store services\u201d, such as filling of refrigerator cases, rotation of inventory, etc., which had previously been performed by Sealtest drivers. The \u201cPlatform Delivery\u201d sales were made by Sealtest to Penn Fruit at a net price of eighteen cents per quart, a price allowed by OMI for sales to \u201cdistributors.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">During the period from October, 1963, to August, 1966, Sealtest made the bulk of its platform sales to Penn Fruit at its storage facilities in Claymont, Delaware, with the milk apparently being hauled there by Sealtest from its Camden plant. This method of operation was necessitated by a New Jersey Supreme Court decision<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> holding that wholesale customers such as Sealtest were not entitled to distributor prices in New Jersey. In 1966 OMI granted Penn Fruit a milk dealer\u2019s license and the locus of delivery shifted back to Camden under a new lease-of-facilities arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Since Pennbrook had no facilities outside of Pennsylvania, it could not pursue the procedure employed by Sealtest for avoiding the PMCC minimum-price regulations. Consequently, on November 28, 1961, Penn Fruit began purchasing from Sealtest, by \u201cPlatform Delivery-Camden\u201d, the milk needed for the eighteen stores previously served by Penn-brook. By October of 1962, Penn Fruit had ceased all purchases from Penn-brook, except for certain purchases of \u201cextra-rich\u201d milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Pennbrook\u2019s sales fell off significantly as a result; this is the injury which Pennbrook claims as an \u201cinjury to competition\u201d in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">Sealtest\u2019s answer to that claim is three-fold: (1) the lower \u201cplatform\u201d prices charged to Penn Fruit were \u201ccost justified\u201d; (2) they were established \u201cin good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor\u201d (Pennbrook); and (3) \u201cprice differences mandated by different state regulations do not violate the Robinson-Patman Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">The District Court, in its Opinion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> found that Pennbrook had made out a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201cprima facie case\u201d but that Sealtest had \u201csuccessfully\u201d demonstrated the \u201cadequate defense\u201d of \u201ccost justification\u201d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and further concluded that \u201cThe prices charged by Sealtest and paid by Penn Fruit were established in good faith to meet competition within the scope of the Robinson-Patman Act, including the lower price of Pennbrook.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">On the score of \u201ccost justification\u201d the District Court made this fact-finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">\u201cSealtest\u2019s prices to Penn Fruit were cost justified, and made only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, and delivery.\u201d Finding of Fact No. 125.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">It may be noted parenthetically that the District Court rejected Sealtest\u2019s third asserted defense that its pricing practice was due to the minimum price systems mandated by state regulations and accordingly were not in violation of the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">On review of the testimony we are unable to say that the District Court\u2019s fact-finding that \u201cSealtest\u2019s prices to Penn Fruit were cost justified\u201d was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d. Further, we cannot subscribe to Pennbrook\u2019s contention on this appeal that the District Court erred in construing applicable legal standards in making the stated fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The Robinson-Patman Act specifically makes permissible price \u201cdifferentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are * * * sold or delivered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">The District Court made detailed fact-findings, amply supported by the testimony, on the score of its ultimate fact-finding that Sealtest\u2019s prices to Penn Fruit were \u201ccost justified\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">It specifically found (Fact-Finding No. 108) that Sealtest\u2019s savings \u201cexpressed as a percentage of the sales dollar or selling price\u201d was 21.8%\u2014 broken down as follows: delivery expense 14.4%, selling expense 5%, and general and administrative expense 2.4%, and, (Finding of Fact No. 109) \u201cIn addition, there was a lower material cost in New Jersey in 1961 which increased the savings another 4.4 %\u201d, making a total \u201cdifference in costs, expressed as a percentage of the selling price\u201d of 26.2% (Finding of Fact No. 112). It further found that \u201cAll costs which were attributable to serving Penn Fruit at the platform in Camden were included in the computation.\u201d (Finding of Fact No. 110). In Finding of Fact No. 113, the District Court found that \u201cThe difference in minimum selling price between Pennsylvania and New Jersey was 21.8%.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">On this appeal, Pennbrook contends that \u201cThe cost studies presented at trial by Sealtest were invalid because, in computing its average cost of selling milk to its wholesale milk customers in the Delaware Valley, it improperly lumped both large and small retail store customers, and various institutional customers, including restaurants, hospitals, schools and vending machines.\u201d It cites in support of its contention, United States v. Borden Company, et al., 370 U.S. 460, 82 S.Ct. 1309, 8 L.Ed.2d 627 (1962), and American Motors Corporation v. Federal Trade Commission, 384 F.2d 247 (6 Cir. 1967), cert. den. 390 U.S. 1012, 88 S.Ct. 1260, 20 L.Ed.2d 164 (1968). These cases, however, afford no nourishment to Pennbrook\u2019s stated contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">As the District Court stated in its Opinion at page 763, of 287 F.Supp:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-16\">\u201cSealtest\u2019s cost justification study was based upon a comparison of its costs to serve Penn Fruit at Camden and Clayton and its costs incurred in serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>ing its Pennsylvania retail store customers as a group. * * * Such a cost study met the requirements set forth in United States v. Borden Co. * * * as the class of Sealtest\u2019s Pennsylvania retail customers as a group reflects the \u2018uniformity and selfsameness\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s cost of doing business with customers in that group.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The testimony established that the sales and distribution methods pursued by both Sealtest and Pennbrook (except as to platform sales) were uniform.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">What has been said makes it unnecessary for us to reach the second ground assigned, by the District Court for its holding in favor of Sealtest, viz. that \u201cThe prices charged by Sealtest and paid by Penn Fruit were established in good faith to meet competition. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Anx2\">For the reasons stated, the Order of the District Court entering Judgment in favor of the defendant will be affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-10\">. \u00a7 2(a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-11\">\u201c(a) * * * it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce * * *, either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, * * * where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them: <em>Provided, </em>That nothing herein contained shall prevent differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\">.
