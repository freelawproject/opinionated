The convictions of their codefendants are not contested on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The count charging the violation of Section 2314 alleged that defendants made purchases in Burlington, Vermont with a falsely made and forged Travelers Express money order drawn on a California bank, thereby causing the money order to pass in interstate commerce. The conspiracy count alleged various instances in which falsely made and forged Travelers Express money orders, drawn on the California bank, had been presented at stores in Vermont in return for goods and money.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The indictment also contained a third count charging appellants with possessing a sawed-off shotgun which had not been registered with the Secretary of the Treasury, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5841, 5851 (1964). Appellants were convicted on this count but the count was subsequently dismissed upon the authority of Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Appellants\u2019 main contention is that they were prejudiced by the presentation at trial, over objection, of numerous guns, of testimony relating to the guns and of testimony concerning two robberies. They argue that the atmosphere thus created was inappropriate to the charges of causing and conspiring to cause forged securities to pass in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">During oral argument it was alleged that a number of guns were produced, though not marked in evidence, and were left on a table in view of the jury throughout the trial. While this may have happened, it does not appear that any objection was made to the exhibition of the guns and an examination of the record fails to find support for the contention that there was, in fact, such an exhibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">It appears that three guns were admitted into evidence as \u201cfruits\u201d of the crime, i. e., as having been purchased in Vermont with the forged securities stolen from a store in Oregon. This evidence was admissible as tending to establish the conspiracy charged and as showing the interstate character of defendants\u2019 crime. See United States v. Johnson, 254 F.2d 175 (2d Cir.), cert. dismissed, 357 U.S. 933, 78 S.Ct. 1378, 2 L.Ed.2d 1369 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">The testimony concerning the thefts of the money orders was relevant in proving that they were subsequently falsely made and forged.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
