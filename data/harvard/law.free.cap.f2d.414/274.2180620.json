Accordingly, we have directed the clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties of this fact in writing. See Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court and Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-22\">In his <em>pro se </em>complaint, Frederick W. Copeland seeks to enjoin the execution of a state court\u2019s writ of assistance that ordered him ejected from certain real property in favor of the mortgagee, First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Lake County, a Corporation, et al. He also seems to complain of the procedure by which he was at one time adjudged incompetent. Beyond vague references to the equal protection and due process clauses, the complaint states no bases for federal jurisdiction or any cognizable grounds upon which the relief sought might be granted. The district court properly dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-23\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
