They are not contradicted by Phillips in his response.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-15\">The undisputed facts show there was no violation of Phillips\u2019 right to counsel, or any other constitutional right, by prison officials. No litigation involving Phillips appears to have been pending when he requested to write for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-16\">The order of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
