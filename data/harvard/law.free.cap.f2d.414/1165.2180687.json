Code \u00a7 502 (1967). He claims that the trial judge committed error in giving a missing witness instruction to the jury. We agree it was error, but on the facts of this case we think it was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">The grand jury indicted appellant for assault with intent to commit robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon. The Government\u2019s version of the facts, as adduced by its witnesses, was that appellant and a woman came to the apartment of a Mrs. Wilson late one night and demanded that she give appellant $25.00. When she refused, appellant picked up a shotgun which Mrs. Wilson kept on a table in her apartment and pointed it at her. Mrs. Wilson then went next door to ask a neighbor to lend her the money. The neighbor came out with a gun, scuffled with appellant, and then shot him. The police were called and appellant was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">Appellant\u2019s version was that he and a man named Cliff were at a bar when they met a girl who asked appellant to walk her home. They left, leaving Cliff behind. While they were walking the girl offered to have sexual relations with appellant for $10.00. The girl took appellant to the apartment of Mrs. Wilson. There the girl refused to go ahead with the bargain and refused to return the money. Appellant demanded his money back, and then saw the shotgun. He picked it up, intending to keep it as collateral if the money was not returned. He never pointed the shotgun at anybody. As he walked out the door, Mrs. Wilson got her neighbor who came out with a gun. The neighbor, becoming excited at seeing appellant with the shotgun, shot appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">After the evidence the judge asked if there were any special requests for instructions. Appellant\u2019s counsel requested that the jury be instructed that, since the Government failed to bring in the girl who was with appellant (the girl had given her name to the police when they arrived at the apartment), the jury could infer that the testimony of the girl would have been detrimental to the Government\u2019s version. However, both the Government and appellant had tried, unsuccessfully, to locate the girl, and the judge refused to give such a missing witness instruction against the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">After the colloquy about the girl, the judge, on his own, asked: \u201cHowever, where is Cliff?\u201d Appellant answered that Cliff was at work. The judge then stated that he \u201cwondered\u201d whether the United States Attorney \u201cisn\u2019t going to ask for that missing-witness instruction\u201d as to Cliff. The United States Attorney did request such an instruction and the judge, over appellant\u2019s objection, charged the jury that since appellant had not brought in Cliff to testify the jury could infer that Cliff\u2019s testimony would be adverse to appellant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-12\">After deliberation, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of assault with intent to commit robbery and guilty of assault with a dangerous weapon. This appeal followed, in which appellant assigned as error the missing witness instruction given regarding Cliff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-14\">In 1894 the Supreme Court stated the general principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-15\">\u201c* * * The rule even in criminal cases is that if a party has it peculiarly within his power to produce witr nesses whose testimony would elucidate the transaction, the fact that he does not do it creates the presumption that the testimony, if produced, would be unfavorable. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1222-16\">Graves v. United States, 150 U.S. 118, 121, 14 S.Ct. 40, 41, 37 L.Ed. 1021. The factor at issue here is the requirement that the witness be \u201cpeculiarly available\u201d to the party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>As long ago as 1923, this court pointed out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-5\">\u201cThe general rule is that no such inference may be drawn by a jury because a party fails to call as a witness one who is in a legal sense a stranger to him and is equally available to the other side. * <em>* </em>*\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">Egan v. United States, 52 App.D.C. 384, 396, 287 F. 958, 970 (1923) (quoting from state cases). And we have found error in the giving of such an instruction where the witness was equally available to both sides. <em>See Egan, supra; Bi</em>lleci v. United States, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 278-279, 184 F.2d 394, 398-399, 24 A.L.R.2d 881 (1950).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">Thus before a missing witness instruction can be given against a defendant there must be a showing that the witness was not available to be subpoenaed by the Government. In the recent case of Wynn v. United States, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 60, 64-65 n. 23, 397 F.2d 621, 625-626 n. 23 (1967), we reiterated this requirement, noting there the absence of certain critical facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-8\">\u201cAmong the circumstances which do not appear are the extent of appellant\u2019s knowledge of the whereabouts of the witnesses at the time of trial; their then physical amenability to subpoena; and, on the other hand, the Government\u2019s opportunities to itself call them after learning of their identity, either before or during trial. * * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1223-15\">The trial judge should make an inquiry on this point before giving the instruction. <em>See </em>Stewart v. United States, U.S.App.D.C. (No. 20,983, decided February 10, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-16\">In this case there is no indication that the witness was available to appellant but not to the Government. The Government did not even appear to be pursuing the matter until the trial judge suggested that he would be amenable to a request by the Government.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the judge asked appellant where the witness was, appellant answered, \u201cHe\u2019s at work, Your Honor.\u201d The judge accepted this answer, pointing out to appellant, \u201cHe\u2019s at work, yes; so you know where he is.\u201d The judge then used this information to infer that the witness was available to appellant. However, it is clear that if appellant\u2019s statement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>true, the witness was equally available to the Government. In the absence of a showing to the contrary, it was error to have given the missing witness instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">The question remains whether the error requires reversal. The fact that the instruction was not only objected to below, but was actually invited by the trial court, militates in favor of a new trial. However, while the question is a close one in view of all the circumstances, we think the error was harmless. Cliff\u2019s testimony was relevant, if at all, only to the counts charging an intent to rob, and appellant was acquitted on these counts. The instruction thus served at most to cast doubt on appellant\u2019s general credibility. In a case where the defendant\u2019s credibility is crucial, we could not ignore that consequence. But it is extremely unlikely that even without the missing witness instruction a jury would credit appellant\u2019s story, contradicted by two witnesses, that he picked up Mrs. Wilson\u2019s gun only as collateral for a debt. Accordingly, we find no real possibility of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">. The full instruction was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-8\">\u201cThere has been testimony with respect to a person by the name of Cliff. In that connection, if a witness who could have given material testimony on an issue in this case was peculiarly available to one party and was not called by that party, and his absence has not been sufficiently accounted for or explained, then you may, if you deem it appropriate, infer that the testimony of the witness would have been unfavorable to the party which failed to call him.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1222-18\">. Appellant also argues that the judge erred by using the phrase \u201ca witness who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>eould have given material testimony on an issue in this case\u201d rather than the phrase \u201celucidate the transaction.\u201d We think the distinction insignificant. However phrased, the requirement is that the witness be an important part of the party\u2019s case, that his testimony be noncumulative, and that it be superior to other testimony already given on the matter. Morton v. United States, 79 U.S.App.D.C. 329, 332 n. 11, 147 F.2d 28, 31 n. 11, cert. denied, 324 U.S. 875, 65 S.Ct. 1015, 89 L.Ed. 1428 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-10\">Further, of course:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-11\">\u201cwhere it cannot reasonably be supposed or inferred that the missing witness would have supported the defendant\u2019s account, even if true, we do not think there is any legitimate basis for comment on defendant\u2019s failure to call the missing witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1223-12\">Pennewell v. United States, 122 U.S.App.D.C. 332, 333, 353 F.2d 870, 871 (1965). (In <em>Pennewell </em>the defendant\u2019s story was that the missing witness, not defendant, had committed the crime.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1223-17\">. We do not have in this ease the issue whether, even where the witness is physically available to both sides, the presumption attaches and the instruction can be given nonetheless because the party is in a special relation to the witness and the witness could be expected to be hostile to the other party. <em>See </em>Richards v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 197, 275 F.2d 655, cert. denied, 363 U.S. 815, 80 S.Ct. 1253, 4 L.Ed.2d 1155 (1960). Here there is no claim that the witness was in a special relationship (such as employer-employee) to appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1223-20\">. Where the propriety of an instruction is far from clear, the action of a judge in suggesting that one be requested is unsound. In Egan v. United States, 52 App.D.C. 384, 395-396, 287 F. 958, 969-970 (1923), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-21\">\u201c * * * We think it was erroneous for the court to call attention to the absence of Kramer and Adams, inasmuch as their absence had not been suggested, either by the district attorney or by counsel for the defendant. * * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
