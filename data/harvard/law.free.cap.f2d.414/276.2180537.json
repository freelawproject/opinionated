App. \u00a7 462(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-20\">Defendant contends that he should have been permitted to offer certain documentary evidence at the sentencing hearing, and to call witnesses, which might have mitigated the extent of the sentence, and that he was deprived of the right to correct erroneous statements in the presentencing report.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-21\">The plea of guilty was entered on October 2, 1968 and at the request of defendant\u2019s counsel, sentencing was deferred until October 16, 1968. At that time, defendant called two witnesses on his behalf. He did not attempt to call any additional witnesses, nor did he indicate that he desired to present any additional information to the court either from the witnesses who were present or from anyone else. If, as defendant\u2019s brief argues, evidence in mitigation of punishment was presented at the sentencing hearing \u201cin a brief and disjointed fashion\u201d and and without an \u201cintegrated and marshaled presentation,\u201d it was not because of any ruling by the district judge, but because no additional evidence was offered to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-22\">Defendant has appended to his brief so-called \u201cExhibits\u201d which were never presented to the district judge. We need not decide, therefore, whether they would have been relevant in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-23\">The district judge made the presen-tencing report available to defendant\u2019s counsel, who concurred in the judge\u2019s statement that he considered the report \u201cfavorable in all respects\u201d to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-24\">The record shows that defendant had full opportunity to present whatever facts he thought useful at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-25\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
