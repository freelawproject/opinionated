The appellant is serving a life sentence in the Kentucky State Penitentiary on conviction in the Butler County Circuit Court of Willful Murder. The district judge denied the petition without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">The sole question before the District Court, and likewise now before us, is whether the appellant\u2019s federal constitutional rights were violated by reason of the fact that a deputy sheriff who testified against hi'm at the trial was placed in charge of the jury during the progress of the trial and the deliberations of the jury. He claims that the deputy had an opportunity to improperly influence the jury and cites Turner v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 466, 85 S.Ct. 546, 13 L.Ed.2d 424, in support of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">The district judge found,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-17\">\u201cThere is no allegation that it (the deputy\u2019s testimony) played a key role in the case, or that the petitioner\u2019s fate was in any degree dependent upon the amount of confidence placed in Card-well (the deputy) by the jurors or upon the credibility which they attached to his testimony. Nor is there any allegation of the type of fraternization and the intimate relationship that existed in <em>Turner. </em>This petition goes no further than to state that \u2018a deputy sheriff who was a witness for the Commonwealth (was permitted) to act as custodian of the jury.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-18\">We agree wi'th the district judge that-these allegations are not sufficient \u2022 to bring the case within the decision announced in <em>Turner, </em>supra, and they do not show a violation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Bowles v. State of Texas, 366 F.2d 734, 736, (C.A. 5); Crawford v. Beto, 385 F.2d 156, 157, (C.A. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-19\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed without prejudice to the right of the appellant to renew his petition for a writ of habeas corpus upon such allegations of fact as will bring it within the decision of Turner v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 466, 85 S.Ct. 546, 13 L.Ed.2d 424, if indeed, such facts do exist.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
