The facts as presented to this court are not in controversy and present a somewhat novel and, indeed, refreshing background for judicial consideration. The legal issue springs from the receipt by taxpayers in 1963 of $10,000 in cash and $867 in merchandise as the result of placing first in a national contest sponsored by Better Homes and Gardens Magazine and announced as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the \u201c1962 Home Improvement Contest.\u201d Taxpayers concede the amounts so received constitute a merit prize and were thus income<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but assert the right to deduct as costs attributable to the production of the income the sum of $9,816.23 expended in accomplishing the successful home improvement. Their basic contention is that the expenditures made <em>proy duced </em>the prize and, in view of the continued and professional<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> activity of the Paxman family in matters concerned with family recreational pursuits, that consequently the subject construction costs of the winning family recreational room should fall within the confines of \u201cordinary and necessary expenses\u201d as that phrase is contained in the provisions of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162 or 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 212. Although the unusual and non-repetitive nature of taxpayers\u2019 prize income lends sympathetic appeal to their plea for unusual and non-repetitive tax consideration, the undisputed facts clearly support the decision of the Tax Court that the costs of construction of the subject room are simply a capital outlay.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">In August of 1960, utilizing various fixtures and funishings previously collected by them, taxpayers commenced the construction in the attic of their residence of a decorative recreation room in the style of a Victorian ice cream parlor. The project was completed in 1962 at which time taxpayers entered the room in Better Homes and Gardens Magazine \u201c1962 Home Improvement Contest.\u201d The contest was originally announced in the magazine\u2019s January 1962 issue. Judging of the contest was -to be in part based upon the usefulness and satisfaction of the improvement to the family or individual involved. Taxpayers in submitting their final entry form stated as the reason for the improvement that \u201cwith seven children needing more bedroom space, play space and storage space, the large unfinished high-peaked attic of our Victorian house seemed to provide the ideal space for expansion.\u201d It is obvious that the Paxmans, at the inception of the project, considered the construction of the recreation room as a home improvement. The subsequent incentive of the contest and its result did not change the tax nature of the expenditures. Therefore, the award which resulted from their entry in the contest was legally prize income and nothing else. It is a well-settled principle that every deduction must be specifically provided for by statute, Deputy v. DuPont, 308 U.S. 488, 60 S.Ct. 363, 84 L.Ed. 416; Calvin v. United States, 10 Cir., 354 F.2d 202; United States v. Akin, 10 Cir., 248 F.2d 742, and taxpayers\u2019 attempt to bring the claimed deduction within the coverage of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 212 must fail. The expenditures in question clearly constituted amounts paid out for the permanent improvement of taxpayers\u2019 residence within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 263 which by its ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>plicit terms denies the claimed deduction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">[I] t may be said in general terms that an expenditure should be treated as one in the nature of a capital outlay if it brings about the acquisition of an asset having a period of useful life in excess of one year or if it secures a like advantage to the taxpayer which has a life of more than one year. * * * Akin, <em>supra, </em>at 744.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">It is evident that the expenditures increased the value of taxpayers\u2019 home, provided them with a room in which they and their family could derive satisfaction and enjoyment for a number of years, and accordingly were expenditures in the nature of a capital outlay.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-5\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 74.

This characterization is supported by the record. Although Mr. Paxman is a practicing lawyer by occupation he has written several published books on family \u201cfun\u201d; members of the Paxman family have won merit-type prizes in the same field on three other occasions; and taxpayers frequently lecture on related subjects. The Commissioner allowed special depreciation on the room on the premise that it served to further income-producing endeavors to the extent of 25 percent of its use and was dedicated to family use 75 percent of the time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b323-14\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 263 in its pertinent part provides \u201c[n]o deduction shall be allowed for \u2014 -(1) Any amount paid out for new buildings or for permanent improvements or betterments made to increase the value of any property or estate.\u201d <em>See also </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.263(a)-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
