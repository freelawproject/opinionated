The employee, Joseph Sleeman, had sued the railroad under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51-60 (1964), and recovered a judgment. Sleeman v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R. R., 290 F.Supp. 817 (W.D.Mich.1968), <em>aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>414 F.2d 305 (6th Cir. 1969). The court in that case held that negligent design in lighting of the railroad\u2019s parking lot, where the accident occurred, played some part in causing this accident. The railroad in this action sought contribution against the third-party defendants, contending that they are joint tortfeasors. The jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants, finding no cause for action. The jury also answered special questions propounded to it by the District Judge. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>answered \u201cYes\u201d to a question as to whether the defendant truck driver had been negligent \u2014 but answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question as to whether such negligence had been a proximate cause of Sleeman\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">On this appeal appellant C &amp; O\u2019s primary issue, as we see the matter, is whether the jury\u2019s answer holding the driver\u2019s negligence not to be a proximate cause of the accident was against the great weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The facts are set out in detail both in Sleeman v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R.R., 414 F.2d 305 (6th Cir. 1969), and in the District Judge\u2019s opinions in these two cases, Sleeman v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R. R., 290 F.Supp. 817 (W.D.Mich.1968); Sleeman v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R. R., 290 F.Supp. 830 (W.D.Mich.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">There was evidence from which the jury could have concluded that Sleeman was guilty of contributory negligence and that the C &amp; O parking lot was negligently designed and lighted\u2014 or both. Sleeman testified that he had seen the truck coming and had continued walking rapidly across the driveway in the driving rain without looking again, after concluding that the truck would pass behind him. This evidence alone would justify a jury verdict of no cause for action against defendants, since contributory negligence of the plaintiff is a valid defense under Michigan law. <em>See, e. g., </em>Rouse v. Michigan United Ry., 158 Mich. 109, 122 N.W. 532 (1909); Worthington Corp v. Lease Management, Inc., 352 F.2d 24 (6th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 937, 86 S.Ct. 1068, 15 L.Ed.2d 854 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Appellant\u2019s complaint, however, is not based on the ultimate verdict. It is addressed to the claimed conflict between the special question findings that 1) defendant truck driver was negligent, and that 2) such negligence was not a proximate cause of Sleeman's injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Among other things, the District Judge instructed the jury that it had the right to determine from the total evidence in the case whether or not there was negligence in the condition or speed of defendants\u2019 truck at the date and time and under the total circumstances of this case. The jury could have concluded that there was some neglect on defendants\u2019 part in relation to one or more of these factors. But when Slee-man, dressed in\\dark clothing, admittedly walked rapidly into the path of the vehicle, with his face turned away in the driving rain, and without ever looking up again, the jury could have concluded that the negligence found was not a proximate cause of Sleeman\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Under Michigan law proximate negligence is a jury question unless the great weight of evidence compels a contrary conclusion with which \u201creasonable minds could not differ.\u201d McKinney v. Yelavich, 352 Mich. 687, 692, 90 N.W.2d 883 (1958); Serratoni v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R. R., 333 F.2d 621 (6th Cir. 1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 960, 85 S.Ct. 648, 13 L.Ed.2d 555 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">We cannot conclude that reasonable minds could not have arrived at the jury\u2019s answers to the special questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">Further, in this appeal from a jury verdict in a federal diversity case, federal review standards govern:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-13\">\u201cWhere there is a view of the case that makes the jury\u2019s answers to special interrogatories consistent, they must be resolved that way. For a search for one possible view of the case which will make the jury\u2019s finding inconsistent results in a collision with the Seventh Amendment. Arnold v. Panhandle &amp; S. F. R. Co., 353 U.S. 360, 77 S.Ct. 840, 1 L.Ed.2d 889. <em>Cf. </em>Dick v. New York Life Ins. Co., 359 U.S. 437, 446, 79 S.Ct. 921, 3 L.Ed.2d 935. Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Ellerman Lines, Ltd., 369 U.S. 355, 364, 82 S.Ct. 780, 786, 7 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">As to other appellate issues, we find no reversible error. Specifically, we find no abuse of judicial discretion in the judge\u2019s orders denying a belated mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>tion for a jury trial in the Sleeman case and in granting separate trial of the third-party action.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
