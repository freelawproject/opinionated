Seeking to recover damages on account of Jan\u2019s injury, Jack Killian, individually and on behalf of Jan (his minor daughter), filed suit against Eyerly Aircraft Company, the manufacturer of the ride which is known as a Rock-O-Plane,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and against Jack Eyerly, the company\u2019s president. Service upon Eyerly Aircraft Company which is an Oregon corporation, and upon Jack Eyerly individually was accomplished through the Texas \u201cLong Arm\u201d statute. Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat. art. 2031b (1964).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Eyerly Aircraft and Jack Eyerly filed motions to dismiss and quash service. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The motion was overruled as to the company and sustained as to Jack Eyerly. Eyerly Aircraft now appeals. from that interlocutory order of the trial court under the aegis of 28 U.S.C.A. 1292(b) (1966), contending that its contacts with Texas were insufficient to support in personam jurisdiction. The substantive issues before us, therefore, are: (1) whether Eyerly Aircraft had sufficient contacts with the State of Texas to support in personam jurisdiction against a constitutional attack, i.e., whether the corporation had the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with Texas necessary in order for the maintenance of the suit not to offend due process; and (2) whether, assuming that the assertion of jurisdiction is constitutionally permissible, the Texas \u201cLong Arm\u201d statute was intended to reach as far as the controversy at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The Rock-O-Plane in question was manufactured by Eyerly Aircraft in Oregon approximately twenty years ago, and from there this ride indirectly peregrinated to Texas through interstate commerce. In 1949 the Rock-O-Plane was sold and shipped to an amusement company in Chicago. Then in 1964 that company sold the ride to William D. Stanley Shows, Inc., in Fargo, North Dakota. During the years intervening between that sale and the injury to Jan Killian in Dallas, this ride toured numerous states with Stanley Shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">Although there is nothing in the record to indicate that Eyerly Aircraft ever saw the ride after it was shipped to Chicago, the record does clearly reflect that Eyerly Aircraft contemplated that the ride would ambulate from state to state throughout the nation and that it would eventually tour Texas.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>over, Eyerly Aircraft through other transactions had made numerous and repeated contacts with Texas and has purposefully availed itself of the protections of her laws. Included in this enumeration of contacts with Texas are the following: (1) sales and deliveries of amusement devices and parts directly into the state; (2) the extension of credit in the state; (3) the retention of liens on items sold; (4) the filing of such liens with state and county authorities; (5) the servicing of machines in the state; and (6) the solicitation of business in the state.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These contacts with Texas were neither occasional nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>sporadic \u2014 they were both continuous and substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Our first concern is whether the assertion of Texas \u201cLong Arm\u201d jurisdiction in this diversity case was consistent with due process. The scope of permissible state jurisdiction over the person of foreign corporations has broadened considerably in the last twenty-five years, but the power of states and federal courts sitting in diversity cases over foreign corporations still has constitutional limits. Hanson v. Denckla, 1958, 357 U.S. 235, 251, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283, 1296. The legal evolution of subjecting foreign corporations to forum process reflects a rejection of the primeval requirement of forum corporeality expressed in Pennoyer v. Neff, 1878, 95 U.S. 714, 24 L.Ed. 565, and an adoption of the principle that a foreign corporation is subject to forum tentacles whenever the corporation has such \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with the forum state \u201cthat the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u201d International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 1945, 326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 158, 90 L.Ed. 95, 102; McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., 1957, 355 U.S. 220, 222, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223, 225-226. What \u201cis essential in each case [is] that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus involving the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d Hanson v. Denckla, <em>supra, </em>235 U.S. at 253, 78 S.Ct. at 1240, 2 L.Ed.2d at 1298. See Annot., 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1958); Annot., 19 A.L.R.3d 13 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Here the defendant corporation has purposefully conducted business activities in Texas, but the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, which sounds in tort, did not arise out of those contacts. Eyerly Aircraft not only actively solicited business in Texas, but it also sold and serviced its products in the state. If the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action arose out of these contacts, e.g. if the child\u2019s injury had resulted from a defect in a ride shipped directly into Texas by Eyerly Aircraft, due process would unquestionably be satisfied. Hardy v. ReKab, Inc., D.Md. 1967, 266 F.Supp. 508; Farmer v. Ferris, N.C. 1963, 260 N.C. 619, 133 S.E.2d 492; see International Shoe Corp. v. Washington, <em>supra. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, however, arises out of an alleged defect in a Rock-O-Plane which the defendant corporation had neither sold nor serviced in Texas. Eyerly Aircraft manufactured the ride in Oregon and has had no contact with the ride since introducing it into interstate commerce by selling it to a Chicago amusement show some twenty years ago. The question in this case, therefore, is whether the unrelated business contacts plus the introduction of the ride into interstate commerce are sufficient to support Texas in personam jurisdiction over Eyerly Aircraft. We hold that these contacts are sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">Where a foreign corporation does substantial business within a state, that state may assert in personam jurisdiction over the corporation to enforce a cause of action arising out of a tort committed in part within its boundaries. Smyth v. Twin State Improvement Corp., Vt. 1951, 116 Vt. 569, 80 A.2d 664, 25 A.L.R.2d 1193. Thus where a corporation with substantial contacts within state X ships into that state a product which it has manufactured in state Y and an injury occurs in state X because of an alleged defect in the product, the corporation may constitutionally be called upon to defend a products liability suit brought in state X where the injury occurred. Deveny v. Rheem Mfg. Co., 2 Cir. 1963, 319 F.2d 124; Shealy v. Challenger Mfg. Co., 4 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 102; cf. Carter v. American Bus Lines, Inc., D.Neb. 1959, 169 F.Supp. 460. This result also obtains where the manufacturer has elected to distribute his wares through independent wholesalers instead of through its own corporate apparatus so that it is only very indirectly responsible for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>product reaching the injured consumer. Florio v. Powder Power Tool Corp., 3 Cir.1957, 248 F.2d 367; Etzler v. Dille and McGuire Mfg. Co., W.D. Va. 1965, 249 F.Supp. 1. The present trend is to take the next logical step and hold that a corporation is answerable where it introduces its product into the stream of interstate commerce if it had reason to know or expect that its product would be brought into the state where the injury occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">\u201cWhere a defendant does business of such a volume, or with such a pattern of product distribution, that he should reasonably anticipate that his product may be ultimately used in any state, he has done the act required for the exercise of jurisdiction by the state where the injured user resides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">\u201cWhen a manufacturer voluntarily chooses to sell his product in a way in which it will be resold from dealer to dealer, transferred from hand to hand and transported from state to state, he cannot reasonably claim that he is surprised at being held to answer in <em>any </em>state for the damage the product causes. Nor can he deny the substantial interest of the injured person\u2019s state in providing a convenient forum for its citizens.\u201d Keckler v. Brookwood Country Club, N.D. Ill.1965, 248 F.Supp. 645, 648-649.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">See also Harford v. Smith, N.D.W.Va.1966, 257 F.Supp. 578; Jackson v. National Linen Service Corp., W.D.Va.1965, 248 F.Supp. 962; Anderson v. Penncraft Tool Co., N.D .Ill. 1961, 200 F.Supp. 145; contra O\u2019Brien v. Comstock Foods, Inc., 1963, 123 Vt. 461, 194 A.2d 568; see Yules v. General Motors Corp., D.Mont. 297 F.Supp. 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The primogenial ease for subjecting a non-resident corporation to forum process where the corporation has shipped its product into the forum state indirectly through the stream of interstate commerce is Gray v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., 1961, 22 Ill.2d 432, 176 N.E.2d 761. In Gray the plaintiff was injured in Illinois when a water heater exploded because of a defective valve. Service of process was sustained against the defendant foreign corporation which manufactured the valve even though the corporation\u2019s only contact with Illinois was very indirect. The defendant corporation manufactured the defective valve in Ohio and, subsequently, that valve was incorporated into a hot water heater in Pennsylvania. That heater was then sold in the course of commerce through which it eventually reached Illinois. On these facts the Supreme Court of Illinois found that the defendant corporation had sufficient contacts with Illinois to support in per-sonam jurisdiction without due process being offended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">\u201cIn the case at bar defendant does not claim that the present use of its product in Illinois is an isolated instance. While the record does not disclose the volume of Titan\u2019s business or the territory in which appliances incorporating its valves are marketed, it is a reasonable inference that its commercial transactions, like those of other manufacturers, result in substantial use and consumption in this State. To the extent that its business may be directly affected by transactions occurring here it enjoys benefits from the laws of this State * * * and from the protection which our law has given to the marketing of hot water heaters containing its valves. Where the alleged liability arises, as in this case, from the manufacture of products presumably sold in contemplation of use here, it should not matter that the purchase was made from an independent middleman or that someone other than the defendant shipped the product into this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">With the increasing specialization of commercial activity and the growing interdependence of business enterprises it is seldom that a manufacturer deals directly with consumers in other States. The fact that the benefit he derives from its laws is an indirect one, however, does not make it any the less essential to the conduct of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>his business; and it is not unreasonable, where a cause of action arises from alleged defects in his product to say that use of such products in the ordinary course of commerce is sufficient contact with this State to justify a requirement that he defend here.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 176 N.E.2d at 766.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In the case <em>sub judice </em>Eyerly Aircraft had far more substantial contacts with the state where its product allegedly caused injury than did the defendant corporation in <em>Gray. </em>Here Eyerly through the years had activated continuous and substantial business relations directly with Texas concerns, whereas in <em>Gray </em>there was no evidence that the defendant corporation had any contacts with Illinois other than the indirect shipment of the single valve through interstate commerce into the state. Moreover, Eyerly did not intend for its products to be sedentary and it had reason to know that its rides would not come to a permanent rest at the domicile of its original purchaser. The carnivals which purchase Eyerly\u2019s rides frequently do not have fixed loci and are often fun and thrill dispensing nomads which itin-erate from place to place. Given the multistate kinetics of its products and its engagement in world-wide trade, we assert, without chauvinistic overtones, that Eyerly Aircraft should expect that the stream of interstate commerce would bring its products to Texas. We therefore hold that Eyerly Aircraft\u2019s contacts with Texas were substantial enough to constitutionally support Texas\u2019 assertion of \u201cLong Arm\u201d in personam jurisdiction over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">By basing our holding on the dual grounds that Eyerly Aircraft had substantial contacts in Texas apart from the alleged commission of a tort within the state and that it introduced this Rock-O-Plane into interstate commerce with reason to know that the ride would probably eventually nomadize through the state, we do not mean to imply that the commission of a single tort without further contacts in the state would not be sufficient to satisfy due process. Where a nonresident corporation engages in a single isolated transaction in a state and a tort claim arises out of that activity, the state may assert jurisdiction over the non-resident corporation without contravening due process. Elkhart Engineering Corp. v. Dornier Werke, 5 Cir. 1965, 343 F.2d 861; Dtzler v. Dille and McGuire Mfg. Co., W.D. Va. 1965, 249 F.Supp. 1; see Hutchinson v. Boyd and Sons Press Sales, Inc., D. Minn. 1960, 188 F.Supp. 876. This position was given a measure of Supreme Court support in Justice Goldberg\u2019s opinion in chambers in Ro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>senblatt v. American Cyanamid Co., 1965, 86 S.Ct. 1, 15 L.Ed.2d 39, 43:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201cThe logic of this Court\u2019s decisions in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95, [161 A.L.R. 1057] and McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223, supports the validity of state \u2018long arm\u2019 statutes such as the one involved here which base in personam jurisdiction upon commission of a \u2018tortious act\u2019 in the forum State. Since those decisions a large number of States have enacted statutes similar to the one here. In cases under these statutes in state and federal courts, jurisdiction on the basis of a single tort has been uniformly upheld.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">\u201cIndeed, the constitutionality of this assertion of jurisdiction today, could only be doubted by those determined to oppose the clear trend of the decisions. This situation is exactly that of the nonresident-motorist statutes, which were long ago upheld, except that the highways are not directly involved. It is now clear, if it was ever in doubt, that the nonresident-motorist cases were not really based on \u2018consent\u2019 but on the interest of the forum State and the fairness of trial there to the defendant.\u201d Currie, The Growth of the Long Arm, 1963 U. Ill. Law Forum 515,540.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">Although we recognize that there is strong authority for the single tort theory, we need not and do not decide how far this principle will extend and whether it would encompass the case <em>sub judiced.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">Having determined that Eyerly Aircraft had sufficient contacts with Texas to satisfy due process, we must now take the specific measurements of the Texas \u201cLong Arm\u201d statute to see if its arm reaches as far as the Constitution permits in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have little difficulty in finding the statutory reach even though the <em>Erie </em>directives from the Texas courts<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> are lacking in delineation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>incandescence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The federal courts in diversity cases, however, have on several occasions engaged in rational divination on this question and have always held that article 2031b should be given as broad a reach as due process will permit any \u201cLong Arm\u201d statute to be given.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In Atwood Hatcheries v. Heisdorf &amp; Nelson Farms, 5 Cir. 1966, 357 F.2d 847, 852, this Court per Chief Judge Brown wrote: \u201cwe now declare what was more hesitatingly suggested in Lone Star and even more guardedly assumed in Jack Tar that \u2018the Texas purpose [in enacting article 2031b] was to exploit to the maximum the fullest permissible reach under federal constitutional restraints.\u2019\u201d See also Turner v. Jack Tar Grand Bahama, Ltd., 5 Cir. 965, 353 F.2d 954, 956; Lone Star Motor Import, Inc. v. Citroen Cars Corp., 5 Cir. 1961, 288 F.2d 69, 73; Barnes v. Irving Trust Co., S.D.Tex.1968, 290 F.Supp. 116, 117; Amco Transworld, Inc. v. M/V Bambi, S.D.Tex.1966, 257 F.Supp. 215, 216-217; cf. Trinity Steel Co., Inc. v. Modern Gas Sales &amp; Service Co., Tex.Civ.App. 1965, 392 S.W.2d 861 (writ ref\u2019d n. r. e.).

In construing a \u201cLong Arm\u201d statute containing a similar provision referring to a tort committed in whole or in part in the state, the court in Williams v. Vick Chemical Co., S.D. Iowa, 279 F.Supp. 833, 836, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ady-dedup-0\">\u201cThe Iowa law is clear that the manufacturer of a product which causes injury in Iowa has committed a tort in part in Iowa and that such contact is an act of doing business sufficient to confer the courts with jurisdiction over the defendant. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">See also Beetler v.

Hoover &amp; Son, Tex. 1967, 418 S.W.2d 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">We need not, however, rely solely on these general propositions. A Minnesota \u201cLong Arm\u201d statute, which is in all relevant aspects identical to the Texas statute,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> has been construed to apply in a products liability case where the defendant foreign corporation had less direct and substantial contacts with the forum state than did Eyerly Aircraft in this case. Ehlers v. United States Heating and Cooling Mfg. Corp., 1963, 267 Minn. 56, 124 N.W.2d 824. In the <em>Ehlers </em>case the plaintiff\u2019s building in Minnesota was destroyed by a fire allegedly caused by a defective boiler manufactured by the defendant foreign corporation. The boiler was manufactured in Ohio by the defendant corporation and was sold to a New York corporation. Subsequently, the boiler was sold and delivered by the New York company to an Illinois corporation, which in turn sold it to the Minnesota corporation which installed it in the plaintiff\u2019s building. The manufacturer had no contact with the boiler after it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>left the Ohio factory and had no separate dealings within the State of Minnesota. Upon these facts the Supreme Court of Minnesota found that the nonresident corporation had committed a tort \u201cin whole or in part in Minnesota\u201d, and that the \u201cLong Arm\u201d statute was therefore applicable. The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">\u201cThe issue for decision is whether the property damage here involved \u2014 if the result of negligent manufacture of the boiler \u2014 can, under the circumstances described, be considered a tort committed \u2018in whole or in part in Minnesota\u2019 so as to give jurisdiction over the manufacturer,, upon compliance with \u00a7 303.13 subd. 1(3), without offense to its Federal constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">We have previously held that the negligent manufacture of a product in a foreign state becomes a tort commit- ' ted \u2018in whole or in part in Minnesota\u2019 when personal injury occurs in Minnesota as a result of use of the product here. [Cases cited].\u201d 124 N.W.2d at 826.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">On the basis of a literal reading of the statutory language and the relevant ease authority, we have concluded that the Texas courts would hold that article 2031b encompasses the case <em>sub judice. </em>Accord, Hearne v. Dow-Badische Chemical Co., S.D. Tex. 1963, 224 F.Supp. 90; Hull v. Gamblin, D.C.Ct. App. 1967, 241 A.2d 739. We therefore hold that Eyerly Aircraft was subject to Texas \u201cLong Arm\u201d service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">Our final concern is Eyerly Aircraft\u2019s argument that the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings were insufficient to invoke the long arm of article 2031b. The appellant contends that the Supreme Court of Texas in McKanna v. Edgar, Tex. 1965, 388 S.W.2d 927, held that as a jurisdictional condition precedent to the application of article 2031b (3), the plaintiff must affirmatively <em>plead </em>that the defendant corporation does not maintain in Texas either (1) a regular place of business, or (2) a designated agent for service. McKanna v. Edgar clearly construed Article 2031b to require some affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>showing that these two conditions have been satisfied before \u201cLong Arm\u201d process via the Secretary of State may be used. Thus the Texas \u201cLong Arm\u201d statute under whose shelter the plaintiff wants to come is applicable only where these two short-arm methods of serving process are alleged or otherwise shown to be unavailable to him.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> McKanna v. Edgar may have required even more \u2014 it <em>may </em>have further held that the face of the pleadings must contain the allegations that the defendant corporation \u201cdoes not maintain a place of regular business in this State or a designated agent upon whom service may be made.\u201d 388 S.W.2d at 929. See Curry v. Dell Publishing Company, Tex.Civ.App.1969, 438 S.W.2d 887, 890; Firence Footwear Co. v. Campbell, Tex.Civ.App. 1967, 411 S.W.2d 636 (writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.):</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The record in the case at bar reflects that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint contains allegations that service of process was made \u201cunder V.A.T.S. 2031b upon the Secretary of State of the State of Texas and by serving JACK EYERLY, Individually, and on behalf of EYERLY AIRCRAFT CO., c/o Eyerly Aircraft Co., * * * \u201d, but the complaint does not allege Eyerly had no registered agent or regular place of business in Texas. Other parts of the record, however, do show affirmatively that \u201cEYERLY AIRCRAFT CO. never has appointed or authorized any agent to accept service of process for it in any action commenced in the State of Texas\u201d, and that \u201cEyerly Aircraft Co. does not within the State of Texas maintain any stock of goods or merchandise or have any warehouses, have any bank accounts, own or lease any property, real or personal, or any buildings, equipment or machinery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AUM\">Bypassing for the moment the Mc-Kanna v. Edgar problem, the allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint are clearly sufficient under the standards set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 8. In Conley v. Gibson, 1957, 355 U.S. 41, 47-48, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed. 80, 85-86, the Supreme Court gave us positive instructions to give a liberal construction to pleadings when passing upon their sufficiency under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">\u201c[T]he Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require a claimant to set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim. To the contrary, all the Rules require is \u2018a short and plain statement of the claim\u2019 that will give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff\u2019s claim is and the grounds upon which it rests. The illustrative forms appended to the Rules plainly demonstrate this. Such simplified \u2018notice pleading\u2019 is made possible by the liberal opportunity for discovery and the other pretrial procedures established by the Rules to disclose more precisely the basis of both claim and defense and to define more narrowly the disputed facts and issues. Following the simple guide of Rule 8(f) that \u2018all pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice,\u2019 we have no doubt that petitioners\u2019 complaint adequately set forth a claim and gave the respondents fair notice of its basis. The Federal Rules reject the approach that pleading is a game of skill in which one misstep by counsel may be decisive to the outcome and accept the principle that the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits. [Case cited].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">We now return to McKanna v. Edgar and the question whether that decision requires us to deviate from the Federal Rules and hold that plaintiff Killian\u2019s complaint was fatally incomplete. Assuming that McKanna v. Edgar did hold that the face of the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings must contain allegations regarding the absence of either a registered agent for process or a regular place of business in the state and that it is not enough that the necessary information appear without contradiction elsewhere in the record, the issue before us is the extent to which Erie binds us to the law as announced in that Texas decision. The answer is that <em>Erie </em>compels us to hold that a necessary prerequisite to the applicability of section 3 of article 2031b is that the record affirmatively show that the corporation being sued \u201cdoes not maintain a place of regular business in this State or a designated agent upon whom service may be made,\u201d but that <em>Erie </em>does not require us to say that this information must appear on the face of the pleadings. We hold that plaintiff Killian\u2019s complaint was sufficient to invoke article 2031b (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The <em>Erie </em>rationale for our result lies in the substantive-procedural dichotomy. The jurisdictional prerequisites to the applicability of Article 2031b are matters of state substantive law which under <em>Erie </em>we are bound to accept. We are, however, not bound to follow the state law regarding the way the substantive rights must be pled or shown since such matters are governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Hannah v. Plumer, 1965, 380 U.S. 460, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8. A federal court enforcing an obligation or right created by state law \u201cis bound to enforce the obligation [or right] as it finds it, but is not \u2018bound by the dubious and perhaps conflicting intimations on <em>elegantia juris </em>to be found in local decisions\u2019 and is not \u2018imprisoned by procedural niceties relating to amendment of pleadings.\u2019\u201d Kenney v. Trinidad Corporation, 5 Cir. 1965, 349 F.2d 832, 837, cert. den. 382 U.S. 1030, 86 S.Ct. 652, 15 L.Ed.2d 542, quoting in part from Levinson v.

Tyson 304 U.S. at 73-74, 58 S.Ct. at 819-820, 82 L.Ed. at 1191-1192, 114 A.L.R. 1487. That the York test was an attempt to effectuate these policies is demonstrated by the fact that the opinion framed the inquiry in terms of \u2018substantial\u2019 variations between state and federal litigation. 326 U.S. at 109, 65 S.Ct. at 1469, 89 L.Ed. at 2086, 160 A.L.R. 1231. Not only are nonsubstantial, or trivial, variations not likely to raise the sort of equal protection problems which troubled the Court in Erie; they are also unlikely to influence the choice of a forum. The \u2018outcome-determination\u2019 test therefore cannot be read without reference to the twin aims of the Erie rule: discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws.\u201d Hannah v.

Edgar requirements by merely adding a few words to his complaint. Likewise, the application of the federal rule would not cause an \u201cinequitable administration of the laws\u201d because plaintiff Killian could have easily complied with the Texas pleading rule if he had been litigating in the state courts. Under Hannah v.

Suppose a situation where a corporation, whose residence is in state X, commits a tort in state <em>X </em>and is sued for that tort in state Z. Unless the corporation had substantial contacts with state Z, the courts in state Z could not assert jurisdiction over the person of the foreign corporation. Turner v.

Eyerly Aircraft argues that these decisions were undermined by the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s decision in O\u2019Brien v. Lanpar Co., Tex.1966, 399 S.W.2d 340. Eyerly points out that the Texas court quoted with approval from a decision of the Supreme Court of Washington, Tyee Construction Co. v. Dulien Steel Products, Inc., 1963, 62 Wash.2d 106, 381 P.2d 245, 251, in which it was stated that jurisdiction over a foreign corporation could be entertained where the corporation had purposefully acted in the forum state and where the cause of action being asserted arose from such act. The suggested implication of this decision is that where, as in the case sub judice, the cause of action arose from a tort separate and apart from the corporation\u2019s other business activities in the state, Art. 2031b is inapplicable even though the contacts are sufficient to satisfy due process. We disagree with this reading of <em>O\u2019Brien. </em>This Texas decision has at least three material distinguishments from the case at bar. First, the Texas Supreme Court was concerned with the Illinois \u201cLong Arm\u201d statute and not with Art. 2031b. The Texas court made this very clear when it said : \u201cIt should be remembered, however, that it is the Illinois law and not the Texas law that is in point.\u201d 399 S.W.2d at 343. Second, when the Texas court referred to the Washington decision, it was discussing the due process limits on \u201cLong Arm\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>service of process and it was not speaking of any statutory limits. The third distinction goes to an important difference between the facts of this case and the situation described in the language of the Washington opinion. The requirement there imposed was that the cause of action being asserted must arise out of the foreign corporation\u2019s contacts with the state. The Washington court\u2019s implicit reference was to the situation discussed in footnote 7, <em>supra, </em>\u2014 the instance where a corporation, whose residence is in state X, is sued in state Y on a cause of action arising out of a tort committed in state Z. In contrast, the case <em>sub judice </em>concerns a corporation, whose residence is in state X, being sued in state Y for a tort committed in part in state Y. For this reason the Washington court\u2019s language has no constitutional or statutory relevance to the case at bar. A <em>fortiori </em>the Texas decision in <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>which is distinguishable on two other grounds, has no relevance here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b656-6\">.

It asserts that in tort actions the validity of statutes of this kind has been upheld only where the tortious conduct complained of was committed wholly within the state of the forum; and directs attention to a number of decisions in which jurisdiction was denied where such conduct occurred entirely outside the forum, even though the damage or injury which resulted therefrom occurred within the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">It is well settled that a manufacturer, regardless of privity of contract, is liable to an ultimate user of his product or to others who may reasonably be expected to be in the vicinity of its probable use for injuries arising from his negligence in the manufacture or containment of the product. Assuming that here defendant\u2019s conduct in containing the hy-drofluosilicic acid was negligent, the question remains whether such negligence constituted the commission of a tort in whole or in part within Minnesota so as to give jurisdiction to our courts under \u00a7 303.13, subd. 1(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A39\">* * * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Y\">While recognizing the merit of protecting rights of foreign corporations not doing business here, we feel that such considerations are outweighed by the general objective of our single-act statute, that is to permit a Minnesota citizen injured here by the wrongful act of a foreign corporation to seek recompense therefor in our courts. Beck v. Spind-ler, supra. Based upon such considerations and the well-established principle that the place of the wrong is the place where the legal injury occurs, we conclude that if the allegations of the complaint are established it would follow that defendant has committed a tort within the state, and hence under \u00a7 303.13, subd. 1(3), may be said to have been doing business here so as to be subject to our jurisdiction thereunder.\u201d 104 N.W.2d at 892, 894.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b658-5\">. These short-arm methods of service are set forth in Section 2 of Article 2031b:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEv\">\u201cWhen any foreign corporation, association, joint stock company, partnership, or non-resident natural person, though not required by any Statute of this State to designate or maintain an agent, shall engage in business in this State, in any action in which such corporation, joint stock company, association, partnership, or non-resident natural person is a party or is to be made a party arising out of such business, service may be made by serving a copy of the process with the person who, at the time of the service, is in charge of any business in which the defendant or defendants are engaged in this State, provided a copy of such process, together with notice of such service upon such person in charge of such business shall forthwith be sent to the defendant or to the defendants principal place of business by registered mail, return receipt requested.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
