The evidence against defendant was not strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-22\">In its case-in-chief, the government sought to prove a belligerent statement, allegedly made by defendant shortly before the offense, as bearing upon defendant\u2019s state of mind. The proof was excluded. Nonetheless, on cross-examination of the co-defendant, government counsel quoted the excluded statement and asked if the defendant had made it. Defendant\u2019s objection was sustained, and the jury was instructed to disregard the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-23\">The excluded statement thus brought to the attention of the jury was highly prejudicial to the defendant. In view of the weakness of the government\u2019s case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>we cannot say that government counsel\u2019s error was rendered harmless by the court\u2019s admonition and that it did not affect the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and the cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
