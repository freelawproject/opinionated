They left the laundromat in unclear circumstances. Several months later, ap-pellees filed a petition to have appellants declared bankrupt. The referee found that appellants had abandoned the premises. He applied the measure of damages provided by Cal.Civil Code \u00a7 3308 and found an indebtedness to appellees of $7908.83 plus costs and attorney\u2019s fees of $1111.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-18\">We are not in a position to overturn the finding of abandonment. This being so, most of the California cases cited by the parties on the California law of landlord and tenant are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-19\">It is clear that there was enough indebtedness to satisfy the requirement of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 95, which was all that was necessary as an amount to adjudicate involuntarily this business bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-20\">Somebody may have wrongfully crippled appellants by changing the locks on the washing machines. But the referee found that the landlords didn\u2019t do it. So this issue is unimportant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-21\">The adjudication of bankruptcy is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
