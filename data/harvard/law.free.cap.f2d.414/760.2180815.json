Manfredonia appeals from a judgment of conviction on two counts of perjury in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621. Appellant was sentenced to eighteen months in prison and a $2,000 fine on the first count; the imposition of sentence was suspended on the second count and he was placed on probation for a period of five years to begin after the service of his sentence on count one; he was also fined an additional $2,000. The perjury charges arose out of an earlier trial of this same defendant for violations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Wagering Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4401, 4411, 7203 and 7262. While the appeal from the wagering tax conviction was pending in this court, the Supreme Court decided Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 716, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968), which held that these statutes were unconstitutional because they violated the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The appellant\u2019s conviction was thereupon reversed. United States v. Manfredonia, 391 F.2d 229 (2 Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-23\">Count One of the indictment in the present case charged that appellant\u2019s testimony in the wagering tax trial that he was not and never had been in the business of accepting wagers was false and perjurious.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Count Two charged that appellant perjured himself in denying various aspects of a conversation between himself and an undercover Internal Revenue Service agent who was posing as a bettor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>By its verdicts of guilty on both counts, the jury found that Manfredonia was a bookmaker who handled large bets; that on August 17,1966 Internal Revenue Service Agent Peden, posing as a jewelry salesman and big time bettor, met the appellant through Louis Ellrodt, an intermediary, after which the appellant arranged with Peden for the placing of substantial bets. The appellant gave Peden a code for placing bets by telephone which was \u201cJE\u201d (Peden) for \u201cHB\u201d (Manfredonia), and other instructions as to making calls to place bets, including signals which the answering person would give if bets could not be placed at that time, as well as signals covering the amounts and other data on the bets made. Subsequently, Peden placed a $280 bet which he lost. Later he placed two more bets, one of which he won. As a result of these bets Peden was owed $410 by the appellant, Manfredonia, but when Peden called either to place additional bets or to collect the amount due him, he was advised that the wire room of the betting establishment had been closed down. Peden was told by one of Manfredonia\u2019s messengers or agents that he would get the money due Peden and deliver it to him at Rossi\u2019s Bar at 1:30 p. m. on August 24th, but neither the messenger nor the money was there at that time. About two hours later, however, another man outside the bar, to whom Peden had been directed, agreed to find \u201cHB\u201d for him. The man drove off in a white Thunderbird, and Peden with Trerotola, other special agent, followed some distance behind. They presently discovered the white Thunderbird parked in front of Manfredonia\u2019s residence. They then returned to Rossi\u2019s Bar where they met the original messenger who advised Peden that the betting business would be closed down until the following Monday, but at that time the unidentified man in the white Thunderbird returned and delivered to Peden the $410 which the stranger said he had procured at the \u201cmain office.\u201d The messenger than gave Peden a telephone number to call concerning the placement of wagers during the following week.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-17\">The first attack made by the appellant is that Agents Peden and Trerotola committed perjury and, with their testimony stricken, there is insufficient valid evidence to sustain appellant\u2019s perjury convictions. He argues that the agents\u2019 perjury is shown by the difference between Peden\u2019s grand jury testimony<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>the testimony of both agents at the trial that when the unidentified man drove off in the white Thunderbird they followed in a Government vehicle and found the Thunderbird parked opposite Manfre-donia\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Upon close examination, however, this discrepancy in the testimony is not as significant as appellant would have us believe. Peden\u2019s memorandum of activities for the day in question, made right after the events, records that he and Trerotola had followed the white Thunderbird and observed it in front of Manfredonia\u2019s residence, which verified the trial testimony. At the trial this memorandum, together with a copy of the grand jury testimony of these agents, was made available to the defense. Although he had the opportunity, defense counsel did not use any of this material to impeach Peden.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, the portion of Peden\u2019s grand jury testimony referred to is part of a long narrative answer that was not interrupted by specific questions. In light of these facts it is obvious that, while before the grand jury, Peden simply neglected to relate the side excursion to follow the white Thunderbird and adhered to the main thread of his story.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\"> It is also clear that there was sufficient evidence to satisfy the so-called \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule that a defendant\u2019s perjury cannot be proved by the uncorroborated testimony of one witness. This requirement may be satisfied by the testimony o'f a second witness or by other independent evidence, circumstantial or direct. United States v. Marchisio, 344 F.2d 653, 665 (2 Cir. 1965); United States v. Collins, 272 F.2d 650, 652 (2 Cir. 1959), <em>cert. denied, </em>362 U.S. 911, 80 S.Ct. 681, 4 L.Ed.2d 619 (1960). Peden\u2019s story about the excursion of the unidentified man in the Thunderbird to Manfredonia\u2019s residence and his return with the money for Peden was fully corroborated by Trerotola\u2019s testimony. There was also other supporting evidence such as Ellrodt\u2019s testimony that Man-fredonia agreed to think about making arrangements to take Peden\u2019s bets and Manfredonia\u2019s subsequent call to Ellrodt to bring Peden to a specific place in Mount Vernon at a particular time.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">Manfredonia also contends that this court\u2019s reversal of his wagering tax conviction rendered that charge \u201cuntenable\u201d and, therefore, operated <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to make immaterial the testimony upon which the present perjury indictment was based. In advancing this argument appellant completely ignores the purpose of the perjury statute which is to keep the process of justice free from the contamination of false testimony. It is for the wrong done to the courts and the administration of justice that punishment is given, not for the effect that any particular testimony might have on the outcome of any given trial. For this reason it matters not what the ultimate disposition of the case may be; false swearing is still prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">Indeed, it has long been established that an acquittal of the defendant in a trial where false testimony was given does not bar a prosecution for perjury. Adams v. United States, 287 F.2d 701, 705 (5 Cir. 1961); Kuskulis v. United States, 37 F.2d 241 (10 Cir. 1929). It has likewise been held that the reversal of a conviction because of an improper indictment will not prevent a prosecution for perjury committed at the former trial. United States v. Williams, 341 U.S. 58, 71 S.Ct. 595, 95 L.Ed. 747 (1951). See also, United States v. Remington, 208 F.2d 567 (2 Cir. 1953), <em>cert. denied, </em>347 U.S. 913, 74 S.Ct. 476, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>98 L.Ed. 1069 (1954). In all of these cases the questioned testimony was material at the time it was given, and subsequent events did not eliminate that materiality.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To sustain a conviction of perjury, \"* * * materiality must be established only as of the time [the] answers were given.\u201d United States v. McFarland, 371 F.2d 701, 703 (2 Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Finally, appellant urges that the testimony of Ellrodt and Peden concerning their discussions prior to the contact with Manfredonia is hearsay, and that the introduction of this testimony was prejudicial error. But these conversations were plainly relevant to show the events leading up to the introduction of Peden to Manfredonia. They were only offered for the purpose of showing that Peden and Manfredonia met and conversed and not for the truth of what they said to each other. Moreover, the trial court made this clear in its charge when it instructed the jury that such conversations might not be taken as evidence that Manfredonia was at any time engaged in bookmaking. Also it should be noted that both Ellrodt and Peden testified in court and were available for cross-examination. See United States v. Elgisser, 334 F.2d 103, 108 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 881, 85 S.Ct. 151, 13 L.Ed.2d 87 (1964). Cf. United States v. Catino, 403 F.2d 491, 496 (2 Cir. 1968); United States v. Brill, 350 F.2d 171, 173 (2 Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-4\">.

The pertinent part of Peden\u2019s grand jury testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-20\">\u201cI went outside, and there was another individual, a third individual, who told me that Sposato would be back around four o\u2019clock, but he could probably get my money for me, so he said he\u2019d have to go to the main office to get the money, and he got into his car, took off, and I stood on the corner, waiting for him to return\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-21\">\u201c * * * Well, finally after about ten minutes of standing on the corner, then Sposato showed up, and he asked me\u2014 you know he apologized for not being there at one o\u2019clock, and he said he\u2019d get it now. I said no, another fellow had gone up to get the money, said he was going to the main office. He said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>\u2018Oh, that must be \u2014 \u2019 I forget the name he used. We were standing there, waiting, Sposato and myself. With that, the third individual came back and handed me the money.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\">. It has long been the rule in this Circuit that grand jury testimony may be used to impeach a witness. United States v. Borelli, 336 F.2d 376, 391 (2 Cir. 1964), cert. denied sub nom. Cinquegrano v. United States, 379 U.S. 960, 85 S.Ct. 647, 13 L.Ed.2d 555 (1965); United States v. Zborowski, 271 F.2d 661, 665 (2 Cir. 1959); United States v. Spangelet, 258 F.2d 338, 341-342 (2 Cir. 1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b821-15\">. The fact that Manfredonia\u2019s conviction on the wagering tax charge was overturned because of the unconstitutionality of the wagering tax statutes, rather than because of a defective indictment or other error, makes no difference whatever in the matter of the materiality of the false testimony or the validity of the perjury charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-16\">Analogous to the present situation are those cases where prosecutions for false swearing or reporting of false information have been permitted despite the fact that the statutory provisions which required the reporting of the information may have been unconstitutional (Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 865-866, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966); Kay v. United States, 303 U.S. 1, 6-7, 58 S.Ct. 468, 82 L.Ed. 607 (1938); United States v. Kapp, 302 U.S. 214, 58 S.Ct. 182, 82 L.Ed. 205 (1937)); or that the governmental agency involved had been improperly delegated the authority to make the inquiry (Ogden v. United States, 303 F.2d 724, 731 (9 Cir. 1962)); or that the administrative body involved was not a validly constituted tribunal (United States v. Meyer, 140 F.2d 652, 655 (2 Cir. 1944)). In all of these cases the constitutionality of the statute pursuant to which the answers were given was held to be irrelevant to the question of whether the defendant\u2019s answers were material to the particular proceeding. This was so because the perjury or false reporting prosecution was one to punish the defendant for false swearing or for fraud on the government, not one to enforce the invalid statute or regulation pursuant to which the answers were given.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
