Byrne, Senior United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b837-12\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">Merton Arthur Chase was tried before a jury and convicted of transporting a stolen motor vehicle across state lines, in violation of the Dyer Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312 (1964). On this appeal he first contends that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to suppress evidence consisting of an oral statement and papers misidentifying himself given to a law enforcement officer while being questioned at a service station, and in allowing the officer to repeat those statements in his testimony at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">The officer in question was Doyle Freeman of the Arizona Highway Patrol. On September 21, 1968, he received a radio call from the Holbrook, Arizona Dispatch Center of the Arizona Highway Patrol, to watch for a blue 1968 Ford with Massachusetts license plates which had \u201crun\u201d from a New Mexico State officer. The following afternoon, he and another Arizona Highway Patrol officer were parked along the highway in separate patrol cars near Holbrook, and saw the described vehicle drive by. Turning on their red lights, the two officers gave chase. Defendant pulled into a Shell station and alighted from his car. One of the officers parked his patrol car in front of defendant\u2019s vehicle, and the other parked behind it.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-18\">Officer Freeman questioned Chase, after which he placed Chase under arrest for driving without a valid driver\u2019s license. Officer Freeman then gave Chase part of the warnings prescribed in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, placed him in his patrol car and took him to the county jail in Holbrook.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-19\">At the outset of the trial, Chase moved to suppress Officer Freeman\u2019s proposed testimony with respect to his questioning of defendant at the service station. Following an evidentiary hearing in the absence of the jury, the court denied the motion. At the trial, Officer Freeman testified on direct examination that, at the service station, he first asked Chase for his driver\u2019s license and the car registration. The officer testified that Chase gave him identification in the name of Russell Chase (defendant\u2019s brother), and stated that he did not have a driver\u2019s license. On cross-examination by counsel for Chase, Officer Freeman further stated that Chase advised him at this time that the car was rented.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-20\">In Lowe v. United States, 9 Cir., 407 F.2d 1391, this court held that when a law enforcement officer stops a car and asks the driver for identification and a vehicle registration slip, this limited on-the-scene investigative questioning need not be preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings. See also, Arnold v. United States, 9 Cir., 382 F.2d 4, 7; United States v. Gibson, 4 Cir., 392 F.2d 373. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>Accordingly, it was not necessary for Officer Freeman to give Chase a Miranda-type warning before asking him for his driver\u2019s license and the car registration. The officer was therefore entitled to testify as to' the responses Chase made to those questions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress Chase\u2019s statements elicited by the prosecution, and in receiving evidence concerning those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Chase also contends that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant the verdict of guilty on the Dyer Act charge, and the trial court therefore erred in denying his motion to acquit. We have examined the evidence and find it ample to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-29\">. We note that the same information, namely that Chase did not have a driver\u2019s license with him, and that he was holding himself out as his brother, Russell, was already before the jury through the testimony of New Mexico law enforcement officers, and was admitted without objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
