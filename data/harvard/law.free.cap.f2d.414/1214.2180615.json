Decision here was deferred awaiting the Supreme Court opinion in the Gissel Packing Co. and The Sinclair Company cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Armed by the teaching of those cases, we remand this case to the Board to determine whether, \u201ceven in the absence of a \u00a7 8(a) (5) violation, a bargaining order would have been necessary to repair the unlawful effect of [the company\u2019s unfair labor practices].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In making that determination the Board should consider whether, in view of the company\u2019s unfair labor practices, \u201cthe risks that a fair rerun election might not be possible were too great to disregard the desires of the employees already expressed through the cards.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Otherwise we affirm the order of the Board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>The Board here properly found on substantial evidence that on March 7, 1966, the union possessed valid designation cards from a majority of employees in the unit. But then, as it did concerning the Gissel Packing Company in <em>Gissel, </em>using <em>Joy Silk </em>Mills<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as its guide, the Board found that the company\u2019s rejection of the union\u2019s bargaining demand was in bad faith and violative of Section 8(a) (5). The Board made no finding, as it did in <em>The Sinclair Company, </em>that the company\u2019s unfair labor practices were such \u201cthat, even in the absence of a \u00a7 8(a) (5) violation, a bargaining order would have been necessary to repair the[ir] unlawful effect * * *.\"<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Compare </em>Retail Store Employees Union Local 880 v.

The Board found that the company violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act by promising benefits to the employees prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>election; by granting benefits to the employees following the election; and <em>by </em>distributing company garment tags among the employees and observing who accepted them. The Board further found that the company violated \u00a7 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act by discharging or laying off six employees because of their union activities. These findings are fully supported by substantial evidence in the record viewed as a whole. Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).
