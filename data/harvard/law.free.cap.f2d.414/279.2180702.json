He appealed and his conviction was affirmed. Dear-inger v. United States, 344 F.2d 309 (9th Cir. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-23\">Thereafter, the trial court conducted a full evidentiary hearing on petitioner\u2019s motion for new trial on newly discovered evidence. This was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-24\">This petition alleged that he was held in \u201csolitary confinement\u201d prior to his trial, and was denied a motion for a continuance ten days before his trial. Neither of such grounds was urged on appeal. He also charged that he was inadequately represented by counsel at his trial, an issue raised on his appeal (but not at his trial) and decided adversely to him on appeal. 344 F.2d 309 at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-25\">The two grounds urged here for the first time are stated in general conclu-sionary terms. Petitioner fails to specify facts concerning the mode of his custody, or how it affected his relations with his counsel or how he or his counsel were affected in presenting his de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>fense. His complaint as to a continuance was not properly raised at his trial, nor at all on his appeal, and he has waived it.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Thus the appellant has presented no factual matters that require a hearing; hence no hearing was required. The district court carefully examined the transcript of petitioner\u2019s trial proceedings, and found no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">We affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
