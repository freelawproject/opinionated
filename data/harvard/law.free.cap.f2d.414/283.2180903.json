Suit was filed in the state court to enjoin the picketing and boycotting activities of appellants. They, in turn, sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the federal court. The federal district court denied relief and dismissed the complaint. The district court\u2019s reasoning was based on the facts that the same controversy had first been submitted to the state court, and that the state court had assumed jurisdiction, held an evidentiary hearing and enjoined appellants. These facts led the court to the view that its injunctive prerogative was inhibited by Title 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2283,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in that this was \u201c* * * not the rare case * * * for utilization of a federal injunction to vindicate a clear constitutional right.\u201d The court was of the further view that declaratory relief was not required by the holding of Zwickler v. Koota, 1967, 389 U.S. 241, 88 S.Ct. 391, 19 L.Ed.2d 444. This appeal followed. We reverse for further proceedings for the reasons to be set out and within stated limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-18\">Appellants are members of the \u201cGreenwood Movement\u201d, a civil rights group active in Greenwood, Mississippi. Two of the appellees are class representatives of some sixty merchants and bankers in Greenwood who appeared as plaintiffs in the state court suit, some appearing in an individual capacity, some in a corporate capacity. The third ap-pellee is Honorable William H. Bizzel, Chancellor of the Chancery Court of Le-flore County, Mississippi, who issued the injunction in the state court suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-19\">There was no evidentiary hearing in the federal district court and the following facts are taken from the pleadings in the federal and state courts and from the opinions rendered in each court. There was an extensive state court evi-dentiary hearing but the record of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>hearing was not before the district court. The decision of the district court was rendered on a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The state court suit was filed on June 5, 1968. The federal suit was filed on June 11. The state court heard evidence on June 12, 13, 17, and 19. The state court injunction issued on July 4. Appellants moved on July 26 for expedition of the federal suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The Greenwood Movement was organized in November of 1967. Its activities greatly increased after the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April of 1968. A boycott of white merchants began on April 10, 1968. The Movement stated its objectives to be, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cTo eliminate segregation and discrimination; to make all men free; to create fair employment practices.\u201d The state court found the specific goals to be equal employment by the city, equal job opportunities in business, use of courtesy titles, improved city services in Negro areas, fair treatment by police, representation on various public boards and agencies, and dialogue with elected officials. The picketing which supported the boycott was very intensive, being carried on every day except Sunday. The state court found that \u201c* * * In a few. instances the size of groups has been sufficient to interfere with vehicles and pedestrians, but this has not been a major problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The state court found that the Movement did, however, involve activities of a more questionable nature. There was testimony to indicate that members of the Movement had harassed and used abusive language toward Negroes who continued to patronize the white merchants. There were instances of violence. The most serious was a firebomb thrown into the house of a Negro family who had continued to shop at stores of the white merchants. There were several instances of windows having been broken, in one case by a bottle containing a note saying, \u201cDon\u2019t shop downtown or fire next time \u2014 The Spirit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The state court order enjoined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">\u201c1. Picketing or marching, or persuading or inducing any other person or persons to picket or march, in any organized form whatsoever, with or without signs or placards, upon Howard Street or upon Carrollton Avenue or in the Highland Park Shopping Center in the City of Greenwood, or within 300 feet of the place of business in the City of Greenwood of any of the Complainants in this cause, a list of which complainants is attached hereto and is made a part hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">\u201c2. Loitering or congregating, or inducing or persuading any person or persons to loiter or congregate, upon any sidewalk or street or other public area in the City of Greenwood for the purpose of doing anything whatsoever, directly or indirectly, to induce, persuade, or coerce any person or persons not to trade or do other business with the business establishments of any of the said Complainants in the City of Greenwood, Mississippi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">\u201c3. Stationing themselves or anyone else as a lookout or lookouts for the purpose of observing customers entering, leaving, or shopping or doing other business in the business establishments of any of the said Complainants in the City of Greenwood, Mississippi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">\u201c4. Making or preparing or causing to be made or prepared a record of the names, automobile license numbers or other identification of person or persons entering or trading in the business establishments of any of the said Complainants in the City of Greenwood, Mississippi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-13\">\u201c5. Publishing, distributing, or announcing in any manner the name or names of persons who have entered or traded in or shall hereafter enter or trade in the business establishments of any of said Complainants in the said City of Greenwood or causing such names to be published, distributed or announced; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-14\">\u201c6. Threatening, intimidating, coercing, or using force or violence upon any person or persons so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>dissuade such person or persons from entering or trading in the business establishments of any of said Complainants in the said City of Greenwood.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASJ\">The prayer of appellants in the federal court was for a declaration of their federal rights and an order vacating the state court injunction, or in the alternative, that the bounds of the state court injunction be limited. On August 13, 1968, the district court dismissed the complaint. Machesky v. Bizzell, N.D.Miss., 1968, 288 F.Supp. 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The several issues presented in the district court included whether state action was present so as to render the Fourteenth Amendment applicable. The court, acting on an assumption <em>arguendo </em>basis, found it unnecessary to reach this question and it must be considered on remand. Cf. Shelley v. Kraemer, 1948, 334 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161. In considering this question the district court must analogize the state court order with cases where First Amendment rights [picketing] have been restricted by municipal ordinances. Cf. Davis v. Francois, 5 Cir., 1968, 395 F.2d 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Another issue in the district court, and one which is asserted here by appellants, is that they were entitled to separate consideration of their prayer for declaratory judgment regardless of whether injunctive relief was available. They rely for this proposition on Zwickler v. Koota, supra. The district court distinguished the <em>Zwickler </em>case by limiting its rationale to attacks on statutes alleged to be unconstitutional on their face. The court also declined in its discretion to entertain the petition for declaratory judgment. We affirm the action of the district court on the discretionary basis, and thus find it unnecessary to reach the question whether the scope of <em>Zwickler </em>is so restricted. This conclusion is part and parcel of the in-junctive relief question. Assuming <em>ar-guendo </em>that the court could not grant injunctive relief, it would be most unusual to render a declaratory judgment under the circumstances declaring the state court order unconstitutional. This would set up a direct confrontation with the state court with no power in the federal court to make its judgment effective. One can scarcely envision a more untoward predicament for a court, be it federal or state. On the other hand, if the court was possessed of power in the circumstances, it would follow that action on the declaratory judgment prayer would be a necessary concomitant.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">Appellants also contend that they were entitled to injunctive relief in another form even if the order of the state court was immune from federal court reach. This, they urge, would be in the form of an injunction against criminal contempt trials in the event the state court order was violated. We reject this contention although criminal contempt proceedings may be separate proceedings. Such a fragmented approach would be exalting form over substance and would be an effort to do indirectly that which \u00a7 2283 prohibits a federal court from doing directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">In sum, appellants must prevail, if they are to prevail, on the assignment of error that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">We come then to the anti-injunction statute, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2283, supra. Our decision is in the context of First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Amendment rights only. Appellants are denied the right to picket in certain areas of the business district of Greenwood and before the courthouse and city hall. The denial is of all picketing, not merely a limit on the number of pickets. We reach only this aspect of the injunction, leaving to the district court on remand other questions such as vagueness and overbreadth in other parts of the. injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">We begin by eliminating two questions. One is whether Title 42, \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> constitutes an express exception to \u00a7 2283. The other is whether the rationale of Dombrowski v. Pfister, 1965, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22, is applicable to carve out an exception to \u00a7 2283.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The <em>Dombrowski </em>decision sheds light on both questions. First, <em>Dombrowski, </em>although involving First Amendment rights, is distinguishable from the instant case in that here state proceedings had already been initiated at the time the appellants first came into the district court. In footnote 2 in <em>Dombrowski, </em>the Supreme Court made this distinction clear: \u201cThis statute [28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2283] and its predecessors do not preclude injunctions against the Institution of state court proceedings, but only bar stays of suits already instituted.\u201d Thus <em>Dombrowski </em>in and of itself is not controlling here. The federal action having been first in time, the court went on to state in the same footnote: \u201cWe therefore find it unnecessary to resolve the question whether suits under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (1958 ed.) come under the \u2018expressly authorized\u2019 exception to \u00a7 2283.\u201d This latter question has subsequently been described by the court as being open. Cameron v. Johnson, 1965, 381 U.S. 741, 85 S.Ct. 1751, 14 L.Ed.2d 715, and Cameron v. Johnson, 1968, 390 U.S. 611, 88 S.Ct. 1335, 20 L.Ed.2d 182, footnote 3. In any event, we do not reach the \u00a7 1983 question since we find decision proper on a narrower approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">Our decision is grounded on the premise th\u00e1T]TYZ83 Ts~non-jurisdictional in that it is no more than a statutory enactment of the principle of comity for application in the relationship between federal and state courts. \u25a0 As such, it is to give way in those extraordinary cases where the federal injunction is necessary to vindicate clear First Amendment rights. The question, on this premise, becomes whether appellants alleged such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">The first facet of the premise, that \u00a7 2283 is demonstrative of a policy of comity in a system of federalism is sustained by the authorities. In Baines v. City of Danville, 4 Cir., 1964, 337 F.2d 579, 593, cert. den., 381 U.S. 939, 85 S.Ct. 1772, 14 L.Ed.2d 702, the court after an exhaustive analysis, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-14\">\u201cSince the statute was fathered by the principles of comity, it has been held that the statute should be read in the light of those principles and, though absolute in its terms, is inapplicable in extraordinary cases in which an injunction against state court proceedings is the only means of avoiding grave and irreparable injury. In our view, the congressional command ought to be ignored only in the face of the most compelling reasons, but we have certainly been told by the Supreme Court that in those circumstances it may be disregarded, for its parentage discloses that it was not intended to be as absolute as it sounds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">The authorities simply equate \u00a7 2283 with the comity principle in a context of the equity powers of the court. See Smith v. Apple, 1924, 264 U.S. 274, 279, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>44 S.Ct. 311, 68 L.Ed. 678, 681.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cf. Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 1943, 319 U.S. 157, 63 S.Ct. 877, 87 L.Ed. 1324, on the comity limitation under general equity powers. See also T. Smith &amp; Son, Inc. v. Williams, 5 Cir., 1960, 275 F.2d 397; Dilworth v. Riner, 5 Cir., 1965, 343 F.2d 226. This approach was well-recognized by the district court in this case. Machesky v. Bizzell, 288 F.Supp. at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">This brings us to the question whether appellants alleged facts making out that extraordinary case which would warrant the court departing from the stricture of the congressional command of \u00a7 2283. This requires the application of the factual allegations here to the departure precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">One area in which the command of \u00a7 2283 has been held to give way is where the United States is a party. See Leiter Minerals, Inc. v. United States, 1957, 352 U.S. 220, 77 S.Ct. 287, 1 L.Ed.2d 267. In that case the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Frankfurter, reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">\u201cThe statute is designed to prevent conflict between federal and state courts. This policy is much more compelling when it is the litigation of private parties which threatens to draw the two judicial systems into conflict than when it is the United States which seeks a stay to prevent threatened irreparable injury to a national interest. The frustration of superior federal interests that would ensue from precluding the Federal Government from obtaining a stay of state court proceedings except under the severe restrictions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283, would be so great that we cannot reasonably impute such a purpose to Congress from the general language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283, alone.\u201d 352 U.S. at 225, 77 S.Ct. at 291.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al_\">The emphasis is on the \u201cnational interest\u201d or \u201csuperior federal interests\u201d as asserted by the United States. In Studebaker Corp. v. Gittlin, 2 Cir., 1966, 360 F.2d 692, \u00a7 2283 was found not to be a bar even where the United States was not a party. Although the Securities and Exchange Commission could have there sought an injunction, it had not. The court in an opinion by Judge Friendly said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">\u201cIf the policy of the anti-injunction statute is superseded by the need for immediate and effective enforcement of federal securities regulations and statutes, the fact that enforcement here is by a private party rather than the agency should not be controlling.\u201d 360 F.2d at 698.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">Here the United States could not have been a party and thus the <em>Studebaker </em>case is distinguishable in that regard. This line of cases does, however, point up the distinction between private parties asserting public rights and mere private parties \u2014 private rights status.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">We should take note of what is meant here by public rights as distinguished from private rights. Public rights may be involved, as in <em>Leiter Minerals, </em>where the government\u2019s proprietary interests are the subject of litigation. They may arise, as in <em>Studebaker, </em>where the government is performing or might perform in its regulatory capacity. The most important public rights and the ones involved here, however, are political rights which determine the composition of gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ernment and the direction of government policy. In United States v. Carolene Products Co., 1938, 304 U.S. 144, 152, 58 S.Ct. 778, 82 L.Ed. 1234, 1241-1242, Justice Stone in another context differentiated between that governmental action affecting \u201cordinary commercial transactions\u201d and that governmental action \u201cwhich restricts those political processes which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation * * Listed by Justice Stone as included within public rights were voting, dissemination of information, political organization, and peaceable assembly. 304 U.S. at 152, footnote 4, 58 S.Ct. at 783, footnote 4. These public rights are what Justice Brennan and Professor Alexander Meiklejohn refer to as rights of \u201cgoverning importance\u201d. See Brennan, \u201cThe Supreme Court and the Meiklejohn Interpretation of the First Amendment\u201d 79 Harv.L.Rev. 1 at 12-13. This article points out that public rights relate to the citizen in his capacity as a governor, i.e., how the citizen votes, what information he has at his disposal relating to political decisions which he may be called upon to make, and how he may join with others to influence public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Private rights, on the other hand, as we here use the term are those relating to the citizen in his capacity as one of the governed, i.e., his subjectivity to criminal laws and governmental regulation and his rights to governmental protection for his purely private affairs such as contract and tort. Thus this decision does not reach the criminal defendant seeking to enjoin state criminal prosecutions not related to these public or governing rights secured by the First Amendment. Cf. Stefanelli v. Minard, 1951, 342 U.S. 117, 72 S.Ct. 118, 96 L.Ed. 138, which forecloses the use of the federal injunctive powers in connection with private rights of this type.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Numerous Supreme Court opinions attest to the fact that First Amendment rights are not private rights of the appellants so much as they are rights of the general public. \u201cThose guarantees [of speech and press] are not for the benefit of the press so much as for the benefit of all of us. A broadly defined freedom of the press assures the maintenance of our political system and an open society.\u201d Time, Inc. v. Hill, 1967, 385 U.S. 374, 389, 87 S.Ct. 534, 543, 17 L.Ed.2d 456, 468. Bond v. Floyd, 1966, 385 U.S. 116, 136, 87 S.Ct. 339, 349, 17 L.Ed.2d 235, 248, speaks of the First Amendment as protecting \u201c[t]he interest of the public in hearing all sides of a public issue.\u201d In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 1964, 376 U.S. 254, 270, 84 S.Ct. 710, 721, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, 701, the court spoke of the \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open * * *.\u201d In Stromberg v. California, 1931, 283 U.S. 359, 369, 51 S.Ct. 532, 536, 75 L.Ed. 1117, 1123, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">\u201cThe maintenance of the opportunity fo,r free political discussion to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>end that government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes may be obtained by lawful means, an opportunity essential to the security of the Republic, is a fundamental principle of our constitutional system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Indeed dictum in City of Greenwood, Miss. v. Peacock, 1966, 384 U.S. 808, 829, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 1813, 16 L.Ed.2d 944, 957, clearly speaks to this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">\u201cIf the state prosecution or trial on the charge of obstructing a public street or on any other charge would itself clearly deny their rights protected by the First Amendment, they may under some circumstances obtain an injunction in the federal court. See Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Since this passage speaks of \u201cstate prosecution or trial\u201d, it would seem clearly to indicate a situation somewhat different from <em>Dombrowski </em>in that in such a situation, as here, state proceedings within the meaning of \u00a7 2283 would be in progress. Thus, what the dictum must mean is that when the institutional interests sought to be protected by the <em>Dombrowski </em>decision are offended by the state proceeding, then the state proceeding may be enjoined even in the face of \u00a7 2283. What are these institutional interests ? The language of <em>Dombrowski </em>is clearly directed to protecting the public interest in information about public issues. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">\u201cBecause of the sensitive nature of constitutionally protected expression, we have not required that all of those subject to overbroad regulations risk prosecution to test their rights. For free expression \u2014 of transcendent value to all society, and not merely to those exercising their rights \u2014 might be the loser.\u201d <em>Dombrowski, </em>supra, 380 U.S. at 486, 85 S.Ct. at 1121.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The Court also spoke of the interest in avoiding \u201cmaking vindication of freedom of expression await the outcome of protracted litigation.\u201d <em>Dombrowski, </em>supra, 380 U.S. at 487, 85 S.Ct. at 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Thus, what is here involved is not simply private litigation over private rights. It is not even, as in <em>Letter Minerals, </em>public litigation in the narrow sense that the United States is a party protecting its proprietary interests. What is involved is much more public, and the demand for federal intervention is much more compelling. By way of emphasis, we reiterate the First Amendment facts. The injunctive prohibits \u201cpicketing * * * upon Howard Street or upon Carrollton Avenue or in the Highland Park Shopping Center or * * * within 300 feet of the place of business in the City of Greenwood of any of the Complainants in this cause.\u201d The complainants number approximately sixty of Greenwood\u2019s banks, food stores, drug stores, clothing stores, department stores, furniture stores, and numerous specialty stores and service centers. As recently as Amalgamated Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., 1968, 391 U.S. 308, 88 S.Ct. 1601, 20 L.Ed.2d 603, the Supreme Court said, \u201cWe start from the premise that peaceful picketing carried on in a location open generally to the public is, absent other factors involving the purpose or-manner of the picketing, protected by the First Amendment.\u201d 391 U.S. at 313, 88 S.Ct. at 1605.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">The right to picket is not absolute. It must be \u201casserted within the limits of not unreasonably interfering with the rights of others to use the sidewalks and streets, to have access to store entrances, and where conducted in such manner as not to deprive the public of police and fire protection.\u201d Kelly v. Page, 5 Cir., 1964, 335 F.2d 114, 119. These interests can, of course, be protected by state injunctions narrowly drawn. The injunction here, however, has not struck such a balance. It prohibits all picketing in the designated business areas of Greenwood, for whatever purpose and in whatever manner carried out. This overshoots the mark and the situation cannot be saved by Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies, 1941, 312 U.S. 287, 61 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Ct. 552, 85 L.Ed. 836, a case premised on violence of an intensity and duration in no way present here, or at least on the record before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The injunction here in question goes even further than prohibiting protected picketing. It enjoins \u201cloitering or congregating * * * to induce, persuade, or coerce any person or persons not to trade of to do other business with * * * Complainants. * * * \u201d This, for aught else appearing, prohibits the distribution of leaflets or even speech directed toward the boycott effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">We hold that the state court injunction here is unconstitutionally overbroad in that it lumps the protected with the unprotected in such a way as to abridge important public interests in the full dissemination of public expression on public issues. We hold also that where important public rights to full \u25a0 dissemination of expression on public issues are abridged by state court proceedings, the principles of comity embodied in \u00a7 2283 must yield, and that the district court is empowered to enjoin the state court proceedings to the extent that they violate these First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">In so holding we are not unaware that \u201c[b]y that enactment, [\u00a7 2283] Congress made clear beyond cavil that the prohibition is not to be whittled away by judicial improvisation.\u201d Amalagamated Clothing Workers of America v. Richman Brothers Co., 1955, 348 U.S. 511, 514, 75 S.Ct. 452, 454, 99 L.Ed. 600. It follows that a federal court must yield to the important institutional interests in comity where only private rights are involved. Where, however, the institutional interests in comity collides with the paramount institutional interests protected by the First Amendment, comity must yield. That is the case here based on the allegations and record, such as it was, before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">This is not to say that the district court is to act as an appellate court or an overlord over the state court. It is to say that there is concurrent jurisdiction in the federal court<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> over the same subject matter and that the federal court must act where public rights springing from the First Amendment are violated even though that violation be at the hands of a state court. The \u2022 action of the federal court must be limited to intruding only to the extent that .the state court order impinges on the First Amendment rights involved. The \u25a0state court, no less than a state or a municipality, is not immune from the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. Art. VI, Cl. 2, Constitution. See Davis v.
