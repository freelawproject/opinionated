ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1154-20\">Nearly every state in the Union has ventured to regulate in a criminal context an assortment of conduct characteristically grouped under the denomination \u201cvagrancy.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Congress, in like vein, has enacted the two statutes currently in operation in the District of Columbia commonly referred to as the \u201cgeneral vagrancy\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201cnarcotic vagrancy\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> laws. On this appeal we came face-to-face with claims of unconstitutionality directed toward the former. In a companion case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> decided today, we deal with similar challenges to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-21\">The legislation now before us categorizes eight \u201cclasses of persons\u201d who \u201cshall be deemed vagrants in the District of Columbia,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and specifies fine and imprisonment as the punishment for vagrancy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District\u2019s police department has administratively implemented these provisions with procedures, called \u201cvagrancy observations,\u201d which are utilized prior to vagrancy arrests. An observation, as the word connotes, consists in police surveillance of an individual, followed by questioning and the assembly of information on a vagrancy observation form.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The form is turned in at a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>cinct station and circulated to other precincts with substantial vice problems. At least three observations within a 45-day period are customarily made before the person observed is arrested for vagrancy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">On January 22,1966, at 3:08 a. m., two police officers, patrolling a section of the inner city described as a \u201cden of vice,\u201d saw appellant standing in the doorway of a \u201cknown house of ill fame.\u201d The officers recognized appellant as a \u201cknown and convicted felon, thief, prostitute, vagrant, and narcotics user.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She was \u201cobserved\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> approaching a male pedestrian and walking with him toward a neighboring \u201chouse of ill fame.\u201d The officers intercepted the pair and asked appellant a battery of questions concerning her reasons for being on the streets at that hour, to which appellant responded that she was on her way to \u201cSlim\u2019s room\u201d to get clothes which she left there. Inquiry was also made as to her employment status, the last time she had \u201cturned a trick,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and her use of \u201cjunk.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellant said that she was not employed, was no longer using \u201cjunk,\u201d and had not \u201cturned tricks\u201d since the previous month. Compliably with the officers\u2019 request, she rolled up her sleeves, thereby revealing two needle marks on her left arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">Four days later, an around-the-clock police vigil again focused on appellant. At 1:04 a. m. she was spotted \u201cflagging several automobiles\u201d carrying male occupants, and was overheard using the jargon of professional prostitutes soliciting customers. She asked one male driver if he was \u201csporting\u201d and invited him to accompany her to a house because she \u201cdidn\u2019t turn any tricks in any car.\u201d She was again questioned by the police and, for the second time, her answers intimated nothing. Marks were perceived on appellant\u2019s left arm when, in response to an officer\u2019s request, she exposed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-12\">On January 29, 1966, seven days after the first observation, appellant was seen at 4:10 in the morning walking back and forth from a street corner. Her meandering apparently aroused the interest of a police officer who kept her in view for approximately ten minutes. Then followed another round of interrogation, and appellant was informed of the vagrancy law and told to go home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-13\">The final observation of appellant was made by the officer who had conducted the first. On February 11,1966, between 1:30 and 3:00 a. m., he detected appellant standing on a street corner and stopping male pedestrians as they passed. This time the officer placed appellant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-14\">The information upon which appellant was prosecuted charged that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>was a vagrant within three of the statute\u2019s definitions of the term:<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-4\">\u201cThe following classes of persons shall be deemed vagrants in the District of Columbia:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-5\">\u201c(1) Any person known to be a pickpocket, thief, burglar, confidence operator, or felon, either by his own confession or by his having been convicted in the District of Columbia or elsewhere of any one of such offenses or of any felony, and having no lawful employment and having no lawful means of support realized from a lawful occupation or source, and not giving a good account of himself when found loitering around in any park, highway, public building, or other public place, store, shop, or reservation, or at any public gathering or assembly. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-6\">\u201c(3) Any person leading an immoral or profligate life who has no' lawful employment and who has no lawful means of support realized from a lawful occupation or source. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-7\">\u201c(8) Any person who wanders about the streets at late or unusual hours of the night without any visible or lawful business and not giving a good account of himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1156-8\">At the ensuing trial in the Court of General Sessions, appellant pressed motions to dismiss the information and for a judgment of acquittal on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that the vagrancy statute was unconstitutionally vague. Chief Judge Greene, in an illuminating opinion,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> expounded the view that the statute was indeed invalid<footnotemark>1<em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but, recognizing the binding force of decisions of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals sustaining the statute, denied both motions and found appellant guilty as charged. The Court of Appeals affirmed,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> adherently to its earlier pronouncements,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and we allowed this further appeal because of the obvious importance of the questions involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-13\">Appellant advances skillfully a number of bases upon which it is urged that the vagrancy law is unconstitutional, but we find it necessary to consider but one. The pervading difficulty, as we see it, is the legislative omission to provide a reasonable degree of guidance to citizens, the police and the courts as to just what constitutes the offenses with which appellant was charged. We reverse, holding that each of the statutory provisions upon which appellant\u2019s conviction rests is so vague as to infringe rights secured by the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-15\">Reasonable precision in the definition of crime has been regarded as -\u2019a desideratum by free people since the early days of the common law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>precept, virtually from the birth of the Nation, has occupied a position of honor in the scheme of constitutional values,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and for justifications of the highest order. Fluid language which sweeps citizens under the penumbra of penal legislation without warning is abhorrent. The imposition of criminal liability for behavior which a person could not reasonably understand to be prohibited offends the most rudimentary considerations of fairness. \u201cNo one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. All are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus \u201ca statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AmkH\"> Statutory vagueness has a distinctive impact, too, on human activity not essentially wicked and on the processes by which its criminality is to be appraised. \u201cLiberty under law extends to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Since most people, shy away from legal violations, personal liberty is unconstitutionally dampened when one can but doubt whether he is actually free to pursue particular conduct.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Moreover, definitional uncertainty is an open invitation, if indeed not inevitably an antecedent, to virtually unrestrained administration. \u201c[A] law fails to meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause\u201d not only \u201cif it is so vague and standardless that it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits,\u201d but also if it \u201cleaves judges and jurors free to decide, without any legally fixed standards, what is prohibited and what is not in each particular case.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> And legislation of that character \u201cdoes not provide for government by clearly defined laws, but rather for government by the moment-to-moment opinions of a policeman on his beat.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-14\">So it is that a criminal statute perishes on constitutional grounds when it leaves speculative the tests for ascertaining the line separating guilty from innocent acts. A reasonable degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>certainty is prerequisite.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Fair notice to those of ordinary intelligence is necessary.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It is essential that the statutory language \u201cconveys sufficiently definite warnings as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">These are the critical elements of the void-for-vagueness doctrine; these are the criteria by which we must measure the statute at bar. \u201cVague laws in any area suffer a constitutional infirmity,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and what the Constitution demands of other laws it exacts imperatively of those which undertake to punish vagrancy.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">Appellant was prosecuted and convicted under three of the statutory subsections\u2014(1), (3) and (8) of Section 22-3302\u2014 defining independent concepts of vagrancy. Perusal of these subsections<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> discloses that each incorporates language precipitating problems in terms of the void-for-vagueness doctrine. These provisions we must now individually scrutinize, in the light of pertinent constitutional principles, to ascertain whether they can pass muster. D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3302(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-23\">The first type of vagrancy with which appellant was charged has four elements. \u201cAny person [1] known to be a * * * thief, * * * by his having been convicted in the District of Columbia * * * of * * * such [offense] * * * and [2] having no lawful employment and having no lawful means of support realized from a lawful occupation or source, and [3] not giving a good account of himself [4] when found loitering around in any * * * public place\u201d is a vagrant.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s prior conviction of petit larceny<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> supplies the first element,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and there was evidence on which the trial judge could find the sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>ond.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> But this subsection requires additionally that the accused be found loitering, and that he fail to give a good account of himself.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We are unable to perceive in these two elements the degree of specificity which due process enjoins upon legislative enactments that specify criminal offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">\n<em>\u2014\u201cLoitering\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">\u201cLoitering\u201d has not been defined legislatively. The District of Columbia Court \u25a0 of Appeals, adopting our definition of the term in another context,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> has construed \u201cloitering\u201d in the vagrancy statute as meaning \u201cto be slow in moving, to delay, to linger, to be dilatory, to spend time idly, to saunter, to lag behind.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In contrast to such seemingly innocuous conduct,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> however, the court has also read subsection (1) to mean that \u201cwhen one\u2019s wandering and conduct on the streets at late or unusual hours is such as to give reasonable grounds for a belief that his purpose for being on the street is not a legitimate one, we think that the law may validly require that he be called upon to account for his actions.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Further evidencing the susceptibility of the statutory language to divergent understandings, witnesses at appellant\u2019s trial likewise voiced widely differing interpretations of \u201cloitering,\u201d ranging from the ostensibly innocent to the potentially criminal<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In the complete absence of statutory criteria by which the one can be objectively distinguished from the other, we find a fatal constitutional flaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-17\">In People v. Diaz,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> a statute forbidding anyone \"to lounge or loiter about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>any street or street corner\u201d was held to be constitutionally infirm because it failed \u201cto point up the prohibited act, either actual or threatened,\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and thus did not differentiate \u201cconduct calculated to harm and that which is essentially innocent.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Meeting the same fate was the statute involved in Hawaii v. Anduha,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> which made it a misdemeanor for any person to \u201chabitually loaf, loiter, and/or idle upon any public street or highway or in any public place.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Other courts treating similar enactments have reached the same conclusion.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> These decisions undergird our conclusion that \u201cloitering,\u201d as used in the subsection before us, is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">\n<em>\u2014\u201cNot Giving A Good Account of Himself\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">We encounter difficulty not only with \u201cloitering\u201d but equally with the mandate of subsection (1) that the person loitering explain his activity in a manner that amounts to \u201cgiving a good account of himself.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The statute furnishes no standard by which it can be ascertained whether an explanation for particular conduct is \u201cgood,\u201d and decisions addressing \u201cgood account\u201d provisions are but little more definitive. A refusal to account, says the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, is a failure to give a good account,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and what the statute demands is not \u201ca <em>mere account\u201d </em><footnotemark>50</footnotemark> but \u201cone which is reasonably credible.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> We do not disagree with the court\u2019s interpretation, but that is the extent to which prior judicial construction is informative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-12\">The record discloses disparate opinions on \u201cgood account\u201d entertained by those to whom enforcement of the statute is entrusted. Two police officers testified that a declination to answer questions is a failure to give a good account, but another officer said that this was a matter which the judge would have to decide. An officer avowed that \u201c[g]ood account means that you are not out there for an illegal purpose,\u201d but another declared that the accounting is not good if the answers to an officer\u2019s questions do not satisfy the officer. To the Corporation Counsel\u2019s chief prosecutor whether a good account is given is a matter determinable only on the facts of the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-13\">We deem the \u201cgood account\u201d provision much too loose to satisfy constitutional requirements. It takes but little reflection to bring to mind almost immediately the magnitude of the guesswork <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>its application commonly entails. As one court recently put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-6\">\u201c[T]he term <em>\u2018good </em>account\u2019 * * * leaves too much discretion in the hands of the police and the courts. It does not involve a certain standard, for what may be a good account to one person may very easily not be one to another. The word \u2018good\u2019 is especially subjective in nature and is used in our parlance in many different ways and contexts. Does it mean \u2018morally good\u2019 or does it mean \u2018lawful\u2019 in the sense that if one does not admit to a crime he has given a good account of himself? On the other hand, \u2018good account\u2019 may mean an account which puts the accused above suspicion or it may mean that his statement must give the officer sufficient credible information so as to negate probable cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-7\">\u201cIn addition, the statute imposes no time limit on \u2018good account.\u2019 Does it require a person to give a \u2018good account\u2019 of himself as of the moment the officer stops him or must he be prepared to explain and defend his conduct and whereabouts since he entered the state? One cannot tell how far back in time he may have to justify himself or his activities in order to avoid the criminal penalties of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1161-9\">However viewed, subsection (1) is an investiture of enormous discretion in those who must administer it. Interdicted persons may tarry in public places only if willing to answer questions by police officers as to why they are there, and then only at the risk that their explanations might not appeal to their inquisitors. In Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held invalid an ordinance making it \u201cunlawful for any person * * * to so stand, loiter, or walk upon any street or sidewalk * * * after having been requested by any police officer to move on,\u201d saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-10\">\u201cLiterally read, therefore, the second part of this ordinance says that a person may stand on a public sidewalk in Birmingham only at the whim of any police officer of that city. The constitutional vice of so broad a provision needs no demonstration. It \u2018does not provide for government by clearly defined laws, but rather for government by the moment-to-moment opinions of a policeman on his beat.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1161-11\">We discern no significant difference from a constitutional standpoint between a law licensing one\u2019s presence on a public street upon a police officer\u2019s favorable judgment and one conditioning it upon the officer\u2019s satisfaction with the explanation as to why the person is there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>\n<em>\u2014\u201cLeading An Immoral Or Profligate Life\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">The second statutory provision appellant allegedly violated denominates a vagrant \u201c[a]ny person [I] leading an immoral or profligate life [2] who has no lawful employment and who has no lawful means of support realized from a lawful occupation or source.\u201d <footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Our concern here is with the first specification.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Immorality and profligateness are not terms of art, at least in common understanding, and the definitional problems they pose are quite readily apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">The record in this case contains an instance in point. A police officer testified that he made approximately 470 arrests for vagrancy in 1965, yet he was uncertain as to the reach of the statutory words. He was sure that \u201cleading an immoral and profligate life means being a known prostitute.\u201d When questioned, however, as to whether the statutory language is limited to prostitution, this veteran responded \u201cNo, I imagine it means other things,\u201d but commendably admitted that \u201cI don\u2019t know what they might mean.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">Turning to prior judicial construction, we discover that the dilemma is not lessened but magnified. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals considers the provision under examination to be so elastic as to prohibit any conduct that is not \u201cdecent, upright, good, [or] right.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Elaborating, it says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-7\">\u201cWebster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u2018profligate\u2019 as \u2018completely given up to dissipation and licentiousness; broken down in morals and decency.\u2019 It has been said that \u2018Immorality\u2019 is not necessarily confined to matters sexual in their nature; it may be that which is contra bonos mores; or not moral, inconsistent with rectitude, purity, or good morals; contrary to conscience or moral law; wicked; vicious; licentious, as, an immoral man or deed. Its synonyms are: Corrupt, indecent, depraved, dissolute; and its antonyms are: Decent, upright, good, right.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"agx-dedup-1\">We are in no position to debate this interpretation, for the statutory language leaves an open field for speculation. And given this meaning, subsection (3) affords an almost boundless area for individual asessment of the morality of another\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-17\">In Musser v. Utah,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> the Supreme Court remanded a conviction under a state statute prohibiting conspiracies \u201cto commit acts injurious to public morals\u201d with a strong suggestion that the law was unconstitutionally vague. \u201cStanding by itself,\u201d said the Court, \u201cit would seem to be warrant for conviction for agreement to do almost any act which a judge and jury might find at the moment contrary to his or its notions of what was good for health,' morals, trade, commerce, justice or order.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> We think the subsection before us is cut from much the same cloth. Opposing segments of the general public may agree as to the immorality or profligateness of many activities.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> But, more importantly, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>expectable, if indeed not inevitable, that they will disagree on many others without approaching absurdity. Not only does the phrase under scrutiny fail to chart for the individual citizen the course that is proscribed, but it also fails to mark out reasonably distinct boundaries for the judges, juries and police officers who are required to administer the law. We hold that the first element of subsection (3) \u2014 \u201cleading an immoral and profligate life\u201d \u2014 necessitates so much guesswork as to its coverage as to incur the condemnation of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3302(8)</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">Subsection (8), the final provision invoked against appellant, extends the vagrancy definition to \u201c[a]ny person [1] who wanders about the streets at late or unusual hours of the night [2] without any visable or lawful business and [3] not giving a good account of himself.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The last component \u2014 failure to render \u201ca good account\u201d \u2014 alone suffices to invalidate this subsection on vagueness grounds.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Upon analysis, we find that the first two elements of subsection (8) afflict it with the same malady.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">\n<em>\u2014\u201cWanders * * * Without Any Visible Or Lawful Business\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-9\">The proscription against wandering has no built-in criterion whatever for ascertainment of the kind or degree of movement prohibited. Nor does the statute attempt to give content to the expression \u201cwithout any visible or lawful business.\u201d As construed by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, this phrase \u201cdoes not refer to the ordinary vocation of the person but has reference to the purpose of being on the street, and business is not limited to the pursuit of monetary gain. One may have lawful business on the street even though he is there merely for exercise or recreation or any other proper purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-17\">This appears to be a logical reading of the statutory language, but what it means is that law enforcement officers may arrest a person who \u201cwanders\u201d on the streets late at night without \u201cany proper purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> A police officer must first make an unguided determination as to whether in one\u2019s activity on the streets he \u201cwanders.\u201d Coupled with the requirement that the wanderer give \u201ca good account\u201d of himself, it is evident that the officer must then make an equally unassisted judgment as to whether the purpose is \u201cproper.\u201d Subsection (8) is thus a grant of an unfettered discretion \u2014 to administrative and judicial authorities alike \u2014 to regulate movement on the public streets. This is plainly much more than the Constitution tolerates.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-18\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-19\">The role of statutory vagueness in the aberrations of vagrancy administration appears vividly from the testimony regarding appellant\u2019s arrest and the enforcement policies generally in vogue in the District. One of the officers who arrested appellant testified that it \u201cappeared\u201d to him that she had been soliciting prostitution, but that for lack of evidence he \u201ccould not make a proper arrest or a proper prosecution on grounds of prostitution.\u201d \u201cInstead,\u201d he arrested her for vagrancy, in accordance with what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>seems to be common practice.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The other officer participating in the arrest opined that appellant is leading an immoral and profligate life because \u201cI believe she is currently soliciting prostitution,\u201d but, since \u201call the elements of soliciting prostitution were not there,\u201d admitted that he \u201ccould not prove it.\u201d This officer, too, in taking appellant into custody, was simply following his usual procedure in such situations.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">Definitions of crime traditionally combine a wrongful intent with a guilty act in a causal relationship to a consummated social harm. None of these characteristics is to be found in vagrancy prosecutions, which present instead \u201cthe astounding spectacle\u201d of \u201ccriminality with no misbehavior at all.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Into the making of \u201cvagrancy\u201d go such formless ingredients as \u201cloitering,\u201d \u201cwandering,\u201d \u201cleading an immoral and profligate life,\u201d and \u201cgood account,\u201d concepts featuring a suspicion that a crime is being or might be committed.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Essentially all that has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in a vagrancy prosecution is that the accused was observed under circumstances deemed questionable. Charges of vagrancy thus make possible criminal convictions based on conjecture rather than on evidence of criminality,<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> contrary to the most fundamental principles of our criminal jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-18\">The record exposes vagrancy enforcement as a device utilized not only to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>flict punishment for suspected but unprovable violations in progress but also, through preventive conviction and incarceration, to suppress crime in the future. By this theory of vagrancy administration, a police officer testifed, \u201cundesirables\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> are swept from the streets into prison because \u201cif they are not out there, the crime can\u2019t be committed.\u201d \u201c[I]n practical effect,\u201d the witness acknowledged, \u201cvagrancy is used as a charge or ground for arrest in cases where you feel there is prostitution or sodomy going on but you cannot make a case. * * It is used to get the undesirables off the street.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he good effect of this statute,\u201d the witness continued, \u201cis that it puts people in jail who might be about to commit a crime or who might commit a crime in the near future,\u201d and \u201chelps to lower the crime rate of the precinct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">According to another officer, a vagrancy arrest may be preferred to an arrest for another crime, though known to be in commission, because the arrested \u201cperson might be a real smooth operator and I might not be able to catch them doing these other things.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The Corporation Counsel\u2019s chief prosecutor testified that \u201cyou certainly don\u2019t have to wait until a person goes in and engages in the act of prostitution before you can see fit to arrest that person for being a vagrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-12\">We agree with Judge Greene that the \u201cbasic design [of the vagrancy law] is one of preventive conviction imposed upon those who because of their background and behavior are more likely than the general public to commit crimes, and that the statute contemplates such convictions even though no overt criminal act has been committed or can be proved.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> And Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s sage observation lays bare the part that statutory vagueness plays in the realization of that objective:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-13\">\u201c[S]tatute[s] of the type that seek , to control \u2018vagrancy\u2019 * * * are in a class by themselves, in view of the; familiar abuses to which they are put; * * * Definiteness is designedly avoided so as to allow the net to be cast at large, to enable men to be caught who are vaguely undesirable in the eyes of police and prosecution, although not chargeable with any particular offense. In short, these \u2018vagrancy statutes\u2019 and laws against \u2018gangs\u2019<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> are not fenced in by the text of the statute or by the subject matter so as to give notice of conduct to be avoided.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1165-16\">We do not gainsay the importance of crime prevention or the need for effective measures to combat transgression of the criminal law. But as desirable as these goals are,<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> they can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>not be achieved through techniques that trample on constitutional rights.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Many years ago this court held that a citizen cannot be punished merely for being \u201ca suspicious person.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Statistical likelihood that a particular societal segment will engage in criminality is not permissible as an all-out substitute for proof of individual guilt.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> And not even past violation of the criminal law authorizes one\u2019s subjection to innately vague statutory specifications of crime.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">We conclude, then, that subsections (1), (3) and (8) of the general vagrancy statute must fall for unconstitutional vagueness. We accordingly reverse the judgment of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals with direction to remand the case to the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions for dismissal of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">It may be appropriate to add a final word on the scope and nature of our ruling. Our opinion has been cast in relatively narrow doctrinal terms and passes on only those particular statutory sections involved in the information against appellant. As we have suggested in our opinion, besides the need for adequate notice to both the public and enforcement officials of what conduct constitutes criminal activity, other constitutionally protected interests may be infringed by vagrancy statutes such as those before us. While we have not relied on these doctrines, we do not wish to suggest that they are inapplicable or of less dignity than those upon which we base our ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-13\">We are also aware that our ruling, as a matter of stare decisis, undercuts the validity of other sections of both the general vagrancy statute and narcotic vagrancy legislation. Our silence as to the validity of these sections does not indicate any reservation about extending our holding to cover them in appropriate cases. We do not rule on those sections now because their validity was not argued nor is decision on them necessary for resolution of the case before us. We add this word, fully aware that it is dictum, to avoid constriction of the scope of the ruling by all concerned, including those in the legislative and executive branches.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-14\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1154-11\">.

A number of years ago, the Corporation Counsel advised the police department as to the type and quantum of evidence deemed essential to successful prosecutions under the vagrancy statute. In turn, a memorandum from the Deputy Chief of Police, addressed on March 23, 1954, to the entire force, imparted to law enforcement officers information as to the number and features of ob-serrations to be made in each type of case encompassed by the law. The memorandum stated that a suspected prostitute under observation should be engaged in conversation to determine her reason for being on the street at late hours, and that a record should be kept of the observations and conversations so that \u201cthe explanations given by the suspected person * * * may be used in court.\u201d Testimony at the trial of this ease indicated that suspected vagrants are to be observed three times over a period of 45 days.

Moreover, the suspicion may sometimes be even further removed, as Judge Greene found it was here: \u201cThe officers testified that defendant Ricks is leading an immoral and profligate life because they believed her to be a prostitute. This suspicion of prostitution, in turn, rests primarily upon her presence in the doorway of an establishment which the officers suspected of being a house of ill fame.
