BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">This case, simple in setting but not so easy of determination, is before us as an interlocutory appeal, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(b). The appeal presents the single issue of whether a partnership may be sued under the special venue provisions of the Jones Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in a district in which the partnership is doing business but in which neither the partnership\u2019s principal office is located nor any partner resides. It splices the main brace to state it in more realistic terms. The question is whether the cherished ward of the admiralty \u2014 a seaman, whether salt water, pure and unadulterated or of a <em>Sieracki-Ryan-Yaka </em>variety \u2014 who sustains an injury on navigable waters within or offshore of Louisiana, must, in making a Jones Act claim against the multimillion dollar shipowner-employer whose extensive operations are widely scattered over the nation, the high seas and perhaps the terrestrial globe,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pursue this employer in Dallas, Texas, where the dream of oceangoing vessels up the Trinity is an enticing but unrealized community hope and where the admiralty Judge must dispense his justice not from any juridical quarterdeck but from a non-nautical bench high and dry above maritime waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-11\">The District Court held that venue in the Eastern District (in addition to the Northern District \u2014 Dallas) was proper.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>We </em>affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-12\">The Seamen<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> sued Shipowner in the Eastern District of Texas for damages under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 688. Shipowner, a partnership whose partners reside in Dallas, Texas, and whose principal office is in Dallas (see notes 2, 3, <em>supra), </em>filed a motion seeking to have the action either dismissed or transferred to the Northern District of Texas. The motion was denied by the District Judge. This Court granted a \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>1292(b) interlocutory appeal from that ruling, which appeared to be on a controlling question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">The special venue provision of the Jones Act (note 1, <em>supra) </em>reads: \u201cJurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">It has long been settled that even though this provision reads in jurisdictional terms, it refers to venue only. Pure Oil Co. v. Suarez, 1966, 384 U.S. 202, 86 S.Ct. 1394, 16 L.Ed.2d 474, 1966 A.M.C. 1117; Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, 1924, 264 U.S. 375, 44 S.Ct. 391, 68 L.Ed. 748. As this statute was originally enacted and interpreted, \u201cresidence\u201d for a partnership would most certainly have been limited to the residences of the individual partners. McCullough v. Jannson, 9 Cir., 1923, 292 F. 377. But Seamen contend that the expanded concept of corporate residence for venue purposes, as set forth in 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1391(c)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, is applicable to this large business organization sued as a shipowner under the Jones Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-15\">At the outset, certain things warrant emphasis. First, there is no question of subject-matter jurisdiction which rests on the Jones Act, a federal statute. Second, on jurisdiction over the person there is no doubt that Shipowner had sufficient contracts with the Eastern District to be amenable to <em>in personam </em>process under F.R.Civ.P. 4(d) (3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Last, for a federal statutory claim, F.R.Civ.P. 17(b) (1),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> accords partnerships <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>express capacity to be sued. Of greatest importance is the fact that <em>jurisdiction </em>is in no sense in question, so this case does not involve the problem confronting the Supreme Court in United Steelworkers of America v. Bouligny, 1965, 382 U.S. 145, 86 S.Ct. 272, 15 L.Ed.2d 217. There the Court held that for purposes of diversity jurisdiction an unincorporated association was not a citizen and that its citizenship was that of its individual members.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">The problem comes down to the purely procedural question whether a multistate unincorporated business organization \u201cresides\u201d or has a \u201cresidence\u201d for Jones Act venue purposes in a district in which it is doing business, but which is not the location of its principal office or the place where its owner-partners live. We answer this question in the affirmative. Since in that answer we draw directly on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that corporate venue standards apply to give meaning to \u201cresidence\u201d or similar concepts concerning unincorporated associations, we are led to the subsidiary question whether for <em>venue </em>purposes \u2014 we repeat, venue\u2014 there can be any recognizable difference between the unincorporated partnership and the unincorporated association. That we answer in the negative. In this binary world, that plus and minus adds up to affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">A good place to start is Pure Oil Co. v. Suarez, <em>supra, </em>because it deals with this very part of the Jones Act. In that case the Supreme Court held<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that in a suit against a corporation under the Jones Act, venue was proper in a state that was neither the state of incorporation nor the place of the principal office, but in which the corporation was doing business. This inverted form of statutory interpretation, reading the general provision of \u00a7 1391(c) into the specific provision of the Jones Act was thought justifiable in light of the liberalizing policy of \u00a7 1391(c) and the generality of the language used. Thus the word \u201cresidence\u201d as used in the Jones Act was thought to do nothing more than refer to general doctrines of venue rules, which might change from time to time. The change might come from legislative or judicial action or a combination of both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-9\">But the quest cannot end there. For a partnership is not a corporation, even though persuasive arguments may be made that the entity theory of partnerships has now so engulfed the aggregate theory as to make nice distinctions between the two forms of business associations almost meaningless.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But while the <em>Suarez </em>Court did not decide our specific question, it did accomplish a number of things. It established the principle that venue provisions of the Jones Act should receive treatment consistent with the liberal application of that legislation. Next, it recognized that the legislative addition of \u00a7 1391(c) was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>\u201cto bring venue law in tune with modern concepts of corporate operations.\u201d 384 U.S. at 204, 86 S.Ct. at 1395, 16 L.Ed.2d at 476. To this end the change was held to be applicable not only to the general diversity and federal-question venue provisions, \u00a7 1391(a) and (b), but also \u201cto all venue statutes using residence as a criterion, at least in the absence of contrary restrictive indications in any such statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 86 S.Ct. at 1396, 16 L.Ed.2d at 476. On that score, the Court concluded that \u201cthere is nothing to the legislative history of [the venue] provision of the Jones Act to indicate that its framers meant to use \u2018residence\u2019 as anything more than a referent to more general doctrines of venue rules, which might alter in the future. Id. at 205, 86 S.Ct. at 1396, 16 L.Ed.2d at 477 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">Perhaps with this liberal approach nothing more would have been needed to reach our result here. But we are spared the travail of speculating whether a small step by that Court would have meant a big leap for us unaided by any decision subsequent to <em>Suarez </em>for the recent case of Denver &amp; R. G. W. R. R. v. Brotherhood of R. R. Trainmen, 1967, 387 U.S. 556, 87 S.Ct. 1746, 18 L.Ed.2d 954, affords an adequate gravitational basis. In that case the defendant was an unincorporated association \u2014 a labor union. The Court reaffirmed that for venue purposes the defendant should be suable as an entity and recognized that the critical factor was the residence of the entity, rather than the residence of the individual members of the association. Faced with the question of where that entity \u201cresided\u201d, the Court then proceeded to hold for the first time that an unincorporated association should be analogized to a corporation. With that it applied to the assimilated \u201ccorporation\u201d \u00a7 1391(c), which in 1948 brought in for corporate venue any district in which the corporation was \u201cdoing business.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Until this decision the lower courts had been hopelessly divided on the question of where proper venue lay for an unincorporated association.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-12\">The decision in the <em>Denver </em>case leads inevitably to the conclusion that if two seamen were suing an unincorporated association such as a labor union for injuries sustained in the operations of an excursion vessel owned and operated by the union as a shipowner, then venue under \u00a7 688 could properly be laid wherever that unincorporated-business-association-shipowner was doing business, for that would be one of its \u201cresidences\u201d for venue purposes. But, is it much of a step from <em>Denver\u2019s </em>holding to <em>a </em>holding in the present case that this huge unincorporated business enterprise should likewise be treated as \u201cresiding\u201d wherever \u201cit is doing business\u201d? That query leads to two further questions. First, is the holding in <em>Denver </em>to be broadly construed or is it to be limited to labor unions ? Second, for <em>venue </em>purposes, are there any significant differences between a partnership and an unincorporated association ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-13\">As to the first- \u2014 the scope of the holding in <em>Denver </em>\u2014 we perceive no great difficulty. Venue is primarily a ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>tion of convenience for litigants and witnesses, Denver &amp; R. G. W. R. R. Co. v. Brotherhood of R. R. Trainmen, 1967, 387 U.S. at 560, 87 S.Ct. at 1748, 18 L.Ed.2d at 958, and venue provisions should be treated in practical terms. Rutland Ry. Corp. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng., 2 Cir., 1962, 307 F.2d 21, 29, <em>cert. denied, </em>1963, 372 U.S. 954, 83 S.Ct. 949, 9 L.Ed.2d 978. These guidelines become especially applicable when dealing with the Jones Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To hold that labor unions will be the only unincorporated associations to be likened to corporations would be to exclude myriad other unincorporated associations, many of them very large, such as agricultural societies, co-ops, banking associations, charitable associations, news associations, and religious societies, from the sound result of the <em>Denver </em>decision. This would force the law back to the restrictive rule allowing unincorporated associations other than labor unions to be sued only at the location of their principal place of business. Not only would that be illogical, but it would subject litigants bringing suit against such associations to unfair, discriminatory burdens. Furthermore, it would run counter to the general trend to allow suits to be brought at the place liabilities are being created.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">On the second question, exploring the legal theory behind an unincorporated association to determine the difference between that form of enterprise and a partnership can certainly be an exercise in futility. Platitudes and generalities abound. Most are question begging. New sharp legal boundaries appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-9\">The definition of an association given in 7 C.J.S. Associations \u00a7 1, at p. 19, is as good as any: \u201cAn \u2018association\u2019 is a body of persons acting together, without a charter, but upon the methods and forms used by corporations, for the prosecution of some common enterprise.\u201d In Houghton v. Grimes, 1926, 100 Vt. 99, 135 A. 15, 18, the Court said that \u201c[a]t common law an unincorporated association, as regards its rights and liabilities, is fundamentally a large partnership.\u201d And in People v. Brander, 1910, 244 Ill. 26, 91 N.E. 59, the Court was on safe ground in simply saying that \u201cthe term \u2018association\u2019 is a word of vague meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-10\">On the other hand, a partnership nominally has a well-defined meaning. \u201cA partnership is an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.\u201d Uniform Partnership Act \u00a7 6(1). On the basis of this definition, one of the immediate distinctions urged by Shipowner is that an unincorporated association may be formed for some political or benevolent enterprise, while a partnership is nearly always formed to earn a profit. We think this is bad economics and, at least, incomplete law. Worse, for venue purposes the distinction is meaningless. An unincorporated association formed for the most worthy of non-profit purposes could still create liabilities where it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>doing business.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Extending this argument, Shipowner urges that since many unincorporated associations \u2014 especially unions \u2014 have grown so large and pervasive in their influence, the Supreme Court opted to hold them suable where they were doing business. But partnerships, too, can grow to immense proportions, as Shipowner\u2019s activities attest. It operates under an assumed name, employs over seven hundred people, owns twenty-five drilling rigs, and operates in at least three states and on the high seas. (See note 2 <em>supra). </em>Of all things, the most irrelevant is the domicile or residence of those individuals who happen to own the enterprise. It acts like a business. It acts like a big business. It is a big business.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The plea that partnership venue must be geared to the small neighborhood self-made business can hardly be voiced by this industrial Goliath. The problem does not arise until business activities expand geographically beyond personal residence (or principal place of business).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">The little case law and other authority on the problem almost all point toward treating unincorporated associations and partnerships the same for venue purposes. In Joscar Co. v. Consolidated Sun Ray, Inc., E.D.N.Y., 1963, 212 F.Supp. 634, the Court expressly held that partnerships should be treated no differently from unincorporated associations for venue purposes. To the same effect is American Football League v. National Football League, D.Md., 1961, 27 F.R.D. 264. Since the enactment of \u00a7 1391(c) in 1948, the only case based on a federal question (rather than diversity of citizenship)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that has considered the issue is Hadden v. Small, N.D.Ohio, 1951, 145 F.Supp. 387. In <em>Hadden </em>the Court recognized that reason and logic pointed toward holding a partnership suable where it was doing business, but stated that in its view the change should come from Congress. As pointed out earlier (notes 6, 7, <em>supra), </em>two provisions of the rules are persuasive in indicating an assimilation. F.R.Civ.P. 17(b) (1) gives \u201ca partnership or other unincorporated association\u201d capacity to sue and be sued in federal question cases. Rule 4(d) (3) outlines the requirements for service of process upon \u201ca partnership or other unincorporated association.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In these rules the partnership is not only recognized as an entity but is assimilated into the generic term \u201cunincorporated association.\u201d The notes of the Advisory Committee and the commentary make clear that Rule 17(b) did not change the law concerning the capacity to sue or be sued but merely codified existing case law. Rule 17(b) is based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>primarily on <em>Coronado. </em>(United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., 1922, 259 U.S. 344, 42 S.Ct. 570, 66 L.Ed. 975). In <em>Denver </em>the Court said: \u201cThe Coronado case dealt with capacity to be sued, not with venue, but it did legitimate suing the unincorporated association as an entity. Although that entity has no citizenship independent of its members for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, * * * we think that the question of the proper venue for such a defendant, like the question of capacity, should be determined by looking to the residence of the association itself rather than that of its individual members.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Court then went on to hold: \u201cWe think it most nearly approximates the intent of Congress to recognize the reality of the multi-state, unincorporated association such as a labor union and to permit suit against that entity, like the analogous corporate entity, wherever it is \u2018doing business.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">This tiny step of assimilating partnerships with unincorporated associations for venue purposes is in keeping with the strong trend \u2014 judicial and legislative \u2014 toward making modern business entities amenable to suit in places where their business activities give rise to liabilities and obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-23\">Thus, while the Venue Act of 1887<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> severely limited venue from what it had been since 1789,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the trend since that time has been expansive. In 1939 the Supreme Court held that a corporation licensed to do business in a state had thereby consented to suit there.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Then in 1948 Congress provided in \u00a7 1391(c) for corporate venue in any of three places \u2014 where incorporated, where licensed to do business, and where doing business.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In 1963 Congress further expanded venue by providing that tort claims arising from the use of automobiles could be brought where the act or omission occurred.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In 1966, this provision restricted to automobiles was repealed <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and now all suits<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>brought where the cause of action arose<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> All changes, legislative and judicial, have been designed to effectuate one purpose \u2014 to make the venue provisions serve litigants and witnesses, not to allow nice but meaningless distinctions to place stumbling blocks in their way.</p>\n<p id=\"ASJD\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">.

In considering the venue cases, Shipowner has failed to make a distinction that must be kept in mind. The cases arising on diversity jurisdiction have apparently proceeded on the reasoning that since F.R.Civ.P. 17(b) requires the court to look to state law to determine capacity to sue and be sued, state law should also determine whether an unincorporated association or partnership is an entity and has a separate residence for venue purposes. See Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Karchmar, S.D.N.Y., 1960, 180 F.Supp. 727; Harris Mfg. Co. v. Williams, W.D. Ark., 1957, 157 F.Supp. 779; Koons v. Kaiser, S.D.N.Y., 1950, 91 F.Supp. 511.

Thus to \u00a7 1391(c) and the impact given it by <em>Suarez, supra, </em>on the limited venue provisions of the Jones Act must now be added the locality-of-claim standard of amended \u00a7 1391(a) and (b), see note 27 <em>supra. </em>Although enacted subsequent to the filing of these suits, the amendment, as a procedural change, is fully effective retrospectively.

Thus, even on the most favorable statutory reading, Dallas (the Northern District) ceases to be the exclusive place for suit. As to the injury occurring on inland waters, Louisiana is clearly available. And for offshore injury the outer Continental Lands Act may encompass Louisiana. See Rodrigue v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Serv. Co., 1969, 395 U.S. 352, 89 S.Ct. 1835, 23 L.Ed.2d 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-25\">This statutory development shows why we ought not to read too literally footnote 5 in <em>Suarez, </em>which rejected the argument that the Court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1391 (c) was unacceptable because it would make the \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d standard superfluous. Change occurs. Here the 1966 <em>Suarez </em>must bend to 1967 <em>Denver.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
