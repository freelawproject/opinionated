This conviction was affirmed by this court on June 29, 1966. United States v. Schipani, 2 Cir. 1966, 362 F.2d 825. Certiorari was denied on November 7, 1966, 385 U.S. 934, 87 S.Ct. 293, 17 L.Ed.2d 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">On November 30, 1966, the Solicitor General filed a supplemental memorandum in the Supreme Court advising the Court that material evidence against appellant was based in part on electronic surveillance and suggesting that by reason of this taint the \u201cCourt vacate its order denying certiorari, grant certiorari, vacate the judgment of the court of appeals, and remand the cause to the district court for a new trial, should the government seek to prosecute the petitioner anew.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 12, 1966, acting \u201c(u)pon the suggestion of the Solicitor General and upon an independent examination of the case,\u201d the Supreme Court remanded to the district court \u201cfor a new trial should the Government seek to prosecute petitioner anew.\u201d 385 U.S. 372, 87 S.Ct. 533, 17 L.Ed.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-16\">Following remand, appellant filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of any electronic surveillance. A full evidentiary hearing on the motion commenced May 6, 1968, and continued for five days. The Government made full disclosure of all available information relating to electronic surveillance of any conversations in which appellant had participated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, Judge Weinstein suppressed all evidence introduced at the first trial relating to appellant\u2019s \u201clikely sources of income\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and otherwise denied the motion. United States v. Schipani, E.D.N.Y.1968, 289 F.Supp. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-17\">At the second trial, the entire record of the first trial was received in evidence as an exhibit, pursuant to a stipulation entered into by the Government, appellant, and appellant\u2019s trial counsel. Since \u201clikely source\u201d evidence had been excluded, the Government\u2019s case rested solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>on a negation of all non-taxable sources of income, a theory approved in United States v. Massei, 1958, 355 U.S. 595, 78 S.Ct. 495, 2 L.Ed.2d 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">Following detailed findings, the court concluded: \u201cDuring each of the years charged in the indictment the defendant had substantial taxable income greatly in excess of six hundred dollars. During each of these years he should have paid a substantial income tax. He failed to file income tax returns and concealed his income wilfully in order to defraud the government of income taxes due by him to the government. The government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime charged for each of the years charged in the indictment. The defendant is guilty as charged on all counts.\u201d United States v. Schipani, E.D.N.Y.1968, 293 F.Supp. 156, 163, 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-8\">Appellant first questions the propriety of the proceedings upon remand and contends that the Government could not constitutionally retry the case on the basis of \u201cfirst-trial proofs.\u201d He argues that the ruling of the district court that there was sufficient taint-free evidence to permit a retrial on the same evidence constituted a \u201ccollateral finding\u201d that \u201cthe Supreme Court of the United States was \u2018in error\u2019 in having adjudicated to the contrary in deciding the same electronic issues in December, 1966, on the merits and \u2018upon an independent examination of the case.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-9\">We do not so read the Court\u2019s opinion. It is significant that the Supreme Court, after its \u201cindependent examination of the case,\u201d did not order a dismissal. Appellant had petitioned for a \u201cremand with direction to vacate the judgment of conviction and to dismiss the indictment.\u201d The Court did not grant the petition but instead provided expressly for a \u201cnew trial should the Government seek to prosecute * * * anew.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Had the Court intended the construction placed upon its order by appellant, it would have granted his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-16\">Clearly it was necessary to determine in some manner what evidence was tainted. This the district court did in an extended suppression hearing, with complete disclosure to appellant by the Government of all available information in the Government\u2019s files and with an opportunity to cross-examine the key agents and investigators who had any knowledge of the electronic surveillance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1321-17\">The <em>per curiam </em>opinion of the Supreme Court did not hold or even suggest that all evidence at the first trial was tainted by electronic surveillance. The Court had been advised by the Solicitor General that some of the leads and evidence were tainted. Neither the Solicitor General nor the Supreme Court had the benefit of the careful analysis and testimony with respect to the sources of all evidence which were available to the district court as a result of the suppression hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1321-18\">The evidence at the suppression hearing disclosed that the F.B.I. had been compiling information on appellant since 1958. In a report dated October 10, 1960, the defendant was described by one source as \u201cone of the most influential and most powerful figures in New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>underworld\u201d and \u201cconsidered to be associated with several of New York\u2019s top hoodlums\u201d. (289 F.Supp. at p. 46). The first information obtained by electronic surveillance was in 1961 through an investigation of Michael Clemente and covered the \u201cPrisco Travel Bureau, a \u2018front\u2019 for Clemente\u2019s criminal activities and a meeting place for many of New York\u2019s top mobsters.\u201d Although appellant was not the subject of that electronic surveillance, nine conversations in which he participated and 27 others in which he was discussed or his name was mentioned were electronically monitored (P- 47).</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">The district court properly examined all of the evidence in the first trial to determine whether all or only a part was tainted by the electronic surveillance, and whether any untainted portion was independent of and distinguishable from that which was tainted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After a full hearing the court, in a careful opinion, first recognized that \u201cevidence is admitted if it is obtained from an untainted \u2018independent source\u2019 but excluded if it is obtained as the result of illegality\u201d; that evidence discovered \u201cas a result of both legal and illegal leads\u201d is inadmissible, even though \u201cthe legal lead would itself probably have sufficed to uncover the evidence\u201d (289 F.Supp. at p. 54); and that the Government is required to \u201cprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence it introduces was legally obtained\u201d (at p. 59).</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-14\">Applying the foregoing rules, the court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the only tainted evidence was that relating to a likely source of income; that the \u201c(o)ther evidence of defendant\u2019s net worth was proved beyond a reasonable doubt to be untainted\u201d (at p. 61); that the investigation was not intensified by reason of any tainted information,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that it was \u201chighly likely that the government would have launched a saturation investigation * * * even if no information had been received from electronic surveillance of the Prisco Travel Bureau\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (at p. 64).</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-15\">We approve the legal principles applied. The findings were not clearly erroneous. They were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-17\">Appellant\u2019s next contention that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction was considered by this court on the appeal from the first conviction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>As noted <em>supra, </em>at each trial the Government relied on the \u201cnet worth\u201d theory.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The evidence of \u201clikely source\u201d income accepted at the first trial was excluded at the second trial. The evidence negating non-taxable income, however, was identical at the two trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">In affirming the first conviction, this court found that the \u201ctotality of circumstances shown by the evidence\u201d supported the conclusion that no \u201ccash hoard\u201d ever existed; that the \u201cabsence of such a reserve fund was established as part of the Government\u2019s prima facie case\u201d and appellant \u201cremained quiet at his own peril.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The opinion pointed out that the appellant had not suggested any \u201cnon-taxable sources other than a cash hoard\u201d and that \u201cthe Government negatived all other reasonably possible sources from which Schipani could have acquired non-taxable funds.\u201d It was held that, \u201cUnder the circumstances, proof of \u2018a likely source\u2019 of net worth increases is not necessary,\u201d relying on United States v. Massei, <em>supra, </em>and other cases cited. (362 F.2d at 830.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">We adhere to our conclusion that it was not necessary to rely upon a \u201clikely source\u201d of net worth to sustain a conviction, and hold that after the elimination of all evidence of \u201ca likely source,\u201d the evidence was still sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-10\">With respect to appellant\u2019s contention that the Government failed to establish the element of \u201cwillfulness,\u201d Judge Weinstein sets forth in detail the factors showing \u201ca pattern consistent only with that of a guilty mind\u201d (293 F.Supp. at 161). We agree with his conclusion. The factors enumerated in his opinion are essentially the same as those considered by this court in its prior decision (362 F.2d at 831).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-12\">This court also considered on the prior appeal appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the prison record of a statement given by appellant to a prison official in February, 1943, that he had only $1350 in cash which he had left with his wife. The statement was offered to show appellant\u2019s net worth in 1943 as a starting point in proving his net worth at the beginning of the indictment period. The statement was given in the course of a routine interrogation by prison authorities relating to Schipani\u2019s personal history. It was unrelated to any pending investigation of a criminal offense, and particularly bore no relationship to the present case, which was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>initiated until many years later. We adhere to our prior holding that there is no basis for appellant\u2019s claims that this statement constituted an involuntary or incriminatory statement in violation of appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights and was an unlawful search and seiz\u00fare in violation of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">Finally, appellant complains of the conduct of the trial judge, first in \u201crefashioning * * * an indispensable element in the formulation and proof of the indictment charges.\u201d In the first trial, the Government relied upon the \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d arising from the failure to file returns in pre-indictment years. This court held this approach improper, and the trial judge properly called this conclusion to the Government\u2019s attention. In following the suggestion of this court (362 F.2d at 829-830) the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">Nor is there merit in appellant\u2019s contention that he was denied a fair trial by the \u201cinfection of the record with reference to his alleged notorious criminal background.\u201d As noted <em>supra, </em>appellant resisted the Government\u2019s motion to withdraw its consent to a trial without jury. The motion was denied by reason of the trial court\u2019s conclusion that there was \u201ca substantial danger that the defendant will be severely prejudiced if he is tried before a jury\u201d (44 F.R.D. at 463), based in large part upon the testimony in the suppression hearing with respect to defendant\u2019s criminal activities. In an order entered October 14, 1968, Judge Weinstein granted appellant\u2019s motion to strike all references to appellant\u2019s alleged background of illicit activities, saying in part: \u201cThe Court will not base its decision on the defendant\u2019s criminal background, if any.\u201d We find no evidence that the trial court gave any weight to the evidence of appellant\u2019s criminal activities in arriving at the guilty verdict. The proof was sufficient without considering this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-13\">Appellant also complains of the court\u2019s reference to appellant\u2019s \u201cdemean- or and general appearance,\u201d in view of the fact that appellant did not take the stand. We agree with the district court that, \u201cThe trier\u2019s observation of the non-witness defendant\u2019s demeanor and general appearance may be \u2014 and almost invariably is \u2014 considered by him in evaluating evidence introduced at the trial (citing cases).\u201d Moreover, Judge Weinstein specifically stated that \u201c * * * the conclusion that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt was reached solely on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1320-6\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1320-7\">\u201cAny person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1320-8\">. Prior to the first trial the parties had waived a jury. Before the second trial the Government moved to withdraw its consent to trial without jury. The motion was resisted and denied, the court holding that the Government\u2019s waiver covered \u201cthe above entitled case\u201d rather than a particular trial. United States v. Schipani, E.D.N.Y.1968, 44 F.R.D. 461.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1320-9\">. The memorandum set forth that it had come to the attention of the Solicitor General that appellant had been a participant in a number of conversations which had been electronically monitored as a result of trespass. The Solicitor General was unable on the basis of information then available to \u201csay * * * that none of the evidence used by the government at petitioner\u2019s trial was obtained, either directly or indirectly, from an improper source.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1320-18\">. With respect to the evidence presented at the hearing, the court said in part: \u201cThe Government has freely revealed all data available to it. It has presented all the surveillance logs of conversations in which the defendant participated or was mentioned, the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division of the Treasury Department, the Intelligence Division of the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of Justice, and the testimony of the many agents and attorneys in the 1961-1963 investigations of the defendant and the 1966 review of their work by the Department of Justice. In addition, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \u2018case agent\u2019 assigned to the Schipani investigation reviewed all the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports relating to the defendant and underlined all information obtained as a result of electronic surveillance\u201d (289 F.Supp. at p. 45).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1320-20\">. Each time the case was tried on the \u201cnet worth\u201d theory. At the first trial the Government offered evidence of \u201clikely sources\u201d of income, as well as negating all nontaxable sources of income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1321-10\">. A similar procedure of remand for an exclusionary hearing was followed in United States v. Wade, 1967, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149; Gilbert v. California, 1967, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1321-12\">. The evidence adduced at the suppression hearing included \u201ca painstaking analysis of all the evidence introduced\u201d in the first trial, prepared by the Special Agent of Intelligence in charge of the Sehipani investigation, with a member of the staff of the United States Attorney. \u201cThe products of their labors was a comprehensive chart which denotes a specific source or sources for each witness and piece of evidence (including 292 exhibits) introduced at the trial\u201d (289 F.Supp. at p. 49).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1321-20\">. The same is true of the memorandum prepared by James Dewey O\u2019Brien, then the Assistant Chief of the Criminal Section of the Tax Division, upon which appellant heavily relies in support of his contention that all first trial proofs were tainted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">. The proper test is: \u201c(W)hether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means suf- . ficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d Wong Sun v. United States, 1963, 371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417, 9 L.Ed.2d 441; Hoffa v. United States, 1966, 385 U.S. 293, 309, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374; United States v. Wade, 1967, 388 U.S. 218, 241, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1322-9\">. \u201cThe government has established by a preponderance of evidence and possibly by clear and convincing proof \u2014 though not beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 that the intensity of its investigation by Intelligence and the Alcohol Tax Division was not affected by tainted information.\u201d 289 F.Supp. at p. 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-12\">The court had previously concluded that proof showing that the intensity of the investigation was not the result of tainted information was satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1322-18\">. In reaching this conclusion the court relied in part upon the untainted E.B.I. report of October 10, 1960, <em>supra, </em>and \u201cadditional leads * * * through acceptable investigative techniques. Defendant had never filed an income tax return although he obviously enjoyed a high standard of living. Immediately after the investigation began, the defendant appeared so vulnerable and the likelihood that an income tax investigation would prove fruitful was so great, that government agents would naturally focus on him\u201d (289 F.Supp. at p. 64).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1322-21\">. In view of the factual background contained in the prior opinion of this court (362 F.2d 825) and the detailed findings of Judge Weinstein in his order following the suppression hearing (289 F.Supp. 43) and in his opinion following trial (293 F.Supp. 156), we do not deem it necessary to set forth the evidence in detail in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">. In a net worth case, the Government \u201cattempts to establish an \u2018opening net worth\u2019 or total net value of the taxpayer\u2019s assets at the beginning of a given year. It then proves increases in the taxpayer\u2019s net worth for each succeeding year during the period under examination and calculates the difference between the adjusted net values of the taxpayer's assets at the beginning and end of each of the years involved. The taxpayer\u2019s nondeductible expenditures, including living expenses, are added to these increases, and if the resulting figure for any year is substantially greater than the taxable income reported by the taxpayer for that year, the Government claims the excess represents unreported taxable income. In addition, it asks the jury to infer willfulness from this understatement, when taken in connection with direct evidence of \u2018conduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to conceal.\u2019 Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492, 499 [63 S.Ct. 364, 368, 87 L.Ed. 418].\u201d Holland v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 121, 125, 75 S.Ct. 127, 130, 99 L.Ed. 150, rehearing denied 348 U.S. 932, 75 S.Ct. 334, 99 L.Ed. 731.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1323-15\">. Appellant did not offer any evidence at either trial, but relied on insufficiency of the Government\u2019s proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1323-16\">. Appellant recognizes that this issue was determined adversely to his contention in our opinion affirming conviction on the first appeal, but argues that the \u201cinartistic reference to a \u2018reasonably\u2019 proved negation of \u2018all possible\u201d non-taxable source under the <em>Massei </em>case\u201d was an unwarranted extension of the <em>Massei </em>rule and does not find support in other cases construing <em>Massei. </em>We find nothing in the cases cited by appellant contra to our construction of <em>Massei </em>as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1324-9\">.
