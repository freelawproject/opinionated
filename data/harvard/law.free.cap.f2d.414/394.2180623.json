Appellant, on conflicting evidence, was convicted by a jury of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (d). In the course of the bank robbery, appellant was alleged to have \u201cassaulted and put in jeopardy the life of teller Ernestine Cazares by the use of a pistol, a dangerous weapon and device.\u201d Because of certain matters urged in defense, including the defense of the insufficiency of the evidence to convict, we turn to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-19\">The teller, Ernestine Cazares, positively identified the defendant in court (R.T. 51-52) as the man who had approached her teller\u2019s window on November 28, 1968, laid a folded brown paper sack on her counter, said \u201cgive me all your money,\u201d and when she stared at him, \u201che reached into his left pocket and he pulled up a gun. He didn\u2019t point it at me. He just showed me that he had it. * * * [H]e reached it out of his pocket, but he didn\u2019t point it at me. * * * [I] saw it in his hand. He said \u2018all of it and hurry.\u2019 He reached over and picked up the money, I was afraid to scream or anything because I knew he had a gun and I didn\u2019t want anyone to get hurt. [R.T. 44-50.] I didn\u2019t become frightened until I saw the gun. He pulled it completely out of his pocket and showed it to me and then put it back in.\u201d (R.T. 55-56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-21\">A second bank employee also identified the appellant. Two finger print experts testified that the finger prints taken from teller Cazares\u2019 counter (Gov.\u2019s Ex. 4) matched those of defendant De Palma (Gov.\u2019s Ex. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-22\">Appellant\u2019s defense was an alibi; he contended that he had been at his job selling food from a catering truck. Had the jury believed the alibi, they would not have convicted appellant. But they apparently did not believe this defense. That is purely a matter for the trier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>fact to determine. We cannot disturb such a result, unless it clearly is contrary to any substantial evidence. Here it is not, particularly since we must view it in a light most favorable to the prosecution. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); Byrnes v. United States, 327 F.2d 825, 830 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">I. Sufficiency of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Appellant urges that the identification was weak. We cannot agree. The two eye witnesses plus the finger print testimony produce a strong case for the Government. There clearly is sufficient evidence to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Appellant next urges that there was no assault and no jeopardy. Again we cannot agree. While something more than a mere holdup with force and fear is required, physical attack or physical injury to some person is not required, although a dangerous weapon must be used to come within (d) of \u00a7 2113. The life of the person assaulted must be placed in an objective state of danger. Wagner v. United States, 264 F.2d 524, 530 (9th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">True, there was no direct evidence the gun was loaded. But as we said in <em>Wagner, supra, </em>the jury could infer it was. Mrs. Cazares inferred it was, as appellant wanted her to do, and as we think most reasonable persons could under the situation here described.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Appellant\u2019s brief states (Op.Brf. p. 12) that:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">\u201cHe did not display a gun or point a gun at the woman at any time, but at one stage pulled out the gun from his pocket so that it was visible, but that was all.\u201d But that was enough. We have quoted from the evidence, <em>supra, </em>to establish that the only reason the gun was exposed was to intimidate \u2014 there could be no other purpose. That was the threat and the assault on the teller.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">When a gun is exhibited by a person making an unauthorized demand for money, at a bank or a savings and loan company, it is an intimidation \u2014 a threat of reprisal and whether blatant or subtle, it is intended to enforce compliance by creating fear for one\u2019s life. <em>Cf., </em>United States v. Roach, 321 F.2d 1, 5 (3d Cir. 1963); Wheeler v. United States, 317 F.2d 615, 618 (8th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">II. Instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">Appellant urges that there was error in the' refusing of instructions; (a) with respect to the alibi claimed and (b) with respect to finger print evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">Each matter was fully covered by the trial judge\u2019s instructions (R.T. 391-93) which follow those suggested by Mathes and Devitt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">Appellant likewise objects to certain instructions given with respect to the definition of assault. Not only did appellant waive any objections to the instructions given at the trial (18 U.S.C., Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, R.T. 402), but the objections, by reason of what we have previously held, were not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">III. Failure to Grant Request of Jury to Re-read Certain Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-17\">This point is likewise not well taken. The reading of certain witnesses\u2019 testimony, after the jury retires, places emphasis on it, which might well result in the jury\u2019s failure to consider the evidence as a whole. This is particularly true when the defendant\u2019s evidence is diametrically opposed to that of the prosecution, or vice versa. Perhaps if any evidence is read, all should be read. Any trial could thus be almost endless.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-18\"> But we need not consider the various possibilities, for this matter lies almost exclusively in the good judgment of the judge presiding. It is within his sound discretion to determine if the jury\u2019s request should be granted or denied. Here the judge acted, and explained his reasons for so acting. He did not abuse the large discretion grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ed him, in our judgment. Tyler v. United States, 361 F.2d 862 (10th Cir. 1966); Gregory v. United States, 365 F.2d 203 (8th Cir. 1966); Patterson v. United States, 361 F.2d 632 (8th Cir. 1966); Pinckney v. United States, 352 F.2d 69 (5th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">IV. Use of Finger Prints as Violative of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Appellant\u2019s counsel urges that reversal is required in this case by reason of the very recent decision of the Supreme Court in Davis v. State of Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721, 89 S.Ct. 1394, 22 L.Ed.2d 676, decided April 22, 1969. It held that the use of finger prints is not beyond the proscriptions of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; unlawful search and seizure whether performed by Federal or State officers. But the Government\u2019s Exhibits 11 and 12, the fingerprint examples introduced into evidence by the prosecution, were taken from the appellant <em>after </em>there had been \u201cauthorization by a judicial officer for appellant\u2019s detention.\u201d The Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination \u201conly prevents the use against an accused of testimonial evidence obtained from him.\u201d Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Identifying physical characteristics are not evidence of a testimonial nature. Woods v. United States, 397 F.2d 156 (9th Cir. 1968); Gregory v. United States, 391 F.2d 281 (9th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Other points are raised in the briefs, but were not emphasized in oral argument. They either were based on a mistaken idea of the evidence, or on legal points not well taken. We find no merit in any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-19\">.
