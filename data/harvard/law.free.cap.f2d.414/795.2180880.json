Pagano admitted his one time possession of the money and is, therefore, not attacking the original turn-over order. He claims that he lost the entire sum in dice games in New York and Las Vegas with persons unknown at specific places, undisclosed or unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">The trial court found Pagano\u2019s denial of present possession and his explanation to be incredible. Maggio v. Zeitz, 333 U.S. 56, 76, 68 S.Ct. 401, 92 L.Ed. 476 (1948); O\u2019Hagan v. Blythe, 354 F.2d 83, 85 (2 Cir. 1965). We find no error in this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
