Parrish urges that the judgment of the district <em>court </em>must be reversed on the grounds that his guilty plea was not voluntarily entered and that he was denied a fair jury trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-19\">Parrish was indicted for rape, a capital offense. His retained attorney obtained the prosecuting attorney\u2019s agreement to recommend a ninety-nine year sentence if Parrish would plead guilty. After this agreement was obtained, appellant\u2019s mother went to the jail, along with his attorney and his sister-in-law. The mother pleaded with appellant to plead guilty and accept the ninety-nine year sentence. When Parrish acceded to her pleas, he was taken to the courthouse and his plea of guilty was formally entered before a jury selected from a panel of talesmen summoned by the court. Before being qualified, the jurors were asked by appellant\u2019s counsel only if they would abide by the recommendation of the district attorney to set punishment at ninety-nine years. After a brief deliberation, the jury assessed sentence in accordance with the plea bargain at ninety-nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-20\">Parrish maintains that under all the circumstances his plea of guilty was the result of \u201cmental coercion\u201d. In support of this position, he points to his limited education and youth; the psychological pressure created by his confinement for almost six months on \u201cdeath row\u201d in the city jail; the dramatic pleas of his mother and the pressure from his lawyer to plead guilty in order to escape the electric chair; threats by the prosecutor to \u201cburn\u201d him; the rushed court proceedings; and an inadequate determination of voluntariness at the acceptance of the plea. On balance, we conclude that appellant has failed to prove his plea of guilty was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>involuntary. The threat, admittedly made, was made an appreciable time, almost twelve months, before the plea was bargained. It is therefore unlikely that the force generated by the threat, if any, affected the plea subsequently entered on the advice of counsel. Appellant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony that he was threatened at the time of the plea could be and was rejected by the court below. Tyler v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1968, 391 F.2d 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The claim by appellant of involuntariness is grounded largely on his mother\u2019s persuasion. This appears to be an inadequate basis to vitiate the plea. See Kent v. United States, 1st Cir. 1959, 272 F.2d 795, 798; Brown v. United States, 5th Cir. 1953, 204 F.2d 298, 300. The court below found that prior to accepting appellant\u2019s plea of guilty the trial court admonished him of the consequences of his plea, and concluded that the plea \u201cwas voluntarily made after consultation with both his family and his attorney.\u201d These findings are not clearly erroneous. Cooper v. Holman, 5th Cir. 1966, 356 F.2d 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Appellant asserts he was deprived of a fair jury trial. The tales-men were selected from those present in the courthouse and as finally empaneled, consisted of two attorneys, two newspaper reporters, three deputy sheriffs and one investigator from the district attorney\u2019s office. Appellant contends that the jury was not composed of a cross-section of the community and that the jurors were improperly bound to the recommendation of the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The state advances two sound answers to his contention: First, the plea of guilty, knowingly and voluntarily entered, constitut\u00e9s a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects and defenses. Streets v. Wainwright, 5th Cir. 1968, 402 F.2d 87, 88. Second, there is no federal constitutional necessity for a jury to set punishment on a guilty plea. A jury was empaneled only because one was required at the time by Texas law in all capital cases. In essence, the facts of this case disclose that appellant entered a plea of guilty and received the sentence agreed upon as a result of plea bargaining. We have held that this is constitutionally permissible. Rogers v. Wainwright, 5th Cir. 1968, 394 F.2d 492; Hamilton v. Florida, 5th Cir. 1968, 390 F.2d 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b828-9\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING AND PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">Before BELL and THORNBERRY, Circuit Judges, and CHOATE, District Judge.</p>\n<author id=\"b828-12\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">The Petition for Rehearing is denied and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12) the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
