Donald Oster-gard was charged with aiding and abetting Caruso. Section 912 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-15\">Whoever falsely assumes or pretends to be ah officer or employee acting under the authority of the United States or any department, agency or officer thereof, and acts as such, or in such pretended character demands or obtains any money, paper, document, or thing of value, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. June 25, 1948, c. 645, 62 Stat. 742.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">The district court, sitting without a jury, adjudicated the defendants guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-17\">On appeal, the defendants\u2019 principal contention is that the Government failed to establish that Caruso pretended \u201cto be an officer or employee acting under the authority of the United States or any department, agency or officer thereof\u201d and \u201cin such pretended character\u201d obtained money from Norman.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-18\">The evidence shows that the defendants\u2019 scheme was based on the misrepresentation that Caruso was the Administrator of the Veterans Hospital in Coral Gables, Florida. First, Ostergard conned Norman into believing that Caruso, as Administrator, ran a betting pool at the hospital as good therapy for the patients. Ostergard offered to take Norman in as a partner in the betting pool. After a meeting with Caruso, who held himself out as the Administrator, Norman agreed to participate. \u201cBy golly\u201d, he testified, \u201cif [Caruso] is the Administrator, he must be a responsible man * * * [c]ertainly he\u2019s not a racketeer\u201d. Norman\u2019s naivete cost him $3,650 as his share of the losses the pool allegedly suffered. On these facts and on the record as a whole, we conclude that the evidence supports the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-19\">We find no merit in the appellants\u2019 second point that the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>failed to show that the office of administrator existed. \u201cIt is immaterial whether or not there was any government officer or employee with the precise title [the defendant] assumed * * *.\u201d Brafford v. United States, 6 Cir. 1919, 259 F. 511, 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
