Doughty v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1968, 396 F.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-28\"> The district court also found that the attack on the charge to the jury was without merit. It determined that the portion of the charge attacked by appellant was not so prejudicial as to violate constitutional standards when read in context as the law requires. January v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 31; Beck v. United States, 5 Cir. 1963, 317 F.2d 865, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 972, 84 S.Ct. 480, 11 L.Ed.2d 419. We agree. A jury charge is not to be read in segments, but in its totality. As so read the charge before us conforms to constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-29\">Finally, with respect to the trial court\u2019s failure to grant a motion for a new trial, we find, as did the district court, that the denial of such motion did not amount to a constitutional deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-30\">The judgment of the court below is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
