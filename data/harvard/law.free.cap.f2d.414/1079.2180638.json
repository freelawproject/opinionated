The ninth count charged conspiracy to violate \u00a7 1952 between April and June, 1965. Counts two and three were dismissed on motion of the Government and defendant was convicted of the remaining counts, sentenced to concurrent terms of 18 months, and fined $2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">Defendant is charged with operating a gambling enterprise in which he, or others acting in his behalf, sold the numbers of winning horses of races run at various locations across the country to customers who would pay in advance by Western Union money order. Various aliases were used by defendant who, until November 1966, received his information from Delaware Sports Service in Wilmington, Delaware, minutes after the race. Defendant\u2019s customers would use, or attempt to use, the winning numbers to place bets with bookmakers who did not yet know the race results.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s customers would call in advance and indicate in which future race or races they were interested, and defendant, upon receiving the numbers of the winners from his source, would immediately relay it by telephone from his two pizza restaurants in Chicago, Illinois to the customers. Although one customer called defendant from an Illinois location, all money orders were sent from other states. Each count in the indictment, except the conspiracy count, concerned a specific interstate transaction involving the use of Western Union money orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-11\">Defendant, on appeal, contends that the evidence did not support the district court\u2019s finding of guilty in that it did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant\u2019s use of interstate commerce facilities, his subsequent promotion of the unlawful activity, and his participation in a criminal offense. We shall discuss these issues in the order raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-13\">Defendant first asserts that the purpose of the payments made by his customers were not \u201csufficiently related to the defendant\u2019s alleged gambling enterprise to place interstate payment within the interdiction of Section 1952,\u201d and that there was no proof of scienter. These two alleged facts, it is argued, distinguish the instant case from United States v. Zizzo, 338 F.2d 577 (7th Cir. 1964). An examination of the record, however, reveals that the evidence, which this Court must view in the light most favorable to the Government,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was sufficient to support the conclusion that the defendant knowingly used, and caused to be used, interstate facilities to carry out the gambling enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-14\">The testimony of defendant\u2019s employee (an unindicted conspirator), Howard Easter, four of defendant\u2019s customers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>and defendant\u2019s own admissions to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> disclosed that defendant required his customers to send money orders via Western Union before he would release the requested information. Western Union employee Mace testified that defendant was a steady receiver of money orders which on their face disclosed their out-of-state origin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The relation of the payments to the gambling enterprise is manifested by defendant\u2019s own requirement of payment in advance before the wagering information would be released. His knowledge of the use of interstate commerce to carry on the unlawful activity was established by both his receipt of the money' orders and his requirement that they be sent to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">We therefore hold that the evidence was sufficient to support the finding, as required by \u00a7 1952, that defendant knowingly used interstate commerce in the gambling enterprise. United States v. Zizzo, <em>supra, </em>338 F.2d at 580, held that a defendant can validly be convicted of violating \u00a7 1952 if it is proved that he caused the interstate transaction to take place, rather than actually participated in it personally. We are of the opinion, in light of the evidence discussed above, that this holding applies to the case at bar, and that the court below properly found that defendant possessed the necessary knowledge to support conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-10\">Defendant next contends that the race results enterprise could not be found to violate the state law, and therefore could not violate \u00a7 1952, for two reasons: (1) the Illinois statute cannot be interpreted to proscribe the activities with which defendant was charged since Congress, through its enactment of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084, has pre-empted parallel state laws by occupying the field of transmission of wagering information; (2) defendant\u2019s alleged activities were \u201cbeyond the range\u201d of the state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-11\">1. Defendant\u2019s pre-emption argument is founded on the false notion that \u00a7 1084,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which is inapplicable to defendant in the instant case, was intended by Congress to occupy the field to the exclusion of parallel state legislation. In fact, the opposite is true. In Telephone News System, Inc. v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., 220 F.Supp. 621, 627 (N.D.Ill.1963), aff\u2019d per curiam, 376 U.S. 782, 84 S.Ct. 1134, 12 L.Ed.2d 83 (1964), a three-judge district court noted that the legislative history of \u00a7 1084 revealed that \u201cthe purpose of the bill is to assist the various states * * * in the enforcement of their laws pertaining to gambling * * * by prohibiting the use of wire communications facilities which are or will be used for the transmission of bets or wagers and gambling information in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 967, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>In Delaware Sports Service v. Diamond State Telephone Co., 241 F.Supp. 847, at 851 (D.Del.1965), aff\u2019d per curiam 355 F.2d 929 (3rd Cir. 1966), cert. den. 385 U.S. 817, 87 S.Ct. 38, 17 L.Ed.2d 55 the court rejected an argument similar to defendant\u2019s in the instant case, stating that \u201c * * * the purpose of the legislation [\u00a7 1084] was to \u2018aid\u2019 the states. Such a purpose is inconsistent with the contention of preemption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">We agree with the above authorities that Congress has not pre-empted the states from proscribing the transmission of gambling information. The very language of \u00a7 1084(c) compels this conclusion :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-7\">\u201cNothing contained in this section shall create immunity from criminal prosecution under any laws of any State * * *.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1139-8\">Therefore, the Illinois statute could be validly interpreted as embracing the activities in which defendant was accused of participating.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-9\">2. Defendant contends that the race results activities were beyond the scope of the Illinois statute, Ill.Rev.Stat., ch. 38, \u00a7 28-1 (a) (10), since there was allegedly no proof of defendant\u2019s participation in the transmission of \u201cwagers, betting odds, or changes in betting odds,\u201d and no proof as to the speed with which the transmissions were made. First of all, the statute covers <em>\u201cinformation as to \"wagers,\" </em>rather than merely the actual wagers themselves. The evidence elicited at defendant\u2019s trial amply supports the conclusion that defendant\u2019s activities came within those proscribed by the Illinois statute. See Telephone News System, Inc. v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., 210 F.Supp. 471, 476-477 (N.D.Ill.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-12\">Moreover, the drafters of the Illinois statute indicated that \u00a7 28-1 (a) (10) was \u201cdesigned to reach middlemen, agents, and other participants in the gambling racket who might not technically qualify as offenders under other subsections of this article.\u201d Tentative Final Draft of Proposed Illinois Revised Criminal Code of 1961, Committee Comments, pp. 307-308 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-13\">We reject defendant\u2019s contention that, since the statute was designed to apply only to \u201crapid\u201d transmissions of gambling information, the conviction must be reversed because the evidence allegedly failed to establish the essential time elements. The evidence, with all reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom, and when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> shows that the transmission of the information was \u201crapid\u201d indeed. Margaret Logue, an employee of Delaware Sports Service, testified that \u201cwithin seconds after the race was over\u201d the Sports Service would get the results and immediately give it to its customers, including defendant. Howard Easter, defendant\u2019s employee, testified that \u201c[j]ust a matter of seconds\u201d transpired between the receipt of the winning number from Delaware Sports Service and the relaying of the number to the defendant\u2019s customers. Thus, we find that there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of rapidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-14\">We similarly reject defendant\u2019s contention \u201cthat the Government failed to establish that proscribed information was transmitted by the defendant to persons directly or indirectly engaged in <em>illegal gambling </em>operations.\u201d The evidence showed that defendant\u2019s customers were engaged in placing past-post wagers with bookmakers. In United States v. Bergland, 318 F.2d 159, 161 (7th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>1963), cert. den. sub noxn. Cantrell v. United States, 375 U.S. 861, 84 S.Ct. 129, 11 L.Ed.2d 88, this Court noted that the Congressional Record indicated that \u201cpast-posting operations [were] one of the evils that Section 1084 [of Title 18, U.S.C.] would combat.\u201d Thus, since past-posting is illegal under \u00a7 1084 and since defendant\u2019s customers, to whom defendant transmitted the proscribed information, participated in this practice, all elements of \u00a7 28-1 (a) (10) of Chapter 38, Ill.Rev.Stat., were established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">Defendant\u2019s last contention is merely a catch-all, incorporating the prior arguments and concluding that there was no proof of defendant\u2019s participation in any criminal offense or conspiracy. Defendant argues that he was never identified as the person who effected any transmission of proscribed information, that the testimony of the four customers was uncorroborated, unworthy of belief, inaccurate, conelusory, and defective in never having revealed the content of any of the transactions, and that defendant was not proved to have had \u201cknowledge of any actual or anticipated illegal use of the information transmitted.\u201d These allegations are themselves conelusory and unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">First, Easter\u2019s testimony directly established that defendant effected some of the transmissions personally and directed Easter to effect the others. The testimony of the four customers corroborated Easter and was itself corroborated by ample evidence at trial, including testimony, documentary evidence,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and defendant\u2019s own admissions. Moreover, the customers\u2019 testimony included descriptions of the content of the transmissions as race results. Defendant\u2019s last contention \u2014 that knowledge of the illegal use of the transmissions was not proved \u2014 is equally without merit. Besides the fact that the only logical inference that could be drawn from the evidence was that defendant knew the reason his customers were willing to pay in advance for winning numbers, defendant himself stated to F.B.I. agent Briick that he assumed, although was not positive, that the relayed information was used for betting purposes. There was substantial evidence to support the findings of the district court on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">.
