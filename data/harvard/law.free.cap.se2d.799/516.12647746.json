BERNARD GOODWYN\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this appeal, we consider whether an indictment returned by a grand jury as a true bill in open court is invalid when the order recording the indictment was not entered until after the trial on the indictment, and no objection was made to the indictment until after trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 27, 2014, a grand jury for the City of Danville returned indictments in open court against Donald K. Epps (Epps) for assault and battery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-57, and abduction, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-47. Epps pled guilty to assault and battery, and not guilty to abduction. After a bench trial on November 17, 2014, the circuit court convicted Epps of both charges. On January 5, 2015, the court sentenced Epps to 12 months in jail, with 6 months suspended, for assault and battery, and 5 years in prison, with 2 years suspended, for abduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 7, 2015, \"in contemplation of\" an appeal challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, Epps contacted the clerk to obtain the order recording the presentation of his indictments, and learned that no such order had been entered. The same day, Epps moved to dismiss his convictions on the ground that the indictments were improper under\n   <em>\n    Simmons v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1872789\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/89/156/#p157\">\n    89 Va. 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20S.E.%20386\">\n    15 S.E. 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 387 (1892).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 13, 2015, the circuit court entered a written order memorializing the grand jury's October 27 actions. After a hearing on January 22, 2015, the court denied Epps's motion to dismiss. Epps appealed to the Court of Appeals of Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed Epps's convictions in a published opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Epps v.

In assigning error on the ground that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to try him \"because no order recording the presentation of the indictment in open court had been entered\" prior to his trial, Epps stated that this issue required no preservation, but nevertheless maintained that the January 7, 2015 motion preserved his objection. The Court of Appeals held that the \"validity of an indictment is established by the grand jury returning a true bill in open court and the subsequent entry and recordation of an order memorializing those events,\" but also cited Supreme Court of Virginia precedent which has held that felony prosecution by way of an indictment is not jurisdictional, and can be waived.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173576\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/66/393/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173576\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/66/393/\">\n    at 399-400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173576\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/66/393/\">\n    785 S.E.2d at 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court of Appeals noted that Epps challenged only the fact that the presentment order had not been entered prior to his trial, and explained that the timing of the recordation was merely a procedural requirement because no statute, rule or case law contains a time requirement for entry of the order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173576\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/66/393/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173576\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/66/393/\">\n    at 400-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173576\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/66/393/\">\n    785 S.E.2d at 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals ultimately concluded that Epps was properly indicted because of the long-established principle that a court speaks through its written orders, and the January 13 order specifically stated that the grand jury met on October 27, 2014, and returned a true bill in open court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173576\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/66/393/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This Court granted Epps an appeal on the following assignment of error:\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court of Appeals of Virginia erred in affirming the conviction of Mr. Epps, reasoning that the entry of the order recording that the grand jury returned the petitioner's\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   indictment in open court did not have to be entered prior to his trial because it is a mere procedural requirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"The validity of [an] indictment is a question of law which we review de novo.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Howard v.

The Supreme Court found that Cawood had not been properly indicted because there was no record that an indictment against him had ever been returned in open court. Because the court found it was \"essential that a record should be made of the [grand jury's] finding on the Order Book,\" the defendant's conviction was reversed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   , there was no evidence that the indictment, which had been endorsed by the foreman as a \"true bill,\" had ever been presented in court and \"the fact recorded.\" No valid indictment\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   could be found in the Lee County Record Book.

Instead, the indictments in those cases were flawed because there was no evidence that the grand jury returned a true bill naming the defendant in open court.\n   <em>\n    Cawood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20Va.%20%282%20Va.%20Cas.%29%20527\">\n    4 Va. at 541-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 547 ;\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1872789\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/89/156/#p157\">\n    89 Va. at 156-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20S.E.%20386\">\n    15 S.E. at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, here, Epps concedes that the grand jury did, in fact, hand down a true bill in open court. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Cawood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   are inapposite to the issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The indictment requirement is statutory and governed by the Code. \"An indictment is a written accusation of a crime, prepared by the attorney for the Commonwealth and returned 'a true bill' upon the oath or affirmation of a legally impanelled grand jury.\" Code \u00a7 19.2-216. \"The indictment shall be endorsed 'A True Bill' or 'Not a True Bill' and signed by the foreman. The indictment shall be returned by the grand jury in open court.\" Rule 3A:5(c). Code \u00a7 19.2-217 provides that \"no person shall be put upon trial for any felony, unless an indictment or presentment shall have first been found or made by a grand jury in a court of competent jurisdiction.\" None of these statutes or rules requires that an order memorializing this action must be entered prior to trial in order for the indictment to be valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Similarly, Code \u00a7 17.1-123, \"How orders are recorded and signed,\" does not require that an order be entered on the same day as the event it is memorializing in order to be valid.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weatherman v.

Therefore, the circuit court's delay in entering the order recording the grand jury's October 27, 2014 action until January 13, 2015 did not render Epps's indictment invalid. It is undisputed that at the time the circuit court ruled upon Epps's motion to dismiss, the circuit court's record was clear that the grand jury had returned a true bill in open court, and that fact had been recorded by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Further, this Court has previously noted that, under statutes enacted after\n   <em>\n    Cawood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   , the lack of a recording of the indictment did not render the indictment, or trial thereon, void.
