For the first 36 years of his life, Miller was known as \u201cScott Ronald Miller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">{\u00b6 2} In 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001, Miller ran unsuccessfully for various elective offices under the names of either \u201cScott Ronald Miller\u201d or \u201cScott R. Miller.\u201d In November 2003, Miller ran unsuccessfully for Cleveland Municipal Court Judge under the name \u201cScott Miller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">{\u00b6 3} In January 2004, shortly after his latest election defeat, Miller began publicly holding himself out as \u201cScott Russo Miller\u201d in an attempt to effect a common-law change of his name. Miller had his Ohio driver\u2019s license and his Social Security, voter registration, credit, and business cards changed to reflect his claimed name change, i.e., to make \u201cRusso\u201d his middle name.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">{\u00b6 4} On March 1, 2004, Miller filed a nominating petition and statement of candidacy to become an independent candidate for judge of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, General Division for the full term commencing January 11, 2005, at the November 2, 2004 general election. Miller\u2019s petition stated that his name was \u201cScott Russo Miller, formerly Scott Ronald Miller,\u201d but in a blank for him to print his name as it should appear on the ballot, he listed only \u201cScott Russo Miller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">{\u00b6 5} On April 12, 2004, Kenneth J. Fisher, a qualified Cuyahoga County elector, protested Miller\u2019s nominating petition on the basis that Miller\u2019s middle name of \u201cRusso\u201d violated applicable legal requirements. Miller submitted a brief and exhibits in opposition to the protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">{\u00b6 6} On May 3, 2004, appellee, Cuyahoga County Board of Elections, held a hearing on the protest. At the hearing, Miller claimed that he had changed his middle name to \u201cRusso\u201d because he wanted his name to reflect his Italian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>heritage. Miller conceded, however, that Russo was neither his mother\u2019s nor his grandmother\u2019s maiden name. His mother\u2019s maiden name was Spelnak. Miller also claimed that he chose \u201cRusso\u201d because he liked the name.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cRusso\u201d is the name of the county auditor and five county judges: Cuyahoga County Auditor Frank Russo, Judge Anthony J. Russo of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, Judge Joseph F. Russo of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, and Judges Joseph D. Russo, Michael J. Russo, and Nancy Margaret Russo of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, General Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">{\u00b6 8} On May 3, at the conclusion of the hearing, the board of elections voted 3-0 with one abstention to strike Miller\u2019s middle name of \u201cRusso\u201d from the ballot and ordered that his name appear as \u201cScott Miller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">{\u00b6 9} On July 20, 2004, 78 days after the board\u2019s decision, Miller filed an action in the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals for a writ of mandamus to compel the board of elections to place his full name of \u201cScott Russo Miller\u201d on the November 2, 2004 election ballot for common pleas court judge without reference to his former name, \u201cScott Ronald Miller.\u201d The parties moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">{\u00b6 10} On August 27, 2004, the court of appeals granted the board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denied Miller\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">{\u00b6 11} On September 8, 2004, Miller appealed from the judgment of the court of appeals to this court and also filed a merit brief. On September 10, the court ordered the clerk of the court of appeals to transmit the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">{\u00b6 12} On September 16, 2004, the board of elections moved to dismiss the appeal or strike Miller\u2019s merit brief. On the same date, Miller moved for expedited consideration of his appeal. On September 23, 2004, the record was received by this court. On October 1, 2004, we denied the board of elections\u2019 motion to dismiss, granted the board of elections\u2019 motion to strike Miller\u2019s merit brief, and denied Miller\u2019s motion for an expedited briefing schedule and decision. <em>10/1/2004 Case Announcements </em># <em>2, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 1469, 2004-Ohio-5294, 815 N.E.2d 1122. We further noted that Miller could file a new brief \u201cnow that the record has been filed.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">{\u00b6 13} On October 6, 2004, Miller filed a new brief that is virtually identical to his previously stricken brief. Miller also moved to set the due date for the board\u2019s merit brief to on or about October 15. On that same date, we granted Miller\u2019s motion and stated that the board\u2019s merit brief was due on October 15. <em>10/6/2004 Case Announcements </em># <em>2, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 1472, 2004-Ohio-5374, 815 N.E.2d 1125. On October 15, the board of elections filed its merit brief. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>cause is now before the court for an expedited consideration of the merits of Miller\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">{\u00b6 14} Miller asserts that the court of appeals erred in denying the writ of mandamus to compel the board of elections to place his full name of \u201cScott Russo Miller\u201d on the November 2, 2004 election ballot. \u201c \u2018We may vacate the decision of a board of elections and grant a writ of mandamus if [the relator] establishes that the board\u2019s decision resulted from fraud, corruption, abuse of discretion, or clear disregard of applicable law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Stine v. Brown Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 252, 2004-Ohio-771, 804 N.E.2d 415, \u00b6 12, quoting <em>State ex rel. Commt. for Referendum of Lorain Ord. No. 77-01 v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 308, 2002-Ohio-4194, 774 N.E.2d 239, \u00b6 23. Miller claims that the board\u2019s decision should be vacated because all of these grounds exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">{\u00b6 15} The court of appeals did not err in finding that Miller had introduced no reliable evidence of fraud or corruption. That court correctly concluded that in resolving the parties\u2019 summary-judgment motions, it need not consider a newspaper article filed by Miller in support of his claim. See <em>State ex rel. Flagner v. Arko </em>(Feb. 5, 1998), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 72779 and 87263, 1998 WL 45342, * 3 (newspaper article \u201ccannot be accepted as [summary-judgment] evidence; it is \u2018hearsay of the remotest character,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Heyman v. Bellevue </em>[1951], 91 Ohio App. 321, 326, 48 O.O. 404, 108 N.E.2d 161), affirmed (1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 176, 177, 699 N.E.2d 62 (\u201c \u2018[a] newspaper article alone is not evidence of operative facts which might support a Civ.R. 60[B] motion,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Salem v. Salem </em>[1988], 61 Ohio App.3d 243, 246, 572 N.E.2d 726).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">{\u00b6 16} Moreover, the court of appeals correctly held that the board of elections neither abused its discretion nor clearly disregarded applicable law by striking Miller\u2019s claimed new middle name of \u201cRusso\u201d from the election ballot. \u201c \u2018An abuse of discretion connotes an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable attitude.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 344, 2004-Ohio-3122, 810 N.E.2d 949, \u00b6 17, quoting <em>State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 181, 183, 677 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">{\u00b6 17} Miller claimed that he had effected his name change pursuant to common law. But \u201cat common law a person can change his name at will [only] <em>if there is no intent to deceive or defraud.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Morrison v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 336, 337, 17 O.O.3d 420, 410 N.E.2d 764; see, also, <em>In re Hall </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 1, 6, 732 N.E.2d 1004; <em>State ex rel. Krupa v. Green </em>(1961), 114 Ohio App. 497, 501, 19 O.O.2d 341, 177 N.E.2d 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Similarly, in election cases, the guiding principle is that \u201ccandidates shall be prevented from changing their names \u2018to another to avoid an unfavorable result in the use of the abandoned name or to secure advantage by the use of [such other] name.\u2019\u201d <em>McLaughlin v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 98, 2004-Ohio-492, 804 N.E.2d 1004, \u00b6 7, quoting <em>Pierce v. Brushart </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 372, 381, 41 O.O. 398, 92 N.E.2d 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">{\u00b6 19} The evidence introduced before the board of elections established that Miller ran unsuccessfully six times using the names \u201cScott Ronald Miller,\u201d \u201cScott R. Miller,\u201d and \u201cScott Miller.\u201d Two months after he lost his last election in November 2003, he claimed to have changed his name to \u201cScott Russo Miller\u201d and two months thereafter, he submitted his nominating petition for the November 2, 2004 election under that name. \u201cRusso\u201d is the name of several Cuyahoga County judges and the Cuyahoga County auditor. Based on this evidence, the board could reasonably infer that Miller intended to deceive Cuyahoga County voters by designating his middle name as \u201cRusso\u201d and that he also intended to avoid the same unfavorable result that had occurred six previous times when he had used some variation of his prior name. Given these facts, the board of elections acted appropriately in striking his claimed middle name of \u201cRusso\u201d from the election ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">{\u00b6 20} Therefore, because Miller failed to establish that the board\u2019s decision resulted from fraud or corruption or that the board abused its discretion or clearly disregarded applicable law in striking his claimed middle name of \u201cRusso\u201d from the ballot and ordering that his name appear as \u201cScott Miller,\u201d he was not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">{\u00b6 21} Finally, laches bars Miller\u2019s claim. \u201cRelators in election cases must exercise the utmost diligence.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Fuller v. Medina Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 221, 2002-Ohio-5922, 778 N.E.2d 37, \u00b6 7. \u201cIf relators do not act with the required promptness, laches may bar the action for extraordinary relief in an election-related matter.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 12. Miller failed to act with the required diligence by waiting 78 days to challenge the decision of the board of elections, another 12 days to appeal from the court of appeals judgment, an additional 8 days to first move for an expedited briefing schedule, and 5 more days after the court\u2019s October 1 entry to file his brief on appeal and move the court to set a date for the board to file its brief. The statutory deadline to have absentee ballots printed and ready for use has now passed. R.C. 3509.01. See <em>Campaign to Elect Larry Carver Sheriff v. Campaign to Elect Anthony Stankiewicz Sheriff, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 256, 2004-Ohio-812, 804 N.E.2d 419, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">{\u00b6 22} Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals properly denied the writ. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b597-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Scott Miller, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Anp\">William D.

Miller\u2019s attempted name change was an affront to the bar and to the electorate. I would award attorney fees to respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
