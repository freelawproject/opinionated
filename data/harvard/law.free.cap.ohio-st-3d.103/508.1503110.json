(\u201cTed\u201d) Adams, entered the home of Esther Cook and her 12-year-old daughter, Ashley Dawn Cook, in Warren, Ohio. Once inside, Adams killed them by beating and stabbing Esther, and by beating, raping, and strangling Ashley. A jury convicted Adams of the aggravated murders of Esther and Ashley as well as aggravated burglary, kidnapping, and two counts of rape. The jury recommended the death penalty, and the trial court sentenced Adams to death. Adams now appeals his convictions and death sentence directly to us as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">{\u00b6 2} <em>State\u2019s evidence </em>From Christmas 1998 until March 1999, Adams and his girlfriend, Janelle (\u201cNelly\u201d) Hartle, lived with Esther and Ashley on Dickey Avenue in Warren. After March 1999, and at the time of the murders, Adams and Janelle and their infant daughter lived on Mahoning Avenue in Champion, Ohio. James Hartle, who sometimes lived with Esther, was the father of Ashley and Janelle, who were half-sisters.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">{\u00b6 3} On the afternoon of October 11, 1999, Adams borrowed a blue 1991 Chevrolet Cavalier, Ohio license number BAB 2830, from his neighbors, Mike and Kelly Henry. Adams then drove to James Hartle\u2019s house, where he asked to borrow $300 from Hartle to buy a car. Hartle declined to give Adams any money.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">{\u00b6 4} Later that evening, Adams attended a drug party at the apartment of his friend, Mallory \u201cStacie\u201d Jackson. In addition to Adams, guests included Renee Smith, Patricia Litsinger, and Derwin (\u201cStormin\u2019 \u201d) Norman. That night Adams was wearing a white T-shirt, blue pants, and white tennis shoes. When Smith saw Adams, whom she had known for five years, he had $40 \u201cand bought crack cocaine with it.\u201d Later, Adams told Litsinger that he was \u201cbroke,\u201d but he offered cocaine to her in exchange for oral sex. Litsinger refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">{\u00b6 5} After that, Adams left and told Smith that he was leaving \u201cto get some more money.\u201d Smith reported that Adams was gone a long time. By the time Litsinger left, around 11:15 p.m., Adams had already left by himself in his search for more money.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">{\u00b6 6} That same night, October 11, Luetta Simmons, who lived across the street from Esther and Ashley, noticed that a dark-colored car pulled into Esther\u2019s driveway at 11:45 p.m., and that the car left around 12:15 a.m. The taillights on this car resembled the taillights on a Chevrolet Cavalier that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Simmons had once owned. Simmons later noticed that neighborhood dogs were barking an in unusually \u201cloud and obnoxious\u201d manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">{\u00b6 7} Adams returned to Jackson\u2019s apartment. According to Smith, Adams \u201chad blood all over his hands; * * * on his shirt, on his pants, and on the tip of his shoes,\u201d and some of the blood appeared wet. In his pocket, Adams had \u201c[m]oney with a whole bunch of blood on it.\u201d Litsinger also observed that after Adams returned, he had blood on his hands and on his jeans.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">{\u00b6 8} At some point after he returned, Adams took his bloody shirt off. Norman recalled seeing Adams at the apartment when he \u201cdidn\u2019t have a shirt on,\u201d had \u201cblood on him,\u201d and had a roll of money, some of which had blood on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">{\u00b6 9} Later, Adams again left the apartment, but this time he left with Jackson and Norman to get more drugs. Adams, driving a blue Cavalier, dropped Norman off to buy the drugs. Around 2:00 a.m., while Adams was driving around the block, Warren Police Sergeant Robert Massucci pulled Adams over because the Cavalier had only one headlight. Sgt. Massucci noticed that although the weather was cold, Adams was not wearing a shirt, and that Adams had blood on his pants, including a spot approximately four inches by six inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">{\u00b6 10} Warren Police Officer Jeff Miller, who stopped to assist Massucci, frisked Adams and discovered that \u201chis pants were all wet and sticky, * * * gooey.\u201d With the aid of his flashlight, Miller discovered that Adams had blood on his hands, right arm, and pants, and Miller reported that the amount of blood suggested that Adams had \u201cfield dressed a deer.\u201d Adams told Miller that he had cut his hand, but Miller looked and saw no cuts. In the back of the Cavalier, Miller noticed tools and toolboxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">{\u00b6 11} Adams told Sgt. Massucci that he lived on Dickey Avenue, although his driver\u2019s license listed a different address. The officers then let Adams go with a warning about the headlight. Later, Janelle recalled that Adams had come home \u201cin the middle of the night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">{\u00b6 12} Around noon on October 12, 1999, Esther\u2019s friend, Donna Frederick, found Esther\u2019s \u201ccold\u201d body inside the front door of Esther\u2019s home. Frederick called police. A neighbor reported that she had seen Esther and Ashley alive the previous afternoon around 5:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">{\u00b6 13} Police found Esther\u2019s body lying face-down in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs. On the stairs and stairwell walls, police found blood drops and smears. Police found Ashley\u2019s body in an upstairs bedroom. Dr. Humphrey Germaniuk, a forensic pathologist, arrived at the crime scene around 1:00 p.m. that day and estimated that Esther and Ashley had been dead \u201ceight, ten, 12 hours at least.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Dr. Germaniuk, who later performed an autopsy on Esther, concluded that she died as a result of \u201c[m]ultiple blunt force traumatic injuries and multiple sharp force traumatic injuries\u201d with \u201cat least four distinct stab wounds involving the neck and head.\u201d Although police found pieces of a broken broom near the bodies of Ashley and Esther, police found no weapon that might have caused Esther\u2019s injuries. Dr. Germaniuk concluded that in inflicting the puncture wounds on Esther, the killer used \u201csome type of tool that has an acute angle\u201d and two prongs, such as a certain type of crowbar.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 15} Ashley\u2019s body lay upstairs on a bedroom floor next to the bed. Her body was nude and posed, with her legs spread apart. An electric cord had been wrapped five times around her neck, and one end of the cord was in her hand. A bracelet and two earrings had been placed on Ashley\u2019s lower abdomen. After an autopsy, Dr. Germaniuk concluded that Ashley had died as a result of \u201cstrangulation associated with blunt force trauma to the head.\u201d Ashley\u2019s body also revealed multiple injuries and bruises to the genitalia as well as brain swelling, contusions to the head, and lacerations to the mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 16} Dr. Germaniuk also completed a rape kit examination during his autopsy of Ashley and obtained swab samples from her body cavities. Forensic Scientist Steve Wiechman, from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d), concluded that rectal, vaginal, and oral swabs from Ashley\u2019s body tested positive for semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 17} After later tests, Meghan Clement, an expert in DNA analysis at LabCorp, an independent testing laboratory, conducted polymerase chain reaction (\u201cPCR\u201d) analysis of DNA on the oral and vaginal swabs from Ashley\u2019s body and concluded that they contained a DNA mixture. Adams and Ashley could have both contributed DNA to the mixture, and nothing in the analysis suggested that anyone else had contributed DNA to these specimens. The rectal swab, while testing positive for semen, was insufficient to yield a DNA result other than Ashley\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 18} Dr. P. Michael Conneally, a Distinguished Professor of Medical and Molecular Genetics at Indiana University Medical Center, who is an expert on genetic statistics, agreed that genetic markers for the secondary DNA contributor in the vaginal swab matched Adams, who is Caucasian. A similar DNA profile occurs only once in 77,000 Caucasians, once in 2.3 million African-Americans, and once in 128,000 Hispanics.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">{\u00b6 19} At the crime scene, police found no money in the house. The bedroom where Ashley\u2019s body was found was in disarray, as if it had been ransacked. Two dressers were overturned, and blood spatters were found on the ceiling, floor, and on dresser contents. BCI Forensic Scientist Wiechman subjected two bloody sheets from the bedroom to forensic analysis. Wiechman found 17 presumptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>semen stains on different parts of one sheet, tested six of them, and confirmed that three of these were semen stains.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">{\u00b6 20} Jennifer Duvall, an Ohio BCI forensic scientist, found DNA from semen stains in several areas on the same sheet. Adams could not be excluded as a contributor to the DNA in these stains, and his DNA was consistent with DNA in the stains. Duvall testified that DNA found at one particular site, which was identical to Adams\u2019s DNA, would be found only once in 21.1 million Caucasians and once in 1.9 million African-Americans. When Adams and Janelle lived with Esther and Ashley seven months previously, they slept in a downstairs bedroom and never used any of the upstairs bedrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 21} On October 13, police seized the blue Cavalier that Adams had driven on October 11 and 12, which Mike Henry had loaned him. Forensic testing disclosed that the steering wheel, one of the floor pedals, and the headlight lever in the Cavalier tested positive for blood, but the quantity was insufficient for analysis. On October 19, Mike Henry asked Adams why police had found blood in Henry\u2019s car after Adams had borrowed it. During this conversation, Adams denied any responsibility for the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 22} On October 20, police interviewed Adams after fully advising him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Adams waived those rights and gave both an audiotaped and videotaped statement of his activities on October 11 and 12. In these interviews, Adams initially denied any knowledge of the murders. After continued questioning, Adams admitted that he had stopped at Esther\u2019s house the night she was killed and that he had briefly entered the residence. Adams claimed that he had fallen over Esther\u2019s body and had then gone upstairs and found Ashley\u2019s body. He quickly departed, and he did not tell anyone what he had found. Adams admitted that on October 12, he had burned his bloody tennis shoes and trousers. In Adams\u2019s backyard police found a pile of ashes that contained a belt buckle and shoe eyelets.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 23} In addition to the police, Adams told others that he had discovered the bodies on the night of October 11 but had not notified authorities. On October 26, he was \u201con the verge of crying\u201d when he told his friend, Kevin Clements, that he had found the bodies and had \u201ctripped over Esther.\u201d He also told his girlfriend, Janelle, and his sister, Tina Maus, that he had tripped over Esther\u2019s body in the house that night. Later, he admitted to Tina that he had also found Ashley\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">{\u00b6 24} <em>Defense case </em>The defense moved for acquittal under Crim.R. 29, and the trial court denied the motion. The defense then recalled Detective Jeffrey Hoolihan, one of the investigating detectives. Detective Hoolihan agreed that police did not take certain investigative steps, such as examining an open window <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>or a jewelry box for fingerprints, searching the neighborhood for weapons, or pursuing James Hartle as a murder suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">{\u00b6 25} <em>Procedural history </em>The grand jury indicted Adams on three counts of aggravated murder involving the deaths of Ashley Cook and Esther Cook, aggravated burglary, kidnapping of Ashley, and three counts that he had raped Ashley.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 26} Counts 1 and 2, relating to the aggravated murder of Ashley, included seven identical death-penalty specifications alleging murder (1) as part of a \u201ccourse of conduct,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), (2) while committing aggravated burglary, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), (3) while committing a kidnapping, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), (4) while committing vaginal rape, (5) anal rape, and (6) fellatio rape, all in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and (7) of a child under 13 years of age, R.C. 2929.04(A)(9). Count 3, charging the aggravated murder of Esther, listed three specifications, namely, murder (1) as part of a course of conduct, (2) during an aggravated burglary, and (3) during a kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 27} The jury acquitted Adams of anal rape, as charged in Count 7 and in specification 5 of Counts 1 and 2, but convicted him of all remaining charges and specifications. Count 2 (child murder) was dismissed on motion of the state. Following a penalty-phase hearing, the jury recommended the death penalty for the murder of each victim, and the trial court sentenced Adams to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">{\u00b6 28} In his direct appeal to our court, Adams presents 17 propositions of law. We find merit in proposition of law VI. Hence, we set aside the conviction of Adams for kidnapping and the findings of guilt relating to the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specifications charging murder in the course of a kidnapping. We find that his other propositions of law lack merit, and we affirm the findings of guilt. We have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors as to each murder victim and have considered the proportionality of the death sentence. For the reasons that follow, we otherwise affirm the judgment of the trial court and the death sentences imposed against Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Pretrial Issues (I, III, IV, V, X)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">{\u00b6 29} <em>Pretrial suppression </em>\u2014 ineffective <em>assistance </em>In proposition of law I, Adams argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion to suppress pretrial statements that Adams made to the Warren police on October 20, 1999. In those audiotaped and videotaped statements, Adams admitted that he had discovered the bodies of Esther and Ashley, but he denied any responsibility for their deaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">{\u00b6 30} For Adams to obtain a reversal of a conviction or sentence based on ineffective assistance of counsel, he must prove (a) deficient performance (\u201cerrors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>defendant by the Sixth Amendment\u201d) and (b) prejudice (\u201cerrors * * * so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable\u201d). <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">{\u00b6 31} We conclude, however, that Adams\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel lacks merit. First, Adams has not demonstrated deficient performance. Trial counsel cannot be second-guessed as to trial strategy decisions. In fact, the \u201c \u2018[fjailure to file a suppression motion does not constitute per se ineffective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 389, 721 N.E.2d 52, quoting <em>Kimmelman v. Morrison </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 365, 384, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305. \u201cRepresentation is an art, and an act or omission that is unprofessional in one case may be sound or even brilliant in another.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Moreover, \u201ca court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d Id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 32} In this case, counsel for Adams appear to have made a tactical judgment that the best way to defend Adams would be to permit his strong claims of innocence to be admitted into evidence. In these October 20 statements, Adams persistently denied any thefts from the house, any sexual contact with the victims, and any responsibility for their deaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">{\u00b6 33} Counsel\u2019s trial strategy took advantage of the fact that Adams strongly proclaimed to police before trial that he was innocent of these charges. To illustrate this strategy, defense counsel in his opening statement noted that two \u201ctrained, experienced police officers\u201d subjected Adams to \u201can intense interrogation * * * for almost three hours.\u201d Counsel further noted \u201c[tjhere are no less than * * * 50 accusations of assaults, beatings, on these two decedents, and there are just as many explained denials by Stanley that, T did not do this, I did not have anything to do with this.\u2019\u201d In closing argument, counsel resumed this strategy by stressing Adams\u2019s protestations of innocence, e.g., \u201cStanley does not waiver [sic], and his statement remains the same, I didn\u2019t do this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 34} By deciding not to attempt to suppress these pretrial statements, counsel had the benefit of having Adams\u2019s exculpatory explanation of events in evidence, without the risk of having Adams take the stand in his own defense. By not testifying, Adams never had to face a prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination. Further, Adams never had to face devastating impeachment by means of his prior felony convictions, which included a recent murder conviction. See, e.g., <em>State v. Beckett </em>(May 11, 2001), Holmes App. No. 00CA008, 2001 WL 520970 (\u201c[b]y allowing the admission of [pretrial] statements to police * * *, counsel was able to present this defense * * * without putting appellant on the witness stand\u201d); <em>People v. Newman </em>(Mich.App.2000), 2000 WL 33522090 (allowing into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>evidence a voluntary, exculpatory pretrial statement is a matter of trial strategy, not ineffective assistance).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">{\u00b6 35} Second, in order <em>to </em>demonstrate deficient performance, Adams must establish that a basis existed to suppress his pretrial statements. See, e.g., <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 165-166, 749 N.E.2d 226 (where the record contains no evidence justifying a motion to suppress, defendant has not met his burden of proving that his attorney violated an essential duty by failing to file the motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 36} In fact, the record strongly indicates that counsel would have been unsuccessful in attempting to suppress Adams\u2019s pretrial statements. Police advised Adams of his <em>Miranda </em>rights by reading the form to him, and Adams freely signed a waiver of those rights. Adams said that he understood his rights, and the record shows that his <em>Miranda </em>waiver and ensuing statements were voluntary. The audiotaped and videotaped statements reveal that Adams remained in control of himself throughout the interview by persistently and strongly claiming his innocence. Police never threatened or coerced Adams, and Adams never asked for a lawyer or expressed reluctance to talk with police. Moreover, at the time of the offense, Adams was 33 years old and experienced in the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 37} Under the totality-of-circumstances test, the facts show that Adams understood and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that his pretrial statements to police in which he proclaimed his innocence were voluntary and admissible. See <em>State v. Edwards </em>(1976), 49 Ohio St.2d 31, 3 O.O.3d 18, 358 N.E.2d 1051, paragraph two of the syllabus. See, also, <em>State v. Green </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 352, 366, 738 N.E.2d 1208; <em>State v. Eley </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 174, 178, 672 N.E.2d 640; <em>State v. Brewer </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 50, 57-58, 549 N.E.2d 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">{\u00b6 38} Third, counsel for Adams could also have decided that any motion to suppress Adams\u2019s statements to the police would have been pointless. Adams told several others, including a friend, his sister, and his former girlfriend, that he had discovered one or both of the bodies on the night of October 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">{\u00b6 39} Finally, Adams has not established that any prejudice resulted from the admission into evidence of his pretrial statements to police. \u201cTo show that a defendant has been prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the defendant must prove that there exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus. In this case, the conviction of Adams did not hinge on evidence of his exculpatory pretrial statements because compelling evidence established his guilt. Thus, we reject proposition of law I.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>{\u00b6 40} <em>Asserted venire-person misconduct </em>In proposition of law III, Adams argues that because of asserted misconduct by an unknown member of the venire, he was denied a fair trial by an impartial jury. Adams cites an incident that occurred in a jury waiting room during voir dire. Prospective jurors were standing in line to sign a list of those who had heard or read about the case. While in line, a prospective juror, Harriet Dickerson, heard someone behind her comment, \u201cI know we\u2019re not supposed to talk about this, but I believe he\u2019s guilty. When I looked at the newspaper this morning, I was afraid that I was going to have to be on this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">{\u00b6 41} Dickerson could not identify the person who made this remark. Dickerson testified that another prospective juror reportedly had heard the comment and said that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe\u201d that someone had said that. During individual voir dire, Dickerson disclosed the incident to the trial court. After briefly questioning Dickerson, defense counsel did not pursue the matter. Although Dickerson was not challenged for cause, she did not sit on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">{\u00b6 42} Admittedly, \u201c[d]ue process means a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 217, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78. However, <em>Smith </em>holds that the party complaining about juror misconduct must establish prejudice. Id. at 215-217, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78. See <em>United States v. Zelinka </em>(C.A.6, 1988), 862 F.2d 92, 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 43} We reject the defense claim of prejudicial error for several reasons. First, counsel could reasonably decide that this casual remark in a jury waiting room was innocuous and that no purpose would be served by further inquiry. We do not second-guess trial strategy decisions such as those made by counsel during voir dire. See <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 157, 694 N.E.2d 932. We also reject Adams\u2019s claim that the trial court should have, sua sponte, conducted a further inquiry. See <em>State v. Hessler </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 108, 115-116, 734 N.E.2d 1237 (on juror misconduct, \u201cwe show deference to the trial judge, who sees and hears the events and thus is in a better position to accurately evaluate the situation and determine the appropriate scope of inquiry\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 44} Second, no misconduct by an actual juror occurred in this case. Instead, an unknown prospective juror made a casual comment in a jury-selection waiting room suggesting a preconceived opinion. When this unknown person made this remark, no jury had been seated or sworn, nor had the court instructed jurors on their obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">{\u00b6 45} Third, Adams has not established prejudice because the person who made the remark, or anyone who heard it, may never have sat on the jury that tried Adams. \u201cA claim of juror misconduct must focus on the jurors who were actually seated and not those excused.\u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>4, 679 N.E.2d 646, citing <em>Ross v.

See, also, R.C. 2945.79(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">{\u00b6 46} Finally, the trial court and counsel in this case thoroughly and individually voir dired all prospective jurors in order to uncover any bias, prejudice, or preconceived opinions based on pretrial publicity or out-of-court discussions. This extensive voir dire lasted for 11 days, and the court and counsel readily agreed on those who should be excused. In fact, over 30 prospective jurors were excused because of pretrial publicity or knowledge of the case. Moreover, the trial court thoroughly instructed the jury to avoid pretrial publicity, not to discuss the case, and to decide the issues only on the evidence presented in court. Hence, we reject proposition III.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">{\u00b6 47} <em>Change of venue </em>In proposition of law IV, Adams contends that because of pervasive pretrial publicity, the trial court erred in refusing to change venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c[T]he right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, \u2018indifferent\u2019 jurors.\u201d <em>Irvin v.

A few of the newspaper articles submitted in support of the motion definitely disparaged Adams, while others simply described the fact that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>jury was being empanelled. For example, a Warren Tribune Chronicle article, dated September 9, 2001, \u201cPortrait of a Killer,\u201d described in depth Adams\u2019s background and criminal record, including details of his prior murder conviction, and indicated that he was a suspect in other unsolved murders. Publicity continued after the guilty verdicts, but before the October 3 penalty verdict. An article on September 27, 2001, notes that Adams was found guilty and \u201cwas a suspect in a number of unsolved homicides and \u2018may be a serial murderer.\u2019 \u201d An editorial on September 30, 2001, discusses the question \u201cIs Adams a serial killer?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">{\u00b6 51} In spite of the publicity before and during the trial, Adams has not demonstrated that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a change of venue. The trial court conducted extensive individual voir dire of prospective jurors to ensure that they were not prejudiced by publicity about the case. During individual voir dire, the judge cautioned each juror not to discuss the case or read or listen to media reports. On September 11, 2001, just before the final jury was selected, the trial court again individually voir dired each remaining prospective juror to ensure that they were still not contaminated by media reports. The record reflects that six sitting jurors had not read or heard anything about the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 52} Nonetheless, Adams contends that six of the jurors may have been adversely affected by pretrial publicity: Jurors Fonce, Eucker, Kuzmaul, DePalma, Griffin, and Jagiella. Yet, Adams did not challenge any of these six jurors for cause, which indicated that he was satisfied with those individuals when they were seated as jurors. See <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, at \u00b6 37; <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 252, 268, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 53} Moreover, the record affirmatively reflects that pretrial publicity never adversely influenced any of those six jurors. Juror Rhonda Fonce thought that she \u201cremember[ed] reading something in the newspaper\u201d about the case, but recalled no details, had formed no opinion, and said that she would decide the case only on the evidence. When later questioned on September 11, Fonce continued to assert that she had not read media reports. In initial voir dire, Juror Edward Jagiella agreed that he had read about the case in newspapers. But he said that he would decide the case on the evidence before him: \u201cThat is my philosophy. I want to know all of the evidence.\u201d Later, he reported that all he could remember was \u201csomething about a girl being killed and a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 54} Juror Gerald Eucker had read about the case a long time before trial and recalled that it involved a mother and daughter. Eucker also believed that Adams had been \u201cassociated\u201d with another woman\u2019s murder, but he did not \u201cknow whether he [had] been convicted or [was] just a suspect\u201d and had \u201cno idea\u201d whether Adams had anything to do with that case. Eucker agreed to decide this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>case only on the evidence at trial. Later, Eucker reported that he had \u201cvery little knowledge about this case,\u201d but recalled that the victims were killed on Dickey Avenue. When questioned on September 11, Eucker agreed that he had seen Adams\u2019s picture in the weekend paper and had seen the headline, \u201cPortrait of a Murderer,\u201d but he did not read the article or form any opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 55} Juror Deborah Kuzmaul heard \u201cnews that there was an upcoming trial.\u201d But she does not read the newspapers, knew only that a man was being tried for murder, did not know anything about the facts, and had no opinion about the case. At the initial voir dire, Juror Joseph DePalma asserted that he had no independent recollection of the case from the media. When questioned on September 11, DePalma agreed that he had seen Adams\u2019s picture in a weekend paper but said that that photograph had no impact on him and he had not read the article. Because he had the paper with him, he surrendered it, except for the sports section. In initial voir dire, Juror Kenneth Griffin reported that he knew nothing about the case. On September 11, Griffin noted that he received the weekend paper, but he had never read or listened to any media reports about the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 56} In sum, extensive voir dire demonstrated that each of the six jurors who had been subjected to media exposure knew very few details, if any, had no opinion about the responsibility of Adams, and agreed to decide the case only on the evidence at trial. Thus, Adams has not shown that any juror was biased. \u201cA defendant claiming that pretrial publicity has denied him a fair trial must show that one or more jurors were actually biased. Only in rare cases may prejudice be presumed.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, at \u00b6 35. Also, at the end of the trial, the trial court noted that once trial had commenced, \u201cthere is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that any of the articles * * * have come to the attention of the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 57} Therefore, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s careful, individual, and sequestered voir dire of each juror on two separate occasions showed that six jurors had no knowledge of the case. Six remaining jurors recalled only sketchy details, if any, from media exposure. Further, the trial court individually cautioned each juror not to read or listen to media reports, and collectively advised the jury on that point many times.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">{\u00b6 58} Under these circumstances, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to change venue. <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, at \u00b6 30 (\u201cthe trial court took effective steps to protect the defendant\u2019s rights\u201d); <em>State v. White </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 16, 21, 693 N.E.2d 772 (\u201c[i]t is rare for a court to presume that a jury is prejudiced by pretrial publicity\u201d); <em>State v. Bies </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 320, 324, 658 N.E.2d 754. We reject proposition IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>{\u00b6 59} <em>Incomplete voir dire </em>\u2014 ineffective <em>assistance </em>In proposition of law V, Adams asserts that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by conducting an incomplete voir dire examination of prospective jurors. As we noted, reversal of a conviction or sentence based on ineffective assistance requires finding both deficient performance and prejudice. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 60} We reject this claim for several reasons. First, Adams has not shown deficient performance by counsel during voir dire. In fact, defense counsel, along with the court and prosecutor, conducted an extensive voir dire for 11 days. Voir dire eliminated those who were biased and those who would not be fair jurors in a death-penalty case.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 61} Nonetheless, Adams argues that his counsel did not adequately question jurors Eucker, Jagiella, and Griffin about their death-penalty views. But \u201c[t]he conduct of voir dire by defense counsel does not have to take a particular form, nor do specific questions have to be asked.\u201d <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 247, 586 N.E.2d 1042. Accord <em>State v. Seiber </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 4, 12, 564 N.E.2d 408. We \u201cwill not second-guess trial strategy decisions\u201d such as those made during voir dire. <em>State v. Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 157, 694 N.E.2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 62} In fact, the court and counsel fully questioned these particular jurors about their death-penalty views. For example, the death-qualification voir dire for Eucker took over 30 pages of transcript. Eucker expressed \u201cno problem\u201d with the death penalty, thought that it \u201chas a place in our society,\u201d but had \u201cnever given [it] a lot of thought.\u201d He understood that taking a life does not automatically result in the death penalty, and he was open to both the death penalty and life imprisonment. He would do only \u201cwhat the law and the evidence requires\u201d and would \u201clisten to the instructions and set aside [his] own personal opinions.\u201d He would decide on death only if the aggravating circumstances outweighed the, mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Defense counsel did not challenge Eucker for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 63} Counsel and the court also extensively questioned Kenneth Griffin about his death-penalty views. Griffin believed that the death penalty was \u201cthere for a reason.\u201d But when asked if he had strong views, he responded, \u201cNo, not really.\u201d As possible mitigating factors, Griffin mentioned mental problems or the influence of drugs or alcohol. He agreed to follow the court\u2019s instructions, and believed that \u201cif the mitigating factors * * * outweigh the aggravating circumstances, then that is where the sentencing should be.\u201d He would not \u201cautomatically head for a death penalty\u201d if the defendant was convicted. Again, neither side challenged this juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>{\u00b6 64} Counsel and the court also extensively questioned Edward Jagiella. Jagiella believed that if it is proved \u201cbeyond a shadow of a doubt\u201d that a person killed somebody \u201cwith malice,\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re not mentally ill,\u201d that person \u201cdeserve[s] the death penalty.\u201d But Jagiella stated that he could set aside his opinions and follow the court\u2019s instructions. He agreed that society would be protected either by a killer\u2019s execution or by a life sentence. Jagiella agreed to consider all mitigating factors, including \u201cAdams\u2019s character, the way he was brought up, and * * * [whether] he was mentally ill.\u201d He would \u201clisten to all of the facts,\u201d consider the credibility of witnesses, and \u201creserve judgment on everything until everything is in.\u201d Again, neither counsel challenged Jagiella for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">{\u00b6 65} Adams also complains about counsel\u2019s voir dire of alternate juror Jamie Nezbeth. But Nezbeth never sat as a juror and was excused for unrelated reasons during the mitigation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">{\u00b6 66} We conclude that the questioning of all jurors, including the three named by Adams, was thorough and meaningful. Thus, Adams has not shown deficient performance. Counsel \u201cneed not repeat questions about topics already covered by * * * opposing counsel, or the judge.\u201d <em>State v. Watson </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 1, 13, 572 N.E.2d 97. Further, \u201c[c]ounsel were present for voir dire and could see and hear the jurors answer questions. [They] were in a much better position\u201d to judge such issues. <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 143, 538 N.E.2d 373. We have previously rejected similar challenges to the manner in which counsel questioned jurors during voir dire. See, e.g., <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 331, 335, 703 N.E.2d 1251 (counsel\u2019s decision \u201cnot to question jurors further\u201d about their death-penalty views was an \u201cexercise of their discretionary judgment\u201d); <em>State v. Evans, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 247, 586 N.E.2d 1042 (ineffective assistance not established by the fact that counsel in general voir dire only briefly asked jurors about their attitude concerning the death penalty).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">{\u00b6 67} Finally, Adams has not established that prejudice resulted from the manner in which counsel voir dired Eucker, Jagiella, and Griffin. To establish prejudice requires proving that \u201ca reasonable probability [exists] that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus. Adams has not even attempted to demonstrate that more extensive questioning of Eucker, Griffin, and Jagiella would have created a \u201creasonable probability\u201d of a different trial result. Accordingly, we reject proposition V.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">{\u00b6 68} <em>Competence to stand trial </em>In proposition of law X, Adams argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately challenge at trial the competence of Adams to stand trial when a good-faith basis existed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>{\u00b6 69} Before trial, counsel requested a determination of competency. The court selected clinical psychologist Dr. Stanley J. Palumbo, the defense selected psychologist Dr. Douglas C. Darnall, and the prosecutor selected a psychiatrist, Dr. Steven J. Zuchowski. After interviewing Adams and examining relevant records, each expert found Adams competent to stand trial. At a pretrial conference, the parties stipulated to the competency-evaluation reports and agreed that each expert would testify as his report indicated. The court then found Adams competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 70} Admittedly, a person who \u201clacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial.\u201d <em>Drope v. Missouri </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 162, 171, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103. \u201cFundamental principles of due process\u201d prohibit trial of a criminal defendant who is legally incompetent. <em>State v. Berry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 354, 359, 650 N.E.2d 433, citing <em>Pate v. Robinson </em>(1966), 383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836,15 L.Ed.2d 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">{\u00b6 71} Although Adams suggests that he was not competent to stand trial, he primarily argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by not pursuing the issue. Nonetheless, we find that Adams has not established deficient performance. Counsel\u2019s decision to stipulate to the content of three competency evaluations and not cross-examine these experts or otherwise challenge the competence of Adams was grounded on a reasoned tactical judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">{\u00b6 72} First, the record reflects no basis to challenge the reports. The competency reports were comprehensive and satisfied the statutory requirements for competency evaluations. See R.C. 2945.371(G). Each expert explained in detail why Adams was competent to stand trial. For example, Dr. Palumbo interviewed Adams for two hours and reviewed other relevant records such as his own September 1996 evaluation of Adams. After reviewing relevant history, Dr. Palumbo articulated detailed reasons for concluding, \u201cwith reasonable scientific certainty, [that] Stanley Adams is presently able to understand the nature and objective of the proceedings against him and to presently assist in his defense.\u201d According to Dr. Palumbo, Adams understood and described the charges against him, the role of witnesses, the judge, the jury, the prosecutor, and the defense counsel, as well as his role as the defendant. Adams also understood types of pleas, the plea-bargain process, and the potential penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">{\u00b6 73} Dr. Darnall, the expert selected by Adams, also explained in detail why he could \u201cfind no evidence of a significant mental disorder that would hinder [Adams\u2019s] capacity to understand the judicial process or to contribute to his own defense.\u201d Dr. Zuchowski detailed five reasons why he found that Adams understood the nature and objective of the proceedings against him and eight specific reasons why Adams could assist his lawyers. Although all three experts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>reported that Adams had abused drugs and alcohol, no one diagnosed any psychosis or mental limitations that would affect the competence of Adams to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">{\u00b6 74} Under R.C. 2945.37(G), \u201c[a] defendant is presumed to be competent to stand trial.\u201d This presumption remains valid under R.C. 2945.37(G) unless \u201cafter a hearing, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that the defendant is not competent. Faced with these strong conclusions that Adams was competent to be tried, counsel reasonably decided to stipulate to their testimony and not challenge the presumption of competency. When judging professional decisions of counsel, \u201ca court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">{\u00b6 75} Second, counsel knew their client and could best determine if he understood the trial process and was able to assist them in the defense. Counsel could also decide if cross-examination of the experts or further evaluations were needed. See <em>State v. Williams, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-Ohio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, at \u00b6 63; <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 405, 410-411, 692 N.E.2d 151. We grant deference on these issues to those \u201cwho see and hear what goes on in the courtroom.\u201d <em>State v. Cowans </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717 N.E.2d 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">{\u00b6 76} Third, later events at trial vindicated counsel\u2019s decision not to challenge the competence of Adams. During the trial, Adams made a pro se request for witnesses to be recalled, personally asked for an additional DNA test, and argued about a polygraph examination. These personal requests by Adams demonstrated his understanding of the trial process and his ability to assist his defense. In addition, the fact that Adams at times complained about tactical decisions that his lawyers made also established that Adams understood the trial process and was fully engaged in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">{\u00b6 77} Further, Adams \u201cdisplayed no outrageous, irrational behavior during trial, and counsel never complained about his lack of cooperation.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-Ohio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, at \u00b6 63. \u201c[I]t is noteworthy that <em>nobody </em>on the spot thought [that the defendant\u2019s] behavior raised any question as to his competence.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Cowans, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 84, 717 N.E.2d 298. Cf. <em>State v. Thomas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 309, 316, 779 N.E.2d 1017; <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 29-32; <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 603-605, 734 N.E.2d 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">{\u00b6 78} Finally, nothing in the record suggests prejudice, which <em>Strickland </em>requires. The record fails to reflect any reasonable probability that if counsel had cross-examined the experts or requested further evaluations, the trial court\u2019s decision that Adams was competent would have been different. See <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Accord <em>State v. Williams, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-Ohio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, at \u00b6 66. Thus, we overrule proposition X.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Trial issues</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">{\u00b6 79} <em>DNA evidence </em>In proposition of law II, Adams challenges the DNA evidence by claiming that the trial court\u2019s admission of scientific or expert testimony and evidence without a preliminary determination of the reliability of the conclusions to be presented violated his fair-trial rights. Adams complains that \u201cthe trial court regarded DNA [evidence] as nothing novel\u201d and allowed \u201cjunk\u201d testimony to come into evidence. Adams essentially challenges DNA testimony as if trial courts had never accepted DNA evidence before. See Evid.R. 702(C); <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 589-590, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">{\u00b6 80} However, we hold that the trial court was not required to conduct a preliminary hearing under Evid.R. 104 to accept the scientific reliability of DNA evidence. DNA evidence is not \u201cnovel\u201d to Ohio courts as Adams claims. In <em>State v. Pierce </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 490, 597 N.E.2d 107, at paragraph one of the syllabus, we held that \u201cDNA evidence may be relevant evidence which will assist the trier of fact in determining a fact in issue, and may be admissible.\u201d In <em>Pierce, </em>we recognized that \u201cthe theory and procedures used in DNA typing are generally accepted within the scientific community.\u201d 64 Ohio St.3d at 497, 597 N.E.2d 107. Further, we held in <em>Pierce </em>that \u201cquestions regarding the reliability of DNA evidence in a given case go to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility. <em>No pretrial evidentiary hearing is necessary to determine the reliability of the DNA evidence. </em>The trier of fact * * * can determine whether DNA evidence is reliable.\u201d <em>Pierce, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 501, 597 N.E.2d 107. (Emphasis added.) Accord <em>State v. Nicholas </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 431, 437, 613 N.E.2d 225 (\u201cDNA results constitute reliable evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">{\u00b6 81} To support his claims, Adams cites a variety of studies suggesting limitations on DNA evidence. For example, Adams argues that the court should have excluded DNA evidence because of controversy over (1) \u201cthe statistical estimates being offered for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests\u201d; (2) \u201cthe reliability of the methods used * * * for collecting, handling, processing, and testing crime scene samples\u201d; and (3) \u201ccoincidental match probabilities and false error rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">{\u00b6 82} However, the issues that Adams now raises \u201cgo to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility.\u201d <em>Pierce, </em>64 Ohio St.3d 490, 597 N.E.2d 107, paragraph two of the syllabus. In <em>Pierce, </em>we found that the trial court properly admitted calculations as to the frequency probability of DNA samples. Id. at 501, 597 N.E.2d 107. In <em>Pierce, </em>we also recognized that \u201c[g]iven the human element involved in their design and process, all scientific procedures and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>analyses have incidents of error.\u201d Id. at 498, 597 N.E.2d 107. Further, \u201c[t]he jury was free to reject the DNA evidence if it concluded that the evidence was unreliable or misleading.\u201d Id. at 501, 597 N.E.2d 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">{\u00b6 83} Although Evid.R. 702 was amended after <em>Pierce </em>to state the reliability requirement, the Staff Note to Evid.R. 702 indicates that \u201c[t]he amendment is intended to clarify the circumstances in which expert testimony is admissible. * * * [N]o substantive change from prior law is intended. In particular, there is no intention to change existing Ohio law regarding the reliability of expert testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">{\u00b6 84} Further, we have recognized since Evid.R. 702 was amended that \u201c[rjelevant evidence based on valid principles will satisfy the threshold reliability standard for the admission of expert testimony. The credibility to be afforded these principles and the expert\u2019s conclusions remain[s] a matter for the trier of fact. The reliability requirement in Evid.R. 702 is a threshold determination that should focus on a particular type of scientific evidence, not the truth or falsity of an alleged scientific fact or truth.\u201d <em>State v. Nemeth </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 202, 211, 694 N.E.2d 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">{\u00b6 85} In <em>Miller v. Bike Athletic Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 607, 611, 687 N.E.2d 735, we also emphasized that the reliability inquiry relates to the validity of the underlying scientific principles, not the correctness of the expert\u2019s conclusions. See, also, Gerald J. Todaro, The Admissibility of Medical Testimony in Ohio: <em>Daubert, Joiner </em>and Ohio\u2019s Relevance-Reliability Standard (1998), 46 Cleve. St.L.Rev. 319, 335 <em>(Nemeth </em>\u201cultimately continues the relaxed standard imposed by the relevance/reliability approach\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">{\u00b6 86} As we recognized in <em>Pierce </em>over 12 years ago, DNA evidence, premised on valid scientific principles, has been widely accepted as reliable and admissible evidence. <em>Pierce, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 494, 597 N.E.2d 107. \u201c[T]he use of nuclear DNA analysis as a forensic tool has been found to be scientifically reliable by the scientific community for more than a decade.\u201d <em>United States v. Beverly </em>(C.A.6, 2004), 369 F.3d 516, 528. Courts throughout the nation and in Ohio routinely accept DNA evidence. See George Bundy Smith &amp; Janet A. Gordon, The Admission of DNA Evidence in State and Federal Courts (1997), 65 Fordham L.Rev. 2465, 2482-2483, 2488. See, also, <em>State v. Satta, </em>Marion App. No. 9-01-38, 2002-Ohio-5049, 2002 WL 31114690, \u00b6 44 (\u201cthe credibility of the D.N.A. testing * * * is a matter to [be] determined by the trier of fact\u201d); <em>State v. Martin </em>(Aug. 14, 2000), Brown App. No. CA99-09-026, 2000 WL 1145465 (\u201cQuestions regarding the reliability of DNA evidence * * *, including alleged defects or limitations of DNA population frequency statistics, go to weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility\u201d); <em>State v. Honzu </em>(June 1, 1995), Franklin App. No. 94AP07-1011, 1995 WL 326214, * 8 (questions regarding DNA testing procedures go to weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>not admissibility). See, also, Smith &amp; Gordon, 65 Cleve.St.L.Rev. at 2470 (PCR analysis [one of several DNA typing techniques] \u201chas received overwhelming acceptance in the scientific community and the courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">{\u00b6 87} At trial, Adams offered no evidence challenging the DNA evidence or the manner in which the samples were collected or tested, preferring to rely upon cross-examination of the experts. Although counsel cross-examined the experts at length, counsel did not establish any basis to question the admissibility or the reliability of the DNA evidence in this case. Moreover, counsel for Adams specifically asserted that for strategic reasons, they did not want additional DNA testing because it would not help their client.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">{\u00b6 88} Finally, as we have long recognized, the admission of expert testimony is within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 53, 58, 4 OBR 144, 446 N.E.2d 444. In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the DNA experts to testify as such during the trial. Each expert was qualified under Evid.R. 702, and each explained the scientific procedures used. Meghan Clement holds a master\u2019s degree in forensic science, had performed thousands of DNA tests, and had testified over 200 times in courts in 24 states. Dr. P. Michael Conneally, a Distinguished Professor of Medical and Molecular Genetics, is a charter member of HUGO, the Human Genome Organization, had published 275 scientific articles, and had testified as an expert witness in 26 states on genetics and DNA subjects. Jennifer Duvall has a bachelor of science degree in biology, had completed an eight-month Ohio DNA training program, had completed analyses of over 1,000 DNA samples, and had testified as an expert witness 15 times. We find no merit in the claim made by Adams that the trial court erred in failing to hold a preliminary hearing on the admissibility of DNA evidence. Hence, we reject proposition II.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">{\u00b6 89} <em>Conviction of allied offenses </em>In proposition of law VI, Adams argues that his separate convictions for kidnapping and rape constituted \u201callied offenses of similar import\u201d under R.C. 2941.25. Adams argues that no separate animus existed for kidnapping and that he cannot constitutionally be convicted and sentenced separately for these two offenses. Trial counsel preserved the issue by raising the lack of proof of a separate animus for kidnapping in a Crim.R. 29 motion at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">{\u00b6 90} In <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345, we established guidelines to determine whether kidnapping and rape are committed with a separate animus so as to permit separate punishment under R.C. 2941.25(B). We held in <em>Logan </em>that \u201c[w]here the restraint or movement of the victim is merely incidental to a separate underlying crime, there exists no separate animus sufficient to sustain separate convictions; however, where the restraint is prolonged, the confinement is secretive, or the movement is substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>tial so as to demonstrate a significance independent of the other offense, there exists a separate animus as to each offense sufficient to support separate convictions.\u201d Id. at paragraph (a) of the syllabus. Conversely, the <em>Logan </em>court recognized that where the asportation or restraint \u201csubjects the victim to a substantial increase in risk of harm separate and apart from * * * the underlying crime, there exists a separate animus.\u201d Id., 60 Ohio St.2d 126,14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345, at paragraph (b) of the syllabus. In <em>Logan, </em>we also noted that where murder is the underlying crime, a kidnapping in facilitation thereof would generally constitute a separately cognizable offense. Id. at 135, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">{\u00b6 91} In <em>Logan, </em>we found no separate animus to sustain separate convictions for rape and kidnapping. In <em>Logan, </em>after the victim refused to accept some pills, the \u201cdefendant produced a knife, held it to her throat, and forced her into an alley. Under such duress, she accompanied him down the alley, around a corner, and down a flight of stairs, where he raped her at knifepoint.\u201d Id. at 127, 397 N.E.2d 1345, 14 O.O.3d 373. In <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 197, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, citing <em>Logan, </em>we found that charging two aggravating circumstances under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) (robbery and kidnapping) was \u201cunnecessarily cumulative.\u201d In the course of a bank robbery, Jenkins aimed his firearm at certain individuals and ordered others in the bank to move to the rear of the building, but \u201csuch restraint or movement of the victims was incidental\u201d to the robbery. Id. at 198,15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">{\u00b6 92} We have found that a separate animus existed, pursuant to <em>Logan, </em>in a variety of kidnapping and aggravated murder cases. In <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, at \u00b6 135, the defendant <em>lured </em>the six-year-old victim into his apartment and kept her there long enough to show her some videos before raping and killing her. In <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 280-281, 754 N.E.2d 1150, \u201cthe [defendant tied [the victim] to the bed, gagged her, stabbed her one hundred thirty-eight times, slit her throat, and strangled her to death.\u201d In <em>State v. Simko </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 483, 489, 644 N.E.2d 345, the defendant \u201crestrained and terrorized\u201d the victim for approximately one-half hour before shooting her when she tried to escape. In <em>State v. Hill </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 313, 595 N.E.2d 884, the defendant forced the 12-year-old victim from a parking lot to a secluded, wooded area, where the victim was repeatedly beaten, raped, and then strangled and set on fire. See, also, <em>State v. Seiber, </em>56 Ohio St.3d 4, 564 N.E.2d 408 (kidnapping found when defendant and accomplice terrorized and held bar patrons at gunpoint for 20 to 30 minutes, preventing them from leaving); <em>State v. Powell </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 255, 261-262, 552 N.E.2d 191 (kidnapping upheld when defendant lured a child from her home to fourth floor of nearby building where he attempted to rape her and ultimately killed her by throwing her from the window).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>{\u00b6 93} Nonetheless, each of the foregoing cases is distinguishable from this case. In contrast to the facts established in those cases, the state presented no evidence in this case that Adams moved Ashley to or from the bedroom where she was killed or that he tied her up or restrained her in any way other than what was necessary to rape and kill her. No evidence exists in the record of substantial movement, prolonged restraint, or secretive confinement. <em>Logan, </em>60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345, at syllabus. In fact, no evidence exists that Ashley was moved at all. Nor did a \u201ckidnapping in facilitation\u201d of a murder occur. <em>Logan, </em>60 Ohio St.2d at 135, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345. Further, the evidence indicates that Adams was in the house no more than 30 minutes. The pathologist reported that the attack on Ashley and Esther \u201ccould have happened very quickly,\u201d \u201cin a matter of minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">{\u00b6 94} In sum, we hold that the evidence is insufficient, under <em>Logan, </em>to establish the separate animus required to separately convict Adams for kidnapping Ashley. See <em>State v. Donald </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 73, 11 O.O.3d 242, 386 N.E.2d 1341, syllabus (kidnapping is an offense of similar import to rape); Logan; <em>Jenkins</em>; <em>State v. Fears </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 344, 715 N.E.2d 136 (no separate animus for death-penalty specifications alleging robbery and kidnapping without prolonged restraint, significant asportation, or secret confinement).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">{\u00b6 95} Accordingly, the conviction for kidnapping in Count 5, as well as the findings of guilty to the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specifications for murder during a kidnapping in Count 1 and Count 3, is vacated. Count 5 and those specifications are dismissed. The separate sentence for count 5 is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">{\u00b6 96} <em>Jury Instructions </em>In proposition of law XI, Adams argues that the trial court erred by referring to \u201cAshley Dawn Cook, Age 12,\u201d in the instructions on Count 2 and in death-penalty specification 7 in Counts 1 and 2. Adams points out that Ashley\u2019s age was an element of these offenses and an issue of fact for the jury. Her age was also relevant as an issue of fact in Count 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">{\u00b6 97} Due process requires the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the charged offense. <em>In re Winship </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368. Jury instructions that effectively relieve the state of its burden of persuasion violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>Sandstrom v. Montana </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39; <em>Rose v. Clark </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 570, 580, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">{\u00b6 98} In this case, the trial court\u2019s initial trial-phase instructions, which concerned Counts 5 through 8, the kidnapping and rape charges, did not list Ashley\u2019s age as 12 years. For those charges, the court instructed that whether Ashley was \u201cunder 13 years of age\u201d or \u201cunder the age of 13\u201d was an issue of fact for the jury. Adams does not complain about that part of the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>{\u00b6 99} Later, the court instructed the jury on the elements of death-penalty specification 7, murder of a child under 13 in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(9), in Counts 1 and 2. On those specifications, the court instructed the jury that to \u201cfind the Defendant guilty * * * you must find that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant * * * did purposely cause the death of Ashley Dawn Cook, age 12, who was under 13 years of age at the time of the [murder].\u201d Adams now argues that the trial judge in effect instructed the jury that Ashley was in fact 12 years old, when the jury had the responsibility to make a finding of fact on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">{\u00b6 100} Nonetheless, we conclude that Adams waived this claim by not objecting in a timely manner to any ambiguity in the instruction relating to Ashley\u2019s age. See <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus. In this case, the objection was not timely. Counsel had received the instructions and verdict forms two days previously, but counsel did not raise any objection until after the jury was instructed. Untimely objections are reviewed \u201cusing a plain-error analysis pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B).\u201d <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 96, 102, 545 N.E.2d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">{\u00b6 101} Further, we conclude that the instruction did not foreclose the jury\u2019s role. The reference to Ashley as \u201cage 12\u201d came in the context of the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury as to the charge as stated in the indictment. The court then properly instructed the jury that the state had to prove the victim\u2019s age. When considered in the context of the entire instructions, the jury would not have understood the instruction as requiring it to accept that Ashley was 12 years old, without making the required factual finding. See <em>Estelle v. McGuire </em>(1991), 502 U.S. 62, 72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">{\u00b6 102} At worst, the instruction was ambiguous and did not constitute plain error, because the outcome of the trial was not affected by the reference to Ashley\u2019s age. <em>State v. Underwood, </em>3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus. Compelling evidence, including Ashley\u2019s death certificate, as well as testimony at trial, proved that Ashley was 12 years old when she was murdered. No evidence at trial contradicted that fact. Accordingly, we regard the issue raised in proposition XI waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">{\u00b6 103} <em>Restraints during trial </em>In proposition of law XII, Adams argues that the trial court improperly authorized the use of an electronic restraint on him, a \u201cBand-It\u201d belt that could be activated to produce an electric shock if Adams was disruptive in court. Adams argues that the trial court violated his right to a fair trial because the court authorized fitting the device on him without a factual basis for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">{\u00b6 104} With respect to customary physical restraints such as handcuffs or leg shackles, we have long recognized that \u201cno one should be tried while shackled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>absent unusual circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Kidder </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 279, 285, 513 N.E.2d 311. \u201cHowever, shackling is left to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Richey </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 353, 358, 595 N.E.2d 915, citing <em>State v. Woodards </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St.2d 14, 23, 35 O.O.2d 8, 215 N.E.2d 568. The trial court must exercise its own discretion and not leave the issue up to security-personnel. See, e.g., <em>Woodards v. Cardwell </em>(C.A.6, 1970), 430 F.2d 978, 981-982. Accord <em>State v. Cassano, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 94, 2002-Ohio-3751, 772 N.E.2d 81, \u00b6 54. Courts have upheld restraints in trials of defendants with a documented history of violence or escape attempts. See, e.g., <em>Harrell v. Israel </em>(C.A.7, 1982), 672 F.2d 632, 636; <em>Kennedy v. Cardwell </em>(C.A.6, 1973), 487 F.2d 101, 105, fn. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">{\u00b6 105} Courts elsewhere have upheld the use of electronic stun belts when specifically justified. See, e.g., <em>State v. Powell </em>(2002), 274 Kan. 618, 56 P.3d 189 (factors justifying use include serious nature of charges, history of institutional violence, history of verbal or physical assaults); <em>United States v. McKissick </em>(C.A.10, 2000), 204 F.3d 1282, 1299 (without evidence that jury knew that defendants were wearing stun belts, court will not presume prejudice). Accord <em>Scieszka v. State </em>(2003), 259 Ga.App. 486, 578 S.E.2d 149 (where no prejudice is shown, use of stun belt not abuse of discretion); <em>Simms v. State </em>(Tex.App.2004), 127 S.W.3d 924. Other courts have reversed when stun belts have not been amply justified on the record. See, e.g., <em>Gonzalez v. Pliler </em>(C.A.9, 2003), 341 F.3d 897; <em>People v. Mar </em>(2002), 28 Cal.4th 1201, 124 Cal.Rptr.2d 161, 52 P.3d 95; <em>United States v. Durham </em>(C.A.11, 2002), 287 F.3d 1297. Further, the Supreme Court of Indiana has flatly' declared that \u201cstun belts may not be used on defendants in the courtrooms of this State.\u201d <em>Wrinkles v. State </em>(Ind.2001), 749 N.E.2d 1179, 1194. In Ohio, this device has been used previously in some capital cases. See, e.g., <em>State v. Filiaggi </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 230, 238, 714 N.E.2d 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">{\u00b6 106} In this case, the trial court conducted a hearing on September 6, 2001, and heard arguments of counsel and statements from security personnel before authorizing the use of this security device. Further, the record shows that the trial court had a factual basis for authorizing the device.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">{\u00b6 107} First, Chief Deputy Cook of the Sheriffs Office explained, at the hearing, that the Band-It device would produce an electric shock only \u201cif the Defendant embarks on an escape attempt, an assault, or other violent behavior.\u201d Further, Cook explained that the device is \u201cnon-lethal, it\u2019s short-term and it incapacitates.\u201d There is also \u201can audible alert tone that actually tells the Defendant it\u2019s going to go off, so he\u2019s got some discretion on whether to pull back.\u201d The trial court noted that it \u201cdoes absolutely zero harm\u201d when not activated. Although Adams suffers from epilepsy, no medical evidence indicated that he was at additional risk if the device was activated. Nor did evidence establish that his ability to assist counsel was impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>{\u00b6 108} Second, because Adams was wearing clothing over the device, the device was not visible to the jury and, unless it was activated, the jury would not know that it was being worn. The record does not reflect that it was activated in this trial. In contrast, leg irons or shackles always present a risk that jurors will inadvertently discover the restraints and possibly be influenced in deliberations. See, e.g., <em>Illinois v. Allen </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 337, 344, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353. In this case, the jury learned about the device only when Adams personally complained about having to wear it when he made an unsworn statement during the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">{\u00b6 109} Third, the trial court explained its decision to authorize the Band-It device in an entry. The court explained that in November 2000, Adams had been convicted of an unrelated murder and rape and had been sentenced to 25 years to life. Adams also had a \u201clengthy criminal record and [had] been imprisoned on at least four (4) prior occasions.\u201d The trial court found that based on jail reports, Adams \u201cmay pose a risk of escape.\u201d Also, according to Dr. Darnall, Adams had \u201cdifficulty in adequately controlling his frustration and anger.\u201d Adams told Dr. Darnall, \u201c[I]f I get close to it, I am gonna sucker [punch] them [his previous attorneys]. * * * I am going to get the satisfaction and knock the f* * *ing shit out of him.\u201d According to Dr. Zuchowski, Adams could control his behavior, but \u201chis personality traits, particularly impulsivity and irritability, make courtroom outbursts a possibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">{\u00b6 110} On the foregoing basis, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in authorizing this device to be used on Adams during his trial. Cf. <em>State v. Franklin, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, at \u00b681 (defendant\u2019s past violent behavior and psychologist\u2019s description of him as a \u201ctime bomb\u201d justified shackling in penalty phase); <em>State v. Cassano, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 94, 2002-Ohio-3751, 772 N.E.2d 81, at \u00b6 55 (convicted violent felon, murder occurred in prison). Accordingly, we overrule proposition XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">{\u00b6 111} <em>Gruesome photographs </em>In proposition of law XVI, Adams argues that the trial court\u2019s decision to admit certain \u201cshocking and gruesome\u201d photographs deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">{\u00b6 112} In capital cases, nonrepetitive photographs, even if gruesome, are admissible if relevant, as long as the probative value of each photograph outweighs the danger of material prejudice to an accused. <em>State v. Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, paragraph seven of the syllabus; <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 257, 513 N.E.2d 267. Decisions on the admissibility of photographs are \u201cleft to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 601, 605 N.E.2d 916; <em>State v. Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 264, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>{\u00b6 113} As to many photographs and slides that Adams now complains about, he did not object at trial and thus waived all but plain error. No outcome-determinative plain error resulted from the admission of these exhibits because they portray relevant subjects and were of probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">{\u00b6 114} As to crime-scene photographs to which an objection was made, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting these exhibits. Several prosecution exhibits are four-inch-by-six-inch crime-scene photographs of the victims. One exhibit portrays the head and neck injuries that Esther suffered, and other exhibits, taken from different angles, portray the injuries to Ashley, her posed body, and the body\u2019s relationship to the surroundings.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">{\u00b6 115} The photographs were limited in number and noncumulative, and each had substantial probative value. For example, these photographs illustrated the testimony of detectives who described the crime scene and helped to establish the killer\u2019s intent. See <em>State v. </em>Goodwin, 84 Ohio St.3d at 342, 703 N.E.2d 1251; <em>State v. Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 158, 694 N.E.2d 932. These photographs also gave the jury an \u201cappreciation of the nature and circumstances of the crimes.\u201d <em>State v. Evans, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 251, 586 N.E.2d 1042. In other cases involving even more-gruesome photographs, the court has found no abuse of discretion. See, e.g., <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 108-109, 684 N.E.2d 668; <em>State v. Biros </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 443, 678 N.E.2d 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">{\u00b6 116} The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting photographs of the victims when they were alive. Adams has failed to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the admission of these photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">{\u00b6 117} Nor did the trial court abuse its discretion in admitting many slides that the pathologist used to illustrate his testimony. Some slides were crime-scene views that illustrated the pathologist\u2019s description of the crime scene, portrayed the victims and their injuries in relation to the surroundings, helped to establish the killer\u2019s intentions, and corroborated testimony of detectives. A few did not portray bodies and hence were not gruesome. Other slides taken during the autopsy exactly portray Ashley\u2019s injuries, and their admission did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Other slides depict Esther\u2019s different injuries. Cf. <em>State v. Smith, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 367, 2002-Ohio-6659, 780 N.E.2d 221, at \u00b6 32-37; <em>State v. Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 289, 754 N.E.2d 1150. Thus, we reject proposition XVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">{\u00b6 118} <em>Cumulative error </em>In proposition of law XVII, Adams argues that the cumulative effect of errors during his trial denied him due process and a fair trial. However, we have rejected Adams\u2019s claims of error as explained in connection with other propositions. See our discussion on voir dire (III, V), refusal to change venue (IV), the admission of DNA evidence (II), and restraints during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>trial (XII). The trial court adequately protected the fair-trial and due-process rights of Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">{\u00b6 119} Nor did the prosecutor commit misconduct, as Adams suggests, when the pathologist displayed, for demonstrative purposes, an exhibit, which was not admitted, of the type of weapon that may have caused Esther\u2019s injuries. The prosecutor did not err by presenting evidence as to french fries found in Adams\u2019s car. That fact related to other evidence in the case indicating that Ashley had eaten french fries before her death. Evidence that a steak knife was found in the Chevy Cavalier was inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">{\u00b6 120} We find that multiple errors did not occur in this case. See <em>State v. Madrigal, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 397-398, 721 N.E.2d 52; <em>State v. Garner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 49, 64, 656 N.E.2d 623. In our view, the failure to prove a separate animus as to the kidnapping did not affect the other convictions. See discussion on proposition VI. We find no other errors that prejudiced the substantial rights of Adams. Hence, we reject proposition XVII.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Penalty issues</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">{\u00b6 121} <em>Duplicative aggravating circumstances </em>In proposition of law VII, Adams asserts that his rights were violated because duplicative death specifications were submitted for the jury to weigh and consider against mitigation evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">{\u00b6 122} Duplicative death-penalty specifications should be merged when they \u201carise from the same act or indivisible course of conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph five of the syllabus. However, when the offenses illustrate a separate animus and do not show an indivisible course of conduct, merger is not required. See, e.g., <em>State v. Robb </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 85, 723 N.E.2d 1019 (court need not merge 2929.04[A][4], [A][5] or [A][7] specifications); <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 579, 660 N.E.2d 724 (offenses in [A][7] and [A][5] death specifications are not duplicative in that case).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">{\u00b6 123} As we have discussed in connection with proposition VI, no separate animus existed as to the asserted kidnapping of Ashley, and we have vacated the findings of guilt as to the death-penalty kidnapping specifications in Counts 1 and 3. We will consider that failure of proof in our independent assessment of the penalty. See <em>State v. Mitts </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 223, 232, 690 N.E.2d 522; <em>State v. Garner, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 53, 656 N.E.2d 623; <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 527, 605 N.E.2d 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">{\u00b6 124} In other particulars, however, we conclude that Adams\u2019s complaint about duplicative death-penalty specifications lacks merit. First, counsel failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>object and thus waived the issue. <em>State v. Underwood, </em>3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">{\u00b6 125} Second, the specifications were not duplicative for punishment purposes, and counsel were not ineffective for not raising the issue. Murder while committing a felony, such as aggravated burglary, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and during a course of conduct of purposeful killing, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), as charged in Count 1 and Count 3, are not duplicative. See, e.g., <em>State v. Smith, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 116, 684 N.E.2d 668; <em>State v. Williams, 74 </em>Ohio St.3d at 579, 660 N.E.2d 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">{\u00b6 126} Third, murder of a person specifically protected because of status, such as a child, is not duplicative of other death specifications. See <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 199-200 (\u201ccourse of conduct,\u201d [A][5], and murder of police officer, [A][6], are not duplicative); <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, at \u00b6 141 (death of a child, [A][9], is not duplicative of [A][3] or [A][7]). Further, rape by fellatio and vaginal rape are separate offenses under R.C. 2941.25(B), even when one is \u201cfollowed immediately by\u201d the other. <em>State v. Barnes </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 13, 14, 22 O.O.3d 126, 427 N.E.2d 517. Accord <em>State v. Jones </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 12, 676 N.E.2d 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">{\u00b6 127} <em>Ineffective assistance on penalty-phase jury instructions </em>In proposition of law VIII, Adams argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by not requesting \u201cfact-specific mitigation instructions\u201d that would elaborate on \u201cother factors\u201d specified in R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">{\u00b6 128} However, counsel\u2019s decision not to request the trial court to explain how the evidence relates to mitigating \u201cother factors\u201d does not reflect deficient performance. Counsel may have believed that doing so would limit his argument, and thus his decision \u201cfalls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Moreover, the trial court need not explain or elaborate on \u201cother factors\u201d in instructions. <em>State v. Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 122, 559 N.E.2d 710: <em>State v. Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 84-85, 723 N.E.2d 1019. The trial court, by referring to \u201cother factors\u201d in the instructions, never \u201cprecluded [the jury] from considering any evidence as mitigating.\u201d <em>State v. Mitts, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 234, 690 N.E.2d 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">{\u00b6 129} Second, Adams has not established prejudice from the absence of such an instruction. Thus, Adams has not provided any basis to believe that \u201cthere exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus. Accordingly, we reject proposition VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Settled issues</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">{\u00b6 130} <em>Constitutionality </em>We summarily reject proposition IX, which argues that Adams\u2019s counsel provided ineffective assistance by not filing pretrial motions challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty. See <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 569, 715 N.E.2d 1144; <em>State v. Davis </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 326, 349, 581 N.E.2d 1362. See, also, <em>State v. </em>Carter; 89 Ohio St.3d at 607, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">{\u00b6 131} <em>Lethal injection </em>In proposition of law XIII, Adams challenges the constitutionality of lethal injection to carry out the death penalty. However, we have previously rejected similar arguments. See <em>State v. Carter, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 608, 734 N.E.2d 345. Adams\u2019s challenge to electrocution is moot because Ohio law no longer authorizes electrocution to carry out the death penalty. See R.C. 2949.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">{\u00b6 132} <em>Peremptory challenges </em>We summarily reject proposition XIV, which argues that Adams was entitled to 12 peremptory challenges. <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, at \u00b6 66-67; <em>State v. Greer </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 236, 530 N.E.2d 382, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">{\u00b6 133} <em>Reference to jury recommendation </em>In proposition of law XV, Adams complains that the trial court\u2019s reference to the jury verdict as a recommendation, over his objection, affected the reliability of the jury\u2019s verdict. In fact, the trial court never used the term \u201crecommendation,\u201d and the use of the term in the verdict forms accurately reflected Ohio law, did not diminish the jury\u2019s sense of its sentencing responsibility, and did not constitute error. We summarily reject proposition XV. <em>State v. Hughbanks, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 365, 2003-Ohio-4121, 792 N.E.2d 1081, \u00b6 102; <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 101, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">INDEPENDENT SENTENCE EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">{\u00b6 134} <em>Penalty-phase evidence </em>At the penalty phase, Adams presented testimony about his history and background from a psychologist, a psychiatrist, his former girlfriend, and his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">{\u00b6 135} Dr. Sandra McPherson, a psychologist, interviewed Adams, consulted others, and examined various records relating to Adams. According to Dr. McPherson, Adams\u2019s IQ is 77, or in the low average to borderline range and in the lowest 12 percent of the population. His personality test suggests \u201csignificant maladjustment,\u201d and Adams has a \u201cpersonality disorder not otherwise specified.\u201d He is depressed and periodically suicidal. Adams started drinking at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>age five or six and has \u201cbeen involved with multiple substances, amphetamines, marijuana, [and] cocaine, as well as alcohol.\u201d Substance abuse has reduced his capacity for effective cognitive functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">{\u00b6 136} In his early life, Adams suffered from a chaotic upbringing. His father \u201cwas a brutal and seriously disturbed personality,\u201d who beat Adams\u2019s mother and his children regularly and sexually abused his sons and daughters. At one point, his father took the children and hid them for six months. Adams\u2019s history \u201cis certainly at the worst end of * * * disruptive families.\u201d Adams was then raised in various foster homes. As an adult, Adams had a few paying jobs but was not regularly employed. He did odd jobs but primarily lived on social security.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">{\u00b6 137} Dr. Steven Zuchowski, a psychiatrist, corroborated Dr. McPherson\u2019s evaluation and the fact that Adams suffered from a \u201cpersonality disorder, not otherwise specified,\u201d with \u201cborderline\u201d and \u201canti-social\u201d elements. Adams reportedly also suffered abuse in various foster homes. Adams does not have a mental disease or defect, and no medication or therapy is available to treat him. Adams declined to discuss with Dr. Zuchowski his drug abuse or the charged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">{\u00b6 138} Jeffrey Adams, the defendant\u2019s older brother, confirmed details about the family and the chaotic upbringing that the nine Adams children had. Six siblings are still living. Jeffrey noted that their alcoholic father regularly beat their mother and the children and also raped several children, including Stanley.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">{\u00b6 139} Loretta Stanford, a former girlfriend, lived with Adams for nine years, and they had two sons, Stanley, age 12, and William, age ten. When they lived together, Adams was not mean or abusive, but he used crack cocaine and drank too much. But Adams had a \u201cvery nice relationship\u201d with his sons; they played baseball, rode minibikes, and went fishing. He loved them and they loved their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">{\u00b6 140} In an unsworn statement, Adams complained about the Band-It electronic device he was forced to wear, advising the jury that he was \u201cunder a constant threat of being zapped.\u201d He also complained about the prosecutors and the trial, especially the DNA evidence, since he \u201cdidn\u2019t rape little Ashley, let alone kill her.\u201d He said he was sorry that the jury had found him guilty but that he was innocent and \u201ccould never, never take the life of anybody, especially a kid.\u201d Then he stated, \u201cMy son asked me to ask you not to kill his dad. Don\u2019t kill me, please.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">{\u00b6 141} <em>Sentence evaluation </em>After independent assessment, we find that the evidence proves the aggravating circumstances of which Adams was convicted, i.e., murder as part of a \u201ccourse of conduct involving the purposeful killing\u201d of two or more persons, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and murder during an aggravated burglary, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). As to Ashley, the evidence also proved the addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>tional death specifications including murder during rape, both vaginal and fellatio, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and murder of a child under 13 years of age, R.C. 2929.04(A)(9). We have dismissed the murder-during-kidnapping specifications, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and will consider that fact during our independent reassessment of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">{\u00b6 142} As to mitigating factors, we find nothing in the nature and circumstances of the offenses to be mitigating. But we do find that the history and background of Adams provides mitigating features. Adams had a horrific upbringing and an extremely abusive father. Adams lacked the care and nurturing of a loving family while growing up and was raised in numerous foster homes. This factor undoubtedly contributed to his present and past difficulties. But we find nothing in his character to be mitigating.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">{\u00b6 143} We find the following statutory mitigating factors not to be applicable: R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (\u201cvictim inducement\u201d); (B)(2) (\u201cduress, coercion, or strong provocation\u201d); (B)(3) (\u201cmental disease or defect\u201d); (B)(4) (\u201cyouth\u201d); (B)(5) (\u201clack of criminal record\u201d); and (B)(6) (\u201cnot the principal offender\u201d). Adams was 33 years old at the time of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">{\u00b6 144} We regard as mitigating \u201cother factors,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), the fact that Adams has a psychological personality disorder and substance-abuse problems. The fact that Adams has children who love him is also a mitigating \u201cother factor,\u201d but we find no other mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">{\u00b6 145} As to the aggravated murder of Esther Cook, we find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances of murder during a burglary and as a course of conduct outweigh the mitigation presented in this case. Adams feloniously entered Esther\u2019s home and savagely and brutally beat her to death, and he did so as a part of a course of conduct involving Esther\u2019s murder and the murder of her 12-year-old daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">{\u00b6 146} When considering Ashley\u2019s murder, we also find beyond a reasonable doubt that the multiple aggravating circumstances, murder during a course of conduct, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and murder during a burglary and during rape, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), as well as murder of a child, R.C. 2929.04(A)(9), outweigh the mitigating features that Adams presented. Adams chose to rape and murder an innocent 12-year-old child, who was the half-sister of his own girlfriend. His acts clearly demonstrate that the death penalty is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">{\u00b6 147} We find that the death penalty for the aggravated murder of Esther Cook and the death penalty for the aggravated murder of Ashley Cook are proportionate when compared with other \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d murders. See, e.g., <em>State v. Vrabel, 99 </em>Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303; <em>State v. Braden, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003-Ohio-1325, 785 N.E.2d 439; <em>State v. Cornwell, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 560, 715 N.E.2d 1144; <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 696 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>N.E.2d 1009; <em>State v. Keith, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 514, 684 N.E.2d 47; <em>State v. Awkal </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 324, 667 N.E.2d 960; <em>State v. Allard </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 482, 663 N.E.2d 1277; and <em>State v. Combs </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 278, 581 N.E.2d 1071. We find that the death sentence is also proportionate when compared with other cases involving \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d murders committed during a burglary. See, e.g., <em>State v. Hughbanks, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 365, 2003-Ohio-4121, 792 N.E.2d 1081; <em>State v. Hessler, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 108, 734 N.E.2d 1237.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b654-9\">Dennis Watkins, Trumbull County Prosecuting Attorney, and LuWayne Annos, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AJK\">Mary Jane Stephens and John B. Juhasz, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 148} Additionally, we find that the death penalty for the murder of Ashley is neither excessive nor disproportionate when compared with similar felony-murder cases involving rape of a child victim, implicating both R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) and (A)(9). See, e.g., <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185; <em>State v. Smith, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 367, 2002-Ohio-6659, 780 N.E.2d 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 149} Accordingly, the conviction for kidnapping in Count 5, as well as the findings of guilty in counts 1 and 3 as to the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) (murder during a kidnapping), are vacated, and Count 5 and those specifications are dismissed. Otherwise, the judgment of the trial court and the convictions, including the sentences of death, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b654-8\">Resnick, F.E.
