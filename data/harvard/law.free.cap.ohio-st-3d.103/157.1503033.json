Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, John R. Schuller, filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim against his employer, LTV Steel Company, alleging that he had contracted the occupational disease of asbestosis. After Schuller\u2019s claim was denied, he appealed the denial to the Court of Common Pleas of Trumbull County. The jury determined that Schuller was entitled to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. The court ordered costs to be taxed against the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">{\u00b6 2} Schuller filed a postverdict motion for reimbursement of costs and attorney fees, totalling $9,229.18. The bureau agreed that Schuller was entitled to be reimbursed for his attorney fees ($2,500) and for miscellaneous deposition and filing fee expenses ($1,697.25).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, it objected to the remaining expenses ($5,031.93), including the expert witness fees of Dr. Venizelos, who testified live at trial, and of Dr. Bleggi, whose videotaped deposition was played at trial. The trial court agreed and authorized reimbursement for only those expenses and fees agreed to by the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">{\u00b6 3} The court of appeals affirmed that part of the trial court\u2019s decision denying Schuller\u2019s request for reimbursement for Dr. Venizelos\u2019s live in-court testimony. However, it allowed reimbursement for Dr. Bleggi\u2019s videotaped trial deposition fee and, therefore, reversed the trial court\u2019s decision on this point. The court then certified its decision to be in conflict with the First District Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Dean v. Conrad </em>(1999), 134 Ohio App.3d 367, 731 N.E.2d 212, and the Eighth District Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Dixon v. Ford Motor Co., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82148, 2003-Ohio-3959, 2003 WL 21710796. This appeal is before this court upon our determination that a conflict exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">{\u00b6 4} The certified issue for our review is \u201c[wjhether an expert\u2019s witness fee for live in-court testimony is a reimbursable cost of legal proceedings pursuant to R.C. 4123.512(F).\u201d For the reasons that follow, we answer this question in the affirmative and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals in part and remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 4123.512(F) provides for the reimbursement of the \u201ccost of any legal proceedings\u201d incurred by claimants who bring successful workers\u2019 compensation appeals. This section states:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe cost of any legal proceedings authorized by this section, including an attorney\u2019s fee to the claimant\u2019s attorney to be fixed by the trial judge, based upon the effort expended, in the event the claimant\u2019s right to participate or to continue to participate in the fund is established upon the final determination of an appeal, shall be taxed against the employer or the commission if the commission or the administrator rather than the employer contested the right of the claimant to participate in the fund. The attorney\u2019s fee shall not exceed twenty-five hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">{\u00b6 7} In our prior decisions, we have interpreted the phrase \u201ccost of any legal proceedings\u201d broadly, recognizing that the purpose of allowing reimbursement under R.C. 4123.512 is \u201cto minimize the actual expense incurred by an injured employee who establishes his or her right to participate in the fund.\u201d <em>Moore v. Gen. Motors Corp., Terex Div. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 259, 261-262, 18 OBR 314, 480 N.E.2d 1101 (construing former R.C. 4123.519, the predecessor of R.C. 4123.512). In order to ensure that a successful claimant is not penalized for pursuing his or her appeal, and in comporting with the legislative mandate that workers\u2019 compensation statutes are to be liberally construed, R.C. 4123.95, we have consequently allowed reimbursement for a variety of litigation expenses connected with the preparation and presentation of a successful appeal. For instance, in <em>Moore, </em>we held that an expert witness\u2019s fee for preparing and giving his or her deposition is reimbursable as a part of the \u201ccost of any legal proceedings.\u201d Id. at syllabus. We subsequently held that an attorney\u2019s travel expenses incurred in the taking of an expert\u2019s deposition are reimbursable expenses under R.C. 4123.512(F), since these expenses are necessary for prosecuting a workers\u2019 compensation appeal <em>(Kilgore v. Chrysler Corp. </em>[2000], 92 Ohio St.3d 184, 749 N.E.2d 267) and that reasonable videotaped-deposition expenses may be taxed as costs and are reimbursable under R.C. 4123.512(F). <em>Cave v. Conrad </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 299, 762 N.E.2d 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">{\u00b6 8} We explained in <em>Kilgore </em>that these types of expenses \u201care a reasonable litigation expense that might have the effect of unreasonably dissipating a claimant\u2019s award.\u201d Id. at 187-188, 749 N.E.2d 267. Although we recognized that reimbursement would not be allowed for the everyday costs of doing business, we stressed that the \u201ccost of any legal proceedings\u201d language of R.C. 4123.512(F) \u201capplies to costs bearing a direct relation to a claimant\u2019s appeal that lawyers traditionally charge to clients and that also have a proportionally serious impact on a claimant\u2019s award.\u201d Id. at 188, 749 N.E.2d 267. We also stated that reimbursement for such expenses is subject to the trial court\u2019s determination of their reasonable necessity to the presentation of the claimant\u2019s appeal. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">{\u00b6 9} Despite these decisions, the bureau urges us to narrowly construe the phrase \u201ccost of any legal proceedings\u201d in R.C. 4123.512(F) to exclude reimburse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>ment for an expert witness\u2019s fee for live in-court testimony. Although the bureau concedes that the \u201ccost of any legal proceedings\u201d in R.C. 4123.512(F) is broader in scope than the \u201ccosts of the stenographic deposition\u201d language in R.C. 4123.512(D), the bureau argues that a broad construction would undercut the purpose of the General Assembly in enacting R.C. 4123.512(D), which is to encourage the presentation of medical expert testimony by deposition rather than through live testimony in court. For support, appellee cites <em>Akers v. Serv-A-Portion, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 78, 31 OBR 190, 508 N.E.2d 964, which allowed reimbursement for the cost of depositions under former R.C. 4123.519(D), 4123.512\u2019s predecessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">{\u00b6 10} We reject the bureau\u2019s position. At issue in this appeal is R.C. 4123.512(F), not (D). Thus, the <em>Akers </em>decision and the policy behind favoring expert testimony by deposition under R.C. 4123.512(D) is irrelevant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, if we were to construe the language of R.C. 4123.512(F) as the bureau suggests, we believe that this would contravene the legislative intent behind this statute, which is that \u201ca claimant\u2019s recovery shall not be dissipated by reasonable litigation expenses connected with the preparation and presentation of an appeal.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>18 Ohio St.3d at 262,18 OBR 314, 480 N.E.2d 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">{\u00b6 11} The decisions certified as being in conflict with the decision below, in holding that the in-court testimony of a claimant\u2019s medical expert is a reimbursable \u201ccost of any legal proceedings,\u201d understood this policy and correctly interpreted our prior decisions. In <em>Dean v. Conrad, </em>134 Ohio App.3d at 372-373, 731 N.E.2d 212, the First District Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c[i]n light of the intent behind R.C. 4123.512, we liberally construe R.C. 4123.512(F) to include as part of \u2018the costs of any legal proceedings\u2019 the cost of an expert whose testimony is reasonably necessary to establish a prevailing claimant\u2019s right to participate in the fund.\u201d In <em>Dixon v. Ford Motor Co., </em>2003-Ohio-3959, the Eighth District Court of Appeals, in reaching the same conclusion, reiterated why it makes sense to allow a successful claimant in a workers\u2019 compensation appeal to be reimbursed for a medical expert\u2019s live testimony. The court aptly noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cTo rule as Ford argues would require claimants to sacrifice strategy for economy. For various reasons, counsel for a claimant may find in-court testimony of an expert preferable to video deposition testimony. Allowing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>taxing of costs for deposition testimony, but prohibiting the taxing of costs for in-court testimony would create a fundamental unfairness to claimants. It would penalize a successful claimant for their attorney\u2019s strategic decision to present live testimony of an expert witness or would force a possibly undesirable strategic decision to rely only on deposition testimony in the interest of saving money.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b277-9\">Kelley &amp; Ferraro, L.L.P., Michael V. Kelley, Thomas M. Wilson and Robert A. Marcis II, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AQ7\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, Gerald H. Waterman, Assistant Attorney General, Diane Richards Brey, Deputy Solicitor, and Douglas R. Cole, State Solicitor, for appellee Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">{\u00b6 13} We agree with this rationale. The testimony of a medical expert is vital to a workers\u2019 compensation claimant\u2019s being able to prove that his or her injuries meet the requirements for participation in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. Thus, we find that a fee for a witness whose testimony is integral to the claimant\u2019s case and is directly related to his or her appeal is a reimbursable expense under R.C. 4123.512(F). However, as we stated in <em>Kilgore, </em>the amount to be reimbursed must be determined by the trial court. Id., 92 Ohio St.3d at 188, 749 N.E.2d 267. Thus, after the trial court determines that the fee paid to an expert for in-court testimony is directly related to the claimant\u2019s appeal, the court must then determine the reasonableness of the fee. Consequently, we hold that an expert witness\u2019s fee for live in-court testimony is a reimbursable cost of legal proceedings pursuant to R.C. 4123.512(F), subject to the trial court\u2019s determination that the fee is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">{\u00b6 14} As applied to this case, we find that appellant is entitled to be reimbursed for the fee charged by Dr. Venizelos for his live testimony, subject to the trial court\u2019s determination of the reasonableness of the fee. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals in part and remand this cause to the trial court to determine whether that fee was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Judgment reversed in part and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b277-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\">. {\u00b6 a} The costs approved by the bureau were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">{\u00b6 b} Plaintiffs attorney fees: $2,500</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">{\u00b6 c} Transcript/court reporter fee for deposition of Albert Bleggi, M.D.: $186.75</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">{\u00b6 d} Videotape/playback of Bleggi deposition: $575</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">{\u00b6 e} Deposition transcript of John Delliquadri, D.O.: $118.40</p>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">{\u00b6 f} Deposition transcripts of Paul Venizelos, M.D.: $528.10</p>\n<p id=\"b274-16\">{\u00b6 g} Deposition transcript of Ritha Kartan, M.D.: $189</p>\n<p id=\"b274-17\">{\u00b6 h} Filing fee: $100</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\">. In <em>Kilgore v. Chrysler Corp., </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 186-187, 749 N.E.2d 267, we differentiated between the reimbursibility of claimants\u2019 expenditures under R.C. 4123.512(D) and (F). We noted that, under subsection (D), both successful and unsuccessful claimants may be reimbursed for the costs of physicians\u2019 depositions filed with the court. In contrast, R.C. 4123.512(F) applies only to claimants who are found on appeal to be eligible to participate in the fund. This distinction is significant since \u201c[tjhese claimants incur out-of-the-ordinary expense in order to establish then\u2019 right to participate, additional expense that other claimants do not incur.\u201d Id. at 187, 749 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
