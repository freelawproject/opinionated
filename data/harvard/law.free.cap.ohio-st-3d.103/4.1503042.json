He was insured under medical professional liability policies issued by P.I.E. Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cP.I.E.\u201d) for the period July 1, 1993, through July 1, 1995. The primary policy provided liability coverage of up to $200,000 per claim with a $600,000 aggregate limit. P.I.E. had also issued an excess insurance policy to Katz that provided an additional $1 million per claim with an aggregate limit for all claims of $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">{\u00b6 2} In 1995, Katz notified P.I.E. that claims arising out of the treatment of Teri Sue Robinson had been made against him. In 1996, Susan Robinson (\u201cRobinson\u201d), appellee, filed an action in her capacity as administrator of Teri\u2019s estate, alleging that Katz negligently rendered medical care to Teri. Robinson included a survival claim to recover for Teri\u2019s medical expenses and pain and suffering. Robinson also asserted a wrongful death claim on behalf of three individuals: Teri\u2019s mother, father, and brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">{\u00b6 3} P.I.E. thereafter became insolvent. The parties agree that P.I.E.\u2019s obligations to Katz in regard to Robinson\u2019s claims are subject to the Ohio Insurance Guaranty Association Act, R.C. Chapter 3955 (\u201cthe Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">{\u00b6 4} The Act created the Ohio Insurance Guaranty Association (\u201cOIGA\u201d), appellant herein, a nonprofit, unincorporated association. R.C. 3955.06(A). OIGA collects funds from member insurers and administers those funds to protect insureds and third-party claimants from certain losses resulting from the insolvency of its members. R.C. 3955.08(A)(3). Pursuant to R.C. 3955.01(D)(2)(b) and 3955.08(A)(1), OIGA is responsible for paying \u201ccovered claims\u201d up to a statutory limit of $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The cause before us is a declaratory judgment action filed by Katz pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2721. Katz named OIGA and sought a declaration of OIGA\u2019s limits of responsibility under the Act. Katz alleged that a real and actual controversy exists as to how many covered claims have been in fact asserted against Katz: one survival claim and additionally one claim for each of Teri\u2019s relatives entitled to recover under the wrongful-death statute, per policy, or only one combined claim statutorily capped at $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">{\u00b6 6} Robinson intervened as a party plaintiff in the action. Each of the parties filed a motion for summary judgment. Katz and Robinson contended that there are at least four separate claims covered under each of the P.I.E. policies: the survival claim and claims on behalf of the decedent\u2019s relatives, including her mother, father, and brother. OIGA asserted that its exposure was limited to one payment of $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">{\u00b6 7} The primary policy included the following provision:</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cV \u2014 LIMITS OF LIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe Limits of Liability of The Company are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201ca. as to each claim</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe Limit of Liability stated in the General Declarations, as applicable to \u2018each claim,\u2019 is the limit of The Company\u2019s liability for all damages because of any one claim or suit or all claims or suits first made during the policy period because of injury to or death of any one person * * *.\u201d (Boldface sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">{\u00b6 12} Katz conceded that this provision \u201cmight <em>arguably </em>limit coverage to a single limit for all claims arising out of one occurrence\u201d (emphasis added) but contended that the provision was nevertheless unenforceable pursuant to <em>Savoie v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 500, 620 N.E.2d 809. Similarly, in support of her motion for summary judgment, appellee Robinson asserted that <em>Savoie </em>controls to invalidate this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court entered summary judgment, recognizing four separate claims against the primary policy. It found that the primary policy provided coverage of up to $200,000 for each of those claims, with a total aggregate limit of $600,000. It declared OIGA liable to the same extent. The trial court grounded its decision in <em>Savoie, </em>which held, \u201cLiability policy provisions which purport to consolidate wrongful death damages suffered by individuals into one \u2018each person\u2019 policy limit are unenforceable.\u201d Id., paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">{\u00b6 14} In regard to the excess policy, the trial court held, \u201c[I]f any \u2018covered\u2019 claim under the primary policy exceeds $200,000, that claimant is entitled to an additional \u2018covered\u2019 claim under the excess policy up to $300,000 with a total aggregate amount of coverage available to plaintiffs under the excess policy of $1,000,000.00.\u201d In so holding, the court rejected OIGA\u2019s argument that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>liable to pay only a single statutory maximum of $300,000, notwithstanding the existence of both a primary policy and an excess policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">{\u00b6 15} The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">{\u00b6 16} We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals in part. We today limit the holding of the first paragraph of the syllabus of <em>Savoie </em>to cases presenting similar facts, i.e., cases involving claims against automobile insurance policies that contain \u201ceach person\u201d limits. Accordingly, a medical doctor and a professional liability insurer may agree that the insurer\u2019s liability for all damages sustained from the death of one person is subject to the monetary limit declared for \u201ceach claim,\u201d irrespective of the number of wrongful-death claimants. Paragraph one of the <em>Savoie </em>syllabus does not apply to claims made against professional-liability insurance policies, whether those claims arose before or after October 20,1994, the effective date of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 20.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">OIGA Coverage Limits Under the P.I.E. Primary Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. Chapter 3955 exists, in part, \u201cto provide a mechanism for the payment of covered claims under certain insurance policies [and to] avoid excessive delay in payment and reduce financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer.\u201d R.C. 3955.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">{\u00b6 18} R.C. 3955.08(A)(1) provides that OIGA shall be obligated to the extent of \u201ccovered claims\u201d existing within certain time limits relative to a determination that an insurer has become insolvent. However, \u201c[i]n no event shall the association be obligated to a policyholder or claimant in an amount in excess of the face amount of the policy from which the claim arises.\u201d Id. Moreover, OIGA is statutorily \u201cdeemed the insurer to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and to such extent shall have all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent.\u201d R.C. 3955.08(A)(2). Accordingly, under no circumstances is OIGA liable in an amount exceeding the amount for which P.I.E. itself would have been contractually liable. We are thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>required to interpret the PJ.E. policy to determine the application of its limits of liability to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">{\u00b6 19} OIGA argues that Section V(A) of the primary policy is a valid and enforceable contractual provision agreed to by both P.I.E. as insurer and Katz as insured. Katz and Robinson argue that <em>Savoie </em>applies to invalidate this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">{\u00b6 20} The first paragraph of the syllabus in <em>Savoie </em>states: \u201cEach person who is presumed to have been damaged as a result of a wrongful death claim may, to the extent of his or her damages, collect from the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy up to its per person limits subject to any per accident limit. Liability policy provisions which purport to consolidate wrongful death damages suffered by individuals into one \u2018each person\u2019 policy limit are unenforceable.\u201d <em>Savoie, </em>67 Ohio St.3d 500, 620 N.E.2d 809, paragraph one of the syllabus. OIGA argues that this proposition of law does not apply to medical-malpractice liability policies. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">{\u00b6 21} The facts of <em>Savoie </em>involved claims made pursuant to automobile liability policies. The first sentence of the majority opinion specifies that the case \u201craise[d] three questions of <em>automobile </em>insurance law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 503, 620 N.E.2d 809. Each of the three remaining syllabus paragraphs of the <em>Savoie </em>decision specifically refers to uninsured/underinsured insurance, which exists exclusively in automobile liability policies. Every case cited in the syllabus of <em>Savoie </em>as being overruled, applied, followed, or limited<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> involved interpretation of an automobile insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">{\u00b6 22} Moreover, the first paragraph of the <em>Savoie </em>syllabus, upon which the appellees rely in contending that the consolidation clause in the P.I.E. policy is unenforceable, overrules <em>State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Rose </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 528, 575 N.E.2d 459, and paragraphs one and two of the syllabus of <em>Burris v. Grange Mut. Cos. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 84, 545 N.E.2d 83. Both <em>Rose </em>and the identified paragraphs in <em>Burris </em>establish law relative to <em>automobile </em>liability insurance provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">{\u00b6 23} We acknowledge that a surviving spouse, the children, and the parents of a decedent are \u201crebuttably presumed to have suffered damages\u201d resulting from wrongful death. R.C. 2125.02(A)(1). However, it does not follow that a claim for damages, even though legally viable, is necessarily within the coverage of a liability policy procured by a tortfeasor. See <em>Savoie, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 516, 620 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>N.E.2d 809 (Moyer, C.J., dissenting) (Section 19a, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, providing that wrongful-death damages shall not be limited by law, does not mean that an insurer and an insured may not contract for limited levels of coverage). Even in the context of automobile insurance law, <em>Savoie </em>was an aberration in terms of construing provisions in liability policies, as opposed to uninsured and underinsured insurance provisions. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">{\u00b6 24} In short, we refuse to extend the rationale of the first paragraph of <em>Savoie </em>beyond the context of automobile insurance cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">{\u00b6 25} In the case at bar, Katz purchased a primary policy with a limit of \u201c$200,000 each claim\u201d from P.I.E. OIGA contends that Section V(A) of that policy was clearly included to cover circumstances in which one act of malpractice may result in multiple damage claims, such as may occur in a wrongful-death action. Both Katz and Robinson have consistently argued that issues of interpretation of Section V(A) are irrelevant, in that the provision is nevertheless moot pursuant to <em>Savoie. </em>Our decision today that <em>Savoie </em>does not invalidate Section V(A) revives the relevance of the issue in view of our established precedent that ambiguous insurance provisions are construed in favor of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">{\u00b6 26} In the case at bar, the Sixth District Court of Appeals determined that Section V(A) was a limits-of-liability provision. We agree insofar as the clause provides a monetary limit on P.I.E.\u2019s obligation under the policy. We do not, however, believe that Section V(A) is a <em>consolidation </em>clause for purposes of counting how many \u201cclaims\u201d exist under the policy. There simply is no language in the clause indicating that all claims recognized as lawful under the wrongful-death statute are consolidated into \u201cone claim\u201d under the policy. Section V(A) instead imposes a valid and enforceable $200,000 <em>limit of liability </em>on <em>all </em>claims resulting from the death of a single person, irrespective of the number of people recognized under law as having a wrongful-death claim. It provides that the $200,000 limit applicable to \u201ceach claim,\u201d as set forth in the declarations, caps P.I.E.\u2019s exposure \u201cfor <em>all damages </em>because of * * * <em>all claims </em>* * * because of * * * death of any one person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In short, there remain at least four claims under the P.I.E. policy. Each of those claims is a \u201ccovered claim\u201d as defined in R.C. 3955.01(D)(1). But had P.I.E. remained solvent, it would have been liable up to only a total maximum of $200,000 for all of those claims pursuant to Section V(A). OIGA, per statute, is not obligated to pay more than that maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">OIGA Coverage Limits Under the P.I.E. Excess Policy</p>\n<p id=\"A84\">{\u00b6 27} R.C. 3955.01 defines \u201ccovered claim\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>{\u00b6 28} \u201c(D)(1) \u2018Covered claim\u2019 means an unpaid claim * * * which arises out of and is within the coverage of an insurance policy to which sections 3955.01 to 3955.19 of the Revised Code apply * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(2) \u2018Covered claim\u2019 does not include any amount:</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(b) In excess of three hundred thousand dollars on any claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">{\u00b6 32} OIGA argues that it is irrelevant that Katz had procured two separate policies \u2014 one primary and one excess \u2014 in determining the statutory maximum of its indemnification liability. It argues that Katz \u201cpurchased medical malpractice liability insurance coverage that had been divided by the carrier between a primary insurance policy and an excess insurance policy.\u201d It further argues that the \u201cfact that the insurance coverage is provided through two integrated policies, rather than through a single policy, was of absolutely no significance\u201d and that it is liable up to only one $300,000 statutory limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">{\u00b6 33} OIGA correctly asserts that the fact that there are two separate policies here does not affect the number of claims. It does, however, affect the amount of P.I.E.\u2019s exposure under the two policies and thus also the extent to which OIGA\u2019s statutory maximum liability will be invoked. Contrary to OIGA\u2019s contention, however, the two policies cover not one claim, but four claims, as set forth in Section I of this opinion. Hence OIGA\u2019s maximum <em>statutory </em>exposure is $1.2 million, i.e., the statutory maximum of $300,000 per covered claim multiplied by four claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">{\u00b6 34} Robinson presented four covered claims in her action against Katz: three wrongful-death claims and a survival claim. As discussed previously, Section V(A) of the P.I.E. primary policy limits maximum recovery for all claims to $200,000 under that policy; contrary to OIGA\u2019s contentions, the policy did not consolidate the claims to one claim. Because OIGA steps into P.I.E.\u2019s shoes, it, too, has a $200,000 exposure under the primary policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">{\u00b6 35} Katz purchased an excess policy with a $1 million limit of liability per claim in addition to his primary policy. Had P.I.E. remained solvent, it would have been liable for excess coverage up to a limit of $1 million under the excess policy. We have recognized that OIGA \u201csteps into the shoes of that insurer\u201d when an insurer becomes insolvent, and it assumes all of the carrier\u2019s obligations except as otherwise provided in the Act. <em>Lake Hosp. Sys., Inc. v. Ohio Ins. Guar. Assn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 521, 523, 634 N.E.2d 611. The four claims Robinson made against Katz are subject not only to the coverage provided under the primary policy, but also to the additional coverage provided under the excess policy. To the extent that the claims arising from Katz\u2019s alleged malpractice exhaust the $200,000 coverage under the P.I.E. primary policy, those claims are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>afforded additional coverage of up to $1 million under the excess policy. Because OIGA steps into the shoes of P.I.E., its exposure <em>under the P.I.E. excess policy </em>is $1 million. OIGA\u2019s maximum exposure <em>under the two policies </em>is thus $1.2 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">{\u00b6 36} Pursuant to R.C. 3955.01(D)(2)(b), however, OIGA\u2019s exposure is limited to $300,000 per covered claim. Because four covered claims are presented in this action, OIGA\u2019s statutory exposure is $1.2 million. That this exposure is coextensive with P.I.E.\u2019s exposure, had P.I.E. remained solvent, under the primary and excess policies combined is a mathematical coincidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">{\u00b6 37} Section V(A) of the P.I.E. policy is not a consolidation clause, as it does not purport to consolidate <em>all </em>wrongful-death <em>claims </em>arising from the death of a single person \u2014 here, Teri Sue Robinson \u2014 into <em>one claim </em>for purposes of applying the policy limits. It does, however, provide a limitation of P.I.E.\u2019s total exposure for all claims under the primary policy. Accordingly, pursuant to R.C. 3955.08(A)(1), OIGA\u2019s maximum exposure under the primary policy as to claims made in connection with the death of Teri Sue Robinson is $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">{\u00b6 38} The P.I.E. excess policy provided coverage with a $1 million per claim limit, with an aggregate limit for all claims of $1 million. When the $200,000 available under the primary policy is combined with the $1,000,000 maximum exposure under the excess policy, the total liability under both P.I.E. policies is $1,200,000. Pursuant to R.C. 3955.01(2)(b), however, OIGA is not liable to pay any individual claimant an amount in excess of $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b127-10\">Bryant, F.E.

Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 500, 620 N.E.2d 809, is not about automobile insurance policies; it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>is about whether parties may contract away the statutory and constitutional underpinnings of wrongful-death claims in Ohio. This court wrote in <em>Savoie </em>that \u201c[liability policy provisions which purport to consolidate wrongful death damages suffered by individuals are unenforceable because they directly violate the policy expressed by the General Assembly and this court.\u201d <em>Savoie, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 504, 620 N.E.2d 809. Whether the decedent died in an automobile or on the operating table is immaterial. The only relevant thing is that the decedent left behind survivors that are all rebuttably presumed pursuant to R.C. 2125.02 to have suffered damages resulting from the wrongful death. The claims of <em>each </em>person are recognized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">{\u00b6 40} Here, as in <em>Savoie, </em>the consolidation of wrongful-death damages suffered by different individuals is unlawful.

Thus, the total amount of coverage available to the plaintiffs in this case and payable by OIGA should be $1.6 million.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b128-7\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ad\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">{\u00b6 42} I concur in the syllabus paragraph; however, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s analysis of the P.I.E. insurance contracts and its conclusion as to OIGA\u2019s statutory exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">{\u00b6 43} Plaintiffs asserted four claims against Dr. Katz, all derived from a single act of malpractice. For purposes of insurance coverage under the P.I.E. primary policy, however, the express language of the policy limits the company\u2019s liability \u201cfor all damages because of any one claim or suit or all claims or suits first made during the policy period because of injury to or death of any one person\u201d to the limit for \u201ceach claim.\u201d I agree with Justice O\u2019Connor that this is a clear and unambiguous consolidation clause. Therefore, under the primary policy, P.I.E. would have been liable up to the single-claim limit of $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">{\u00b6 44} P.I.E.\u2019s insolvency triggered OIGA\u2019s obligation as \u201cinsurer to the extent of [the insurer\u2019s] obligation on the covered claims.\u201d R.C. 3955.08(A)(2). A \u201ccovered claim\u201d is defined as a claim <em>\u201cwhich arises out of and is within the coverage of an insurance policy </em>* * * issued by an insurer which becomes * * * insolvent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 3955.01(D)(1). It is limited by the language of the policy and the statutory cap of $300,000. R.C. 3955.01(D)(2)(b). In other words, OIGA steps into the shoes of P.I.E. <em>up to a maximum of $300,000.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>{\u00b6 45} Nevertheless, the majority obligates OIGA to pay up to $1.2 million for one medical malpractice action against Dr. Katz under the guise of four \u201ccovered claims\u201d reaching Katz\u2019s excess liability policy. I do not agree that OIGA\u2019s payment of $200,000 constitutes exhaustion of the primary policy for purposes of reaching Katz\u2019s excess liability insurance policy. However, even if an OIGA payment of $200,000 satisfied the exhaustion requirement in the primary policy in order to access coverage under the excess policy, I believe that OIGA is obligated to pay only an additional $100,000 because its liability is capped by statute at $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">{\u00b6 46} Katz\u2019s excess liability policy provides a level of coverage above that of the primary policy. The excess policy does not become an issue until the limits of the underlying primary policy are exhausted. Had P.I.E. remained solvent, the excess policy would have provided an additional $1 million of liability coverage upon exhaustion of the primary coverage. However, the excess policy applies \u201conly if the underlying coverage is applicable and the claim is first made in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Underlying Insurance.\u201d Except in limited instances, the excess policy incorporates provisions of the underlying insurance, including the primary policy\u2019s consolidation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">{\u00b6 47} The purpose of the OIGA is to prevent catastrophic loss by compensating claimants when an insurance company becomes insolvent. <em>PIE Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ohio Ins. Guar. Assn. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 209, 212, 611 N.E.2d 313. Although OIGA assumes the place of the insolvent insurer, it is <em>not </em>replacement insurance. I believe that the majority\u2019s interpretation has the potential to deplete OIGA funds by exposing OIGA to expansive, unanticipated liability that may jeopardize OIGA\u2019s financial stability and the viability of its funds for other qualified claimants. It will erode the system put in place by the General Assembly to protect policyholders and claimants who are affected by insolvent insurance companies. This decision will also potentially affect all Ohio insurance consumers as the cost of these multiple claims is ultimately passed on to them through increased premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">{\u00b6 48} The General Assembly intended OIGA to pay what the insolvent insurer would have been obligated to pay, <em>subject to a statutory maximum limit of $300,000 per claim. </em>Today\u2019s majority ignores that limit in favor of expansive liability that obligates OIGA to the maximum insurance coverage that was available under the P.I.E. policies. I do not agree with this interpretation. Therefore, to the extent that the majority recognizes more than one \u201ccovered claim,\u201d I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>O\u2019Connor, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3H\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">{\u00b6 49} I concur with the syllabus announced by the majority that <em>Savoie v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 500, 620 N.E.2d 809, is an aberration that should be limited to cases with similar facts. This aberration was spawned by earlier uninsured-underinsured motorist law, which the legislature revised by means of 1994 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 20, 145 Ohio Laws, Part I, 204, 210-212, and' subsequent acts into the current R.C. 3937.18. The current statute provides limited guidance for ascertaining OIGA\u2019s liability under R.C. Chapter 3955 for a medical malpractice insurance policy issued by a now insolvent insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">{\u00b6 50} I dissent because the survivorship and wrongful-death claims, which the majority effectively consolidates into one claim under the primary policy, should also be consolidated into one claim under the excess policy. Moreover, a single claim submitted to OIGA under an excess or umbrella policy may recover $300,000 more than what is available from the primary policy. I would award the plaintiffs $200,000 under the primary policy and $300,000 under the excess policy for a total of $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">{\u00b6 51} My disagreement with the majority begins with its treatment of the primary policy\u2019s \u201cLimits of Liability\u201d section. The majority correctly states that this section subjects the plaintiffs\u2019 four claims to a single $200,000 limit under the primary policy, which has a $200,000 per-claim limit and an aggregate limit of $600,000. The majority, however, states that the limits-of-liability section does not consolidate the claims. The majority inconsistently holds both that there are four unconsolidated claims and that the four unconsolidated claims are collectively restricted to the one $200,000 per-claim limit of the primary policy. Subjecting multiple claims to a single limit is the very definition of claims consolidation. The declarations page of the primary policy states that the policy will pay up to \u201c$200,000 [for] each claim.\u201d The limits-of-liability section defines \u201ceach claim\u201d as \u201call claims or suits * * * because of injury to or death of any one person.\u201d An analogous statute, R.C. 3937.18(G), provides that automobile liability insurance policies \u201cmay * * * include terms and conditions to the effect that all claims resulting from or arising out of any one person\u2019s bodily injury, including death, shall collectively be subject to the limit of the policy applicable to bodily injury, including death, sustained by one person, and, for the purpose of such policy limit shall constitute a single claim.\u201d This form of consolidation is exactly what the P.I.E. primary policy accomplished. Therefore, the limits-of-liability section of the policy, Section V(A), is a clear and unambiguous consolidation clause. See <em>Clark v. Scarpelli </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 271, 282, 744 N.E.2d 719, and <em>Saunders v. Mortensen, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 86, 2004-Ohio-24, 801 N.E.2d 452, \u00b6 16-17. The policy even refers to the collective claims with the singular \u201ceach claim.\u201d Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the plaintiffs are jointly entitled to no more than $200,000 under the primary policy.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b131-9\">Spengler Nathanson P.L.L., James R. Jeffery and Teresa L. Grigsby, for appellee Gordon L. Katz, D.O.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AVG\">Vorys, Sater, Seymour &amp; Pease, L.L.P., F.

Greenberger, urging affirmance for amicus curiae William Witt, M.D.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">{\u00b6 52} Second, I find that under R.C. Chapter 3955, a claim under an excess policy is a \u201ccovered claim\u201d separate from a claim made under the primary policy and accordingly subject to an independent $300,000 limit. R.C. 3955.01(D)(1) defines \u201c[cjovered claim\u201d as an unpaid claim \u201cwhich arises out of and is within the coverage of <em>an insurance policy\u201d </em>to which Chapter 3955 applies. (Emphasis added.) This definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d restricts the term to a claim made under a single insurance policy. An excess insurance policy is physically and legally separate from a primary policy. Identical claims submitted under each policy constitute two \u201ccovered claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">{\u00b6 53} Here, the coverage in the excess policy is provided \u201cin accordance with the applicable provisions of the Underlying Insurance.\u201d Because I believe that the limits-of-liability section of the primary policy consolidated the plaintiffs\u2019 claims,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it follows that plaintiffs are jointly entitled to no more than $300,000 under the excess policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">{\u00b6 54} I would allow $200,000 (per-claim policy limit) under the primary policy and $300,000 (\u201ccovered claim\u201d statutory limit) under the excess policy for a total possible award of $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">{\u00b6 55} This award would be consistent with the stated purpose of R.C. Chapter 3955, which is to \u201creduce,\u201d but not necessarily eliminate, \u201cfinancial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer.\u201d R.C. 3955.03. Contrary to the majority\u2019s interpretation, the chapter is not intended to fully guarantee each covered insurance policy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b131-14\">. The majority does not satisfactorily explain why it treats the plaintiffs\u2019 claims collectively under the primary policy but separately under the excess policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
