Later that night, defendant-appellant, Nawaz Ahmed, was detained before he could depart for Pakistan on a flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport (\u201cJFK\u201d) in New York. Appellant was indicted for the aggravated murders of his estranged wife, Lubaina, her father, Abdul, and her sister and niece, Ruhie and Nasira. Appellant was found guilty and sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">I. Facts and Case History</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">{\u00b6 2} In October 1998, Lubaina hired an attorney to end her marriage with appellant and to secure custody of their two children, Tariq and Ahsan. According to Lubaina\u2019s divorce attorney, appellant did not want a divorce, and consequently, it was a hostile divorce proceeding. In early February 1999, shortly after the complaint for divorce had been filed, Lubaina was awarded temporary custody of the children and exclusive use of the marital residence. Later that month, the divorce court issued a restraining order to prevent appellant from coming near Lubaina or making harassing phone calls to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant had accused Lubaina, a physician, of having an affair with another physician, and claimed that their oldest son, Tariq, was not his. A subsequent paternity test showed that claim to be false. According to Lubaina\u2019s divorce attorney, Grace Hoffman, Lubaina had been afraid of appellant, and she had called Hoffman three or four times a week, \u201cscared [and] frustrated * * *. It just kept escalating.\u201d Lubaina had also confided to Hoffman that appellant had forced her to have sex with him during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">{\u00b6 4} Tahira Khan, one of Lubaina\u2019s sisters, corroborated that Lubaina had feared appellant. She also testified that Lubaina had told her that appellant had raped her repeatedly.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The owner of the rental home where Lubaina resided testified that Lubaina had called him in February 1999 and asked him to change the locks on the house. He stated that Lubaina had been very upset and had asked that he change them within the hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">{\u00b6 6} In March 1999, Lubaina complained to police that appellant was harassing her by telephone, but after the officer explained that the matter could be handled through criminal or civil proceedings, she decided to handle it through the ongoing divorce proceedings. The final divorce hearing was scheduled for Monday, September 13, 1999, and Lubaina had arranged for her sister Ruhie to fly in from California the Friday before to testify at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">{\u00b6 7} On Friday, September 10, 1999, appellant called Lubaina\u2019s office several times. But Lubaina had instructed the medical assistants at her office to reject any phone calls from him. Then, at approximately 4:00 p.m. that day, Lubaina took appellant\u2019s call. Appellant, who worked and lived in Columbus, wanted Lubaina to bring the children to him for the weekend two hours earlier than planned. Appellant claimed that he was planning a surprise birthday party for their youngest son. Lubaina, however, refused to change her plans and told appellant that he was using the birthday party as an excuse to inconvenience her.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b6 8} Rafi Ahmed, husband of Ruhie and father of two-year-old Nasira, testified that Ruhie and Nasira had been scheduled to arrive in Columbus from California at 10:34 p.m. on Friday, September 10. Ruhie had planned to call Rafi that night when she arrived at Lubaina\u2019s home near St. Clairsville. However, since he had not heard from Ruhie, Rafi began calling Lubaina\u2019s home at 1:21 a.m., Saturday, September 11. Rafi called 20 to 25 times, but he got only Lubaina\u2019s answering machine. At approximately 3:00 a.m., he called the Belmont County Sheriffs Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">{\u00b6 9} A parking receipt found in Lubaina\u2019s van indicated that the van had entered a Columbus airport parking lot at 9:30 p.m. and exited at 11:14 p.m. on September 10,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">{\u00b6 10} Around 3:45 a.m. on September 11, in response to Rafi Ahmed\u2019s call, a sheriffs detective went to Lubaina\u2019s home and knocked on the doors and rang the doorbell. She got no answer. The detective also looked in the windows, but nothing at the home appeared to be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">{\u00b6 11} Later that day, Belmont County Sheriffs Department Detective Steve Forro was assigned to investigate the missing persons. He recognized Lubaina\u2019s name because he was the officer who had talked to her regarding appellant\u2019s harassing phone calls. Forro called appellant\u2019s home to see if he had any information. Appellant did not answer, so Forro called Columbus police to have them check appellant\u2019s apartment. They did and found that he was not home.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Forro went to Lubaina\u2019s home at 2:18 p.m. As he walked around the outside of the house, he noticed a flicker of a car taillight through a garage window. Using a flashlight, he looked through the window and saw a van with its hatch open and luggage inside. He then saw the body of a man on the floor covered with blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">{\u00b6 13} Forro called for backup. Deputy Dan Showalter responded and entered through a side door, which he had found unlocked. He searched the house and found three more bodies on the basement floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">{\u00b6 14} Detective Bart Giesey found appellant\u2019s MCI WorldCom employee badge on the basement floor near the bodies. Records from appellant\u2019s employer, MCI WorldCom in Hilliard, Ohio, revealed that appellant\u2019s badge was last used at 7:19 p.m. on September 10,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">{\u00b6 15} Through several inquiries, police learned that appellant was scheduled to depart from JFK for Lahore, Pakistan, that evening. Earlier that day, appellant, through a travel agent, had booked a flight leaving for Pakistan that same evening. Appellant had made arrangements to pick up the airline ticket at the travel agent\u2019s home near JFK. Appellant arrived at the agent\u2019s home with both of his sons and asked if he could leave them with the agent, saying that his wife would pick them up soon. Appellant wrote on the back of his and Lubaina\u2019s marriage certificate, which he gave to the agent, that he was leaving his sons to be handed over to his wife. Appellant also signed his car over to the agent. The agent then drove appellant to JFK to catch his flight to Pakistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">{\u00b6 16} At 8:10 p.m., Robert Nanni, a police officer stationed at JFK, learned that appellant was a murder suspect and that he had checked in for a flight scheduled to leave for Pakistan at 8:55 p.m. Appellant was located and arrested. Nanni noticed a large laceration on appellant\u2019s right thumb. Nanni read appellant his rights and called airport paramedics to attend to appellant\u2019s thumb. Among the items confiscated from appellant was an attach\u00e9 case containing 15 traveler\u2019s checks totaling $7,500, his will, and $6,954.34 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">{\u00b6 17} On October 7, 1999, a grand jury indicted appellant on three counts of aggravated murder for purposely and with prior calculation and design killing Lubaina, Ruhie, and Abdul, pursuant to R.C. 2903.01(A), and one count for the aggravated murder of Nasira, pursuant to R.C. 2903.01(C) (victim younger than 13). All four aggravated murder counts carried a death-penalty specification alleging a course of conduct involving the killing of two or more persons. R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). The aggravated murder count for Nasira carried an additional death-penalty specification alleging that the victim was younger than 13 years at the time of the murder. R.C. 2929.04(A)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">{\u00b6 18} At trial, Dr. Manuel Villaverde, the Belmont County Coroner, testified that he had been called to the crime scene on September 11, 1999. All four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>victims appeared to have died from blood loss from slashes on their necks. Based on the condition of the bodies, he determined that the victims had been killed at approximately 3:00 a.m. that day, with two to four hours\u2019 variation either way.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">{\u00b6 19} A deputy coroner for Franklin County performed autopsies on all four victims and concluded that each victim had died from skull fractures and a large cut on the neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">(\u00b6 20} Diane Larson, a forensic scientist at the DNA-serology section of the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d), concluded that the DNA of blood found in the kitchen of Lubaina\u2019s home matched appellant\u2019s DNA profile. The probability of someone else in the Caucasian population having that same DNA profile is 1 in 7.6 quadrillion, and in the African-American population, the probability is 1 in 65 quadrillion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">{\u00b6 21} After deliberating, the jury found appellant guilty as charged. After the mitigation hearing, the jury recommended death, and the court imposed a death sentence on appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">{\u00b6 22} The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">{\u00b6 23} Appellant has raised 19 propositions of law. We have reviewed each and have determined that none justifies reversal of appellant\u2019s convictions for aggravated murder. Pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A), we have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating evidence. We find that the aggravating circumstance (circumstances, in the case of Nasira) in each murder count outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we affirm appellant\u2019s sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">II. Pretrial/Voir Dire Issues</p>\n<p id=\"A3k\">A. Failure to Remove Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">{\u00b6 24} In his second proposition of law, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in failing to remove defense counsel, since a conflict of interest occurred when he filed a lawsuit against counsel in federal court. Alternatively, appellant contends that there was a total breakdown of the attorney-client relationship that required counsel\u2019s removal. Appellant submits that the trial court\u2019s inquiry into the difficulties between him and counsel was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">{\u00b6 25} Appellant complained about his counsel on numerous occasions. Appellant was first represented by appointed public defenders at his arraignment. Appellant claimed that counsel had not met with him or answered his questions, but counsel disputed appellant\u2019s allegations. Due to conflicts with appellant, both attorneys later withdrew, and by June 2000, the trial court had appointed attorneys Peter Olivito and Adrian Hershey to represent appellant. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>appellant sought to hire attorneys of his own choosing, he was never able to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">{\u00b6 26} Soon after Olivito and Hershey were appointed, appellant began complaining that their representation was ineffective. At a September 6, 2000 hearing, appellant claimed that counsel had neither met nor consulted with him prior to seeking a continuance. At a November 9, 2000 hearing, appellant complained that Hershey had laughed at and humiliated him in front of a detective, had made racial slurs, and had been hostile toward him. Hershey disputed appellant\u2019s complaints, and the court advised appellant to let his counsel help him.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">{\u00b6 27} At a January 2, 2001 hearing, appellant told the court that he had hired attorney Joseph Carpino to represent him and that he had filed a civil rights lawsuit against Olivito and Hershey in federal court and wanted to discharge them.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">{\u00b6 28} On January 8, 2001, the trial court held a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to discharge counsel. Appellant indicated again that he was suing counsel in federal court. He also claimed that he had given his attorneys a list of witnesses, but that in 16 months, neither his first attorneys nor his new attorneys had contacted them and that his new attorneys had \u201crefused to contact them.\u201d Olivito explained that many of the witnesses that appellant had named were in Pakistan and that appellant had not provided phone numbers to contact them. Both attorneys told the trial court of their efforts to obtain witnesses and comply with requests by appellant. The trial court concluded that counsel was representing appellant diligently and therefore overruled appellant\u2019s motion to discharge them.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">{\u00b6 29} Also at the January 8, 2001 hearing, the court found that Carpino could not serve as appellant\u2019s counsel because he was not certified to act as counsel in capital cases. The court overruled Carpino\u2019s motion to become appellant\u2019s trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">{\u00b6 30} Appellant reiterated his dissatisfaction with counsel at a January 11, 2001 suppression hearing. He also complained about counsel at the outset of voir dire, as well as at the mitigation and sentencing hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">{\u00b6 31} Appellant relies on <em>Smith v. Lockhart </em>(C.A.8, 1991), 923 F.2d 1314, 1321, citing <em>Douglas v. United States </em>(D.C.App.1985), 488 A.2d 121, 136, in claiming that his federal lawsuit against appointed counsel reflected a conflict between his interests and counsel\u2019s. Appellant contends that once he raised the issue of a conflict of interest, the trial court was required to allow him to demonstrate that the conflict \u201cimpermissibly imperiled] his right to a fair trial.\u201d See <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>{\u00b6 32} There are strong indications that appellant filed his federal lawsuit simply to get his court-appointed attorneys discharged. Prior to trial, the trial court held hearings regarding appellant\u2019s complaints about counsel on November 9, 2000, and January 8, 2001. Upon considering the statements of appellant and counsel, the trial court found no reason to replace counsel. At the conclusion of the November 9 hearing, the trial court urged appellant to let his counsel help him. At the conclusion of the January 8 hearing, the court stated: \u201cThe court is comfortable that counsel has represented Mr. Ahmed * * * diligently; that the difficulties which have arisen in this case stem from what Mr. Ahmed himself pinpointed when he said that he does not understand. And the allegations do not have firm footing in law or in fact. The motion to discharge is overruled.\u201d Nor did the trial court find any conflict of interest that adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance. See <em>Mickens v. Taylor </em>(2002), 535 U.S. 162, 171-172, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 152 L.Ed.2d 291. Under these circumstances, we will defer to the trial judge, \u201cwho see[s] and hear[s] what goes on in the courtroom.\u201d <em>State v. Cowans </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717 N.E.2d 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">{\u00b6 33} We further note that courts \u201cmust be wary of defendants who employ complaints about counsel as dilatory tactics or for another invidious motive.\u201d <em>Smith v. Lockhart, </em>923 F.2d at 1321, fn. 11, citing <em>United States v. Welty </em>(C.A.3, 1982), 674 F.2d 185, 193-194.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">{\u00b6 34} Appellant continually complained about counsel. The trial court took appellant\u2019s complaints seriously and listened to all sides before it determined that his complaints were not valid and that counsel should remain as appellant\u2019s attorneys. The federal lawsuit appears to have been filed in an attempt to create a conflict so that his counsel would be removed from the case, not a genuine grievance causing a true conflict of interest. Moreover, after the trial court conducted thorough inquiries into the difficulties between appellant and counsel, it found that appellant\u2019s complaints against counsel were not substantiated. Nothing offered by appellant compels us to disturb that ruling. See <em>State v. Deal </em>(1969), 17 Ohio St.2d 17, 46 O.O.2d 154, 244 N.E.2d 742, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">{\u00b6 35} Appellant argues alternatively that even if there was no conflict of interest, there was at least a total breakdown in the attorney-client relationship that necessitated counsel\u2019s removal. The trial court, however, addressed appellant\u2019s complaints concerning counsel\u2019s representation of him at two hearings as stated above. Upon considering appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial and his complaints about counsel and claims of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness throughout trial, the trial court held that \u201c[h]ours of testimony [concerning appellant\u2019s disagreements with counsel] established that the grounds alleged were not cogent or reliable.\u201d In addition, the record reflects many instances where appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>continued to confer with counsel throughout the proceedings, thus belying his claim that there was a total breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">{\u00b6 36} Since appellant did not substantiate his claims of a conflict of interest and of a total breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, we overrule his second proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">B. Change of Venue</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">{\u00b6 37} In his ninth proposition of law, appellant claims that pervasive, prejudicial pretrial publicity about this case saturated Belmont County and thus required a change of venue. Appellant moved for a change of venue and, in a hearing on that motion, offered 14 articles about the crimes from local newspapers. The trial court, however, overruled the motion after the jury had been impaneled.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">{\u00b6 38} The trial court has discretion to grant or deny a motion for a change of venue; its ruling will not be disturbed on appeal unless the court abused its discretion. See, e.g., <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 479, 653 N.E.2d 304. We have long held that voir dire examination provides the best test as to whether prejudice exists in the community against the defendant precluding a fair trial in the jurisdiction. <em>State v. Swiger </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St.2d 151, 34 O.O.2d 270, 214 N.E.2d 417, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 117, 559 N.E.2d 710. \u201cA defendant claiming that pretrial publicity has denied him a fair trial must show that one or more jurors were actually biased.\u201d <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 464, 739 N.E.2d 749; accord <em>Mayola v. Alabama </em>(C.A.5, 1980), 623 F.2d 992, 996. Even pervasive adverse pretrial publicity does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial. <em>Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart </em>(1976), 427 U.S. 539, 554, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">{\u00b6 39} Undoubtedly, there was extensive pretrial publicity about the murders in the local media. However, the trial court conducted an extensive, individual, sequestered voir dire of prospective jurors, which helped insulate against any negative effect of the pretrial publicity. <em>Lundgren, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 479-480, 653 N.E.2d 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">{\u00b640} The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s request for a change in venue. Similar to the situations in <em>Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 464, 739 N.E.2d 749, and <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 28-30, appellant failed to demonstrate that \u201cthe publicity in this case was so pervasive that it impaired the ability of the empaneled jurors to deliberate fairly and impartially.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">{\u00b6 41} Moreover, as in <em>Treesh, </em>each empaneled juror confirmed during voir dire that he or she had not formed an opinion about the guilt or innocence of the accused, could put aside any information previously heard about the case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>could render a fair and impartial verdict based on the law and evidence. Thus, appellant has not shown that any biased juror sat on the jury or that the trial court abused its discretion. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s ninth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">C. Failure to Grant a Continuance</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 42} In his tenth proposition of law appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant him a continuance at the outset of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">{\u00b6 43} On the day before voir dire began, appellant provided defense counsel a list of approximately 60 potential witnesses that he wanted contacted and interviewed to aid in his defense. The list of names provided no addresses or phone numbers, but only a general description of the area where the potential witnesses might be located, i.e., Pakistan, Washington D.C., Pittsburgh, New York. Defense counsel requested a continuance in order to find and interview these potential witnesses. The state objected, and the trial court denied the continuance, stating: \u201cI believe that if we were to work with this list, we might never have a trial. And so balancing the need to have an efficient administration of justice and the tardy presentation of the list, the court overrules the motion for a continuance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">{\u00b6 44} We have recognized that \u201c \u2018[t]he grant or denial of a continuance is a matter [that] is entrusted to the broad, sound discretion of the trial judge. An appellate court must not. reverse the denial of a continuance unless there has been an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 342, 744 N.E.2d 1163, quoting <em>State v. Unger </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 65, 67, 21 O.O.3d 41, 423 N.E.2d 1078. In evaluating a motion for a continuance, \u201c[s]everal factors can be considered: the length of delay requested, prior continuances, inconvenience, the reasons for the delay, whether the defendant contributed to the delay, and other relevant factors.\u201d <em>State v. Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 115, 559 N.E.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">{\u00b6 45} Appellant asserts that the denial of the continuance resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the trial court\u2019s denial of a continuance did not result in ineffective assistance or reflect an abuse of discretion. The motion was made at the beginning of voir dire, and the list of names of potential witnesses was just that, a list of names. No phone numbers or addresses were provided, only general locations. Moreover, defense counsel Olivito noted when requesting the continuance that when he and Hershey were appointed, more than six months earlier, \u201cwe began making inquiry of the defendant as to witnesses that could assist us in either phase of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">{\u00b6 46} At a January 8, 2001 hearing, approximately one week before voir dire began, appellant claimed that he had given names of potential witnesses to counsel but that counsel had never contacted them. Olivito responded that the list that appellant had given him did not include telephone numbers and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>largely made up of people in Pakistan who did not speak English. Appellant then asserted that no one had contacted other potential witnesses who live in the United States and Canada and that \u201cmost of that information is available with the sheriffs office, because they confiscated all my phone books * * But nothing in the record, beyond appellant\u2019s assertions, indicates that appellant had previously relayed that information to counsel. Furthermore, defense counsel noted that none of the witnesses that appellant had named lived in Belmont County.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">{\u00b6 47} Hershey stated that he had contacted appellant\u2019s brother in Toronto, Canada, but he had been uncooperative and had hung up on him. Moreover, appellant\u2019s own failure to communicate specific information about potential witnesses to his attorneys contributed to the last-minute request for a continuance at the outset of voir dire. Appellant could have easily told counsel earlier that contact information for potential witnesses was in his address books that were in the custody of the sheriffs office.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">{\u00b6 48} Also militating against the requested continuance was the fact that no time period was specified as to the proposed length of the continuance. In addition, the list of potential witnesses contained people who lived in Pakistan, whose testimony could be secured only with difficulty, which suggests that the delay would be significant. Nor did appellant proffer any summary of what the testimony of these witnesses would have been, and thus there is no basis for us to judge the importance of obtaining the continuance. By failing to proffer a description of the testimony, appellant has not preserved the issue. See, e.g., <em>State v. Davie </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 311, 327, 686 N.E.2d 245; <em>State v. Twyford </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 340, 353, 763 N.E.2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">{\u00b6 49} The inconvenience that would have resulted if a continuance had been granted also supports the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s requested continuance. The venire had been summoned, and an open-ended continuance could have delayed the beginning of trial in the hope that some witnesses could be located, to the inconvenience of all involved with the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">{\u00b6 50} Since the trial court\u2019s denial of the requested continuance did not amount to an abuse of discretion, we reject appellant\u2019s tenth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">D. Right to Contact Foreign Consulate</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">{\u00b6 51} In his 17th proposition of law, appellant argues that law enforcement officers\u2019 failure to advise him, a foreign citizen, of his right to contact his country\u2019s consulate pursuant to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (\u201cVCCR\u201d) deprived him of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">{\u00b6 52} Appellant asserts that both New York and Belmont County law enforcement personnel were aware that he was a Pakistani citizen, since they had seized his Pakistani passport. Appellant contends that even though police officers knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>that he was a Pakistani citizen, they failed to inform him of his absolute right to consular access under the VCCR.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">{\u00b6 53} Appellant contends that he is a citizen of both Pakistan and the United States. Under Section 1448, Title 8, U.S.Code, however, the United States does not recognize the \u201cother citizenship\u201d of a person claiming dual citizenship once the person takes the oath to become a United States citizen. See <em>United States v. Shahani-Jahromi </em>(E.D.Va.2003), 286 F.Supp.2d 723, 726, fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">{\u00b6 54} Moreover, as the court noted in <em>United States v. Matheson </em>(D.C.N.Y. 1975), 400 F.Supp. 1241, 1245: \u201c[I]t is a recognized fact of international law that a dual national is never entitled to invoke the protection or assistance of one of the two countries while within the other country. See <em>Nishikawa v. [Dulles], </em>356 U.S. 129, 132, 78 S.Ct. 612, 2 L.Ed.2d 659 (1958); <em>Kawakita v. United States, </em>343 U.S. 717, 733, 72 S.Ct. 950, 96 L.Ed. 1249 (1952).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">{\u00b6 55} Additionally, we have decided that whatever individual rights the treaty may confer are waivable. <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 54-56, 752 N.E.2d 904. As in <em>Issa, </em>appellant failed to raise this issue before the trial court and has therefore waived all but plain error. Plain error is absent, since it cannot be said that but for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise. <em>State v. Moreland </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 62, 552 N.E.2d 894. Appellant\u2019s 17th proposition is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">III. Trial Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AIj\">A. Competency Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">{\u00b6 56} In his first proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to order a competency evaluation. Appellant submits that there were sufficient indicia of incompetency before and during trial to compel the trial court to order a competency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">{\u00b6 57} Near the end of the guilt phase, appellant filed a handwritten motion to have his competency evaluated. He asserted that he was having \u201cextreme pain in the brain and head and * * * frequent blackouts and vertigo attacks.\u201d The court asked the jail\u2019s physician to examine appellant, but appellant refused to be examined by anyone other than his own doctor from Columbus.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">{\u00b6 58} The court then held a hearing, without the jury present, in which appellant and several employees of the Belmont County Jail testified. Appellant claimed that he had vertigo and that his head was hurting, and that he had been suffering from these problems during the 16 months that he had been in jail. But employees at the jail who saw him on a daily basis rebutted his testimony. They testified that appellant had never complained of any medical, mental, or psychological conditions until the day he filed the motion for the competency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>evaluation. The trial court then held that appellant had not established good cause for the court to order a competency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">{\u00b6 59} Appellant argues that the trial court erred and cites a number of instances in which his behavior should have prompted the court to order a competency evaluation. First, appellant notes that the court was aware that no attorney could please him. At five different hearings, appellant complained about counsel and lodged numerous allegations that counsel were not listening to his requests or working on his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">{\u00b6 60} Second, appellant points to his suspicions that jail personnel were spying on him. During the mitigation hearing, Dr. Smalldon stated that appellant believed that jail personnel were monitoring everything he said and wrote.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">{\u00b6 61} Third, appellant claims that the court knew that appellant was seeing conspiracies everywhere. Before the court, he accused his counsel of colluding with the prosecutor. He made accusations, in numerous pro se pleadings, that the trial judge was conspiring to deprive him of his rights. Appellant felt that the jail staff were part of the prosecution and that the jail physician was biased against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">{\u00b6 62} Fourth, appellant cites his failure to understand the proceedings and his inability to respond on point to questions asked him.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">{\u00b6 63} Last, appellant points to Dr. Smalldon\u2019s penalty-phase testimony that appellant has a delusional disorder of the persecutory type.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">{\u00b6 64} R.C. 2945.37 requires a competency hearing if a request is made before trial. But \u201c[i]f the issue is raised after the trial has commenced, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue only for good cause shown or on the court\u2019s own motion.\u201d R.C. 2945.37(B). Thus, \u201cthe decision as to whether to hold a competency hearing once trial has commenced is in the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Rahman </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 156, 23 OBR 315, 492 N.E.2d 401. The right to a hearing \u201crises to the level of a constitutional guarantee where the record contains \u2018sufficient indicia of incompetence,\u2019 such that an' inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competency is necessary to ensure the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Berry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 354, 359, 650 N.E.2d 433, citing <em>Drope v. Missouri </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 162, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103, and <em>Pate v. Robinson </em>(1966), 383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">{\u00b6 65} There was no request before trial to evaluate appellant\u2019s competency. When appellant requested a competency evaluation during trial, the trial court received testimony from him and jail personnel and concluded that he had not established good cause for the court to hold a hearing on the issue. This case is similar to <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 323, 329, 731 N.E.2d 645, wherein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the record did not reflect \u201csufficient indicia of incompetence\u201d to have required the trial court to conduct a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">{\u00b6 66} Although Dr. Smalldon testified that appellant suffers from a severe mental illness, \u201c[t]he term \u2018mental illness\u2019 does not necessarily equate with the definition of legal incompetency.\u201d <em>State v. Berry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d 354, 650 N.E.2d 433, at the syllabus. \u201cA defendant may be emotionally disturbed or even psychotic and still be capable of understanding the charges against him and of assisting his counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Bock </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 108, 110, 28 OBR 207, 502 N.E.2d 1016. In fact, as the trial court noted when it denied appellant\u2019s motion, appellant was able to prepare the motion for a competency evaluation himself using correct legal terms. We also note that the record shows that appellant assisted counsel subsequent to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">{\u00b6 67} Nor did defense counsel enter an insanity plea or suggest that appellant lacked competency, unlike counsel in <em>State v. Were </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 173, 176, 761 N.E.2d 591, who continually raised the issue of defendant\u2019s competency. Counsel had ample time to become familiar with appellant, since they represented him from June 2000 through the February 2001 sentencing. Although appellant repeatedly complained about his counsel \u2014 making allegations that counsel disputed \u2014 counsel never questioned his competency. If counsel had some reason to question appellant\u2019s competency before the filing of appellant\u2019s handwritten motion, counsel surely would have done so. See <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 405, 411, 692 N.E.2d 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">{\u00b6 68} Neither appellant\u2019s behavior at trial nor any testimony presented on his behalf provided \u201cgood cause\u201d to hold a hearing on his competency or \u201csufficient indicia of incompetence.\u201d Moreover, deference on such issues should be granted to those \u201cwho see and hear what goes on in the courtroom.\u201d <em>State v. Cowans, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 84, 717 N.E.2d 298; <em>State v. Smith, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 330, 731 N.E.2d 645. Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s first proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">{\u00b6 69} In his 11th proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in precluding him from offering rebuttal evidence on the issue of whether he had established good cause to hold a competency hearing. However, this argument is also not well taken. Nothing in R.C. 2945.37 required the court to hold a hearing to determine good cause or allow rebuttal testimony. Nor was there any proffer of evidence to demonstrate that appellant had credible rebuttal evidence. In sum, appellant was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow him to rebut the jail staffs testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">B. Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">{\u00b6 70} In his third proposition of law, appellant argues that the admission of hearsay evidence regarding Lubaina\u2019s fear of appellant and the reasons for her fear deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>{\u00b6 71} Grace Hoffman, Lubaina\u2019s divorce attorney, testified that Lubaina had been afraid of appellant. On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited from Hoffman that Lubaina had described appellant as controlling and manipulative and that Lubaina had told her that appellant had been violent during the marriage, including \u201cforced sex\u201d and \u201csome striking.\u201d On redirect, Hoffman again stated that Lubaina had been afraid of appellant during the divorce proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">{\u00b6 72} Tahira Khan, Lubaina\u2019s sister, also testified that Lubaina had been afraid of appellant. The second time this was elicited from Khan, the defense objected and the court essentially advised the prosecutor to limit his questions to adducing testimony that Lubaina had feared appellant and not the reasons behind the fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">{\u00b6 73} Khan also testified that when she had asked Lubaina why, with all the problems in the marriage, she and appellant had had a second child, Lubaina had told her, \u201cHe raped me.\u201d The defense did not object to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">{\u00b6 74} In <em>State v. Apanovitch </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 21-22, 514 N.E.2d 394, this court held that evidence that a victim had a fearful state of mind was admissible as a hearsay exception under Evid.R. 803(3), as a statement of \u201cthen existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition.\u201d However, the reasons or basis behind the victim\u2019s fearful state of mind would not be admissible under this exception. This court has followed the reasoning in <em>Apanoviteh </em>in subsequent cases. See <em>State v. Simko </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 483, 491, 644 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 323, 338, 652 N.E.2d 1000; <em>State v. Awkal </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 324, 331, 667 N.E.2d 960; <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 670, 677-678, 687 N.E.2d 1358. With regard to testimony of fear elicited in this case, the trial court properly allowed the testimony. No testimony was admitted over objection as to the basis of the victim\u2019s fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">{\u00b6 75} With regard to the testimony that appellant had \u201cforced sex\u201d on Lubaina, defense counsel elicited this statement on cross-examination. Any error in admitting this testimony and Khan\u2019s subsequent testimony that appellant had raped Lubaina was invited error, since the defense first elicited the testimony. See <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 102. The defense opened the door to Khan\u2019s remark about rape based on its cross-examination of Hoffman. See <em>State v. Davie, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 322, 686 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">{\u00b6 76} Moreover, since no objection was raised, appellant has waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 604, 605 N.E.2d 916. In view of the strong and compelling evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt, any error was not plain error affecting the outcome of his trial. <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph two of the syllabus. Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s third proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">C. Other-Acts Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">{\u00b6 77} In his fourth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court admitted improper character and other-acts evidence throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">{\u00b6 78} Under Evid.R. 404(B), \u201c[ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove\u201d a defendant\u2019s character as to criminal propensity. \u201cIt may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d The exceptions allowing the evidence \u201cmust be construed against admissibility, and the standard for determining admissibility of such evidence is strict.\u201d <em>State v. Broom </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 533 N.E.2d 682, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">{\u00b6 79} However, \u201c[t]he admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus. Thus, we review the trial court\u2019s decision with an abuse-of-discretion standard. See <em>State v. Finnerty </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 104, 107, 543 N.E.2d 1233; <em>State v. Hymore </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 122, 128, 38 O.O.2d 298, 224 N.E.2d 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">{\u00b6 80} By failing to object at trial to any of the instances he refers to in arguing this proposition, appellant waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Slagle, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 604, 605 N.E.2d 916. Appellant fails to demonstrate plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">{\u00b6 81} Appellant asserts that the court allowed impermissible character evidence when Lubaina\u2019s attorney, Grace Hoffman, was permitted to read portions of appellant\u2019s August 18, 1999 divorce-proceeding deposition during her testimony. Appellant contends that the deposition was irrelevant and that it was introduced to demonstrate that he was long-winded and evasive. But such characteristics do not imply that he had a propensity to commit crime. Moreover, the passages read by Hoffman tended to show that appellant had been suspicious that Lubaina was having an affair and thus related to appellant\u2019s motive:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cThat was surprising to know that my wife didn\u2019t want any present from me but she brought home flowers on Valentine\u2019s Day given by somebody else, which definitely was something strange to me that somebody was giving [a] Valentine gift to my wife at the hospital * *</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">{\u00b6 83} Another deposition passage read by Hoffman concerned appellant\u2019s explanation of why he had secretly applied for passports for his two sons. This testimony helped show that- appellant had planned in advance to leave the country. Appellant had initially planned to take his sons with him on the flight to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Pakistan. Thus, the testimony was admissible because it tended to show prior calculation and design.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">{\u00b6 84} Appellant next complains that Deputy Forro\u2019s testimony regarding Lubaina\u2019s complaint that he was harassing her by phone tended to show his bad character. However, this testimony tended to show the escalating acrimony between appellant and Lubaina.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">{\u00b6 85} Testimony from Lubaina\u2019s sister Tahira Khan that appellant had repeatedly raped Lubaina should not have been allowed. However, appellant did not object, and defense counsel had elicited the rape allegations earlier in the trial through Lubaina\u2019s divorce attorney. Given the substantial evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt, this evidence was not outcome-determinative. <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 193, 702 N.E.2d 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">{\u00b6 86} In addition, testimony by Khan that appellant had refused to help Lubaina comfort one of their sons, who was upset that his mother was leaving him with his father for a visit, was harmless. Testimony that appellant came to Lubaina\u2019s house in February 1999 and \u201cstarted flinging things all over the floor\u201d was also harmless and did not affect the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">{\u00b6 87} Appellant also asserts that the trial court should have provided a limiting instruction as to testimony about his behavior during the divorce proceedings. Yet appellant failed to request a limiting instruction, and the lack of such an instruction did not amount to plain error. See <em>State v. Frazier, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 339, 652 N.E.2d 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">{\u00b6 88} Given the admissibility of some of the alleged other-acts evidence and the lack of plain error with regard to the inadmissible evidence, we overrule appellant\u2019s fourth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">D. Failure to Declare a Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">{\u00b6 89} In his eighth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial after Officer Nanni testified that when appellant was arrested at JFK and Nanni asked him what happened to his thumb, appellant had replied: \u201cI want to speak to my lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">{\u00b6 90} Defense counsel did not object to Nanni\u2019s comment, but shortly after the comment was made, the prosecutor informed the court, away from the jury, that he had inadvertently elicited the response from Nanni that appellant had asked to speak with his attorney. The prosecutor suggested, and defense counsel requested, that a curative instruction be given. The court then instructed the jury: \u201cA few moments ago, the witness stated that during police interrogation, the defendant requested the right to counsel. You are instructed to disregard the defendant\u2019s request to speak to counsel. Each of us has an absolute right to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>counsel present during any police interrogation. You are to infer nothing from his having requested the right to speak to counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">{\u00b6 91} The testimony elicited from Nanni was improper, since the assertion of the right to counsel must not be used against the accused. <em>State v. Combs </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 278, 280-281, 581 N.E.2d 1071. See, also, <em>Doyle v. Ohio </em>(1976), 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91; <em>Wainwright v. Greenfield </em>(1986), 474 U.S. 284, 295, 106 S.Ct. 634, 88 L.Ed.2d 623, fn. 13; <em>State v. Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 479, 739 N.E.2d 749. However, the trial court\u2019s curative instruction prevented any prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">{\u00b6 92} The trial court did not err in not sua sponte declaring a mistrial at that point. The determination of whether to grant a mistrial is in the discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Glover </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 18, 19, 517 N.E.2d 900; <em>State v. Brown, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 51, 2003-Ohio-5059, 796 N.E.2d 506, \u00b6 42. \u201c[T]he trial judge is in the best position to determine whether the situation in [the] courtroom warrants the declaration of a mistrial.\u201d <em>Glover, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 19, 517 N.E.2d 900; see, also, <em>State v. Williams </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 153, 167, 652 N.E.2d 721. This court will not second-guess such a determination absent an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">{\u00b6 93} No abuse of discretion occurred. The trial court issued a curative instruction shortly after the jury heard Nanni\u2019s improper statement. The jury can be presumed to have followed the court\u2019s instructions, including instructions to disregard testimony. <em>State v. Loza </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 75, 641 N.E.2d 1082; <em>State v. Zuern </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 56, 62, 512 N.E.2d 585. The curative instruction by the court was similar to that upheld in <em>State v. Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 480, 739 N.E.2d 749, in a similar factual context. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s eighth proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">E. Gruesome Photos</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">{\u00b6 94} In his 12th proposition of law, appellant asserts that gruesome crime-scene photos, autopsy slides, and videotape that were admitted were irrelevant, unnecessary, cumulative, and repetitive and prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">{\u00b6 95} Under Evid.R. 403, the admission of photographs is left to a trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>State v. Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 121, 559 N.E.2d 710; <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 264, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768. Nonrepetitive photographs in a capital case, even if gruesome, are admissible if the probative value of each photograph outweighs the danger of material prejudice to the accused. Id. at paragraph seven of the syllabus; <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 257-258, 513 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">{\u00b6 96} Eight crime scene photos were admitted over appellant\u2019s objections, and they are gruesome. State\u2019s Exhibit 6 depicts the body of Abdul Bhatti on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>garage floor. State\u2019s Exhibit 15 shows the doorway area between the basement and garage where the bodies of Ruhie and Abdul can partially be seen. State\u2019s Exhibit 16 depicts the bodies of Lubaina, Ruhie, and Nasira on the basement floor, and although it is repetitive of State\u2019s Exhibit 25, any error in admitting it was harmless. State\u2019s Exhibits 17, 18, 19, and 20 are individual close-up photos of the heads of the four murder victims. State\u2019s Exhibit 21 is a crime-scene videotape, and portions of it are repetitive of the crime-scene photos.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">{\u00b6 97} However, all of the photos and the videotape helped to prove the killer\u2019s intent and illustrated the testimony of detectives who described the crime scene. These photos and video also gave the jury an \u201cappreciation of the nature and circumstances of the crimes.\u201d <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 251, 586 N.E.2d 1042. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that the probative value of each one outweighed any prejudicial effect. Some of the photos and videotape were repetitive, but their admission did not materially prejudice appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">{\u00b6 98} Appellant also claims that he was prejudiced by the admission of the autopsy slides of the four victims. Appellant raised no specific objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">{\u00b6 99} Many of the autopsy slides are gruesome. However, the slides illustrated the coroner\u2019s testimony in describing the multiple injuries sustained by all four victims. The slides also helped to prove the killer\u2019s intent. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that the probative value of each one outweighed any prejudicial effect. Any repetition did not materially prejudice appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">{\u00b6 100} In addition, the trial court did not err in readmitting seven crime-scene photos during the penalty phase. A trial court may properly allow repetition of much or all that occurred in the guilt phase pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(D)(1). See, e.g., <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 282-283, 528 N.E.2d 542; <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 73. The photos in question helped demonstrate the aggravating circumstances in this case. Appellant\u2019s claims of prejudice are not persuasive. Therefore, we overrule appellant\u2019s 12th proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">F. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">{\u00b6 101} In his 18th proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on reasonable doubt based on the statutory definition in R.C. 2901.05. We have repeatedly rejected the same argument, and do so again for the same reasons. See <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph eight of the syllabus; <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 417, 739 N.E.2d 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>IV. Penalty-Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AHS\">A. Sentence Appropriateness</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">{\u00b6 102} In his seventh proposition of law, appellant argues that his death sentence is inappropriate because his background and mental disease militate against such a sentence. We will consider appellant\u2019s arguments later in this opinion as part of our independent review of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">B. Failure to Allow Pro Se Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">{\u00b6 103} In his 13th proposition of law, appellant submits that the trial court deprived him of due process and the right to conduct his own defense when the court declined to accept his waiver of counsel at the beginning of the penalty phase. Appellant contends that <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, guarantees him the right to waive assistance of counsel and proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">{\u00b6 104} If a trial court denies the right of self-representation, when properly invoked, the denial is per se reversible error. <em>State v. Reed </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 534, 535, 660 N.E.2d 456, citing <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 168, 177, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122. However, in this case, the right of self-representation was not properly invoked. See <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 49-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">{\u00b6 105} At the beginning of the penalty phase, appellant gave the trial court a pro se motion \u201cto exercise his right to self representation under the circumstances and thus hereby discharge the appointed counsels.\u201d The court explained to appellant the right that he was waiving and what representing himself would entail. The court then gave appellant a docket entry to sign that stated: \u201cBeing fully advised of my rights, I hereby elect to represent myself.\u201d Appellant signed the form but also wrote on the docket entry: \u201cI have not been allowed the rights under Constitution and as given in Constitution and Crim.R. 10 and 44 to continuance and representation by selection counsel and even to represent myself alone without the presence of court appointed counsels to whom I have sued in the civil case C2-001-0013 in Federal Court. There has been no defense, no defense witnesses and almost no investigation to justify 16 months of delay or period before trial and \u2014 .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">{\u00b6 106} The trial court then addressed appellant and repeatedly asked him whether he understood his rights and wanted to waive them. Appellant did not give a clear answer. The court then held: \u201cWhen I read the comments that you have written on the docket entry, I find that you have failed to effectively sign the entry that was prepared by the court; that the soliloquy [sic] has failed and that you have not, in fact, elected to undertake self representation. We will proceed. Counsel will represent you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>{\u00b6 107} The trial court correctly found that appellant did not unequivocally and explicitly invoke his right to self-representation. See <em>State v. Cassano, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 94, 2002-Ohio-3751, 772 N.E.2d 81, \u00b6 37-38. \u201cThe constitutional right of self-representation is waived if it is not timely and unequivocally asserted.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Ylst </em>(C.A.9, 1990), 921 F.2d 882, 888; see, also, <em>United States v. Frazier-El </em>(C.A.4, 2000), 204 F.3d 553, 558 (assertion of the right of self-representation \u201cmust be * * * clear and unequivocal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">{\u00b6 108} Given these circumstances, appellant\u2019s 13th proposition is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">C. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">{\u00b6 109} In his 14th proposition of law, appellant complains about the following penalty-phase instruction: \u201cFor purposes of this proceeding, only that testimony and evidence which was presented in the first phase that is relevant to the aggravating circumstance or circumstances Defendant was found guilty of committing and to any of the mitigating factors that will be described below, is to be considered by you.\u201d Appellant asserts that this instruction improperly left it up to the jury to determine what guilt-phase evidence was relevant in its sentencing deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">{\u00b6 110} As in <em>State v. Jones, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 349-350, 744 N.E.2d 1163, appellant failed to raise this issue before the trial court and has therefore waived all but plain error. See, e.g, <em>State v. Slagle, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 604, 605 N.E.2d 916. The instruction might have been interpreted to mean that jurors had to determine which evidence that had been presented during the guilt phase was relevant to the penalty phase. As we noted in <em>State v. Getsy, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 201, 702 N.E.2d 866, it is \u201cthe trial court\u2019s responsibility, not the jury\u2019s, to determine what evidence [is] relevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">{\u00b6 111} However, no outcome-determinative plain error occurred. As in <em>Jones, </em>the ambiguous instruction did not determine the outcome of the case because \u201c[m]uch of the trial phase evidence was relevant at the sentencing phase because it was related to the aggravating circumstances, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the asserted mitigating factors. See <em>State v. Gumm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 653 N.E.2d 253, syllabus.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 350, 744 N.E.2d 1163. As noted in <em>Jones, </em>evidence of the nature and circumstances of the aggravating circumstances is also relevant at the penalty phase. Most of the evidence admitted in the guilt phase was also admissible during the penalty phase. See <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, at \u00b6 90. Therefore, we overrule appellant\u2019s 14th proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>D. Sentencing Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">{\u00b6 112} In his 15th proposition of law, appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion was inadequate and did not comply with the requirements of R.C. 2929.03(F). Appellant\u2019s arguments are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">{\u00b6 113} First, appellant points to an error in the court\u2019s sentencing opinion, which states that the jury heard the \u201ctestimony of the defendant\u201d in mitigation, when in fact, appellant never testified. This misstatement was harmless. Moreover, we have independently evaluated the sentence and thereby rectified any error in the sentencing opinion. <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 191, 631 N.E.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">{\u00b6 114} Appellant also claims that the sentencing opinion fails to define how much weight the court gave to the mitigating evidence. But when a defendant introduces evidence in mitigation, a trial court is not required to accept it as mitigating or assign it any weight. See <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph two of the syllabus. And although the trial court did fail to explain its weighing process, inadequate explanations do not create reversible error. <em>State v. Fox, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 190, 631 N.E.2d 124. Any error in the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion can be cured by our independent review. See, e.g., <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 170-173, 555 N.E.2d 293; <em>State v. Raglin </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 253, 257, 699 N.E.2d 482; <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 38, 544 N.E.2d 895 (failure to separately weigh the aggravating circumstances of each murder count against the mitigating factors can be cured by independent review). Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s 15th proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">E. Alternate Jurors in Deliberation Room</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">{\u00b6 115} In his 16th proposition of law, appellant argues that the trial court erred by permitting the alternate jurors to sit in on deliberations during both phases of the trial in violation of Crim.R. 24(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">{\u00b6 116} The trial court clearly erred in allowing the alternate jurors to sit in on deliberations during both phases of trial, even though the defense agreed to it and the trial court admonished the alternates not to participate in the deliberations. As we held in <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 531-534, 747 N.E.2d 765, and <em>State v. Jackson </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 436, 438-440, 751 N.E.2d 946, Crim.R. 24(F) prohibits the presence of alternate jurors in the jury deliberation room.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">{\u00b6 117} Because appellant failed to object, all error is waived save plain error. <em>Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 532, 747 N.E.2d 765. Plain error is absent in this case. Appellant does not allege, nor does the record reveal, that the alternate jurors participated in the deliberations either \u201c Verbally or through \u201cbody language\u201d [or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>that] alternates\u2019 presence exerted a \u201cchilling\u201d effect on the regular jurors.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, at \u00b6 135, quoting <em>United States v. Olano </em>(1993), 507 U.S. 725, 739, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">{\u00b6 118} Thus, appellant fails to demonstrate that he was in fact prejudiced by the presence of the alternate jurors. See <em>State v. Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 531-534, 747 N.E.2d 765; <em>State v. Jackson, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 439-440, 751 N.E.2d 946. This court will not ordinarily presume prejudice. Id. at 439, 751 N.E.2d 946. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s 16th proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">V. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">{\u00b6 119} In his fifth proposition of law, appellant alleges that he was denied a fair trial because of prosecutorial misconduct throughout the trial. \u201c[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">A. Guilt phase</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">{\u00b6 120} Appellant first complains that the prosecutor referred to the death sentence during both opening and closing statements. References to the death penalty during the guilt phase were condemned by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Darden v. Wainwright </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 168, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144. In <em>Darden </em>the prosecutor implied that imposing the death penalty would be the only guarantee against a future similar act. Id. at 180, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144. Nevertheless, the court held that the comments did not deprive Darden of a fair trial. See, also, <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 316, 528 N.E.2d 523 (\u201ccounsel should not comment on matters not at issue in the trial\u201d). Appellant failed to object and thus waived all but plain error. The remarks made did not amount to plain error. In addition, the trial court instructed the jury that opening and closing statements were not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">{\u00b6 121} Appellant next complains that the prosecutor referred to evidence not presented at trial. Before trial, the prosecutor informed the court that it would not call a police officer who had taken a domestic-violence report from Lubaina in 1994. But then in his opening statement, the prosecutor stated: \u201cLike many women in her situation, she filed reports with the authorities, but never followed through.\u201d Appellant claims that the prosecutor promised one thing to the parties and the court but then submitted evidence through the \u201cback door\u201d by vouching to the jury that it existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">{\u00b6 122} Appellant is incorrect. The prosecution never stated that it would not present any evidence of domestic-violence reports, only that it would not present the 1994 report. The prosecution did present evidence that Lubaina had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>complained of telephone harassment when Deputy Steve Forro testified that he had responded to a March 1999 complaint by Lubaina. He also testified that Lubaina had decided to handle the problem through her divorce proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">{\u00b6 123} Appellant also contends that the state failed to disclose before trial, as required by Crim.R. 16, that appellant had told Officer Nanni at the time of his arrest that he had come from St. Clairsville. Appellant argues that this prejudiced his defense, since it placed him in the vicinity of the murders, instead of Columbus, where he resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">{\u00b6 124} Yet the defense failed to object and thus did not give the trial court an opportunity to fashion a remedy, assuming that there was a violation of Crim.R. 16. See Crim.R. 16(E)(3). Moreover, evidence not disclosed is deemed material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the trial would have been different. See <em>State v. Johnston </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 48, 529 N.E.2d 898, paragraph five of the syllabus. Even if this information had been disclosed by the prosecution, the outcome of the trial would not have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">{\u00b6 125} Appellant also claims that the prosecutor improperly elicited testimony that Lubaina had feared appellant and that appellant had raped her. However, as discussed earlier regarding appellant\u2019s third and fourth propositions of law, that testimony was either proper or did not affect the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">{\u00b6 126} Appellant next claims that misconduct occurred during the state\u2019s guilt-phase closing argument when the prosecutor (1) vouched for state\u2019s witnesses, (2) made derogatory comments about defense counsel\u2019s trial tactics, and (3) speculated about evidence that was not presented at trial. Appellant did not object to any of the claimed misconduct at trial. His claims are therefore waived. <em>State v. Slagle, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 604, 605 N.E.2d 916. Even assuming that these comments were improper, we find that they did not determine the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883 (whether improper remarks constitute prosecutorial misconduct requires analysis as to [1] whether the remarks were improper and, [2] if so, whether the remarks prejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">B. Penalty phase</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">{\u00b6 127} Appellant next claims misconduct in the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of the defense\u2019s mitigation expert, Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon. Appellant claims that the prosecutor was abusive and tried to discredit Smalldon\u2019s testimony based on Smalldon\u2019s general opposition to the death penalty. However, the prosecutor\u2019s questioning was not improper, but was designed to detect bias in Smalldon and thereby discredit his findings of mitigating evidence in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>{\u00b6 128} Appellant did not object to any other claimed misconduct during Smalldon\u2019s cross-examination. His claims are therefore waived. <em>State v. Slagle, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 604, 605 N.E.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">{\u00b6 129} Appellant further contends that the following comments made during penalty-phase closing argument denigrated defense counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">{\u00b6 130} \u201cThe defense has a little more leeway. * * * They essentially can say anything they want. Had I dared quote anything from the Bible, there would have been an objection and the judge would have silenced me at once.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">{\u00b6 131} \u201cSo that\u2019s the procedure to keep us away from these emotional appeals, where he quotes from the Bible; I quote from the Bible. He quotes again; I quote again, and instead of a court of law, we\u2019re here at a prayer meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">{\u00b6 132} \u201cLadies and gentlemen, your common sense has brought you this far. Don\u2019t abandon it now just because somebody quotes from the Bible. I wonder if those four innocent victims were given a chance to pray before their throats were slashed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">{\u00b6 133} These comments were made in reply to the defense\u2019s closing argument employing biblical references such as God did not sentence Cain to death for killing Abel, Christ pronounced that \u201cwe should turn the other cheek,\u201d and Christ sought mercy for his killers. While the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were theatrical, they were provoked by defense counsel\u2019s argument. In any event, none of these comments affected appellant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">{\u00b6 134} Appellant next complains about the prosecutor\u2019s speculating how many \u201cpounds\u201d of weight should be accorded to the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating factors. Appellant\u2019s objection on this point was correctly overruled by the trial court, as we have noted that \u201c[a] prosecutor can freely argue the weight to be given to potentially mitigating factors.\u201d <em>State v. Loza </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 82, 641 N.E.2d 1082. In addition, the question \u201cWhat\u2019s the weight you give to four innocent lives taken the way they were taken?\u201d does not necessarily suggest, as appellant submits, that the prosecutor was inviting the jury to weigh the nature and circumstances of the offenses as aggravating circumstances, which would violate our holding in <em>State v. Wogenstahl </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 662 N.E.2d 311, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cIsolated comments by a prosecutor are not to be taken out of context and given their most damaging meaning.\u201d <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 204, 661 N.E.2d 1068, citing <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo </em>(1974), 416 U.S. 637, 647, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">{\u00b6 135} Appellant also contends that the prosecutor attempted to lessen the jurors\u2019 responsibility for imposing a death sentence by saying, \u201c[Mjaybe some day, when I\u2019m retired and gone from here, they might actually consider executing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>somebody.\u201d But the defense objected, and the trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">(\u00b6 136} As appellant claims, the prosecutor did attack his character when he commented: \u201c[H]e\u2019s just a bad person who does bad, evil things.\u201d But this characterization was part of the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the psychological evidence was not mitigating and that appellant was not delusional or \u201csick\u201d when he killed the victims. The jury must consider the defendant\u2019s character under R.C. 2929.04(B), and the prosecutor can argue the merits of his cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">{\u00b6 137} Appellant also complains that prosecutorial comments on Dr. Small-don\u2019s testimony were an attack on the value of psychiatric evidence. Yet the prosecutor opened these comments by stating: \u201cI believe that psychology can be a good thing, if it\u2019s used for good purposes. * * * But you know, psychology can be misused.\u201d The prosecutor continued by questioning Smalldon\u2019s expert opinion that appellant was delusional during the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">{\u00b6 138} However, appellant\u2019s failure to object waived all but plain error, and there is no plain error. Appellant relies upon <em>Gall v. Parker </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 231 F.3d 265, 313-314, but <em>Gall </em>is readily distinguishable. In <em>Gall, </em>the court found the comments by the prosecutor to be an attack on the legitimacy of the defense of insanity, a defense that had been enacted by the legislature. In this case, the prosecutor merely questioned Smalldon\u2019s expert opinion and did not attack the legitimacy of a mental disease or defect as a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">{\u00b6 139} Last, appellant contends that even though defense counsel failed to object to some of the prosecutorial comments that he now claims were improper, this court can examine them, individually and collectively, for prejudicial effect. See <em>State v. Fears </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 354-355, 715 N.E.2d 136 (Moyer, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). We have examined them, and none of the comments by the prosecutor compel a reversal, either individually or collectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">{\u00b6 140} Based on the foregoing, we overrule appellant\u2019s fifth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">VI. Effective Assistance</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">{\u00b6 141} In his sixth proposition of law, appellant argues that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 141-142, 538 N.E.2d 373. However, in no instance does appellant demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>result of the trial would have been different.\u201d Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">A. Voir dire</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">{\u00b6 142} Appellant asserts that counsel failed to adequately question prospective jurors on their racial and religious biases, particularly because of issues that were raised during the trial. For example, the prosecutor argued that the murders were honor killings, born of religious extremism. In addition, the state introduced evidence about appellant\u2019s religion and his religious views on divorce. Moreover, Dr. Smalldon observed that appellant had fled Pakistan because of religious persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">{\u00b6 143} However, \u201c[t]he conduct of voir dire by defense counsel does not have to take a particular form, nor do specific questions have to be asked.\u201d <em>State v. Evans, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 247, 586 N.E.2d 1042. As we noted in <em>State v. Watson </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 1, 13, 572 N.E.2d 97, under <em>Turner v. Murray </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 28, 37, 106 S.Ct. 1683, 90 L.Ed.2d 27, fn. 10, \u201cthe actual decision to voir dire on racial prejudice is a choice best left to a capital defendant\u2019s counsel.\u201d The same applies to a decision to voir dire on religious prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">{\u00b6 144} Defense counsel did voir dire on racial and religious prejudice with regard to some, but not all, prospective jurors. We will normally defer to defense counsel\u2019s judgment in voir dire and not find ineffective assistance. <em>State v. Clayton </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 49, 16 O.O.3d 35, 402 N.E.2d 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">{\u00b6 145} Appellant also contends that counsel failed to adequately probe prospective jurors about their experience with or views on domestic violence and incorrectly recited the burden that the defense would have if a penalty phase were required, by stating that, to avoid a death sentence, the mitigating factors had to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">{\u00b6 146} With regard to domestic violence, counsel questioned some prospective jurors on the topic and may have decided that the examination of other jurors\u2019 views would be unwise. Again, we ordinarily refrain from second-guessing counsel\u2019s trial strategy. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">{\u00b6 147} While counsel\u2019s comments during voir dire did incorrectly describe the defendant\u2019s burden in the penalty phase, the errors were harmless. The trial court\u2019s correct instruction of the law with regard to the weighing process cured counsel\u2019s much earlier misstatements. <em>State v. Loza, </em>71 Ohio St.3d at 79, 641 N.E.2d 1082; <em>State v. Jackson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 40, 565 N.E.2d 549. The jury is presumed to follow the instructions given to it by the trial judge. <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 24, 33, 528 N.E.2d 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">{\u00b6 148} Appellant also claims that counsel failed to adequately challenge the venire or present evidence of the percentage of minorities in Belmont County to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>show that the venire was composed unconstitutionally. Appellant did object to the venire as not representing a true cross section of the community, but the trial court overruled the objection and noted that the issue could be raised again if specifics were asserted. At the close of voir dire, counsel moved to dismiss the jury panel as not representing a proper cross section of the community, since there was only one non-Caucasian person on the venire.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">{\u00b6 149} A defendant is entitled to a jury \u201cdrawn from a source fairly representative of the community.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Louisiana </em>(1975), 419 U.S. 522, 538, 95 S.Ct. 692, 42 L.Ed.2d 690. Counsel did object to the composition of the venire but did not present evidence on minorities in Belmont County. In any event, appellant fails to show prejudice or a reasonable probability that were it not for this error, the result of the trial could have been different. <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">B. Guilt Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">{\u00b6 150} Appellant next argues that defense counsel robbed him of the presumption of innocence during opening statement when counsel mentioned that the prosecutor would seek a death sentence if appellant were found guilty. The jurors knew, however, that they were seated in a capital trial, and counsel simply reminded the jurors that appellant\u2019s life was at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">{\u00b6 151} Appellant complains that counsel failed to authenticate e-mails that he had exchanged with his employer that would have shown a benign explanation for appellant\u2019s attempted trip to Pakistan after the murders. The e-mails were rejected for lack of authentication. However, even if these e-mails had been admitted, they would not have changed the result of appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">{\u00b6 152} Appellant asserts that counsel were ineffective for failing to request a competency evaluation and for failing to object to the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s midtrial request for a competency evaluation. But as discussed regarding appellant\u2019s first proposition of law, the trial court acted properly in rejecting appellant\u2019s request and there was insufficient indicia of incompetency to justify an evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">{\u00b6 153} Appellant contends that counsel failed to adequately prepare and investigate his case due to other trial obligations. Defense counsel Olivito informed the trial court in June of 2000 that he would be defending another capital case in September of that year, as well as a federal case in November. Olivito told the court that his earliest trial availability would be January 2001, when trial, in fact, took place. Despite Olivito\u2019s busy schedule, however, he and defense co-counsel Hershey met and discussed appellant\u2019s case \u201cat least twice a week\u201d beginning in July 2000. Appellant fails to demonstrate that Olivito\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>performance was deficient. This court will not infer failure to investigate from a silent record. <em>State v. Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 542, 747 N.E.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">{\u00b6 154} Appellant next complains that he was prejudiced when defense counsel elicited testimony from state\u2019s witness Grace Hoffman that appellant had been violent toward Lubaina and had forced sex on her. As we determined in the discussions regarding appellant\u2019s third and fourth propositions of law, this testimony did not affect the outcome of his trial nor deprive appellant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">C. Penalty Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">{\u00b6 155} Appellant asserts that counsel was deficient during opening statement of the penalty phase by reciting all of the statutory mitigating factors and commenting that most were not applicable in this case. While this was not helpful to appellant\u2019s case, it was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">{\u00b6 156} Appellant further claims that defense counsel failed to adequately investigate and. prepare for the penalty phase. Again, appellant raises generalities but no specifics as to what other mitigating evidence was available. Appellant did not provide counsel with his list of approximately 60 potential witnesses until the onset of trial. And the list did not include contact information. Appellant fails to overcome the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">{\u00b6 157} Appellant argues next that counsel failed to request the assistance of a \u201ccultural expert\u201d and a foreign-language interpreter. However, appellant\u2019s assertions that these experts would have helped his defense are speculative at best. In <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 694 N.E.2d 932, syllabus, we recognized that a trial court must provide funds for an indigent criminal defendant when the defendant has made a particularized showing of a reasonable probability that experts would aid the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">{\u00b6 158} The record, however, does not support appellant\u2019s assertions that these experts would have helped his defense. In fact, appellant employed a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon, who testified in mitigation, describing appellant\u2019s mental and emotional problems and his background in Pakistan. Moreover, the record does not show that defense counsel failed to investigate whether these experts would help appellant\u2019s case. This court will not infer failure to investigate from a silent record. <em>State v. Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 542, 747 N.E.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">{\u00b6 159} Appellant also argues that during penalty-phase closing argument, defense counsel encouraged the jury to impose death. Appellant cites several statements that he claims were attacks against him: (1) \u201cI\u2019ve spoken about the brutality of these crimes. * * * But ladies and gentlemen of the jury, shouldn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>we be considered here to be better than Nawaz? In your own thinking, shouldn\u2019t we all be better than Nawaz?\u201d (2) \u201cBecause I, quite frankly, think \u2014 and I can stand here and look you in the eye and tell you \u2014 I think you are better than Nawaz, and I think I am better than Nawaz, and I think everybody in this courtroom is.\u201d (3) \u201cLadies and gentleman, Nawaz dealt the cards that he was given. I don\u2019t think he did it wisely. I don\u2019t think he did it justly and I don\u2019t think you do, either.\u201d (4) \u201cAnd I know \u2014 I know the other side of that coin, those victims weren\u2019t big; those victim weren\u2019t strong. One of them was a very, very young child. One of them was a very, very old and fragile father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">{\u00b6 160} Defense counsel made these comments after the jury had already found appellant guilty of all four murders. In context of the entire closing argument, counsel was trying to persuade the jurors to think beyond \u201can eye for an eye,\u201d to persuade them that although appellant thought that killing would solve his problems, they could think \u201cbetter than Nawaz\u201d and opt not to give him a death sentence. In any event, the complained-of statements by counsel were part of a trial strategy meant to convince the jury to not impose a death sentence. Even if some statements were questionable, they do not compel us to find ineffective assistance. <em>State v. Clayton, </em>62 Ohio St.2d at 49, 16 O.O.3d 35, 402 N.E.2d 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">{\u00b6 161} Appellant next contends that counsel failed to tell him about his right of allocution so that he was not prepared for the sentencing hearing. He also claims that his counsel encouraged the judge to impose a death sentence by stating that if appellant were \u201cput to death, that would probably be merciful.\u201d Neither of these things prejudiced appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">{\u00b6 162} With regard to counsel\u2019s failure to prepare appellant for the sentencing hearing, it is noteworthy that during allocution, the trial judge explained the purpose of allocution to appellant several times and advised him to focus on his life and why his life should be spared. Appellant ignored the court\u2019s advice, however, and spent most of his time arguing that counsel had been ineffective. The trial court succinctly responded to appellant\u2019s complaints that counsel had not prepared him for the hearing: \u201cWhat I want to know about doesn\u2019t require preparation or briefing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">{\u00b6 163} Counsel\u2019s comment that death for appellant might be merciful was part of a defense strategy to point out that a life sentence would be a worse punishment than a death sentence for this particular defendant. Moreover, counsel concluded by asking the court to impose a life sentence on appellant rather than a death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">{\u00b6 164} Next, appellant cites instances in which counsel failed to object to statements or matters that we have discussed under other propositions of law: allowing alternates in the deliberation room (proposition No. 16), eliciting hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>testimony regarding Lubaina\u2019s fear of appellant (No. 3), prosecutorial misconduct (No. 5), improper definition of reasonable doubt (No. 18), other-acts evidence (No. 4), violations of the VCCR (No. 17), leaving it to the jury to determine which guilt-phase evidence was relevant to the penalty phase (No. 14), and testimony that should have prompted a mistrial (No. 8). However, in none of these instances was appellant prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to object. None of the alleged failures to object amounted to deficient performance, either individually or collectively, nor did they affect the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">{\u00b6 165} Last, appellant asserts that the cumulative effect of errors and omissions by trial counsel infringed his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. However, appellant received a fair trial, and any error was nonprejudicial. \u201cSuch errors cannot become prejudicial by sheer weight of numbers.\u201d <em>State v. Hill, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 212, 661 N.E.2d 1068; <em>State v. Braden, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003-Ohio-1325, 785 N.E.2d 439, \u00b6 123. For all the foregoing reasons, we reject appellant\u2019s sixth proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">VII. Constitutionality</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">{\u00b6 166} In his 19th proposition of law, appellant challenges the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. These claims are summarily rejected. See, e.g., <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, syllabus; <em>State v. Zuern </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 56, 63, 512 N.E.2d 585; <em>State v. Carter </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 218, 227, 594 N.E.2d 595; <em>State v. Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 139, 22 OBR 203, 489 N.E.2d 795; <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 103-104, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">VIII. Independent Review and Proportionality</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">{\u00b6 167} After independent assessment, we find that the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstances in this case: that appellant murdered Lubaina, her father Abdul, her sister Ruhie and Ruhie\u2019s daughter, Nasira, as a course of conduct (R.C. 2929.04[A][5]); and that Nasira was under the age of 13 at the time of her death (R.C. 2929.04[A][9]).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">{\u00b6 168} At the mitigation hearing, appellant presented four witnesses. The first two were called to show that prior to the murders, appellant was showing signs of paranoia. John Mentzer, the maintenance supervisor of the apartments where appellant lived, testified that appellant \u201cwas one of the more difficult residents that I\u2019ve got on the property.\u201d Appellant had complained to Mentzer that maintenance personnel had entered his apartment without his permission. He insisted on seeing Mentzer\u2019s records of when apartment personnel had entered his apartment as well as the apartments above and below his. Appellant told Mentzer that \u201che knew that the CIA had gotten into his apartment and bugged it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>{\u00b6 169} Lisa Redmond, the apartment manager, also testified for the defense. Redmond testified that appellant had told her that the apartment maintenance personnel had let the CIA into his apartment to bug it. When she denied this, she felt that appellant did not believe her.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">{\u00b6 170} Shehida Ahmed, appellant\u2019s sister-in-law, testified on appellant\u2019s behalf. Shehida moved to Canada from Pakistan five years earlier and had known appellant for 20 years. According to Shehida, appellant treated all family members well and was very helpful. Appellant had also helped family members financially. Shehida described appellant as having always been religious, practicing Islam, and \u201cdevoted towards family.\u201d When Lubaina filed for divorce, appellant was very upset, and he tried to convince his relatives to keep their families together and \u201cmake their relations better with each other.\u201d Shehida always knew appellant as \u201ca loving person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">{\u00b6 171} Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon, a forensic psychologist, was the principal mitigation witness. Dr. Smalldon observed that \u201cof all of the capital death penalty defendants who I\u2019ve ever worked with, I believe Mr. Ahmed may have been the most difficult to work with.\u201d Smalldon met with appellant three times, spending between 12 and 15 hours with him. Appellant refused.to participate in formal testing, and Smalldon found it \u201call but impossible to engage in a dialog\u201d with him. But Smalldon felt that he had been \u201cable to collect a great deal of relevant information\u201d from appellant without the tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">{\u00b6 172} Smalldon found appellant to be \u201cvery intelligent\u201d but also paranoid and extremely guarded. Nevertheless, Smalldon was able to obtain useful information on appellant\u2019s history and background from appellant and his acquaintances. Appellant grew up in a rural area in Pakistan and attended school, even though education was not compulsory there. His father was a farmer, and his mother was an uneducated housewife. Appellant was one of six children and was the oldest son.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">{\u00b6 173} Appellant served in the Pakistani Air Force, where, in the early 1970s, he became friends with Major Naeem Khan. Appellant maintained contact with Khan until Khan moved to America in the early 1980s. Appellant reestablished contact with Khan when appellant came to the United States in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">{\u00b6 174} Appellant practices Islam and, according to Smalldon, belongs to the \u201c73rd denomination of Islam,\u201d which was in radical disfavor with the mainstream Islamic population in Pakistan in the 1980s. The sect was persecuted, and discriminatory laws were enacted against its members. When appellant emigrated from Pakistan to the United States, he felt he had no other choice. Both appellant and Khan decided to flee Pakistan because of the persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">{\u00b6 175} Upon emigrating from Pakistan, appellant lived in Chicago, where he earned a degree in computer science from Northeastern University. During that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>time, he worked for Khan at a refrigeration company. Khan described appellant to Smalldon as quiet, introverted, and very devout but very rigid in his religious beliefs. Khan told Smalldon that appellant was a nonviolent person. In fact, Khan described an incident to Smalldon in which appellant had been beaten up for his religious convictions and had. walked away instead of fighting back.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">{\u00b6 176} According to Smalldon\u2019s testimony, Khan has remained in contact by telephone with appellant since he has been in jail. Khan told Smalldon, \u201cThis is not the Nawaz that I\u2019ve known. He\u2019s living in an illusion.\u201d Kahn told Smalldon that he believes that appellant had lost touch with reality and had lost his rationality. Appellant asked Khan in one phone conversation: \u201cAre you on my side or are you on their side?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">{\u00b6 177} Smalldon noted that appellant had no history of being treated for mental or emotional problems until 1999. Lubaina had prescribed for him the antidepressant Prozac at the beginning of 1999. Appellant\u2019s physician in Columbus, Dr. Mohammed Ahmed, met with him briefly in 1999 and prescribed Zoloft for his depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">{\u00b6 178} Smalldon concluded that appellant is not insane, but suffers from a delusional disorder, persecutory type; a depressive disorder; and a paranoid personality disorder. In addition, appellant has several prominent personality traits: narcissistic trait \u2014 a pattern of grandiosity, presumptuousness, and a sense of entitlement; passive-aggressive trait \u2014 a pervasive negativistic attitude, seeing the glass half-empty, and feeling that he is getting \u201ca raw deal\u201d; and obsessive-compulsive trait \u2014 a preoccupation with control, order, typically at the expense of flexibility and spontaneity. According to Smalldon, appellant\u2019s paranoid-personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive suspicion of other people, a too quick tendency to believe that people are out to humiliate or demean him.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">{\u00b6 179} Smalldon testified that appellant was experiencing delusional disorder of the persecutory type while committing the murders. Smalldon asserted that appellant has a severe mental illness that impaired his capacity to accurately perceive reality and think logically. However, Smalldon declined to state that because of appellant\u2019s mental illness, he lacked the capacity to understand the wrongfulness of his conduct. Rather, Smalldon stated that appellant\u2019s mental illness was of such severity that it <em>could </em>have substantially impaired his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">{\u00b6 180} Appellant declined to make an unsworn statement at the mitigation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">{\u00b6 181} The nature and circumstances of the offense offer nothing in mitigation. Appellant traveled from Columbus to St. Clairsville and murdered his estranged wife, father-in-law, sister-in-law, and niece by fracturing their skulls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>and slitting their throats. Appellant then tried to escape to Pakistan before he was apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">{\u00b6 182} Appellant\u2019s history, character, and background provide some mitigating features. He served in the Pakistani Air Force. He earned a degree in computer science when he came to the United States and was gainfully employed during his time here. Appellant is very religious and, in fact, fled Pakistan because of religious persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">{\u00b6 183} With regard to the statutory mitigating factors of R.C. 2929.04(B), the trial court considered appellant\u2019s mental illness to be a mental disease or defect under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). Dr. Smalldon testified that appellant\u2019s mental illness could have substantially impaired his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. Although we do not view appellant\u2019s mental illness as a (B)(3) factor, it is nevertheless entitled to weight in mitigation as a (B)(7) factor. See <em>State v. Raglin, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 273, 699 N.E.2d 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">{\u00b6 184} The R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) factor also deserves weight in mitigation, since appellant lacked a significant history of prior criminal convictions and juvenile adjudications. None of the other factors of R.C. 2929.04(B) are implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">{\u00b6 185} Upon independent weighing, we find that the aggravating circumstance in each murder count (circumstances, in the case of Nasira) outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. While appellant was suffering mental and emotional problems in the midst of a contentious divorce, these factors and other mitigating factors are far outweighed in each instance by the aggravating course-of-conduct circumstance. In the murder of Nasira, the two aggravating circumstances heavily outweigh the mitigation. Appellant\u2019s actions merit the capital penalty to which he was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">{\u00b6 186} As to each victim, the death penalty is both appropriate and proportionate when compared with capital cases involving the purposeful killing or attempt to kill two or more persons. See <em>State v. Davie, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 311, 686 N.E.2d 245; <em>State v. Taylor, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 27, 2002-Ohio-7017, 781 N.E.2d 72; <em>State v. Brown, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 51, 2003-Ohio-5059, 796 N.E.2d 506; and <em>State v. Jordan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 216, 2004-Ohio-783, 804 N.E.2d 1. The death penalty is also appropriate and proportionate when compared to cases involving the murder of a child under the age of 13. See <em>State v. Smith, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 367, 2002-Ohio-6659, 780 N.E.2d 221 (six-month-old victim); <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185 (six-year-old victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">{\u00b6 187} Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the court of common pleas, including the penalty of death, is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Frank Pierce, Belmont County Prosecuting Attorney, and Michael L.
