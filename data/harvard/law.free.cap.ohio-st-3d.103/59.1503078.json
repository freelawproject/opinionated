Shimko, and defendant-appellee Thomas G. Lobe, both of whom are admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>to practice law in Ohio. The dispute centers on the terms of an oral agreement with regard to the division of legal fees for litigation in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">{\u00b6 3} On September 19, 1995, Lobe wrote to defendant-appellee Cleveland Bar Association (\u201cCBA\u201d), requesting that the dispute be \u201cset down for mandatory and binding Arbitration.\u201d Lobe\u2019s request was made pursuant to the Bylaws and Rules of the Division of Fees Mediation and Arbitration Committee, which were adopted by the CBA\u2019s Board of Trustees on September 25, 1992, to implement DR 2-107(B). Under the committee\u2019s bylaws, \u201cany decision rendered by a sole arbitrator or an arbitration panel is final and binding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">{\u00b6 4} In a letter dated September 29, 1995, Shimko opposed Lobe\u2019s request for arbitration on the grounds that Lobe had failed to allege sufficient facts to invoke the committee\u2019s jurisdiction. On December 8, 1995, the committee\u2019s secretary notified the parties that the committee was accepting jurisdiction and recommended that Lobe file the requisite petition. Lobe then submitted a formal petition for arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">{\u00b6 5} Shimko commenced this action in 1996 by filing the first of two complaints for declaratory judgment in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas against Lobe, CBA, and defendant-appellee Ohio State Bar Association (\u201cOSBA\u201d) (case No. 96CVH02-1206). In that complaint, Shimko sought a declaration that DR 2-107(B) violates several provisions of the Ohio and United States Constitutions and, therefore, is invalid and unenforceable. Finding that \u201c[t]he practice of law is a privilege granted by the Supreme Court to those persons * * * who agree to be bound by the rules of the profession\u201d and that the \u201cregulation of * * * fee disputes is a proper function of the Court in its superintendence of the Bar,\u201d the trial court held that DR 2-107(B) \u201cdoes not violate the Plaintiffs rights existing under the Constitutions of the State of Ohio and the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">{\u00b6 6} The court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, except to the extent that it had decided the issue of whether DR 2-107(B) deprives Shimko of his right to a jury trial as guaranteed by Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution without having made a factual determination of reasonableness. Espousing the proposition that \u201c \u2018[n]o one has an absolute right to practice law, and the State may impose reasonable conditions and limitations upon those who wish to exercise that privilege,\u2019 \u201d the majority of the court of appeals framed the determinative inquiry under Section 5, Article I in terms of whether DR 2-107(B) \u201cis reasonable and, therefore, appellant should be bound by it.\u201d <em>Shimko v. Lobe </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 336, 347, 706 N.E.2d 354, quoting <em>Kelley Drye &amp; Warren v. Murray Industries, Inc. </em>(D.N.J.1985), 623 F.Supp. 522, 527. The appellate court believed, however, that it needed a \u201cfactual basis to assess the reasonableness of this rule\u201d and, in accordance with that belief, remanded the cause to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>trial court \u201cfor a hearing to determine the reasonableness of the rule in * * * eliminating appellant\u2019s right to a jury trial.\u201d Id. at 347-348, 706 N.E.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">{\u00b6 7} On February 20, 1998, Shimko\u2019s cross-appeal to this court was dismissed for failure of prosecution. (1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 1450, 690 N.E.2d 545. On April 1, 1998, this court refused to accept appellees\u2019 discretionary appeal. (1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 1502, 691 N.E.2d 1061. Shimko then dismissed his original action pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">{\u00b6 8} Shimko refiled his complaint on April 5, 1999. The second complaint (case No. 99CVH04-2793) essentially duplicated the first, with the addition of two new claims not involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">{\u00b6 9} On April 17 and 18, 2000, an evidentiary hearing was held before a magistrate in accordance with the earlier mandate from the court of appeals to determine the reasonableness of DR 2-107(B). In a decision filed September 13, 2000, the magistrate concluded that \u201cDR 2-107(B) is a reasonable restriction on the practice of law, and therefore constitutional.\u201d In so doing, the magistrate found that in compelling arbitration of fee disputes between lawyers, the rule serves to prevent the erosion of public confidence in the legal profession, particularly by \u201cavoiding what many perceive as the tawdry spectacle of lawyers fighting over the carcass of a fee\u201d and \u201chelps to preserve the confidentiality of attorney-client communication and to preserve privileges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">{\u00b6 10} In a decision dated August 13, 2001, the trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision over Shimko\u2019s objections, with one minor modification as to a finding of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">{\u00b6 11} On Shimko\u2019s appeal, the court of appeals affirmed all aspects of the trial court\u2019s various rulings, concluding that \u201c[bjased on the evidence presented at the [April 17, 2000] hearing * * * the compulsory arbitration and mediation provision of [DR 2-107(B) ] is a reasonable restriction on those who practice law in Ohio.\u201d 152 Ohio App.3d 742, 2003-Ohio-2200, 790 N.E.2d 335, \u00b6 32. Moreover, the court of appeals found that \u201cattorneys admitted to the practice of law in Ohio, including [Shimko], agree to have a \u2018dispute between lawyers arising under this rule\u2019 submitted to mediation or arbitration. By doing so, they have waived the right to a jury trial in [cases involving such] fee disputes.\u201d Id. The court also held that by providing for mediation or arbitration through bar associations, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has not unlawfully delegated judicial authority to resolve [such] fee disputes,\u201d since the lawyer\u2019s consent upon admission \u201cto be bound [by] the Code of Professional Responsibility, including DR 2-107(B)\u2019s provisions * * * gives the mediators or arbitrators their authority to resolve the fee disputes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">{\u00b6 12} The cause is now before this court pursuant to the acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>{\u00b6 13} In this appeal, Shimko proposes that DR 2 \u2014 107(B) is unconstitutional for two reasons: (1) it denies attorneys the right to a jury trial as guaranteed by Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, and (2) it creates or delegates the power to create tribunals unauthorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">{\u00b6 14} For the reasons that follow, we reject both these propositions and hold that DR 2-107(B) is a lawful exercise of this court\u2019s inherent and plenary power to regulate, control, and define the practice of law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">RIGHT OF TRIAL BY JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">{\u00b6 15} Beginning with the adoption of Supreme Court Rule XXVI in February 1875, see 24 Ohio St. V, and culminating in the adoption of Section 2(B)(1)(g), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution in 1968, it has been methodically and firmly established that the power and responsibility to admit and discipline persons admitted to the practice of law, to promulgate and enforce professional standards and rules of conduct, and to otherwise broadly regulate, control, and define the procedure and practice of law in Ohio rests inherently, originally, and exclusively in the Supreme Court of Ohio. See <em>Smith v. Kates </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 263, 265-266, 75 O.O.2d 318, 348 N.E.2d 320; <em>Mahoning Cty. Bar Assn. v. Franko </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 17, 5 O.O.2d 282, 151 N.E.2d 17; <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Pleasant </em>(1958), 167 Ohio St. 325, 4 O.O.2d 433, 148 N.E.2d 493; <em>In re McBride </em>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 419, 58 O.O. 242, 132 N.E.2d 113; <em>Judd v. City Trust &amp; Sav. Bank </em>(1937), 133 Ohio St. 81, 10 O.O. 95, 12 N.E.2d 288, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>In re Thatcher </em>(1909), 80 Ohio St. 492, 89 N.E. 39; Swisher, Professional Responsibility in Ohio (1981) 1.15-1.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">{\u00b6 16} In exercising its supervisory responsibility over the bar, this court has sought to maintain the integrity of the legal profession and preserve the public confidence in the judicial system. See, e.g., EC 1-1, 9-1, and 9-6. See, also, <em>Franko, </em>supra, 168 Ohio St. at 23, 5 O.O.2d 282, 151 N.E.2d 17; <em>In re Disbarment of Thatcher </em>(1910), 83 Ohio St. 246, 249, 93 N.E. 895. Thus, while recognizing that \u201c[t]he legal profession cannot remain a viable force in fulfilling its role in our society unless its members receive adequate compensation for services rendered,\u201d EC 2-15, the Code of Professional Responsibility contains a broad range of rules that limit the attorney\u2019s pursuit of legal fees. See, e.g., DR 2-101(E)(l) and (2) (specifying allowable and binding advertisement with regard to fees), DR 2-103 (general prohibition and exceptions concerning payment of referral fee), DR 2-106(A) and (B) (precluding lawyers from collecting an illegal or clearly excessive fee and providing standards for determining when a fee is clearly excessive), DR 2-106(C) (prohibiting contingent fees in criminal cases), DR 2-110(A)(3) (requiring a lawyer, upon withdrawing from employment, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>refund any fees that were paid in advance), DR 3-102(A) (prohibiting a lawyer from sharing legal fees with a nonlawyer), DR 5-103(A) (prohibiting acquisition of proprietary interest in litigation, except a lien to secure payment of fees and a contingency fee in civil cases), and DR 5-107(A) (precluding a lawyer from accepting third-party compensation without the client\u2019s consent after full disclosure).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">{\u00b6 17} To this end, DR 2-107 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(A) Division of fees by lawyers who are not in the same firm may be made only with the prior consent of the client and if all of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(1) The division is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or, if by written agreement with the client, all lawyers assume responsibility for the representation;</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(2) The terms of the division and the identity of all lawyers sharing in the fee are disclosed in writing to the client;</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(3) The total fee is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(B) In cases of dispute between lawyers arising under this rule, fees shall be divided in accordance with mediation or arbitration provided by a local bar association. Disputes that cannot be resolved by a local bar association shall be referred to the Ohio State Bar Association for mediation or arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">{\u00b6 23} Gov.Bar R. IV(1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe Code of Professional Responsibility, as adopted by this Court on October 5, 1970 and set forth in 23 Ohio State 2d Reports, as amended, shall be binding upon all persons admitted to practice law in Ohio. The willful breach of the Code shall be punished by reprimand, suspension, disbarment, or probation as provided in Gov.Bar R. V.\u201d See, also, Gov.Bar R. I(8)(A) (requiring each applicant, upon admission to the bar, to take an oath to \u201cabide by the Code of Professional Responsibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">{\u00b6 25} The court of appeals expressed some doubt, however, as to the finality of an arbitration award rendered pursuant to DR 2-107(B). In its 1997 decision, the court of appeals timorously noted, \u201cAlthough the rule itself does not state that arbitration before the Ohio State Bar Association is either \u2018final\u2019 or \u2018binding,\u2019 the Ohio State Bar Association DR 2-107 Attorney\u2019s Fee Division Dispute Resolution Plan, adopted by the Council of Delegates on November 9, 1991, expressly states that such arbitration is \u2018binding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shimko, </em>supra, 124 Ohio App.3d at 346, 706 N.E.2d 354, fn. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">{\u00b6 26} Considering that DR 2-107(B) explicitly requires division of fees \u201cin accordance with mediation or arbitration,\u201d that \u201c[t]he Disciplinary Rules, unlike the Ethical Considerations, are mandatory in character\u201d (Preface to Code of Professional Responsibility), and that the salient purpose of the rule is to prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>litigation of disputes between lawyers over the division of fees, it is clear that DR 2-107(B) cannot and was not intended to be interpreted otherwise. Lest there be any further uncertainty, we hold that an arbitration award rendered pursuant to DR 2-107(B) is final, binding upon the parties, and unappealable. In this way, the burden of withstanding constitutional scrutiny under Section 5, Article I will fall upon the rule itself, as adopted by this court, rather than being foisted upon the implementing plans or bylaws of a particular bar association.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">{\u00b6 27} Shimko correctly asserts that the court\u2019s power to regulate the bar \u201cis not absolute and [that] it must be contained by, and act congruently with, the very constitution that provides for its existence.\u201d This court may no more disregard or infringe upon the constitutional rights of our citizens in the exercise of its regulatory functions than may any other branch of government. As we explained in <em>Christensen v. Bd. of Commrs. on Grievances &amp; Discipline </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 534, 537, 575 N.E.2d 790, \u201cRules adopted by this court in an administrative capacity must comply with the state and federal constitutions like any other rules and may be tested in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">{\u00b6 28} In particular, the court does not enjoy any special exemption from compliance with Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, which ensures that \u201c[t]he right of trial by jury shall 'be inviolate * * We have consistently recognized that Section 5, Article I does not merely extol a procedural privilege, but secures a sacred and fundamental right, anchored in the founding of our nation and state and basic to the institution of American democracy, that may not be invaded or violated by legislative act or judicial order or decree. See, e.g., <em>Sorrell v. Thevenir </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 415, 421, 633 N.E.2d 504; <em>Morris v. Savoy </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 684, 701, 702-703, 576 N.E.2d 765 (A. W. Sweeney, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <em>Miller v. Wikel Mfg. Co., Inc. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 76, 81, 545 N.E.2d 76 (Douglas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">{\u00b6 29} But the right of trial by jury under Section 5, Article I is still a qualified right. \u201cIt was not * * * the intention of the framers of that clause * * * to guarantee the right of trial by jury in all controversies. That guaranty only preserves the right of trial by jury in cases where under the principles of the common law it existed previously to the adoption of the [Ohio] Constitution. The right of trial by jury has uniformly been recognized and enforced in this state in actions for money, where the claim is an ordinary debt * * *.\u201d <em>Belding v. State ex rel. Heifner </em>(1929), 121 Ohio St. 393, 396-397,169 N.E. 301. See, also, <em>Sorrell, </em>supra, 69 Ohio St.3d at 421, 633 N.E.2d 504; <em>Kneisley v. Lattimer-Stevens Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 354, 356, 533 N.E.2d 743. The right, where it exists, may also be waived. \u201cSection 5 of Article I of the Ohio Constitution does not prevent a court from giving effect to a waiver of a jury trial by a party who has a right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>a jury trial.\u201d <em>Cassidy v. Glossip </em>(1967), 12 Ohio St.2d 17, 41 O.O.2d 153, 231 N.E.2d 64, paragraph one of the syllabus. See, also, <em>Bonewitz v. Bonewitz </em>(1893), 50 Ohio St. 373, 34 N.E. 332, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cA party may waive his right to a jury trial by acts, as well as by words\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">{\u00b6 30} This court has never considered the constitutionality of DR 2-107(B). The rule was challenged on several constitutional grounds in <em>State ex rel. Lawrence v. Marks </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 1207, 655 N.E.2d 1308, and the concurring justices in that case opined that \u201ca legitimate question arises [under Section 5, Article I] whether this court, by rule or otherwise, can force parties in an attorney-fee dispute to arbitrate when the result of a true arbitration is an award which is final and nonappealable and the parties have not previously agreed to arbitrate.\u201d Id. at 1208, 655 N.E.2d 1308 (Douglas, J., concurring). However, the majority of the court refrained from commenting on the merits in that action, which was unanimously dismissed upon motion for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">{\u00b6 31} As far as we can ascertain, no other court has considered the constitutional validity of a disciplinary or other court rule compelling arbitration of fee disputes between attorneys. However, several courts have been confronted with a variety of constitutional objections to court rules that require arbitration of attorney-client fee disputes at the client\u2019s option. In each case, the rule was upheld against all challenges, including those based upon the right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">{\u00b6 32} <em>In re LiVolsi </em>(1981), 85 N.J. 576, 428 A.2d 1268, involved a number of challenges to N.J.R. 1:20A, which was adopted by the New Jersey Supreme Court as a mechanism for resolving fee disputes between attorneys and their clients. The rule establishes fee-arbitration committees and provides that a committee must arbitrate a dispute upon the request of a client, whether the attorney consents or not, and that the committee\u2019s determination is binding on the parties and unappealable. In finding the promulgation of N.J.R. 1:20A to be within the scope of its constitutional power, the Supreme Court of New Jersey explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cThe heart of the constitutional provisions concerning the judicial system was the concentration of responsibility for its proper functioning in the Supreme Court and Chief Justice. Such responsibility requires appropriate power over courts, judges, practice and procedure, and lawyers. Responsibility for an adversarial judicial system requires responsibility for the adversaries, and control over both.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cIn exercising this responsibility, one of the many goals this Court has sought to achieve has been maintaining public confidence in the judicial system.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cGiven the critical importance of the constitutional power of this Court over the practice of law, and its pervasiveness, starting with admission, ending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>with disbarment, and covering everything in between, we have no doubt that the power extends to every aspect of fee agreements between lawyers and clients.\u201d Id., 85 N.J. at 585, 428 A.2d 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">{\u00b6 36} The court went on to reject the claim that N.J.R. 1:20A unconstitutionally denies attorneys the right to trial by jury \u201con the two grounds that in New Jersey attorneys never had an absolute right to trial by jury in fee dispute cases and that recognizing a jury right in such cases would undermine our constitutional authority to regulate the Bar.\u201d Id. at 587, 428 A.2d 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">{\u00b6 37} After <em>In re LiVolsi </em>was decided, the New Jersey rule was twice challenged and upheld in federal court under the jury-trial clause of the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. In <em>Kelley Drye &amp; Warren v. Murray Indus., Inc. </em>(D.N.J.1985), 623 F.Supp. 522, 526-527, and again in <em>Guralnick v. Supreme Court of New Jersey </em>(D.N.J.1990), 747 F.Supp. 1109, 1116, affirmed (C.A.3, 1992), 961 F.2d 209, it was held that state courts may, consistent with the Seventh Amendment, require persons wishing to exercise the privilege of practicing law to waive or forfeit their right to a jury trial if the client elects to arbitrate a fee dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">{\u00b6 38} In <em>Anderson v. Elliott </em>(Me.1989), 555 A.2d 1042, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine held that certain Maine Bar Rules promulgated by the court in 1978 do not infringe upon an attorney\u2019s right to trial by jury under the Maine Constitution. The court explained that \u201cRule 9 establishes a mechanism for binding arbitration of attorney-client fee disputes under the jurisdiction of the Board of Overseers of the Bar, and Rule 3.3(c) obligates an attorney to submit any fee dispute to Rule 9 arbitration at the client\u2019s request.\u201d Id. at 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">{\u00b6 39} At the outset of its analysis, the Maine Supreme Court recognized:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cMaine Bar Rule 9 enables a client to prevent his attorney from having their fee dispute heard by a jury, but that by itself does not violate the constitutional guarantee of the right to a civil jury trial, Me. Const, art. I, \u00a7 20. Elliott\u2019s thesis that a suit to recover a contingent fee is just like any other suit for money damages for breach of contract \u2014 in other words, that the attorney-client relationship is just like any other contractual arrangement \u2014 ignores the uniqueness of the attorney\u2019s relation to the court and to the client.\u201d Id. at 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">{\u00b6 41} Upon taking the oath of office, the court explained, \u201cthe attorney enters into a regulated profession and becomes an officer of the court subject to the court\u2019s inherent power,\u201d which necessarily includes the imposition of \u201c'certain standards peculiarly applicable to attorneys * * * to assure fairness and efficiency of court procedures and adjudications and to foster public confidence in such fairness and efficiency.\u2019 \u201d Id., 555 A.2d at 1048, quoting <em>In re Dineen </em>(Me.1977), 380 A.2d 603, 604. Thus, continued the court, \u201can attorney-client fee dispute is no ordinary contractual controversy. Members of the public as a practical matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>have access to the courts only through their attorneys, and that access is impaired by collateral controversies over legal charges.\u201d Id. at 1049. See, also, <em>Nodvin v. State Bar of Georgia </em>(2001), 273 Ga. 559, 561, 544 S.E.2d 142 (recognizing the \u201cunique * * * importance\u201d of public confidence in the judicial system as justification for mandatory arbitration of attorney-client fee disputes).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">{\u00b6 42} One of Shimko\u2019s principal contentions is that <em>LiVolsi </em>and <em>Anderson </em>are distinguishable because they involve attorney-client fee disputes rather than disputes between attorneys. According to Shimko, \u201cthe nature of the relationship between the attorney and client was critical to each of those courts.\u201d In particular, Shimko contends that because \u201cthe attorney occupies a fiduciary relationship, with a position of superiority over the client * * *, the Supreme Courts of Maine and New Jersey felt it was reasonable for attorneys to submit to non-jury adjudications for fee disputes.\u201d On the other hand, the argument continues, attorneys like Shimko and Lobe need no special protection from one another, as they stand \u201con equal footing and at arms-length, and neither would be hindered or put to a disadvantage by taking the dispute to court.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">{\u00b6 43} Shimko\u2019s argument is built on the erroneous premise that the constitutional validity of the nonjury dispute-resolution mechanisms at issue in <em>LiVolsi </em>and <em>Anderson </em>was necessarily dependent upon concerns peculiar to the attorney-client relationship. However, a close reading reveals that the critical support for the constitutionality of the compulsory arbitration schemes in those cases was ultimately found to lie not in the fiduciary character of the attorney-client relationship or the attorney\u2019s position of dominance over the client, but in the relations existing between the bench and bar, that is, in the recognition that lawyers are officers of the court and essential to the primary judicial function of administering justice. The essential power to control or regulate the fee arrangement between attorney and client is not derived from the attorney\u2019s position in relation to the client, but from the attorney\u2019s position in relation to the court and the justice system. Moreover, Shimko forgets that the courts in <em>LiVolsi </em>and <em>Anderson </em>did not purport to exercise any authority or control over the client. It was the attorney who was held in those cases to have entered a regulated profession and who was subjected to professional standards designed to preserve public confidence in the judicial system. In fact, the very rules at issue in <em>LiVolsi </em>and <em>Anderson </em>are expressly designed to operate at the client\u2019s option, thus disclaiming any ability or desire on the court\u2019s part to compel the client to arbitrate a fee dispute. And because those decisions reflect the court\u2019s broad power to regulate the professional activities of its officers, they are indeed significant to the matter at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">{\u00b6 44} Shimko also maintains that \u201c[statutes and rules that interfere with the right to a trial by jury are subject to the highest level of judicial scrutiny\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>that DR 2-107(B) is not \u201cnecessary to promote a compelling governmental interest.\u201d According to Shimko, the rationale advanced to support the rule, which Shimko states to be that \u201ccitizens will gain confidence in the legal system by not viewing lawyers litigat[ing] over legal fees,\u201d does not rise to the level of a compelling state interest. In any event, Shimko argues, no evidence was presented to suggest that the public is overly concerned with or affected by such litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">{\u00b6 45} Appellees argue, however, that these particular questions were resolved by the court of appeals in its 1997 decision, which became \u201cthe law of the case\u201d upon this court\u2019s dismissal of Shimko\u2019s cross-appeal on February 20, 1998. Thus, appellees contend that Shimko should be precluded from relitigating the applicability of a reasonableness standard and, correlatively, that this court should limit its review to whether sufficient evidence was presented at the hearing on remand to support the finding that DR 2-107(B) is a reasonable restriction on the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">{\u00b6 46} We cannot agree with appellees that the \u201claw of the case doctrine\u201d has any applicability in this case. \u201cThe doctrine is considered to be a rule of practice rather than a binding rule of substantive law and will not be applied so as to achieve unjust results.\u201d <em>Nolan v. Nolan </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 11 OBR 1, 462 N.E.2d 410. This court would be remiss in its supervisory responsibility over the bar if it were to apply the doctrine under the present circumstances. On the one hand, adherence to the doctrine in this appeal could result in this court\u2019s upholding an unconstitutional rule on account of being forced by the law of the case to apply the wrong analytic standard. On the other hand, it could result in this court\u2019s rendering a decision implying that these particular constitutional objections to DR 2-107(B) might be valid, only to postpone their resolution because a doctrine that we have chosen to apply prevents us from considering them.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">{\u00b6 47} Having determined to address Shimko\u2019s contention that DR 2-107(B) fails to withstand strict scrutiny, we now reject it. In the first place, DR 2-107(B) does not implicate the right of trial by jury, because that right does not exist in cases of fee disputes between attorneys. Prior to 1802, the attorney\u2019s ability to recover a fee for legal services was regulated entirely by statute and rested for its authority upon the will of the legislature. Indeed, compensation for advocacy has never been treated as an ordinary debt or contractual right, but has since antiquity been regulated by the prevailing governmental authority possessing the power to control the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">{\u00b6 48} Both at Rome and in the ecclesiastical courts of England, \u201c[t]he advocate * * * had no legal claim to a fee.\u201d Roscoe Pound, The Lawyer from Antiquity to Modern Times (1953) 68. Advocacy was considered \u201ca service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>gratuitously rendered for its own sake, for which the advocate might honorably accept a fair honorarium, voluntarily bestowed on him as a gift, but for which no bargain as to compensation and nothing in the way of hire was permissible.\u201d Id. at 54-55. On those rare occasions when fees were allowed, they were granted and strictly regulated by the prevailing governmental authority. Id. at 51-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">{\u00b6 49} In colonial America, fees were strictly regulated by statute. Thus, Pound recounts:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cIn 1642-3, an Act for the Better Regulation of Attorneys forbade pleading causes for another without license from the court where one pleads * * *. Fees (in tobacco) were fixed very low with a heavy penalty for taking more. A licensed attorney was forbidden to refuse retainer unless already retained on the other side of the same controversy. * * * In 1657-58 it was enacted that no attorney and no other person should plead in any court or give counsel in any cause or controversy for any kind of reward or profit directly or indirectly, under penalty for every breach. However, fees were allowed and fixed by an Act of 1680, but no one was to practice in the General Court (formerly called Quarter Court) unless licensed by the Governor. * * * [Statutory regulation of fees [in Virginia] went on until 1849 * * *.\u201d Id. at 136-138. Also, \u201c[i]n Maryland in 1725 there was a statute regulating fees strictly and allowing planters to pay in tobacco or in currency at a fixed rate.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) Id. at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">{\u00b6 51} In the Northwest Territory, attorneys were permitted to charge and collect fees for their services, but that entitlement was derived from territorial legislation. On August 1, 1792, the territorial legislature passed \u201cAn ACT to regulate the admission of Attorneys.\u201d Pease Ed., Laws of the Northwest Territory (IlLState Bar Assn.Reprint, 1925) 88. The Act of 1792 set forth qualifications for admission, required a successful applicant to take an oath of office, and provided that in no \u201ccause shall fees for more than one attorney be taxed or allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">{\u00b6 52} The 1792 Act was repealed in 1795, id. at 255, 257, and replaced on October 29, 1799, with \u201cAn ACT regulating the admission and practice of attorneys and counsellors at law.\u201d Id. at 340. The Act of 1799 was considerably more structured and comprehensive than its predecessor and, as Swisher explains, \u201cformed the model for succeeding legislation which was to govern the practice of law completely for the next century and more, and to govern at least some aspects of the practice of law into the second half of the 20th century.\u201d Swisher, at 1.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">{\u00b6 53} The 1799 Act provided that no person shall be permitted to practice as an attorney at law in the territorial courts without having previously obtained a license from the governor, \u201cwhich license * * * shall authorize him * * * to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>demand, take and receive all such fees as are or hereafter may be established for any service which he shall or may do as an attorney at law in said territory.\u201d Act of 1799, Section 1. The Act also entitled the attorney, upon licensure, \u201cto ask for and receive, or prosecute for or recover, all such fees as now are or hereafter may be allowed, by law, for services actually performed in his office, as attorney at law.\u201d Section 4. The Act further provided that every attorney \u201creceiving money for the use of his client, and refusing to pay the same when demanded, may be proceeded against, in a summary way, on motion\u201d and that any money or property received by an unlicensed person \u201cas a fee or compensation for [legal] services rendered * * * may be recovered back, with costs of suit.\u201d Act of 1799, Sections 6 and 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">{\u00b6 54} When the power over the practice of law was found to lie inherently in the judicial branch of government, this court firmly established that no person has a right to practice law, but that the practice of law is an extraordinary privilege bestowed by this court upon one who meets the qualifications for admission and continues to maintain the standard of ethical conduct as prescribed by the rules of the court. See <em>Franko, </em>supra, 168 Ohio St. at 22-24, 5 O.O.2d 282, 151 N.E.2d 17; <em>In re McBride, </em>supra, 164 Ohio St. at 426, 58 O.O. 242, 132 N.E.2d 113; <em>In re Thatcher, </em>supra, 80 Ohio St. at 653-655, 89 N.E. 39. See, also, <em>In re Thatcher </em>(N.D.Ohio 1911), 190 F. 969, 974-975. As one court stated, \u201cThe power to promulgate and enforce rules of conduct is a necessary incident to the power to admit; if that were not true, then the courts would have no control over their own officers, and the practice of the law would cease to be a profession and become purely a competitive enterprise.\u201d <em>In re Dombey </em>(C.P.1954), 68 Ohio Law Abs. 36, 45, 1954 WL 8029.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">{\u00b6 55} Thus, virtually all aspects of the practice of law in general, and remuneration in particular, have always been considered to lie within the regulatory jurisdiction of the granting or admitting authority and to be distinct from other types of contractual arrangements. In fact, Shimko objects only to subsection B of DR 2-107. He does not deny this court\u2019s power to promulgate DR 2-107(A); that is, he does not dispute that the court has sole authority to determine whether and under what circumstances lawyers may properly divide fees with other lawyers in the first instance. But since this court has the inherent power to create or deny that right to its officers, it may provide for a procedure of enforcement that does not include a jury trial. See, e.g., <em>Hoops v. United Tel. Co. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 97, 100, 553 N.E.2d 252. See, also, <em>Pleasant, </em>supra, 167 Ohio St. at 335, 4 O.O.2d 433,148 N.E.2d 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">{\u00b6 56} In any event, even if we agreed with Shimko that DR 2~107(B) must be subjected to \u201cthe highest level of judicial scrutiny,\u201d we would still conclude that it is supported by \u201ca compelling governmental interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>{\u00b6 57} In <em>Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar </em>(1975), 421 U.S. 773, 792, 95 S.Ct. 2004, 44 L.Ed.2d 572, the United States Supreme Court recognized that \u201cthe States have a compelling interest in the practice of professions within their boundaries, and that as part of their power to protect the public health, safety, and other valid interests they have broad power to establish standards for licensing practitioners and regulating the practice of professions. * * * The interest of the States in regulating lawyers is especially great since lawyers are essential to the primary governmental function of administering justice, and have historically been \u2018officers of the courts.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">{\u00b6 58} In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Gardner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, this court held that the Free Speech Clause of the Ohio Constitution, Section II, Article I, although broader than the federal Constitution in protecting certain false statements, does not forbid the imposition of discipline on an attorney for violating DR 8-102(B) by falsely accusing an appellate panel of judicial impropriety during a pending court proceeding. In that case, the court adopted an objective standard to determine whether a lawyer\u2019s statement about a judicial officer was made with knowledge or reckless disregard of its falsity, rather than the subjective \u201cactual malice\u201d standard applicable in defamation cases under <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan </em>(1964), 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686. In so doing, we explained that DR 8-102(B) is designed \u201cto preserve public confidence in the fairness and impartiality of our system \u25a0 of justice\u201d and specifically concluded that <em>\u201cthe state\u2019s compelling interest in preserving public confidence in the judiciary </em>supports applying a standard in disciplinary proceedings different from that applicable in defamation cases.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, at \u00b6 29 and 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">{\u00b6 59} DR 2-107(B) is also designed to preserve public confidence in our system of justice. As stated above, the rule is one of various Disciplinary Rules designed to allow for remuneration of legal services without compromising the integrity of the legal profession. But its goal is not to hide from the public that fee disputes do occasionally arise between lawyers. Public confidence in the judicial system is not enhanced by withholding the truth. Nor are fee disputes between lawyers a source of embarrassment for the profession, as honest and legitimate disputes over division of fees arise in any profession or service industry that charges fees. However, when the judicial machinery is used to resolve a simple fee dispute between lawyers, and when clients, perhaps exhausted by litigation, are once again summoned to court in a public battle between their attorneys, compelled to publicly reveal the terms of their fee arrangement and other secrets and confidences, then this court\u2019s failure to remedy that situation with a dignified and expedient dispute-resolution mechanism would directly reflect upon its ability to control the conduct of its officers, and the public confidence in the judiciary would most assuredly be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>{\u00b6 60} Contrary to Shimko\u2019s assertions (and to those of appellees and the court of appeals), identification .and appraisal of the goals of DR 2-107(B) are not evidentiary questions. It is axiomatic that the constitutionality of administrative rules and regulations is a question of law. Otherwise, the facial validity of any particular rule \u201ccould be decided differently from case to case depending on the testimony of expert witnesses. A particular [rule] might then be found [invalid] in one ease only to be applied in another pursuant to differing panels of experts.\u201d <em>Pinchot v. Charter One Bank F.S.B., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 390, 2003-Ohio-4122, 792 N.E.2d 1105, at \u00b6 39 (in considering the legal issue of federal preemption of state statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">{\u00b6 61} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals insofar as it bears on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">CREATION OF UNAUTHORIZED TRIBUNALS</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">{\u00b6 62} It is somewhat difficult to decipher and fairly characterize Shimko\u2019s arguments in support of his second proposition of law. He seems to argue in the first instance that a bar association has no authority under DR 2-107(B) to \u201corder\u201d an attorney to arbitrate a fee dispute \u201cbefore a body created by the bar association.\u201d Shimko describes this \u201cbody\u201d as \u201ca separate tribunal in the form of the arbitration panel of a local bar association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">{\u00b6 63} The CBA, however, did not order Shimko to arbitrate his fee dispute with Lobe; the \u201corder\u201d (or requirement) to arbitrate emanates from DR 2-107(B). The CBA has merely accepted jurisdiction of a dispute that arose under the rule. Moreover, we fail to understand how the arbitration panel that will eventually be selected to determine the dispute between Shimko and Lobe constitutes an entity distinct from the CBA, since that panel will consist of members of the bar (and particularly members of the CBA). In any event, providing the arbitral machinery for determining a fee dispute between attorneys from different firms is precisely what DR 2-107(B) authorizes the CBA to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">{\u00b6 64} Shimko also argues that \u201cDR 2-107(B) is an unreasonable restriction on the right to a trial by jury because the Supreme Court of Ohio does not have the authority to create a tribunal for the purpose of exercising judicial power to hear and determine actions such as the dispute between Mr. Shimko and Mr. Lobe.\u201d Shimko then cites <em>State ex rel. Ramey v. Davis </em>(1929), 119 Ohio St. 596, 165 N.E. 298, paragraph three of the syllabus, and <em>S. Euclid v. Jemison </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 157, 163, 28 OBR 250, 503 N.E.2d 136, for the proposition that \u201conly the General Assembly may create courts inferior to the Courts of Appeals of this State and determine their subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b189-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Timothy A. Shimko &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A., Timothy A. Shimko and David A. Welling, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A03q\">Jones Day, Fordham E. Huffman and J. Todd Kennard, for appellee Cleveland Bar Association.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ank\">Eugene P. Whetzel, for appellee Ohio State Bar Association.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">{\u00b6 65} However, <em>Ramey </em>and <em>Jemison </em>have nothing whatsoever to do with arbitration or rules of court, and DR 2-107(B) does not create courts or any other tribunal. The \u201cjudicial\u201d power that is being exercised under DR 2 \u2014 107(B) is administrative, not adjudicative. The rule does not create any adjudicative body but instead requires officers of the court to arbitrate their fee disputes. Thus, we agree with the court of appeals that Shimko\u2019s obligation as a practicing Ohio lawyer to abide by the Code of Professional Responsibility \u201cgives the mediators or arbitrators their authority to resolve the fee disputes.\u201d 152 Ohio App.3d 742, 2003-Ohio-2200, 790 N.E.2d 335, \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">{\u00b6 66} The judgment of the court of appeals is, therefore, affirmed as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">{\u00b6 67} Based on the foregoing, we hold that DR 2 \u2014 107(B) does not infringe upon the right of trial by jury as guaranteed by Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">{\u00b6 68} Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b189-12\">Moyer, C.J., F.E.
