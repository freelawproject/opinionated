Witt of Cincinnati, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0066274, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1996. On February 10, 2003, relator, Cincinnati Bar Association, charged respondent with professional misconduct, mainly violations of DR 9-102(A) (requiring attorneys to deposit unearned fees in a separate, identifiable bank account) and 9-102(B)(3) (requiring an attorney to properly account for client\u2019s funds in attorney\u2019s possession). A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the cause and, based on the parties\u2019 comprehensive stipulations and exhibits and respondent\u2019s testimony, made findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Respondent is a sole practitioner who has worked almost entirely in criminal defense. In March 2001, Karen Sykes asked respondent to see that Maple Knoll Village, a retirement and nursing home where her mother, Barbara, was a resident, transferred Barbara from its nursing home to its assisted-living unit. Respondent decided to accept Barbara as a client.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">{\u00b6 3} Respondent always charged his criminal-defense clients a flat fee. But in this civil matter, respondent, Karen, and Barbara orally agreed to an hourly fee of $250, and respondent was ultimately paid $10,000. Respondent deposited these funds as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">{\u00b6 4} 1. On March 6, 2001, Karen paid respondent $2,000 on her mother\u2019s behalf, and he deposited this sum in his trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-16\">{\u00b6 5} 2. On March 21, 2001, after respondent had performed 11 hours of work, entitling him to $2,750 in fees, Karen paid him $3,000. Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>deposited this amount in his business operating account, thereby failing to deposit the unearned $2,250 in the trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">{\u00b6 6} 3. On May 25, 2001, after respondent had performed just over 19 more hours of work entitling him to an additional $4,750 fee, Karen paid respondent $5,000. With the $2,250 advanced on March 21, respondent had earned only $2,500 of the May 25th payment of $5,000. Notwithstanding this, respondent still deposited the entire $5,000 check in his business operating account.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">{\u00b6 7} Respondent testified that the case was difficult and time-consuming because of Karen\u2019s involvement. According to respondent, Karen\u2019s behavior was frequently demanding and unpredictable. He said that on two occasions, Karen had to be escorted from the grounds of Maple Knoll because of her angry exchanges with Maple Knoll personnel and that Karen was later barred from the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">{\u00b6 8} Karen also called respondent often and at all hours, repeatedly ordering him to file meritless suits against Maple Knoll. Respondent resisted these requests because Barbara had advised him that she did not want to leave Maple Knoll. At the hearing, respondent related that he was the sixth in the series of attorneys who had been retained for Barbara\u2019s mother. Eventually, he also became the eighth attorney, after having been fired and rehired.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">{\u00b6 9} After many meetings with Maple Knoll doctors and administrators, respondent gained permission to have Barbara moved into assisted living. Just prior to the transfer, however, Karen moved her mother to a different facility, where Barbara died.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">{\u00b6 10} After firing respondent for the second time, Karen appeared at his office to retrieve her mother\u2019s file. Respondent testified that his secretary felt threatened and in his absence gave the file to Karen without first making a copy. Karen thereafter sent a letter requesting an itemized bill and a refund of any unearned portion of the $10,000 fee. Respondent claimed that because the records of the time he had spent on the case were in the case file, he was unable to provide the itemized bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">{\u00b6 11} To respond to the alleged ethics violations, however, respondent reconstructed the time records to the best of his ability from his day planner and other sources and estimated that he had provided legal services worth $13,250. His estimates confirm that at the time the last two payments were received and deposited, respondent had not earned those fees in full. Nor did respondent ever account to Barbara for paying himself the fees he had received on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">{\u00b6 12} During the investigation of this case, relator subpoenaed respondent\u2019s trust-account and operating-account records. The records revealed that respondent frequently made cash withdrawals from his trust account, using an automat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ic teller machine and by writing counter checks to cash. Respondent acknowledged that he kept money in the trust account as a reserve in case of a fee dispute for which he needed to make a refund, apparently having deposited these sums from the flat fees he received in criminal cases. Respondent thus conceded that he had made the identified withdrawals but told the panel that he considered the funds in the trust account his money. Respondent further stipulated to having \u201cfailed to keep contemporaneous accounts/records in order to be able to determine which funds being withdrawn from his [trust] account [were] to be debited [from] any one client\u2019s trust account deposits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent explained that in charging a flat fee, he always informed his clients by way of his new-client information sheet that \u201cattorney fees are deemed earned upon receipt.\u201d Respondent claimed that this arrangement had been recommended at a continuing legal education seminar. Respondent also testified that he kept time records inside the file for every case so that he could account for his time in a fee dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 14} Because a trust account may contain only client funds, funds belonging to both the client and the attorney, and funds sufficient to pay bank charges, the panel found by clear and convincing evidence that respondent had violated DR 9-102(A). Specifically, respondent had placed two payments directly into his operating account rather than withdrawing those amounts from his trust account as earned. Second, respondent used the trust account as a fund from which to resolve fee disputes and considered the trust-account money his own. The panel further found that respondent had violated DR 9-102(B)(3) because he had not properly identified the funds in his trust account and often made cash withdrawals from that account without appropriate record keeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">{\u00b6 15} Relator did not charge a violation of DR 2-106(A) (prohibiting an attorney from collecting an excessive fee), and the panel did not find this misconduct; however, the panel was still troubled by respondent\u2019s practice of informing clients that his fees were earned upon receipt. This practice implied that respondent\u2019s fees were nonrefundable, a practice contrary to <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Klos </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 486, 489, 692 N.E.2d 565, and the rule that on discharge or withdrawal, an attorney is entitled to be paid \u201conly for the services rendered and related expenses,\u201d not a \u201cwindfall.\u201d Fees received in a civil case must be held in trust until earned. And as the board observed, a flat fee received in a criminal case may be deposited directly into the attorney\u2019s operating account, but provisions must be made for refunding all or part of the fee in the event of a discharge or withdrawal so that the attorney\u2019s fee is not excessive. See Bd. of Commrs. on Grievances and Discipline Advisory Opinion No. 96-4 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">{\u00b6 16} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the panel considered the aggravating and mitigating features of respondent\u2019s case. See Section 10 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. The panel found that respondent had no prior disciplinary record, was cooperative in the disciplinary process, and has no mental disability or chemical dependency. Moreover, as the parties agreed that respondent\u2019s misconduct involved poor accounting practices only, the panel did not find that his misconduct had resulted from self-interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">{\u00b6 17} Respondent proved his determination to avoid bookkeeping problems in the future. To improve his office accounting system, he has hired a certified public accountant (\u201cCPA\u201d) to handle his financial affairs, implemented the system that his CPA recommended for tracking client funds, and canceled the ATM card for his trust account. He has since placed only client funds, most of which he holds in trust in order for his clients to make any ordered restitution, in his trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">{\u00b6 18} The panel thus found that respondent sincerely intends to remedy his situation and to avoid further embarrassment and disgrace. Finally, the panel found that although his client was elderly, disabled, and particularly vulnerable, there was inadequate proof that she had sustained any harm as a result of respondent\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">{\u00b6 19} The panel recommended, consistent with the parties\u2019 suggested sanction, that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months but that the entire suspension be stayed on the following conditions: (1) respondent must continue to consult with an accountant to improve his accounting practices and system for tracking client funds and (2) respondent\u2019s practice must be monitored for a period of one year by an attorney, appointed by relator, who is experienced in properly handling the funds of both criminal defense and civil causes of action. The panel further recommended that Karen\u2019s claim be referred to relator\u2019s committee on fee disputes for further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">{\u00b6 20} The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct but recommend a six-month actual suspension, finding that given the particular vulnerability of the client and her daughter, respondent had acted in his own interests and \u201cdisregarded his duties to his client and profession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">{\u00b6 21} Upon review, we agree that respondent violated DR 9-102(A) and 9-102(B)(3), as found by the board. We reject, however, the board\u2019s rationale for imposing a six-month actual suspension. Relator has provided no evidence of specific harm to respondent\u2019s client, whom he served with some success under trying circumstances. And if the amount of respondent\u2019s fee is in controversy, that issue may be submitted, as the panel recommended, to relator\u2019s fee-dispute committee for resolution.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b554-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>James F. Brockman, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Arn\">Clayton G. Napier, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">{\u00b6 22} Because of these considerations and the mitigating features, we find this case most comparable to <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Trainor, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 318, 2003-Ohio-3634, 791 N.E.2d 972, in which another attorney violated DR 9-102(A) and (B) by losing track of disbursements from the proceeds from a client\u2019s settlement. That attorney\u2019s poor accounting and management skills, which resulted in overpayments to the client of $12,000, were obviously not motivated by greed. His misconduct thus warranted only a stayed six-month suspension. Similarly, the evidence of this respondent\u2019s misconduct suggests that he acted by mistake, not selfishness.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">{\u00b6 23} Accordingly, respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months; however, the entire suspension period is stayed on the conditions that (1) respondent continue to consult with an accountant to improve his accounting practices and system for tracking client funds and (2) respondent\u2019s practice be monitored for a period of one year by an attorney, appointed by relator, who is experienced in properly handling the funds from both criminal defense and civil causes of action. If respondent violates either condition of the stay, the stay will be lifted, and respondent will serve the entire six-month suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b554-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
