Williams, was tried by jury, convicted of aggravated murder with a rape-murder capital specification, and sentenced to death. He appealed the judgment to this court as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">{\u00b6 2} On September 3, 2003, we affirmed Williams\u2019s convictions but found reversible error in the penalty phase of his trial. See <em>State v. Williams, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 493, 2003-Ohio-4396, 794 N.E.2d 27. Accordingly, we vacated Williams\u2019s death sentence and remanded the cause to the trial court for resentencing pursuant to current R.C. 2929.06, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b228-16\">{\u00b6 3} \u201c(B) If the sentence of death that is imposed upon an offender is vacated upon appeal because of error that occurred in the sentencing phase of the trial and if division (A) of this section does not apply, the trial court * * * shall conduct a new hearing to resentence the offender. If the offender was tried by a jury, the trial court shall impanel a new jury for the hearing. * * * At the hearing, the court shall follow the procedure set forth in [R.C. 2929.03(D) ] in determining whether to impose upon the offender a sentence of death, life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>imprisonment without parole, life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving twenty-five full years of imprisonment, or life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving thirty full years of imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">{\u00b6 4} At the time Williams raped and murdered Gregory, however, this version of R.C. 2929.06 was not yet in effect, and the then current version did not permit impaneling a new jury to reconsider imposing a death sentence after the original death sentence was vacated for penalty-phase error. See 146 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7820; <em>State v. Penix </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 369, 513 N.E.2d 744. Williams moved this court for reconsideration, arguing that current R.C. 2929.06 is inapplicable because he committed his crime before the statute\u2019s October 16,1996 amendment permitting the impaneling of a new jury and the reimposition of the death sentence. See 146 Ohio Laws, Part VI, 10548, adding subsection R.C. 2929.06(A)(2), now (B). Moreover, he asserted that the prior version of R.C. 2929.06 controls, and thus he cannot be resentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">{\u00b6 5} On December 8, 2003, we granted Williams\u2019s motion for reconsideration and ordered briefing on the following question: \u201cFollowing remand and a new penalty hearing, may a sentence of death be imposed upon the appellant under the current version of R.C. 2929.06, or does the version of R.C. 2929.06 in effect at the time of the offense, which would preclude a death sentence, apply upon remand of this case?\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1525, 2003-Ohio-6510, 800 N.E.2d 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">{\u00b6 6} We now hold that current R.C. 2929.06 does not apply retroactively, and therefore the version of R.C. 2929.06 in effect at the time of Williams\u2019s offenses applies upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">{\u00b6 7} A statute is retroactive if it penalizes conduct that occurred before its enactment. Retroactivity is unconstitutional if it \u201c \u2018takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past.\u2019 \u201d <em>Van Fossen v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 100, 106, 522 N.E.2d 489, quoting <em>Cincinnati v. Seasongood </em>(1889), 46 Ohio St. 296, 303, 21 N.E. 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 1.48 provides: \u201cA statute is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless expressly made retrospective.\u201d Thus, a statute may not be applied retroactively unless the court finds a \u201cclearly expressed legislative intent\u201d that the statute so apply. <em>State v. Cook </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 404, 410, 700 N.E.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">{\u00b6 9} Because the Revised Code is silent as to whether current R.C. 2929.06(B) applies retroactively, it applies only prospectively. Therefore, current R.C. 2929.06 is inapplicable for resentencing an offender whose offenses occurred prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>to the statute\u2019s effective date of October 16,1996. Rather, the law in effect at the time of the offenses applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">{\u00b6 10} Nonetheless, amicus curiae the Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney invites us to overrule <em>Penix, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 369, 513 N.E.2d 744, and hold that former R.C. 2929.06 would permit imposition of the death penalty upon remand. We decline.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">{\u00b6 11} We recently held that a prior decision may be properly overruled \u201cwhere (1) the decision was wrongly decided at that time, or changes in circumstances no longer justify continued adherence to the decision, (2) the decision defies practical workability, and (3) abandoning the precedent would not create an undue hardship for those who have relied upon it.\u201d <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, paragraph one of the syllabus. In light of this standard, we conclude that <em>Penix </em>cannot be properly overruled because, counter to amicus\u2019s arguments, it was not improperly decided and it does not defy practical workability.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">{\u00b6 12} To support its argument that <em>Penix </em>was improperly decided, amicus cites <em>Mast v. Doctor\u2019s Hosp. North </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 539, 75 O.O.2d 556, 350 N.E.2d 429, in which we interpreted App.R. 12(D) to permit \u201cretrial of only those issues, claims or defenses the original trial of which resulted in prejudicial error, and to allow issues tried free from error to stand.\u201d Id. at 541, 75 O.O.2d 556, 350 N.E.2d 429. Unlike <em>Penix, </em>however, <em>Mast </em>did not involve a statute that specifically required the acquiescence of a trial jury in order to impose particular consequences on the defendant. Therefore, we reject amicus\u2019s argument that reimposition of a death sentence on remand is authorized by App.R. 12(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">{\u00b6 13} Amicus also asserts that <em>Penix </em>was wrongly decided because R.C. 2953.07(A) permits an appellate court to reverse a criminal judgment in part and to remand for the sole purpose of correcting an improperly imposed sentence. <em>Penix, </em>however, does not contradict R.C. 2953.07. Rather, <em>Penix </em>states that, in a capital case tried by jury, correction of the sentence on remand may not be accomplished by impaneling a new jury with the power to impose a new death sentence, because R.C. 2929.03 reserves that power to the trial jury. Id., 32 Ohio St.3d at 372, 513 N.E.2d 744. Therefore, we reject amicus\u2019s argument that reimposition of the death penalty on remand is authorized by R.C. 2953.07(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">{\u00b6 14} Even were we persuaded that the <em>Penix </em>rule is unsound, the decision does not defy practical workability. <em>Penix </em>has created no confusion in the courts of Ohio, we fully explained our rationale, and it did not depart from precedent. Cf. <em>Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at \u00b651. Neither has <em>Penix </em>spawned a complex body of law characterized by \u201ca patchwork of exceptions and limitations.\u201d <em>Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at \u00b6 57. Its application is straightforward and its scope is clear: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>reimposition of the death penalty on remand is precluded in capital cases in which the defendant\u2019s aggravated-murder conviction has been affirmed, but the death sentence has been vacated on the ground of penalty-phase error. This simple rule applies to all cases in which the capital crime was committed before October 16, 1996, the effective date of the amendment to R.C. 2929.06 that permitted the death sentence to be reimposed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">{\u00b6 15} We reaffirm <em>Penix, </em>and we hold that current R.C. 2929.06(B) may be applied prospectively only. Further, we remand this cause to the trial court for resentencing pursuant to the law that existed at the time of Williams\u2019s offenses. Accordingly, on remand the trial court shall, pursuant to former R.C. 2929.06(B), conduct a new sentencing hearing and choose from the life-sentencing options available in December 1995: life with parole eligibility after 20 full years or life with parole eligibility after 30 full years.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-6\">Moyer, C.J., F.E.

Therefore, I concur in judgment only and do not join in the syllabus paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">{\u00b6 17} My perception of the issue raised by this case starts with the view that the syllabus of <em>State v. Penix </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 369, 513 N.E.2d 744, was wrongly decided. I find persuasive the dissenting opinion of Justice Robert Holmes in <em>Penix, </em>who reasoned that neither R.C. 2929.03 nor 2929.06, as they then existed, prohibited the state from seeking the death penalty upon remand when the original death sentence was vacated due to penalty-phase error. See id. at 375-379, 513 N.E.2d 744 (Holmes, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">{\u00b6 18} Current R.C. 2929.06(B), effective October 16, 1996, as amended, now explicitly reflects the position of Justice Holmes that the death penalty should be available in this situation. See 1996 Sub.S.B. No. 258, 146 Ohio Laws, Part VI, 10539, 10548, 10554. In amending the statute, the General Assembly did not specify that it was to operate retroactively. Neither did the General Assembly choose to specifically address the effect the amended statute had on <em>Penix, </em>although the holding of <em>Penix </em>was clearly abrogated.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Like the majority, I find that the General Assembly\u2019s failure to specify within current R.C. 2929.06(B) that the statute operates retroactively leads to a presumption that the statute is prospective only and that the presumption has not been overcome in this case. Unlike the majority, however, because I agree with Justice Holmes in his dissent that <em>Penix </em>is an inaccurate interpretation of prior law, I believe that a statutory amendment was not necessary to subject Williams to the death penalty on remand. In different circumstances, I would support the overruling of <em>Penix </em>and its syllabus, and would therefore dissent from the majority\u2019s holding, finding that Williams should be eligible to receive a death sentence on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">{\u00b6 20} My chief reasons for not advocating the overruling of <em>Penix </em>involve two different passages of time. <em>Penix </em>was decided in 1987 and continued to be fully valid until the General Assembly enacted current R.C. 2929.06(B) in 1996. If the General Assembly felt that <em>Penix </em>was wrongly decided, it could have acted more quickly than that to do away with it, instead of allowing the decision to control on the issue for approximately nine years. Also, it would seem that if the General Assembly disagreed with the <em>Penix </em>court\u2019s interpretation of prior law, it could have specified so somewhere within 1996 Sub.S.B. No. 258, as it has commented on past decisions of this court within other bills that have been reviewed by this court. The failure to comment on <em>Penix, </em>considered along with the failure to explicitly make current R.C. 2929.06(B) retroactive, could easily be viewed as acquiescence by the General Assembly in its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">{\u00b6 21} The second passage of time that affects my view of whether <em>Penix </em>should be overruled involves the almost eight years that have passed from the 1996 amendment of R.C. 2929.06 until the issue now comes before us in this case. It is apparent that R.C. 2929.06(B)\u2019s reach is limited to a small number of cases, and for that reason it is not surprising that it has taken this long for the issue to be raised, especially given that death-penalty cases frequently progress at a very deliberate pace. See <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 218 (Resnick, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Nevertheless, when these two time periods are added together, <em>Penix </em>has ostensibly survived for almost 17 years to apply to death-penalty cases in which the capital offense occurred prior to October 16, 1996. I am loath to overrule settled law that has continued unquestioned for this length of time and that applies to such a limited number of cases, even if I believe that it was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">{\u00b6 22} Because, like the majority, I conclude that <em>Penix </em>should not be overruled and so controls, I agree with the majority that on remand the trial court must choose from the sentencing options available when Williams committed his capital offense, in December 1995. Life imprisonment without parole and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>life imprisonment with parole eligibility after 25 full years were not available as sentences for a capital case until R.C. 2929.03 was amended, effective July 1, 1996 (1995 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 2, 146 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7136, 7454-7456, 7810, and 1996 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 269, 146 Ohio Laws, Part VI, 10752, 10926-10927, 11099), and so appellant is not eligible to receive either of those sentences. See <em>Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 220 (Resnick, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), citing <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 399, 721 N.E.2d 52, and <em>State v. Raglin </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 253, 259-260, 699 N.E.2d 482.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b233-9\">Julia R.

Davis, for amicus curiae American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio Foundation, Inc.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">{\u00b6 23} Since the death penalty <em>was </em>a sentencing option at the time Williams committed his capital offense, <em>Madrigal </em>and <em>Raglin </em>do not themselves prevent its imposition on remand in this case. For that reason, if the General Assembly had expressly made current R.C. 2929.06(B) retroactive, those decisions would play no role in our inquiry into the constitutionality of the statute\u2019s application to Williams. Williams\u2019s arguments in this regard, premised on this court\u2019s possible acceptance of the state\u2019s position that R.C. 2929.06(B) can be applied retroactively, strike me as less than convincing. However, because this court has not accepted the state\u2019s threshold proposition that the statute can be applied retroactively, there is no occasion to consider whether retroactive application would offend constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">{\u00b6 24} For all the foregoing reasons, I concur in judgment only.</p>\n<judges id=\"b233-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>David C.
