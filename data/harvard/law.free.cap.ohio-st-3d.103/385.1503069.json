In this case, because we find that the accused essentially proceeded pro se, without being sufficiently warned of the dangers of self-representation and without properly waiving his right to counsel, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">{\u00b6 2} In 2001, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury returned a ten-count indictment against defendant-appellee, Kyle Martin, charging him with attempted aggravated murder, kidnapping, three counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder, two counts of tampering with evidence, obstructing justice, complicity to commit aggravated murder, and tampering with records. Due to Martin\u2019s indigency, the trial court appointed counsel, David L. Grant. About six weeks later at a pretrial conference, Grant withdrew due to irreconcilable differences with Martin and scheduling problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">{\u00b6 3} At a hearing on Grant\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel, Martin indicated that he had filed \u201cmotions for respective counsel and co-counsel.\u201d When asked to clarify the meaning of the motion, Martin stated, \u201cI filed a motion for co-counsel whereas I can do part of my representation on my own with the assistance of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>{\u00b6 4} \u201cTHE COURT: Are you making a request to represent yourself?</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Co-counsel, with the assistance of\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cTHE COURT: If you want to represent yourself, you can.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I want to be a part of that defense. I don\u2019t want to be assigned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">{\u00b6 8} The court responded that it was going to appoint a public defender to represent Martin and granted David Grant\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">{\u00b6 9} At a later hearing regarding speedy trial issues, the trial court inquired of the two public defenders what discussions had taken place with Martin regarding his legal representation. Counsel Darin Thompson stated that it was his understanding that Martin would \u201cactively participate at least to the extent of co-counsel if not taking over the matter himself.\u201d The court then asked Martin, \u201cIs it your intention, Mr. Martin, then to act as your own lawyer?\u201d Martin responded, \u201cNo, it is not, but that\u2019s my intention to participate as to doing all that I can to protect my rights as a citizen. My Constitutional rights and to every right that I have. Okay, that is what I\u2019m doing. I want to make sure that I am assured a fair trial. I want to make sure that motions, defense motions, proper defense motions are filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cI don\u2019t want to go in there pretending that I\u2019m Perry Mason and I\u2019m not. I do need the support. I\u2019m not all-knowing with the law but I do know enough to know what kind of motion I want to file and what kind of motion does what, and I\u2019m familiar \u2014 I will just say that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">{\u00b6 12} After counsel indicated that he found the situation to be awkward because he would not be in control of the case, the trial court told Martin, \u201cYou\u2019re putting these lawyers in a position where it doesn\u2019t appear that you\u2019re going to listen to them. If they suggest to you that, for example, a motion be withdrawn, or that a motion isn\u2019t appropriate, whether the motion might raise some issues that, you know, for tactical or strategic reasons are not to be raised in the ease. So it sounds like you want to be your own attorney, sir?\u201d Martin replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court noted, \u201cIt is awkward to have both the lawyer and the client filing motions, arguing. It\u2019s just very difficult to do, and I think it creates all kinds of ethical issues for lawyers, some of which Mr. Grant indicated arose during his representation, although he didn\u2019t discuss them with me.\u201d Ultimately, the court reserved judgment on the representation issue until another pretrial conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">{\u00b6 14} At the next pretrial conference, when asked about the nature of the representation and the relationship between counsel and Martin, counsel stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u201c[Martin] does wish to maintain a great deal of control as to the direction of the defense, that is, the defendant does himself. We have talked about what our role would be, what we perceive. We come [sic] to some loggerheads as to whether or not we would proceed as I may advise him, and he has maintained consistently that he wants to run the show basically.\u201d The trial court asked Martin, \u201c[I]s that pretty accurate?\u201d Martin replied, \u201cNo, it is not. * * * I have never made it known I want to run the show. I would like some control what\u2019s going on being I have more information involving the case then [sic] any other parties involved in the case. I\u2019ve made several suggestions which were shot down by defense by way of an evidentiary hearing. I asked for a suppression hearing. I asked for an evidentiary hearing. I asked for several different avenues of defense which were totally shot down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 15} The trial court stated: \u2018Well, it sounds like you have disagreements and you want to run the case in a particular fashion and they\u2019re not agreeing with you on that and so you have a right to represent yourself, and in fact that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going to permit you to represent yourself. Now I\u2019ll let counsel sit with you during the proceedings, and when you need their advice, you ask them for their advice but you\u2019re going to run your own defense because that\u2019s apparently what you\u2019re doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cI find that you are a competent individual. You are articulate. You\u2019re able to address different aspects of this case. I would caution you against abandoning your lawyers but that\u2019s your choice. You will be free to represent yourself in this case. What I\u2019m not going to have is your lawyers saying one thing and you saying another. That\u2019s not going to be helpful for the process and it certainly won\u2019t be helpful in the conduct of your trial in front of a jury, so you can be your own lawyer and do whatever you think is appropriate in representing yourself.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cNow having said that I\u2019m going to treat you like a lawyer. That is, I\u2019m not going to give you any greater leeway because you\u2019re representing yourself then [sic] I would to a lawyer. If you make an objection and it\u2019s inappropriate, it will be overruled. If you file something that\u2019s inappropriate, I\u2019ll deal with it in that way. You\u2019ll have counsel with you during trial and during the balance of the proceedings. If you ask them for advice on an issue, they can give it to you, but they may make suggestions to you if they\u2019d like but the fact of the matter is you\u2019re going to represent yourself which is apparently what you want to do although you don\u2019t want to say it. That\u2019s apparently what you want to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 18} Martin never signed a written waiver of his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 19} Prior to trial, the state dismissed the charges of tampering with evidence and tampering with records. In addition, the charge of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder was dismissed at the close of the state\u2019s case. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>trial, Martin made his own opening and closing statements. He himself conducted all examination and cross-examination of witnesses (other than himself). He filed a successful motion to dismiss the count of conspiracy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 20} The jury returned a verdict of not guilty of attempted aggravated murder, not guilty of the lesser included offense of attempted murder, and guilty of kidnapping. On appeal, the Eighth District Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded for retrial. The court held that Martin was inadequately advised about the perils of self-representation and that he was not advised at all about the charges he faced, the potential penalties, or his available defenses. In addition, the court held that the absence of a written waiver compelled reversal, especially considering that Martin never really made an affirmative choice to represent himself but rather chose what he thought to be the lesser of two evils in representing himself. A motion for stay of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment was granted pending the outcome of this case. <em>State v. Martin, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1468, 2003-Ohio-5772, 798 N.E.2d 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 21} This cause is now before us upon our acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Self-Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 22} The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall * * * have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d Similarly, the Ohio Constitution provides: \u201cIn any trial, in any court, the party accused shall be allowed to appear and defend in person and with counsel.\u201d Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">{\u00b6 23} But the United States Supreme Court has also recognized that the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel implicitly embodies a \u201ccorrelative right to dispense with a lawyer\u2019s help.\u201d <em>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann </em>(1942), 317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268. The court clarified this right to proceed without counsel in the landmark case of <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 806, \u00a75 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562. \u201cAlthough not stated in the Amendment in so many words, the right to self-representation \u2014 to make one\u2019s own defense personally \u2014 is thus necessarily implied by the structure of the Amendment. The right to defend is given directly to the accused; for it is he who suffers the consequences if the defense fails.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Id. at 819-820, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">{\u00b6 24} This court, too, has concluded that \u201ca defendant in a state criminal trial has an independent constitutional right of self-representation and * * * may proceed to defend himself without counsel when he voluntarily, and knowingly and intelligently elects to do so.\u201d <em>State v. Gibson </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 74 O.O.2d 525, 345 N.E.2d 399, paragraph one of the syllabus, citing <em>Faretta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Crim.R. 44 governs the procedure for waiver of counsel in \u201cserious offense\u201d cases. It provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(A) Where a defendant charged with a serious offense is unable to obtain counsel, counsel shall be assigned to represent him * * *, unless the defendant, after being fully advised of his right to assigned counsel, knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waives his right to counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 27} Crim.R. 44(C) further provides that in \u201cserious offense\u201d cases, the waiver must be in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">{\u00b6 28} Once the right to counsel is properly waived, trial courts are permitted to appoint standby counsel to assist the otherwise pro se defendant. The U.S. Supreme Court first illustrated the idea of \u201cstandby counsel,\u201d in a footnote in <em>Faretta v. </em>California: \u201cOf course, a State may \u2014 even over objection by the accused \u2014 appoint a \u2018standby counsel\u2019 to aid the accused if and when the accused requests help, and to be available to represent the accused in the event that termination of the defendant\u2019s self-representation is necessary.\u201d <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 834, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, fn. 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Hybrid Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">{\u00b629} As a threshold matter, we must first determine what form of legal representation Martin received. The state contends that Martin\u2019s actions indicate that he was requesting a hybrid form of representation. Moreover, the state argues that hybrid representation is what Martin received. Hybrid representation differs from standby representation in that the defendant and counsel act as co-counsel, sharing responsibilities in preparing and conducting trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">{\u00b6 30} Martin asked to be \u201cco-counsel\u201d on the case, to be \u201cpart of that defense,\u201d \u201cto make sure that * * * proper defense motions are filed,\u201d and to have \u201csome control [over] what\u2019s going on.\u201d After many discussions in which Martin denied that he wanted to proceed pro se, the trial court, against Martin\u2019s wishes, stated, \u201c[Yjou\u2019re going to represent yourself.\u201d The court, in essence, denied his request to be \u201cco-counsel\u201d and required him to proceed pro se and relegated Martin\u2019s counsel to standby status. Although Martin\u2019s standby counsel stepped in and argued some motions and asked some questions of witnesses on occasion, Martin was required to conduct large portions of the trial pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">{\u00b6 31} This court has held that \u201c[n]either the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution nor case law mandates * * * hybrid representation. See <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 168 [104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122], Although appellant has the right either to appear <em>pro se </em>or to have counsel, he has no corresponding right to act as co-counsel on his own behalf.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 6-7, 514 N.E.2d 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>{\u00b6 32} Today we reaffirm and hold that in Ohio, a criminal defendant has the right to representation by counsel or to proceed pro se with the assistance of standby counsel. However, these two rights are independent of each other and may not be asserted simultaneously. <em>Parren v. State </em>(1987), 309 Md. 260, 269, 523 A.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">{\u00b6 33} Hybrid representation raises several troubling issues. First, situations may arise in a hybrid representation environment where the accused and his \u201cco-counsel\u201d disagree on strategy, which witnesses to call, and other key trial issues. Who is the ultimate decision maker? Hybrid representation poses difficult ethical issues for counsel and management issues for the trial judge when the defendant and his counsel disagree as to how the trial should proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">{\u00b6 34} Even more troubling is the issue of waiver. As the Maryland high court stated in <em>Parren v. State: </em>\u201cThe problems arising from such a concept of hybrid representation are apparent. It could not be ascertained by anyone, including the trial court itself, until after the trial whether the defendant had enjoyed representation by counsel, self-representation or hybrid representation, for \u2018[t]he question is one of degree.\u2019 <em>[Bright v. State </em>(1986), 68 Md.App. 41] at 47, 509 A.2d [1227] at 1230. Neither the court, nor the defendant, nor counsel, nor the prosecutor would know until the record of the trial was examined who was actually responsible for the conduct of the defense and in control of deciding questions and resolving problems as they arose. As Wilner, J., said in his concurring opinion [in <em>Bright]:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c \u2018There is * * * no clear boundary line between hybrid representation and self-representation. Moreover, when, as in this case, a request for some degree of self-representation is made before trial, there is no way that the court ever can know on what side of the murky line the matter will fall. * * * [T]here are a number of factors to be considered, all of which are necessarily considered <em>ex post facto.\u2019 [Bright, </em>68 Md.App.] at 57, 509 A.2d at 1235.\u201d <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. at 269-270, 523 A.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">{\u00b6 36} Thus, in a hybrid situation, it is difficult to ascertain even which parts of a trial have proceeded without counsel and where a waiver, if any, applies. In this case, the trial court, faced with the demands of this particular defendant, determined that Martin\u2019s requests would require him to proceed pro se with the assistance of standby counsel. However, under this ruling, Martin\u2019s representation resembled pro se status but also included some elements of hybrid representation in that the judge allowed counsel some active role.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">{\u00b6 37} However, even more critical to our analysis today is that the trial judge did not adequately warn Martin of the perils of self-representation before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>judge required him to conduct much of his defense with counsel present in the courtroom but not assisting. Martin himself delivered opening and closing statements, questioned the victim and all other witnesses, and filed a motion to dismiss. Because the court of appeals held that Martin was inadequately advised about the risks of self-representation and did not execute a written waiver, essentially proceeding pro se for the bulk of the trial, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for retrial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">{\u00b6 38} In this case, there was no signed waiver of counsel. Crim.R. 44(C) provides: \u201cWaiver of counsel shall be in open court and the advice and waiver shall be recorded * * *. In addition, in serious offense cases the waiver shall be in writing.\u201d While literal compliance with Crim.R. 44(C) is the preferred practice, the written waiver provision of Crim.R. 44 is not a constitutional requirement, and, therefore, we hold that trial courts need demonstrate only substantial compliance. See <em>State v. Nero </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 106, 108, 564 N.E.2d 474 (\u201cLiteral compliance with Crim.R. 11 is certainly the preferred practice, but the fact that the trial judge did not do so does not require vacation of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea if the reviewing court determines that there was substantial compliance\u201d); <em>State v. Stewart </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 86, 93, 5 O.O.3d 52, 364 N.E.2d 1163 (\u201calthough it can validly be argued that the trial court should adhere scrupulously to the provisions of Crim.R. 11(C)(2), * * * there must be some showing of prejudicial effect before a guilty plea may be vacated. * * * The trial court substantially compiled with the requirements in Crim.R. 11, and the failure to personally advise appellant that in entering a plea of guilty to murder he would not be eligible for probation does not rise to the status of prejudicial error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">{\u00b6 39} Accordingly, we reaffirm that in the case of a \u201cserious offense\u201d as defined by Crim.R. 2(C), when a criminal defendant elects to proceed pro se, the trial court must demonstrate substantial compliance with Crim.R. 44(A) by making a sufficient inquiry to determine whether the defendant fully understood and intelligently relinquished his or her right to counsel. <em>Gibson, </em>45 Ohio St.2d 366, 74 O.O.2d 525, 345 N.E.2d 399, paragraph two of the syllabus. If substantial compliance is demonstrated, then the failure to file a written waiver is harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c \u2018To be valid such waiver must be made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 377, 74 O.O.2d 525, 345 N.E.2d 399, quoting <em>Von Moltke v. Gillies </em>(1948), 332 U.S. 708, 723, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>{\u00b6 41} The state contends that Martin waived his right to counsel by filing the motion \u201cfor respective counsel and co-counsel.\u201d However, this was filed before any of the discussions concerning the self-representation issue. Therefore, this pro se motion clearly cannot amount to a waiver of Martin\u2019s right to counsel, and we must consider whether Martin was adequately advised of the perils of self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">{\u00b6 42} Although Martin certainly made statements to the effect that he would like to actively participate in his defense, never did he unequivocally state that he wished to waive his right to counsel. In fact, when the trial court informed him that if he wanted to represent himself he could, Martin responded, \u201cI want to be a part of that defense. I don\u2019t want to be assigned.\u201d When the trial court asked Martin if it was his intention to act as his own lawyer, again Martin responded, \u201cNo, it is not, but that\u2019s my intention to participate as to doing all that I can to protect my rights as a citizen.\u201d Again, after the court informed Martin that he was placing his attorneys in an awkward position, the court asked, \u201cSo, it sounds like you want to be your own attorney, sir?\u201d Martin replied for a third time, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking of the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">{\u00b6 43} The trial court cautioned Martin at times that it would be best if Martin were represented by counsel (\u201cI would caution you against abandoning your lawyers but that\u2019s your choice\u201d). But the court did not adequately explain the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments, possible defenses, mitigation, or other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter, per <em>Von Moltke, </em>332 U.S. at 724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309, and <em>Gibson, </em>45 Ohio St.2d at 377, 74 O.O.2d 525, 345 N. E.2d 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">{\u00b6 44} We therefore conclude that Martin was not \u201cmade aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation\u201d so that the record established that \u201c \u2018he [knew] what he [was] doing and his choice [was] made with eyes open.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, quoting <em>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. at 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268. If the court had properly complied with these requirements and had clearly advised Martin that he had no right to be \u201cco-counsel\u201d and that his only choices were to proceed pro se or with counsel, Martin may have made a different choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">{\u00b6 45} The trial court failed to substantially comply with Crim.R. 44(A) by failing to make a sufficient inquiry to determine whether Martin fully understood and intelligently relinquished his right to counsel. <em>Gibson, </em>45 Ohio St.2d 366, 74 O.O.2d 525, 345 N.E.2d 399, paragraph two of the syllabus. Thus, we hold that Martin did not knowingly and intelligently forgo the benefits of counsel as envisioned by <em>Gibson, Faretta, </em>and Crim.R. 44(A). Accordingly, we affirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>judgment of the court of appeals, remanding the cause for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b510-5\">Resnick, F.E.

I agree with the majority that the trial court did not make a sufficient inquiry to determine whether Martin fully understood and intelligently relinquished his right to counsel as required by both the federal and Ohio Constitutions and Crim.R. 44(A). I do not agree with the majority\u2019s implication that it is possible for a trial court to substantially comply with Crim.R. 44<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in \u201cserious offense\u201d cases where it fails to obtain a waiver of counsel in writing. Rather, Crim.R. 52<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and relevant case law provide the standards for determining whether trial court error requires reversal of a conviction. In my view, determination of whether Martin\u2019s conviction should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial due to noncompliance with Crim.R. 44(C) should be made pursuant to those standards rather than pursuant to a substantial-compliance analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">{\u00b6 47} The majority correctly observes that the written-waiver requirement of Crim.R. 44(C) is not a constitutional requirement. Citing our precedent in <em>State v. Nero </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 106, 108, 564 N.E.2d 474, and <em>State v. Stewart </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 86, 93, 5 O.O.3d 52, 364 N.E.2d 1163, it concludes that \u201ctrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>courts need demonstrate only substantial compliance\u201d with Crim.R. 44. I acknowledge that paragraph two of the syllabus of the majority opinion is consistent with our precedent in <em>Nero </em>and <em>Stewart. </em>Nevertheless, I believe that those cases should be disaffirmed to the extent that they hold that compliance with a Criminal Rule occurred when in fact there was a clear lack of compliance with an express mandatory component of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Determination of the Existence of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">{\u00b6 48} Crim.R. 44(C) is clear. It provides: \u201cWaiver of counsel <em>shall </em>be in open court and the advice and waiver <em>shall </em>be recorded as provided in Rule 22. In addition, in serious offense cases the waiver <em>shall </em>be in writing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This court has consistently held that when a statute or rule uses the word \u201cshall,\u201d the prescription is not advisory; rather, it is mandatory. See <em>State v. Burnside, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, \u00b6 36; <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 324-325, 738 N.E.2d 1178; <em>State v. Golphin </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 543, 545-546, 692 N.E.2d 608. In adopting Crim.R. 44(C), this court chose the word \u201cshall\u201d three times. We should not deem as advisory in nature such a clear mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">{\u00b6 49} The purpose of Crim.R. 44 is to ensure that a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights are protected. Crim.R. 44(A) requires a waiver of the right to counsel to be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. This language reflects the constitutional standard established in <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, that \u201cin order to represent himself, the accused must \u2018knowingly and intelligently\u2019 forgo those relinquished benefits,\u201d quoting <em>Johnson v. Zerbst </em>(1938), 304 U.S. 458, 464-465, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461. Crim.R. 44(C), however, adds a procedural layer of protection by requiring that a waiver be in writing. This is an additional safeguard not mandated by the Constitution. In my view, error occurs if compliance is lacking with either Crim.R. 44(A) or (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">{\u00b6 50} The majority devotes most of its analysis to the consideration whether Martin made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver. That inquiry is relevant to the determination whether the trial court complied with Crim.R. 44(A). Only briefly does the majority mention the undisputed fact that Martin never executed a written waiver as required by Crim.R. 44(C). The majority thereby implies that substantial compliance with Crim.R 44(A) is equivalent to substantial compliance with Crim.R. 44 as a whole. In so doing, the majority implies that trial courts need not do what is expressly required by Crim.R. 44(C) \u2014 obtain a waiver in writing. Left unchallenged, this implication may potentially result in further erosion of the express requirements of the Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Criminal Procedure and ultimately lessen the probability that criminal defendants receive the full protection of constitutional and procedural law. The Rules of Criminal Procedure should not be reduced to mere malleable guidelines. Failure of a trial court to obtain a written waiver in a \u201cserious offense\u201d case is simply noncompliance with Crim.R. 44(C) and constitutes trial-court error.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Determination of Reversibility of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 51} As I have stated, the failure of a trial court to comply with a legal rule should be analyzed according to established error analysis embodied in Crim.R. 52 and relevant case law. As we recently explained in <em>State v. Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, Crim.R. 52 empowers appellate courts to correct trial-court error in two situations. First, if a defendant objected to an error at trial, the appellate court considers, pursuant to Crim.R. 52(A), whether the error was harmless. Under a harmless-error inquiry, the state has the burden of proving that the error did not affect the substantial rights of the defendant. Whether the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were affected depends on whether the error was prejudicial, i.e., whether the error affected the outcome of the trial. Prejudicial error mandates reversal of the trial court. If the state proves that the error was not prejudicial, the error is said to have been harmless, and the appellate court will not correct it. Id. at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 52} When a defendant did not object to an error at trial, the appellate court uses Crim.R. 52(B) to determine whether there was plain error. Id. at \u00b6 14. As we explained in <em>Perry, </em>under Crim.R. 52(B), the defendant has the burden of proof. Id. Correction of plain error involves three questions and, if appropriate, the exercise of discretion by the appellate court. <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240. The defendant must first show that the trial court erred by failing to comply with a legal rule. Id. The defendant then must demonstrate that the error was plain, i.e., obvious. Id. Finally, the defendant must show that the error affected his substantial rights. Id. Even if the defendant establishes that plain error affected his substantial rights, the appellate court need not necessarily reverse the judgment of the trial court. In fact, courts are warned to \u201cnotice plain error \u2018with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">{\u00b6 53} There is also a third category of error, known as structural error. Certain constitutional defects disturb the basic framework within which a trial is conducted and \u201cpermeate \u2018[t]he entire conduct of the trial from beginning to end\u2019 so that the trial cannot \u2018 \u201creliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>of guilt or innocence.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, \u00b6 17, quoting <em>Arizona v. Fulminante </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 279, 309 and 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302, quoting <em>Rose v. Clark </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 570, 577-578, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460. Structural error affects the substantial rights of a criminal defendant, even absent a specific showing that the outcome of the trial would have been different, and requires automatic reversal. Because a defendant is relieved of his burden to show prejudice, the finding of structural error is rare and limited to exceptional cases. <em>Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, \u00b6 18, citing <em>Johnson v. United States </em>(1997), 520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718. Among the types of error that have been held to be structural is a total denial of counsel to a criminal defendant. Id. at 469, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718, citing <em>Gideon v. Wainwright </em>(1963), 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 54} The trial court did not make a sufficient inquiry to determine whether Martin fully understood and intelligently relinquished his right to counsel as required by both the federal and Ohio Constitutions and Crim.R. 44(A). I conclude that this error was structural error and that Martin\u2019s conviction must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 55} The presence and limited involvement of standby counsel does not negate the fact that Martin was forced to conduct much of his own defense and was instructed by the trial court that he was to represent himself. This is not a case where counsel was absent, without a waiver, for only a very limited portion of the trial. The trial court\u2019s noncompliance with Crim.R. 44(A) was an error that permeated the basic framework of Martin\u2019s entire trial. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s noncompliance with Crim.R. 44(A) was structural error. <em>Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">{\u00b6 56} The failure of the trial court to procure a written waiver of Martin\u2019s right to counsel was an obvious deviation from Crim.R. 44(C). Because Martin did not object to noncompliance with Crim.R. 44(C) at trial, however, he forfeited all but plain error. <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 49. In the instant case, because the failure of the trial court to comply with Crim.R. 44(A) was structural error, it is not necessary to determine whether the failure to obtain a written waiver of the right to counsel is plain error, and if so, reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">{\u00b6 57} The trial court failed to obtain a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver, thus materially affecting the integrity of Martin\u2019s trial. Although I am <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>not able to concur in its opinion, I concur in the majority\u2019s judgment affirming the judgment of the court of appeals and remanding the cause for a new trial.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b514-5\">William D.
