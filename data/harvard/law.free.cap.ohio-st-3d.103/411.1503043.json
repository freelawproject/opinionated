On January 30, 2004, the board of elections defeated a motion to rescind the April 24, 1998 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On March 2, 2004, Erie County held a Democratic Party primary election to nominate a candidate for the office of Judge of the Erie County Common Pleas Court for the term commencing January 1, 2005. Appellant, Ann B. Maschari, the incumbent common pleas court judge, and appellee Tygh Mathew Tone were the two candidates for the nomination. On March 26, 2004, the board certified that Tone had defeated Maschari. Tone received 7,022 votes, and Maschari received 6,118 votes. There are no Republican Party candidates for common pleas court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">{\u00b6 3} On April 9, 2004, Maschari filed an election contest under R.C. 3515.08 in the Erie County Court of Appeals to challenge Tone\u2019s nomination as the Democratic Party candidate for common pleas court judge. Maschari alleged that at the primary election, more than 1,400 registered Republican Party voters cast votes in the Democratic Party primary election. Maschari claimed that the policy and practice of the board of elections not to challenge voters\u2019 political affiliation in primary elections constituted an irregularity that affected the outcome or made uncertain the result of the primary election. Maschari requested that the court of appeals either declare her the winner of the primary election or set aside the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">{\u00b6 4} Tone and the board of elections answered Maschari\u2019s complaint. In its amended answer, the board of elections raised several defenses, including waiver and estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>{\u00b6 5} In May 2004, the board of elections moved for summary judgment or judgment on the pleadings. Affidavits filed in support of the board\u2019s motion established that Maschari directly solicited and encouraged Republicans to vote for her in the March 2, 2004 Democratic Party primary election. Maschari did not advise voters that if a Republican voted in the Democratic Party primary election, poll workers would challenge their party affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">{\u00b6 6} Maschari filed a memorandum opposing the board\u2019s motion and attached her affidavit in support of her argument. Maschari denied that she had ever encouraged the board of elections or any poll worker to permit registered Republicans to vote in the Democratic primary without being challenged about party affiliation. Maschari further stated that she was unaware, until after the March 2, 2004 primary election, of the board\u2019s policy preventing poll workers from challenging voters based on party affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">{\u00b6 7} On June 1, 2004, the court of appeals entered summary judgment in favor of Tone and the board of elections, denied Maschari\u2019s election contest, and affirmed the results of the March 2, 2004 primary election. The court of appeals determined that the board\u2019s policy did not constitute an election irregularity:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThis court has reviewed the entire record in this case and, upon consideration thereof and the law, finds that the duty to challenge cross-over voters pursuant to R.C. 3513.19 arises only if election officials, who have both discretion in bringing challenges and final authority to decide a voter\u2019s qualifications, doubt a person\u2019s qualifications to vote in a particular party\u2019s primary election. Accordingly, the board\u2019s no-challenge policy was not binding on the election officials, and it therefore does not constitute the type of irregularity that would justify thwarting the will of the voting public by voiding the results of the March 2, 2004 primary election.\u201d 157 Ohio App.3d 366, 2004-Ohio-2876, 811 N.E.2d 555, \u00b6 24. The Sandusky branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Concerned Voters for Proper Elections filed amicus curiae briefs in support of Maschari and urging reversal of the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">{\u00b6 9} This cause is now before the court upon Maschari\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Jurisdiction: R.C. 3515.09</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">{\u00b6 10} The board asserts that we need not address Maschari\u2019s claims on appeal because the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider her election contest. The board asserts that Maschari did not file her election-contest petition \u201cwithin fifteen days after the results of any such nomination or election have been ascertained and announced by the proper authority,\u201d as required by R.C. 3515.09. Because \u201celection contests are special in nature, the procedure prescribed by statute, to invoke a court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear such an action, must be strictly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>followed.\u201d <em>Hitt v. Tressler </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 174, 175, 4 OBR 453, 447 N.E.2d 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">{\u00b6 11} The board claims that because the unofficial results of the March 2, 2004 primary election were first ascertained and announced on March 2, 2004, Maschari\u2019s April 9, 2004 petition was filed more than 15 days after that date, in violation of R.C. 3515.09. Maschari counters that under R.C. 3513.22, the official results of the primary election were not ascertained and announced until March 26, 2004, making her petition timely filed under R.C. 3515.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 12} In analyzing R.C. 3515.09, \u201c[w]ords and phrases used shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Rose v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 229, 231, 736 N.E.2d 886. \u201cAscertain\u201d means \u201cto make (a person) certain, sure, or confident,\u201d and \u201cannounce\u201d means to \u201cmake known officially or publicly.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 126 and 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 13} Under R.C. 3513.22, an election result is neither certain nor official until the board of elections completes its canvass of election returns within the date set by the Secretary of State and the board determines and declares the results and certifies abstracts of those results.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 14} Therefore, the court of appeals correctly held that the phrase \u201cascertained and announced,\u201d as used in R.C. 3515.09, refers to the certification of election results in R.C. 3513.22, which did not take place here until March 26, 2004. 157 Ohio App.3d 366, 2004-Ohio-2876, 811 N.E.2d 555, \u00b6 11. Consequently, Maschari\u2019s petition was timely filed, and the court of appeals had jurisdiction to consider her election contest. Maschari\u2019s claims are next considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">{\u00b6 15} Maschari first contends that the court of appeals erred in deciding her election contest by summary judgment instead of a trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">{\u00b6 16} We need not address the merits of Maschari\u2019s contention for two reasons: (1) Maschari expressly agreed to the summary judgment procedure, and (2) she waived any error by failing to first raise in the court of appeals the objection she raises here. See <em>State ex rel. Ross v. State, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 73, 2004-Ohio-1827, 806 N.E.2d 553, \u00b6 7. In the court of appeals\u2019 April 23, 2004 entry, the court noted that the schedule of proceedings in the election contest, including the time for filing a summary judgment motion and a response to that motion, was \u201cpursuant to the agreement of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">{\u00b6 17} Maschari next claims that the court of appeals erred in denying her the opportunity to conduct discovery in the election contest. Although the court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>appeals first denied the board\u2019s motion for a protective order to prevent Maschari from deposing board members, the court later granted motions for protective orders to prevent Maschari from deposing board members and from deposing electors about their votes in the contested election pending the court\u2019s consideration of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision in a discovery matter is whether the court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Denton v. Bedinghaus, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 298, 2003-Ohio-861, 784 N.E.2d 99, \u00b6 31. \u201cAbuse of discretion\u201d connotes an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable attitude. <em>State ex rel. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 344, 2004-Ohio-3122, 810 N.E.2d 949, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">{\u00b6 19} After the deadline for filing a response to the board\u2019s motion for summary judgment passed, the court of appeals granted the board\u2019s motions for protective orders pending its resolution of the board\u2019s summary judgment motion. In essence, the court of appeals concluded that if summary judgment was granted, it would render moot the need for further discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 20} The court of appeals did not act in an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable manner in so concluding. Although Maschari contends that some of her requested discovery could have resulted in evidence to rebut the board\u2019s summary judgment motion, she did not argue this in her motion for reconsideration of the decision granting a protective order, where she merely claimed that the discovery was \u201cto prepare for the June 2, 2004 trial.\u201d In fact, the depositions for which the court of appeals granted protective orders were for depositions scheduled by Maschari <em>after </em>the May 10, 2004 deadline she had agreed to for the filing of her response to the board\u2019s summary judgment motion. Maschari never moved pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F) to delay the court\u2019s consideration of the summary judgment motion pending further discovery. See <em>Taylor v. Franklin Blvd. Nursing Home, Inc. </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 27, 30, 677 N.E.2d 1212 (\u201ca party who fails to seek relief under Civ.R. 56[F] in the trial court does not preserve its rights thereto for purposes of appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">No-Challenge Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">{\u00b6 21} Maschari asserts that the court of appeals erred in denying her election contest of the May 2, 2004 primary election. In order to ultimately prevail, Maschari had to establish by clear and convincing evidence that one or more election irregularities occurred and that the irregularity or irregularities affected enough votes to change or make uncertain the result of the primary election. <em>In re Election Contest of Dec. 14, 1999 Special Election for the Office of Mayor of Willoughby Hills </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 302, 305, 744 N.E.2d 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Maschari contends that the board of elections\u2019 policy not to challenge a voter\u2019s party affiliation in primary elections constituted an irregularity. R.C. 3513.19(A) imposes a duty on any judge of elections to challenge the right of a person to vote whenever the judge doubts that the person is legally entitled to vote:</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cIt is the duty of any <em>witness </em>or <em>challenger </em>and of <em>any judge </em>of elections and the right of any <em>elector, </em>whenever any such person doubts that another person attempting to vote at a primary election is legally entitled to vote at such election, to challenge the right of that other person to vote.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 24} The statute places on three categories of persons a duty to challenge the right of a person to vote and further provides any elector with a right to challenge the right of a person to vote. Election judges are merely one category of persons with a duty to challenge the right of a person to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">{\u00b6 25} One of the permissible grounds upon which the right of a person to vote at a primary election may be challenged is that \u201cthe person is not affiliated with or is not a member of the political party whose ballot the person desires to vote. Such party affiliation shall be determined by examining the elector\u2019s voting record for the current year and the immediately preceding two calendar years as shown on the voter\u2019s registration card, using the standards of affiliation specified in the seventh paragraph of section 3513.05 of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 3513.19(A)(3). The seventh paragraph of R.C. 3513.05 provides that \u201can elector is considered to be a member of a political party if the elector voted in that party\u2019s primary election within the preceding two calendar years, or if the elector did not vote in any other party\u2019s primary election within the preceding two calendar years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">{\u00b6 26} If challenged on the basis of party affiliation, the person may still vote in the primary election by making a statement \u201cunder penalty of election falsification, that the person desires to be affiliated with and supports the principles of the political party whose primary ballot the person desires to vote.\u201d R.C. 3513.19(B) and 3513.20. If the challenged person does not make this statement, the person will be refused a ballot. R.C. 3513.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">{\u00b6 27} The board\u2019s no-challenge policy improperly divested election officials of their statutory authority and responsibility under R.C. 3513.19(A) to challenge a person\u2019s right to vote based on party affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">{\u00b6 28} The court of appeals determined, however, that the board\u2019s policy did not constitute an irregularity sufficient to withstand the board\u2019s summary judgment motion because the policy \u201cwas not binding on the election officials.\u201d In so holding, the court of appeals relied on <em>Holding v. Corey </em>(1936), 54 Ohio App. 34, 35, 5 N.E.2d 1022, in which an appellate court interpreted a previous statutory challenge provision and held that a board of elections was not liable for damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>for instructing precinct officials to prevent persons affiliated with one party from voting in another party\u2019s primary because precinct officials \u201cwere not bound to follow the [board\u2019s] advice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">{\u00b6 29} The court of appeals erred in so concluding. The pertinent statutes place the responsibility on <em>boards of elections </em>to appoint precinct election officials, R.C. 3501.22(A), train them, 3501.27(A) and (B), and remove them for cause, 3501.22(A). Under R.C. 3501.11(E), the boards of elections must \u201c[m]ake and issue rules and instructions, <em>not inconsistent with law </em>or the rules, directives, or advisories issued by the secretary of state, as it considers necessary for the guidance of election officers and voters.\u201d (Emphasis added.) And R.C. 3501.31 requires precinct election officials to take an oath to discharge their duties \u201cas required by law and <em>the rules and instructions of the board of elections of said county.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Therefore, persons acting as election officials appointed by the board could reasonably believe that they had a duty to follow the board\u2019s instructions, including the no-challenge policy, even if \u2014 as here \u2014 that policy was inconsistent with the applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 30} The board\u2019s policy precluding election officials from exercising their authority under R.C. 3513.19(A) potentially changed the essentially closed primary into an unconstitutional open primary. Cf. <em>California Democratic Party v. Jones </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 567, 120 S.Ct. 2402, 147 L.Ed.2d 502, where the Supreme Court of the United States held that California\u2019s blanket-primary system, which permitted electors to vote for any candidate regardless of the voter\u2019s or candidate\u2019s party affiliation, was unconstitutional because it violated political parties\u2019 First Amendment right of association.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">{\u00b6 31} Consequently, the court of appeals erred in holding that the board\u2019s no-challenge policy did not constitute an election irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">{\u00b6 32} Nevertheless, any error by the court of appeals in determining that the no-challenge policy was not an irregularity does not warrant reversal of the court\u2019s denial of Masehari\u2019s election contest. \u201c \u2018Reviewing courts are not authorized to reverse a correct judgment on the basis that some or all of the lower court\u2019s reasons are erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson v. Wilson, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 315, 2003-Ohio-6112, 798 N.E.2d 1086, \u00b6 10, quoting <em>State ex rel. McGrath v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 72, 2003-Ohio-5062, 796 N.E.2d 526, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">{\u00b6 33} Maschari was estopped from contesting the primary election result. \u201cIn cases in which we have found equitable estoppel in an election contest, irregularities were plain on the face of the ballot, and the contestors were aware of the alleged defects prior to the election.\u201d <em>In re Contested Election of Nov. 2, 1993 </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 411, 413, 650 N.E.2d 859; <em>In re Election of Nov. 6, 1990 for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>the Office of Attorney General of Ohio </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 103, 113-114, 569 N.E.2d 447. In <em>Contested Election of Nov. 2, 1993, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 414, 650 N.E.2d 859, we held that contestors were estopped from raising a defective-ballot-language claim because they \u201cwere either aware of or should have been aware of the ballot language prior to the November 2, 1993 election, yet they failed to raise this issue prior to learning of the adverse election results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">{\u00b6 34} Similarly, although the claimed irregularity was not \u201cplain on the face of the ballot,\u201d Maschari should have been aware of the board of elections\u2019 no-challenge policy, which had been effective since April 1998 and had survived a rescission motion in January 2004. The board\u2019s policy was promulgated and reaffirmed at regular board meetings that were open to the public. But Maschari failed to contest the policy until following the March 2004 primary election results, and in fact, she actively solicited Republicans to vote for her in the primary election. Cf. <em>Shipan v. Slivka </em>(Jan. 22, 1982), Cuyahoga App. No. 44779, 1982 WL 2309 (\u201cContestor made no objection to the Board of Elections about any procedures used by it to count any ballots * * * until after the Board had completed the official count and the subsequent requested recount. By his conduct during the count and recount, Contestor manifested an acquiescence in the procedures used by the Board of Elections to accomplish the ballot evaluation and tabulation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">{\u00b6 35} As the court of appeals noted, \u201c[s]urely [Maschari] was aware, based on her campaign tactics, that there was a high probability that cross-over voters would play a role in the March 2, 2004 primary election. Yet, by her own admission, she failed to educate herself as to the necessity of challenging those cross-over voters * * *. [Maschari] could have * * * ask[ed] the Democratic party to appoint a challenger to each precinct pursuant to R.C. 3505.21.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">{\u00b6 36} Under these circumstances, Maschari is not entitled to pursue Republican voters and then complain about the lack of challenges to those same voters by election officials after she loses. She should have been aware of the board\u2019s publicly adopted no-challenge policy and could have acted under R.C. 3505.21 to have challengers present in each precinct. These facts do not establish \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d manifestly affecting the \u201cintegrity of the election.\u201d <em>In re Election Contest of Dec. 14, 1999 Special Election, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 308, 744 N.E.2d 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">{\u00b6 37} The court of appeals properly denied Maschari\u2019s election contest. \u201c \u2018Our holding is in accordance with the tendency of this court to insist * * * that after an election, unless is it shown that the result was contrary to the will of the electorate, it will not be disturbed.\u2019 \u201d Id., 91 Ohio St.3d at 308, 744 N.E.2d 745, quoting <em>Mehling v. Moorehead </em>(1938), 133 Ohio St. 395, 408, 11 O.O. 55, 14 N.E.2d 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>{\u00b6 38} Our holding is restricted to the unique facts present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 39} Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-7\">Moyer, C.J., F.E. Sweeney, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Att\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b534-8\">Resnick, J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b534-9\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ap_\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">{\u00b6 40} I dissent. From a procedural standpoint, I am persuaded that genuine issues of material fact remain concerning Maschari\u2019s election contest. Moreover, the pertinent statutes governing election contests require a trial rather than a summary judgment proceeding. See, e.g., R.C. 3515.10 (\u201cThe court with which a petition to contest an election is filed shall fix a suitable time for hearing such contest\u201d); 3515.11 (\u201cThe proceedings at the trial of the contest of an election shall be similar to those in judicial proceedings, in so far as practicable\u201d); 3515.14 (\u201cUpon completion of the trial of a contest of election, the court shall pronounce judgment * * *\u201d). Consequently, summary judgment was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">{\u00b6 41} Further, the policy of the Erie County Board of Elections was flatly illegal and may well have significantly affected this race. Whether Maschari encouraged Republicans to vote for her is irrelevant. As the majority explains, a heretofore Republican may vote in a Democratic primary by making a statement \u201cunder penalty of election falsification, that the person desires to be affiliated with and supports the principles of the political party whose primary ballot the person desires to vote.\u201d R.C. 3513.19(B) and 3513.20. Thus, Maschari was well within her rights to seek the possible vote of Republicans. In a small town, party affiliations may be held not as dear as having the opportunity to vote for a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">{\u00b6 42} Maschari\u2019s solicitation of certain Republicans does not mean, however, that she was privy to the policies of the Erie County Board of Elections. Should candidates, including statewide candidates, be responsible for uncovering malfeasance at local boards of elections? That is clearly the duty of the Ohio Secretary of State, who must uncover and correct the illegal actions of local boards well in advance of elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">{\u00b6 43} As the majority recognizes, it is \u201c \u2018the tendency of this court to insist * * * that after an election, unless is it shown that the result was contrary to the will of the electorate, it will not be disturbed.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Election Contest of Dec. 14, 1999 Special Election for the Office of Mayor of Willoughby Hills </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 302, 308, 744 N.E.2d 745, quoting <em>Mehling v. Moorehead </em>(1938), 133 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>St. 395, 408, 11 O.O. 55, 14 N.E.2d 15. We must note that the election in this case was a Democratic primary and that Democrats are the electorate to consider. If the improper crossing over was significant, it is likely that the result was contrary to the will of that electorate.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b535-15\">Law Offices of Donald J. McTigue, Donald J.

Because that was not done in this election in Erie County, I agree with the majority that the no-challenge policy constituted an election irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">{\u00b6 47} Nowhere in the statute, however, does it suggest that if a candidate solicited members of an opposite party to vote in a closed primary, the election judge\u2019s duty would be abrogated. Further, I am unpersuaded that because the candidate did solicit Republicans to vote for her in the primary election, she is somehow estopped from complaining about the no-challenge policy. No evidence exists that all Republicans would have been precluded from voting in the closed primary. Some may have been able to pass a challenge of the election judge had there been one. The majority fails to account for this realistic possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">{\u00b6 48} And moreover, the majority\u2019s claim that its holding is in accord with the tendency not to disturb an election result unless the result is shown to be contrary to the will of the electorate is -not borne out by today\u2019s analysis. The election result here became skewed by unchallenged electors voting in a closed primary \u2014 how can that result be the will of the electorate? It shows the will of those who should have had no influence over the outcome of the election!</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">{\u00b6 49} I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and order a remand for further proceedings as outlined in Justice Pfeifer\u2019s dissenting opinion, with which I concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b535-14\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Tone, Grubbe, McGory &amp; Vermeeren, and Tygh M.
