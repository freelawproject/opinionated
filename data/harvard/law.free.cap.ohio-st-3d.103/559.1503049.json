No. 12 (\u201cH.B. 12\u201d), which \u201cauthorize^] county sheriffs to issue licenses to carry concealed handguns to certain persons.\u201d Title of H.B. 12. Governor Bob Taft approved the act on January 8, and the act became effective on April 8. Id. at L-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">{\u00b6 2} On April 8, 2004, relator, Josephine Lee, appeared at the office of respondent, Franklin County Sheriff Jim Karnes, with her applications and supporting materials for a temporary emergency license to carry a concealed handgun (\u201cTEL\u201d) and a concealed-handgun license (\u201cCHL\u201d). According to Emmett L. Wheeler, who processes applications to carry concealed handguns for the sheriffs office, he informed Lee that she could submit either application, or both, with the required fees for processing. Wheeler advised Lee that in his opinion, she would not have to submit the TEL application because the CHL application would be processed and received by her at the same time. After she consulted with another person who had accompanied her to the sheriffs office, Lee elected to submit only her TEL application.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">{\u00b6 3} Lee then submitted her completed TEL application form, sworn affidavits pursuant to R.C. 2923.1213(B)(1)(a) and (b), and a temporary emergency license fee pursuant to R.C. 2923.1213(B)(1)(c). Lee also was prepared to submit a specimen of her fingerprints to the sheriff in accordance with R.C. 2923.1213(B)(1)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">{\u00b6 4} In one of Lee\u2019s affidavits submitted with her TEL application, she swore that \u201cshe has reasonable cause to fear a criminal attack upon herself or a member of h[e]r family, such as would justify a prudent person in going armed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The sheriffs office did not obtain fingerprints from Lee and did not conduct either a criminal-records check or an incompetency-records check on her. In addition, the sheriffs office never reviewed Lee\u2019s TEL application materials to determine whether the criteria in R.C. 2923.125(D)(1)(a) to (j) applied to Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">{\u00b6 6} Instead, by letter dated April 8, 2004, which was handed to Lee on April 9, Sheriff Karnes notified Lee that her TEL application had been denied because she failed to submit sufficient evidence of imminent danger as required by R.C. 2923.1213(B)(1)(a). In the letter, Sheriff Karnes informed Lee of the denial of her application, the claimed defect in her affidavit, and the availability of appeal to challenge the denial:</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u2018Tour application for a temporary emergency permit * * * is denied since your application fails to provide sufficient facts leading to a reasonable conclusion. Merely reciting the statutory language, without any facts to support your conclusory allegations, is not a sufficient basis for me to issue a temporary emergency permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u2018Tou have the right to provide me with an additional affidavit containing sufficient facts to support your application or you can appeal my decision, per section 119.12 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">{\u00b6 9} On April 9, 2004, instead of attempting to appeal the sheriffs denial of her TEL application, Lee filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel Sheriff Karnes to accept and process her CHL and TEL applications. After Sheriff Karnes answered Lee\u2019s complaint, we granted an alternative writ, and the parties filed evidence and briefs. <em>State ex rel. Lee v. Karnes, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 1481, 2004-Ohio-3069, 810 N.E.2d 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">{\u00b6 10} This cause is now before us for a consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">{\u00b6 11} Lee requests a writ of mandamus to compel Sheriff Karnes to accept and process her CHL and TEL applications. In order to be entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus, Lee must establish a clear legal right to the acceptance and processing of her applications, a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of Sheriff Karnes to accept and process them, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Savage v. Caltrider, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 363, 2003-Ohio-6806, 800 N.E.2d 358, \u00b6 8. With this standard of proof providing our analytical framework, we now consider Lee\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">CHL Application</p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\">{\u00b6 12} Under H.B. 12, a person can apply for a CHL by submitting a completed application form, a nonrefundable license fee, certain supporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>documents, and a set of fingerprints to the sheriff of the applicant\u2019s county of residence or to the sheriff of any county adjacent to the applicant\u2019s county of residence. R.C. 2923.125(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">{\u00b6 13} Upon receipt of these materials, the sheriff must conduct a criminal-records check and an incompetency-records check. R.C. 2923.125(C). Within 45 days after receipt of the application and pertinent materials, the sheriff must generally issue a four-year CHL if the criteria specified in R.C. 2923.125(D)(1)(a) to (l) apply. If the sheriff denies the CHL application because the applicant does not satisfy the criteria in R.C. 2923.125(D)(1)(a) to (Z), the applicant may appeal the sheriffs denial under R.C. 119.12. R.C. 2923.125(D)(2)(b). If the sheriff denies the CHL application as a result of a criminal-records check, the applicant may contest the result using a challenge and review procedure. R.C. 2923.125(D)(2)(b) and 2923.127.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">{\u00b6 14} Lee is not entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel Sheriff Karnes to accept and process her CHL application. The sheriffs duties under H.B. 12 arise only after the applicant submits a completed application form and supporting materials to the sheriffs office. R.C. 2923.125. Sheriff Karnes introduced evidence that Lee never submitted her CHL application to his office for processing and that if she had done so, his office would have accepted it for processing. Athough Lee introduced contrary evidence, the sheriffs evidence prevents her from establishing a clear legal right to the acceptance and processing of her CHL application or a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of the sheriff to do so. See <em>State ex rel. Preschool Development, Ltd. v. Springboro, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 347, 2003-Ohio-3999, 792 N.E.2d 721, \u00b6 12 (relator in mandamus action \u201chas the burden of proving * * * entitlement to the writ\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Woodmen Acc. Co. v. Conn </em>(1927), 116 Ohio St. 127, 132, 156 N.E. 114 (\u201cIn the light of the conflicting testimony offered [in a mandamus action filed in the supreme court], we feel that the relators have not established a clear right to the relief prayed for\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">{\u00b6 15} Therefore, because Lee failed to establish any of the requirements for extraordinary relief in mandamus, we deny the writ of mandamus to compel Sheriff Karnes to accept and process her CHL application.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">TEL Application</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">{\u00b6 16} H.B. 12 further provides that a person can apply for a TEL to carry a concealed handgun by submitting to the sheriff of the applicant\u2019s county of residence (1) evidence of imminent danger to the person or a member of the person\u2019s family, (2) a sworn affidavit that attests to some of the criteria set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>in R.C. 2923.125(D)(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) a temporary emergency license fee, and (4) a set of fingerprints taken by the sheriffs office. R.C. 2923.1213(B)(1)(a) to (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">{\u00b6 17} Upon receipt of the foregoing documentation, the sheriff must immediately conduct a criminal-records check and an incompetency-records check and, after receiving these results, must determine whether the criteria of R.C. 2923.125(D)(1)(a) to (j) apply to the TEL applicant. R.C. 2923.1213(B)(2). The sheriff must either grant the 90-day TEL or deny it. The applicant may appeal the denial of the application. R.C. 2923.1213(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">{\u00b6 18} Sheriff Karnes determined that he need not process Lee\u2019s TEL application because he found that she did not present sufficient \u201c[e]vidence of imminent danger to the person or a member of the person\u2019s family.\u201d R.C. 2923.1213(B)(1)(a). R.C. 2923.1213(A)(1) defines this evidence as either a sworn statement by the applicant or a written document prepared by a governmental entity or public official:</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(1) \u2018Evidence of imminent danger\u2019 means any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(a) A statement sworn by the person seeking to carry a concealed handgun that is made under threat of perjury and that <em>states that the person has reasonable cause to fear </em>a criminal attack upon the person or a member of the person\u2019s family, such as would justify a prudent person in going armed;</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(b) A written document prepared by a governmental entity or public official <em>describing the facts that give the person seeking to carry a concealed handgun reasonable cause to fear </em>a criminal attack upon the person or a member of the person\u2019s family, such as would justify a prudent person in going armed. Written documents of this nature include, but are not limited to, any temporary protection order, civil protection order, protection order issued by another state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>or other court order, any court report, and any report filed with or made by a law enforcement agency or prosecutor.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">{\u00b6 22} Lee chose to submit evidence in accordance with the first alternative \u2014 a sworn statement made under threat of perjury \u2014 as evidence of imminent danger supporting her TEL application. R.C. 2923.125(A)(1)(a). Sheriff Karnes concluded that her statement was insufficient because she did not include <em>specific facts </em>supporting her statement that she had \u201creasonable cause to fear a criminal attack upon herself or a member of h[e]r family, such as would justify a prudent person in going armed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">{\u00b6 23} Resolution of Lee\u2019s challenge to the sheriffs conclusion requires our interpretation of R.C. 2923.1213(A)(1)(a). The court\u2019s paramount concern in construing a statute is legislative intent. <em>State ex rel. United States Steel Corp. v. Zaleski, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 395, 2003-Ohio-1630, 786 N.E.2d 39, \u00b6 12. In discerning this intent, we read words and phrases in context according to the rules of grammar and common usage. R.C. 1.42; <em>Bosher v. Euclid Income Tax Bd. of Review, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 330, 2003-Ohio-3886, 792 N.E.2d 181. If the statute is unambiguous, we must apply it as written. <em>State v. Hairston, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 308, 2004-Ohio-969, 804 N.E.2d 471, \u00b613.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. 2923.1213(A)(1)(a) requires only an applicant\u2019s sworn statement made under threat of perjury that \u201cthe person has reasonable cause to fear a criminal attack upon the person or a member of the person\u2019s family, such as would justify a prudent person in going armed.\u201d It does not require underlying facts to support the sworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">{\u00b6 25} Adopting the sheriffs construction of the R.C. 2923.1213(A)(1)(a) statutory requirement would substitute \u201cdescribing the facts that give the person\u201d for \u201cstates that the person has\u201d before \u201creasonable cause to fear a criminal attack upon the person or a member of the person\u2019s family, such as would justify a prudent person in going armed.\u201d This additional language would make the R.C. 2923.1213(A)(1)(a) definition of \u201c[e]vidence of imminent danger\u201d read, \u201cA statement sworn by the person seeking to carry a concealed handgun that is made under threat of perjury <em>describing the facts that give the person </em>reasonable cause to fear a criminal attack upon the person or a member of the person\u2019s family, such as would justify a prudent person in going armed.\u201d We cannot, however, add this language to the statute. See <em>State v. Hughes </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 424, 427, 715 N.E.2d 540 (\u201cIn construing a statute, we may not add or delete words\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">{\u00b6 26} Had the General Assembly intended the factual requirement espoused by the sheriff, it would have included it in R.C. 2923.1213(A)(1)(a). In fact, the General Assembly did just that in the alternate method for TEL applicants to establish evidence of imminent danger. R.C. 2923.1213(a)(1)(b) (\u201cA written document prepared by a governmental entity or public official <em>describing the facts </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>that give the person seeking to carry a concealed handgun reasonable cause to fear a criminal attack upon the person or a member of the person\u2019s family, such as would justify a prudent person in going armed.\u201d [Emphasis added.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe preeminent canon of statutory interpretation requires us to \u2018presume that [the] legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.\u2019 \u201d <em>BedRoc Ltd., LLC v. United States </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 176, 124 S.Ct. 1587, 1593, 158 L.Ed.2d 338, quoting <em>Connecticut Natl. Bank v. Germain </em>(1992), 503 U.S. 249, 253-254, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391. Because the General Assembly did not include a requirement of descriptive facts to support a TEL applicant\u2019s sworn statement providing evidence of imminent danger in R.C. 2923.1213(A)(1)(a), we will not infer one.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 28} Consequently, Sheriff Karnes erred in rejecting Lee\u2019s TEL application and failing to process it further. Lee presented sufficient evidence of imminent danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">{\u00b6 29} Under these circumstances, the sheriff had a duty to conduct the criminal-records and incompetency-records checks and, upon receipt of those results, to review the information and determine whether the criteria of R.C. 2923.125(D)(1)(a) to (j) apply to Lee. R.C. 2923.1213(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">{\u00b6 30} Nevertheless, Lee had an adequate remedy by appeal from Sheriff Karnes\u2019s decision denying her TEL application. R.C. 2923.1213(B)(2) specifies that a TEL applicant may appeal the denial of a TEL:</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cIf the sheriff denies the issuance of a temporary emergency license to the person, the sheriff shall specify the grounds for the denial in a written notice to the person. <em>The person may appeal the denial, </em>or challenge criminal records check results that were the basis of the denial if applicable, <em>in the same manners specified in division (D)(2) of section 2923.125 </em>and in section 2923.127 of the Revised Code, <em>regarding the denial of an application for a license to carry a concealed handgun under that section.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">{\u00b6 32} R.C. 2923.125(D)(2)(b) provides that an applicant who has been denied a CHL can appeal the denial under R.C. 119.12:</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cIf a sheriff denies an application under this section because the applicant does not satisfy the criteria described in division (D)(1) of this section, the sheriff shall specify the grounds for the denial in a written notice to the applicant. <em>The -applicant may appeal the denial pursuant to section 119.12 of the Revised Code.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">{\u00b6 34} Lee contends that this appeal is not available to her because of the first sentence of R.C. 2923.125(D)(2)(b), which limits the appeal of the denial of CHL applications to those denials based on the applicants\u2019 failure to satisfy the criteria described in R.C. 2923.125(D)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>{\u00b6 35} Lee misreads R.C. 2923.1213(B)(2). The right of TEL applicants who have been denied licenses to appeal is not restricted to a sheriffs finding concerning R.C. 2923.125(D)(1) criteria. R.C. 2923.1213(B)(2) specifies that TEL applicants who have been denied licenses may appeal the denial in \u201cthe same manners specified in\u201d R.C. 2923.125(D)(2). Construing this language according to the rules of grammar and common usage as required by R.C. 1.42, \u201cmanner\u201d means \u201cmode or method in which something is done.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 1376. Therefore, the reference in R.C. 2923.1213(B)(2) to 2923.125(D)(2) is only to the procedural mode or method in which an appeal is effectuated, i.e., pursuant to R.C. 119.12, and not to the substantive types of denials that may be appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">{\u00b6 36} In fact, unlike a denial of a CHL under the first sentence in R.C. 2923.125(D)(2)(b), the denial of a TEL application by a sheriff is not restricted to the applicant\u2019s satisfaction of criteria described in R.C. 2923.125(D)(1). Cf. R.C. 2923.1213(B)(2) (\u201cIf the sheriff denies the issuance of a temporary emergency license to the person, the sheriff shall specify the grounds for the denial in a written notice to the person\u201d) with R.C. 2923.125(D)(2)(b) (\u201cIf the sheriff denies an application under this section <em>because the applicant does not satisfy the criteria described in division (D)(1) of this section, </em>the sheriff shall specify the grounds for the denial in a written notice to the applicant\u201d). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 37} Adopting Lee\u2019s construction of the first sentence of the second paragraph of R.C. 2923.1213(B)(2) would add to that provision the language in the first sentence of R.C. 2923.125(D)(2)(b). Lee\u2019s argument results \u201c \u2018not [in] a construction of [the] statute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the court, so that what was omitted * * * may be included within its scope.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lamie v. United States Trustee </em>(2004), 540 U.S. 526, 124 S.Ct. 1023, 1032, 157 L.Ed.2d 1024, quoting <em>Iselin v. United States </em>(1926), 270 U.S. 245, 251, 46 S.Ct. 248, 70 L.Ed. 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 38} Therefore, although Sheriff Karnes erred in denying Lee\u2019s TEL application for lack of sufficient evidence of imminent danger, Lee is not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus, because she had an adequate remedy by appealing the sheriffs denial. R.C. 2923.1213(B)(2) and 119.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">{\u00b6 39} Based on the foregoing, Lee has not established her entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus regarding either her concealed-handgun license or temporary emergency license applications. Accordingly, we deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">Writ denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b681-11\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
