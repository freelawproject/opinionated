Prayer for a specific performance of the contract; that <em>Henry Howard of John, </em>and <em>Philemon Welsh </em>be made parties, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-7\"><em>Philemon Welsh </em>appeared and confessed the facts charged in complainant\u2019s bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-8\"><em>Henry Howard of John, </em>being summoned and not appearing, an interlocutory decree was passed against him, and a commission ordered, which was issued on the 2nd September, 1833, and closed on the 3rd August, 1835.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-9\">On the 8th September, 1833, <em>Henry Howard of John, </em>petitioned <em>Baltimore county court </em>for leave to file his answer, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>an answer was filed, (the terras of this leave do not appear,) which admitted his contract with <em>Philemon Welch, </em>but alleged that <em>Welch </em>had assigned his contract to <em>James Thomas; </em>that <em>Thomas </em>sold to <em>Cornelius Grimes; </em>that subsequently to the assignment of said agreement, which was put on the back thereof, it was erased in part, and a new assignment made, whereby the rights under said agreement were attempted to be transferred to the said complainant, and the dates of said assignment fraudulently altered, and the mattef placed, of attempted to be placed, in the same situation as though the said assignment to <em>Thomas </em>had never been executed. He also denied a tender at the time and in the manner stated, and exhibition to him of the bond of conveyance as stated, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\">On the 20th November, 1833, the complainant petitioned for leave to amend his bill, in order to make <em>Cornelius Grimes </em>a party defendant, and to aver, that the assignment to <em>Thomas, </em>relied upon in the answer of <em>Howard </em>the defendant,- was obtained by duress. On the 20th November, 1833, the county court (P\u00fcrviance, A. J.,) passed the following order:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-6\">\u201c Leave is granted to make <em>Mr. Grimes </em>a party defendant, \u201caccording to the prayer of the petition.\u201d And a subpoena issued for said <em>Grimes </em>on the 21st November, 1833, who being summoned, appeared and answered the bill, taking in substance the same defence as <em>Henry Howard of John.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-7\">On the 14th April, 1834, the complainant suggested the death of <em>Henry Howard of John, </em>and a subpcena issued for his representatives, who were all summoned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-8\">The defendants then by agreement waived all objections which might be taken to the testimony of <em>Philemon Welch, </em>examined as a witness for complainant, so far as they might arise from his examination without a previous order of court. On the 29th June, 1835, an order was passed directing the commissioner to return the commission, which was closed in August 1835.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-9\">On the 2nd November, 1835, the cause was transmitted to Chancery. And on the 19th January, 1837, it being before the Chancellor (Bland,) he ordered it to stand over with leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>to amend, as allowed by the order of the 20th November, 1833, and also to amend so as to make <em>James Thomas </em>a party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-5\">. On the 17th April, 1838, the complainant filed his amended bill, praying subpoena against <em>C. Grimes, James Thomas, Sarah Howard </em>and others, representatives of <em>H. Howard of John. </em>The alleged matters of the original bill, and the pretended claim of <em>Grimes </em>through <em>James Thomas, </em>the assignee of <em>Welch, </em>who was not made a party to this amended bill, were stated in the bill as amended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-6\"><em>James Thomas </em>answered the bill, and alleged that though he purchased from <em>Welch, </em>yet being unable to comply with his contract, he cancelled it, returned his contract to <em>Welch, </em>who gave him up his bond. He denied a sale to <em>Grimes </em>of any interest in, or any portion of that contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-7\">\u25a0 On the 24th January, 1840, it was agreed that the several answers filed should be taken as answers to the amended bill, as well as to the original bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-8\">The complainants excepted to the evidence of the declarations of <em>James Thomas, </em>as sought to be given in evidence by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-9\">The defendant, <em>Cornelius Grimes, </em>also excepted :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-10\">1.

To the admissibility of all hearsay evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-14\">At December term, 1840, the Chancellor (Bland,) dismissed the bill, being of opinion that putting aside the depositions of the parties to this suit as coming from incompetent witnesses, and the mere hearsay detailed by other witnesses, the complainant has failed to sustain his claim to relief, by any'legal and satisfactory evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-15\">The complainants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The cause was argued before Buchanan, C.

Lloyd for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b43-7\">Archer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A90\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">As the commission <em>ex parte </em>under the interlocutory decree was ordered and issued before <em>Grimes </em>was \u00a1made a party to the proceedings, we think the objection was well taken to the admissibility of the evidence against <em>Grimes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">But we have, notwithstanding, examined the merits of the case upon the testimony taken under the commission, and we have arrived at the conclusion, that the complainant is not entitled to the relief he seeks. In this examination we have considered the declarations of <em>Thomas, </em>to whom the bond of conveyance from <em>Howard </em>was assigned, made before the erasure, and before assignment of the bond, by <em>Welch, </em>to the complainant, as evidence. The complainant derives his title to the bond of conveyance through <em>Thomas, </em>and any declaration made by <em>Thomas, </em>while he was holder of the bond, we consider as evidence against the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">We are satisfied that <em>Welch </em>entered into the contract which is now sought to be specifically enforced with <em>Howard, </em>for the benefit of <em>Thomas, </em>and that he accordingly assigned the agreement to <em>Thomas. </em>While <em>Thomas </em>was thus in possession of the agreement by assignment, he executed a deed to <em>Grimes, </em>large enough by its terms to transfer any interest he had in the land affected by the agreement; and then to defeat <em>Grimes, </em>and with the fraudulent design to deprive the conveyance of its intended operation, he re-delivered to <em>Welch </em>the agreement to convey, when the assignment to <em>Thomas </em>was erased, and an assignment by <em>Welch </em>to <em>Clary </em>was made in its stead. Under such circumstances, it is not perceived that <em>Thomas </em>could have (had he not assigned to <em>Cleary,) </em>any claim to a specific execution of the contract; nor do we see how <em>Cleary, </em>the complainant, could stand in any better situation. The estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>lished rules which govern courts of equity in enforcing contracts, would forbid our interference in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Tire complainant must stand or fall by the pretensions of Thomas, from whom he has in reality derived his pretended title, and has therefore ip our judgment no claim to our interposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">It has been objected that the conduct of <em>Grimes </em>has been harsh and oppressive. This may be so, but <em>Grimes </em>is not demanding the aid of Chancery to enforce a conveyance, but is resisting the claim of the complainant; and he is entitled to see that the court keep within its established rules in determining the rights of the complainant,</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">DECREE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
