Karthaus, </em>a competent witness, that in the month of February, 1836, a ship of his called the <em>Jefferson, </em>arrived at <em>New York, </em>where her sails were sent to a sail loft to be repaired, and four or five new sails in place of those worn out, were ordered to be made for said ship, but were not sent on board; that said ship was insured upon time; that a fire occurred in said sail loft in <em>New York, </em>by which said sails were destroyed; that the witness inquired the usage as between the insurers and insured in the port of <em>New York, </em>in regard to the loss in such cases, and ascertained that the usage there was, that the insurers were liable; and upon that fact being made known to the <em>Neptune Insurance Company off Baltimore, </em>they paid the said loss. The plaintiffs further proved by said witness, that he has been informed by others, that the same usage in regard to vessels whose sails are sent on shore for repair, from a vessel insured on time, existed in <em>England, </em>but of that fact the witness has no personal knowledge. The plaintiffs further proved by the said <em>Karthaus, </em>that he has been informed by others, that several merchants in <em>Baltimore, </em>whose vessels had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>been insured on time, and upon their arrival in <em>Baltimore, </em>whose sails had been sent to the sail lofts for repair, and which were destroyed by fire, Were, as he heard from others, paid for their loss by the insurers. The witness further stated, that he had no knowledge of any usage in such cases in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>except as deduced from the above fact and information, and knew of no usage, pro or contra, in regard to vessels unfinished, or vessels being built in <em>Baltimore.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-5\">The defendants then by their counsel moved the court for its opinion and direction to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-6\">If the jury shall believe from the evidence in this cause, that the spars, blocks, rigging and other materials and work, for the value of which this suit is brought, were never in fact put upon the barque <em>Orb, </em>upon which the insurance in this cause was affected, prior to the accident by fire proved in this cause, that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover under the policy in this cause, notwithstanding the jury may believe from the evidence that the said spars, blocks, rigging and other materials, were intended to be put upon the barque, and would have been put upon said barque if said accident by fire had not occurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-7\">The plaintiffs then moved in like manner the following prayer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-8\">That if the jury believe from the evidence, that the blocks, spars, rigging and other articles destroyed by fire, as set forth in the evidence, were actually delivered to the plaintiffs in a finished state by the parties furnishing the same, for the purpose of being forthwith put upon the barque <em>Orb, </em>and were the property of the plaintiffs as owners of the said barque, and if not insured would have been their exclusive loss, and were deposited in places near the said vessel, convenient for the then intended use thereof, and in the manner usual and customary in cases of building vessels in this city, then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, notwithstanding the said articles had never actually been put on board, or fitted to the said vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The court (Magruder, A. J.,) granted the prayer of the defendants, and rejected the prayer of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-5\">The verdict and judgment being for the defendants, the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b480-6\">The cause was argued before Stephen, Archer, Dorsey and Spence, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-7\">By N. Williams for the appellants, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-8\">By St. Geo. W. Teackle for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b480-9\">Archer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AiGO\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">We agree with the court below, that the policy did not cover the articles, for the loss of which by fire, this suit was instituted to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">We have no proof of usage in the port of Baltimore, in relation to this subject, which would control or govern the contract of the parties. What was the usage in other ports of the Union, could not be considered as entering into the views of the parties in the formation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">The case must, therefore, be decided by the language which the parties themselves have used in the covenant of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">This is a valued policy \u201con a new barque now being built,\u201d and the question is, what do these words import; do they apply to the ship and such materials as from time to time are placed upon her in a process of construction, or are they to be considered of more extensive signification, and as covering whatever materials were brought into the ship yard, and were necessary to her construction, whether fitted and prepared or not, to be placed upon the vessel, though not placed on the ship, or in any way attached to it, or as constituting in fact, a part of the corpus insured ?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">This is a case of the first impression in this State. No cases have been cited, bearing upon the question directly. The contract of insurance is, it is true, one of indemnity, but the terms of it ought not to be carried beyond their ordinary and legitimate signification. The extent of this indemnity is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>to be ascertained, by arriving at the true intention of the parties, as expressed by the words they have used. The thing injured, \u201cis a <em>new barque now being built\u201d </em>and the design of the parties was to cover the ship in the process of construction, ana indemnity was agreed to be furnished for her loss by fire, whatever might be her progress towards completion, when the fire occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The articles, the value of which is claimed, it is proved, were made for the ship, and were in the ship yard, and were in a condition to be fitted and attached to the vessel, if she had been ready to receive them. But they never had been placed upon or fitted to the vessel, so that the policy could attach to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Authorities have been cited to show, that an insurance on ship, covers her tackle apparel and furniture, <em>ex vitermini, </em>and that the sails of a vessel, taken on shore for repair, are also covered, there being a usage proved, that vessels engaged in such trade, removed their sails from the ship for repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">But these cases do not, we apprehend, apply to this case, where the insurance is not on a ship, but on a barque <em>being </em>built, and by which the articles alleged to be insured never constituted a part, and wh ere there is no usage in the port of <em>Baltimore </em>where the insurance was effected, to show that the articles lost were considered within the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">In short, we believe that the insurance in this case covered the barque itself, as it then lay on the stocks at the time of the insurance, and operated on such materials as should be from time to time in a course of construction, put upon and attached to the vessel, so that they might be considered as a part of the vesssl. judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
