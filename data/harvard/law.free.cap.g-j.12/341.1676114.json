R., Senior, </em>by instalments, &amp;c., and also denies that there was any agreement <em>prior to </em>or <em>on </em>the 16th May, 1823, that <em>H. R., Senior, </em>should be permitted to occupy and cultivate said lands, or that after his father\u2019s decease, should the same subject to the payment of the instalments ; and also denied that <em>H. R., Senior, </em>in pursuance of any such agreement did convey to the said defendant the said lands in part performance; that if there ever was as stated in said bill the agreement therein set forth, as above denied, resting in <em>parol, </em>there was never any part performance thereof. The answer then relied upon the statute of frauds, and alleged that at the time he contracted for the said lands the purchase money was to be paid to.if. <em>R., Senior, </em>and to no other person; that defendant bought the said lands as he would of any other person, and considered himself as a debtor to if. <em>R,, Senior, </em>and no other person, and that, no direction was at that time given to pay the purchase money to his other children. The defendant fuither alleged, that the agreement between him and if. <em>R., Senior, </em>other than the contract of purchase, as contained in the deeds, is the agreement of 3rd May, 1824, a true copy of which is filed with the bill. The answer then denied that instructions were given by if. <em>R., Senior and Junior, </em>to <em>I). B., </em>to draw an instrument different from the one thus exhibited, and that if any other exists, it is not in writing and is void in the absence of fraud or mistake. The answer admitted the execution of the bonds and the use, possession and enjoyment of the Jand by if, <em>R., Senior, </em>and objected that the agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>of 3rd May, 1824, was not acknowledged nor recorded, and therefore inoperative to pass a freehold; and then admitted the deed to <em>Warfield, </em>and <em>Fox, </em>and their attempt to sell the land, but denied that the bonds were a lien on the land in the hands of his said trustees or those purchasing from them. The answer also denied that there was any agreement between him and his father or brothers and sisters, that the said bonds should be liens, but that he held a free and unincumbered estate in the land; that he was forced to apply for relief under the insolvent laws, and there are many judgments against him now unpaid. The defendant also answered that it was true the bonds were given in consideration of the whole purchase money, which remains to be paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-5\">The answer of Warfield and Fox, the trustees, &amp;c., took substantially the same grounds of defence as that of their co-defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-6\">The general replication was filed, and a commission issued to take proof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-7\">Under the commission, the draftsman of the agreement was examined, who proved that he drew the deed of 16th May, 1823, but it was not executed in his presence; that when the parties, the father and son came before him to execute the agreement of 3rd May, 1824, they had not agreed upon the amount of the purchase money, but ultimately, in consideration of <em>M. R., Junior, </em>contending that the land did not hold out as stated in the two deeds of 1823, and in consideration of the provision for <em>Mrs. C. Repp, </em>the price was reduced from a sum not recollected, to $10,000, and that no part of the consideration had been paid at that time. The same witness proved the bonds, and the object of giving them, viz: to secure four-fifths of the purchase money; and that the agreement and bonds contained and carry out the views and purposes of the parties, and that he had no knowledge of any other agreement. There was some other proof not deemed material, as the facts are admitted in the answers. Proof of various judgments against <em>11. 11., Junior, </em>rendered in 1836, 1837 and 1838, was also filed, with the record of his application for relief under the insolvent law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The case was submitted <em>for </em>final <em>decree, </em>waiving all matters <em>of form </em>and want of parties, agreeing that the land had been sold for <em>$ </em>10,710, and that the bond-holders should have the same remedy and rights against the proceeds as the land itself, and the county court, (A. Shriver, A. J.,) by consent, dismissed the bill <em>pro forma </em>on the 22nd July, 1841, when the complainants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b356-5\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, C. J., Stephen, Archer, Dorsey, Chambers and Spence* J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-6\">By Palmer for the appellant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-7\">After adverting to the facts, maintained, that a deed to take effect <em>in futuro, </em>was not a deed of bargain and sale, hut a covenant to stand seized until the future day comes. The agreement of 1824, under hand and seal, worked that result upon the deeds of 1823, as respects <em>Repp, Junior, </em>and those claiming under him, and also left the merits open on this argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-8\">As a general rule, the vendor has a lien for purchase money. What are the exceptions to that rule? Upon what are they founded? Are the children of <em>Repp, Senior, </em>entitled to that lien? The bonds were not given to the vendor,, but to those children? The father intended the children should have the land. This is-the same here as a conveyance to them. The vendee must pay the purchase money before he gets clear of the lien. The lien exists in equity, and there the land is the vendor\u2019s until paid for. It is against conscience to take and not to pay. The vendee is a trustee for the vendor until payment. This is so in part or in the whole. If the property is sold by the vendee ahd not paid for, the purchaser may be affected by this lien for the sum due the vendor. Payment to the vendee, by a purchaser after notice of such lien, would not discharge the vendor\u2019s right. 2 <em>Sto. Eq. </em>462, 464. Liens generally arise from constructive trusts \u2014 as contracts to convey. Trusts raised by implication of law are not within the statute of frauds. If the vendor agrees to trust the <em>personal credit of </em>the buyer, this is an exception, and a waiver of the lien. <em>Ib. </em>470. The burthen of proof of displacing a lien is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>on the purchaser. If doubtful the lien attaches. <em>Ib. </em>471. Taking a security is only a presumption of waiver under cir~ cumstances, that is, a security independent of the purchaser yet this only shifts the burthen of proof. 1 <em>Simon and </em>Stuart, 434.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-5\">Then a purchaser with notice is affected before purchase money paid. 2 <em>Sto. Eq. </em>483. By the agreement of May 1834, the purchase money was to be paid to the brothers and sisters, and at the father\u2019s death. The money belonged to the children. There was a privity of contract in equity. It was a family arrangement. In equity it is the father\u2019s land, hence his children, owners of the purchase money, have the same equity. Such is the reason and common sense of the thing* and there is no reason why the lien does not exist.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-6\">It is supposed the children are third parties and not entitled to the lien. The case of 7 <em>Wheaton, </em>46, presented that question, but it was not decided. The cases of 3 <em>Atk. </em>272 and 2 <em>P. Wms. </em>291, are at the base of the opinion, that a lien will not pass to third persons, but they are overruled. It has been extended to legatees and assignees. In 4 <em>Harr. &amp; John. </em>522, it was awarded to a third party. So where a security pays the debt, the law assigns the lien as an incident of the debt. The lien may be transferred by contract. The cases relied on against the right are overruled by 15 <em>Ves. </em>345; 9 <em>Ves. </em>209; 4 <em>Russ. </em>423; 8 <em>Simons, </em>189. In favor of the assignees of the father, the children, and to show the lien passes to them, the counsel cited \u2014 2 <em>Burr. </em>969. 2 <em>Gallison, </em>155. 4 <em>Pick. </em>131. 5 <em>Cow. </em>202. 1 <em>John. </em>581. 3 <em>John, cases, </em>322, 11 <em>John. </em>598. 7 <em>G. </em>&amp; <em>J. </em>120. 2 <em>Am.

The act of 1805, ch. 110, sect. 5, only relates to the insolvent\u2019s funds and the mode of their distribution, and provision is made for judgments, liens arid incumbrances; it does not disturb the general law, and assignees under deeds of trust take the thing conveyed, subject to all the equities which exist at the date of their deeds. 2 <em>Sto. Eq. </em>481. 2 <em>Sug. on V. </em>82, 74. 6 <em>Ves. n, a, </em>95, collects all the cases on this head. 34 <em>Law Lib. </em>327. 12 <em>Ves. </em>346. 2 <em>Ves. </em>&amp; <em>Bea. </em>309. 2 <em>Ed.

A judgment is a general lien, contracts are specific liens. A judgment, binds what the defendant had. It gives no interest. It is but an authority to sell, a bare authority to convert the property, so that it ought not to prevail over a specific right. 2 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>64. 1 P. <em>Wms. </em>278. 1 <em>Paige, </em>125.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-6\">The possession of <em>Repp, Senior, </em>is sufficient to put all parties upon enquiry. It was notice at the time of the judgments rendered to the trustee. A secret equity cannot be set up against a judgment. But this is not a latent equity so long as the father remained in open use and occupation, which is notice. 10 <em>G. </em>&amp; <em>J. </em>324. 16 <em>Ves. </em>220. 1 <em>Sto. Eq. </em>388.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-7\">There is a trust of some kind for the benefit of the children, the bond-holders. The deed is not in fact what it purports in fact to be. It is contradicted by the fact which shows a family settlement, that ought to be enforced upon the death of the father, and denies that all the estate should be given to <em>Repp, Junior. </em>The agreement of fhe 3rd May. The bonds and possession of the father demonstrate the transaction, and let in the parol proof to explain doubtful parts, not to create the trust, but merely to mark its character. Thus the case is not within the statute of frauds. <em>Willis on Trust, </em>20, 21. Any form of writing admitting the existence of a trust, lets in parol proof to show its character and nature.

Ven. </em>83, 75. 2 <em>Ves. </em>&amp; <em>Be. </em>83. 12 <em>Ves. </em>192.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-7\">2. The lien of the vendor was extinguished or waived by the agreement, marked exhibit C, and the bonds for the purchase money executed to third persons by direction of vendor. 1 <em>Paige, 20.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-8\"><em>3. </em>The lien of the vendor is confined to him, and his personal representatives, after his death, and is not assignable; but if assignable, the assignment must be in writing, and cannot be established by parol in favor of the assignee. 1 Bland, 519, 522. <em>Ambler, </em>724.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-9\">4. If the bonds are tantamount to an assignment of the purchase money, they contain no guarantee on the part of the assignor, for the payment thereof; and the assignee having no recourse against the assignor, cannot assert through him, the lien of the vendor for the purchase money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-10\">The obligees are assignees of the debt and not of the lien. The vendor directed the purchase money to be paid to them. The debt existed eleven months before the execution of the bonds. Then they are only an assignment of so much of the purchase money. 1 <em>Paige, </em>501. 2 <em>Sto. Eq. </em>428, <em>No. 2. </em>4 <em>H. &amp; J. 522. 2 H. </em>&amp; <em>J. </em>89, 87. 2 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>J, </em>508. 5 H. &amp; 42. 10 <em>Ohio Rep. </em>318. 7 <em>G. </em>&amp; <em>J. 120.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>5. The obligees in said bonds claim as donees under the vendor, and can only claim as such obligees; or in other words, as bond creditors of the vendee, and as such they cannot come in competition with the judgment creditors of the said vendee, under the said insolvent laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-5\">6. That there is no trust arising by construction or implication of law, and that there is no express trust sufficiently created or made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-6\">7. That the said bonds are not a lien as against the said trustees of <em>H. Repp, Junior, </em>nor as against creditors generally.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b360-7\">By the Court\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">This court being of opinion that a lien for the balance of the purchase money on the land conveyed by <em>Henry Repp, Senior, </em>to <em>Henry Repp, Junior, </em>for the amount of the bonds of said <em>Henry Repp, Junior, </em>(principal and interest,) in favor of his four brothers and sisters, is established, as well against the said <em>Henry Repp, Junior, his </em>judgment and general creditors, and all the defendants in this cause, to be paid out of the proceeds of the said land, do hereby reverse the decree of <em>Frederick </em>county court, with costs, and order that this cause be remanded to said court as a court of equity, for the purpose of taking an account, and that the rights of the complainants may be ascertained and decreed upon in severalty, according to the principles and terms of this decree, and their equity in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">DECREE REVERSED WITH COSTS, AND CAUSE REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Buchanan, C.
