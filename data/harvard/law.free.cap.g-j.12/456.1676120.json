Lloyd </em>and <em>William George Read:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">We state, that when the said cause was before us as referees, the plaintiff claimed for an item of $3,006.70, for which said <em>John Gross, </em>in his administration account, as administrator of <em>Sebastian Iliclcley, </em>deceased, had obtained credit in July, 1829, without having paid it. On the other hand the defendant\u2019s counsel contended, that that item was not open for our examination, because the opinion and decree of the Court of Appeals of <em>Maryland, </em>in the case of <em>Gross, </em>administrator c. t. a. of <em>Sebastian Hickley vs. Susanna </em>Hickley, administratrix, &amp;c., on appeal from the orphans court, was conclusive as to it, and that it was not submitted to us in the above cause. The evidence in relation to said item was taken, subject to said objection and exception of the defendant\u2019s counsel. On consideration, it was decided by us, as referees, that although the said opinion and decree of the Court of Appeals were entitled to our highest respect and consideration, yet as that decree remanded the cause for further proof in the orphans court, and was in a different suit, and as evidence was before us on this point, which was not in the record before the Court of Appeals, by which new evidence it was perfectly clear to us, that said <em>John Gross </em>had not in fact paid the said sum of $3,006.70, at the time he so obtained credit for it in his administration account aforesaid, but only paid at that time $500, and afterwards, on the 11th July, 1830, he paid on account, of it the further sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>of $500, and afterwards, on 2nd February, 1833, he paid the further sum (on said account,) of $1,066.89, and no more; and it further being proved to us, that in the settlement made between said Gross, as administrator of <em>Sebastian Hickley, </em>with <em>William Hickley, </em>on 20th January, 1833, (paper A,) that said <em>William Hickley </em>acted on the belief that said <em>John Gross </em>had only obtained credit on his administration accounts of <em>Sebastian Hickley's </em>estate for what he had actually paid, and that in said settlement, the fact of this item of $3,006.70, or part of it, was still outstanding against said estate, was not taken into consideration, we the said referees, in making up our said award, charged said <em>John </em>Gross with the debt of $3,006.70, and also $100, (the reason for which we do not now recollect, though we were satisfied at the time, that said additional charge of $100 was correct, and suppose now it was on account of the difference of interest from July, 1829, when <em>Gross </em>got credit for it,) and in said award we credited said <em>Gross </em>with the payments which he had in fact made on account of said $3,006.70, to wit, with $500 paid in July, 1829; $500 paid on 11th July, 1830, and $1,066.89, paid on 2nd February, 1833, and also charged and credited various other matters, which we understand, it is not material here to state. It was also in proof before us, that a certain receipt, (or receipts, as <em>Mr. Read </em>thinks,) w'hich, in the aforesaid opinion of the Court of Appeals, was treated as in the possession of and belonging to said <em>John Gross, </em>did not belong to him, but was the property of and in the possession of <em>John I. Gross, </em>as the administrator of the above named <em>William Hickley. </em>John J. Lloyd,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-5\"><em>1th October, </em>1841.

Lloyd, </em>one of the arbitrators, that it was not his habit to state the reasons for his awards on the face of the awards, unless the parties requested it before it was known by them how it was to be decided, and that when he did not state the reasons on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>face of the award, it was not his habit to disclose the reasons after the award was rendered, not because he was unwilling that they should be known, but because he did not think it just to give the party against whom it was made such an advantage, after having taken the chance of an award in his favor. That in the present case, the counsel for the defendants had called on witness and <em>Mr. Read </em>to give them a statement of the grounds on which the award was made, and they had declined assigning therefor the reasons above stated, but both witness and <em>Mr. Read </em>stated to them that they were willing to give such a statement if the counsel on both sides consented to it, or if the court should direct it. After this the written statement was made in order to prevent delay, in case the said <em>Lloyd </em>and <em>Read </em>should be absent, and it was handed to the counsel, subject to the same objections as if the arbitrators had been on the witness\u2019 stand. On its being arranged between the court and counsel that we should go out and make the statement subject to exceptions, we read the written statement as his testimony, and proved that when the said reference took place, the said <em>William George Read </em>and <em>John J. Lloyd </em>were attorneys of this court, have been, and still are.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-5\">The plaintiff further read without objection the affidavits of <em>George Gordon Belt </em>and <em>John 1. </em>Gross, heretofore filed by the plaintiff' in this cause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-6\">\u201c The State of Maryland, use of Susanna Hickley, administratrix, with the will annexed of Catharine Hickley, <em>vs. </em>David Stewart and John I.

That the reference in this case gave the referees the power of deciding upon all claims or demands involved in, or within the scope of the action referred, and all matters in controversy between the parties, and especially upon the propriety and justice of the allowance claimed and given in the accounts of said <em>John Gross, </em>as administrator of <em>Sebastian Hiekley, </em>(as settled in the orphans court,) for the alleged payment of the debt due to <em>Shorb </em>by said <em>Hiekley.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-10\">2nd. That the extent and effect of said reference could not be in any degree qualified or restricted, nor the right of the referees to decide upon the justice of the said allowance for <em>Shorb\u2019s </em>debt, as a matter in fact in controversy between the parties, in any respect affected by the mere undivulged impressions or belief of <em>Gross, </em>or his counsel, as to the extent of the reference, even if the evidence of the same were admissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>3rd. The decree of this court was not final and conclusive, so as forever to debar the appellant in this case from controverting the right of said <em>Gross </em>to the said allowance made him for <em>Shorb\u2019s </em>debt, in his accounts, as settled in the orphans court; and that either, upon the trial of the action on the bond in <em>Baltimore </em>county court, or of the matters referred before the referees, it was competent to said appellant, notwithstanding said decree, to controvert <em>Gross, </em>right to said allowance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-5\">4th. That whether said decree was or was not final, the said appellant might, at the trial of the action on said bond, have objected, that the same was not final, and was entitled to have that question tried and decided; that the question, as to the effect of said decree, was open to contest, and was in fact, a matter in dispute; and that the said action, and all matters in controversyhaving been referred, the decision of the referees upon the effect and conclusiveness of said decree, was final and conclusive, (and above all, in a case where the referees were attorneys or legal arbitrators,) and that the court below had no right to review or correct their decision, on that or any other question that arose in the trial before the referees, even if erroneous, there being nothing on the face of the award disclosing any such error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-6\">5th. That even if the arbitrators exceeded their authority in disallowing the allowance for <em>Shorb\u2019s </em>debt, the court below erred in setting aside the whole award.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b475-7\">By J.
