That the sale made by the sheriff passed no title to'the purchaser, because the proceedings do not describe with sufficient legal certainty the premises levied upon and sold. <em>Thomas vs. </em>Turvey, 1 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>Gill </em>435. <em>Williamson vs. </em>Perkins, 1 <em>Harr. &amp; John. </em>452. <em>Clarke vs. Belmear, </em>1 <em>Gill </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>443, 448.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-5\">In the argument upon this point in relation to the d\u00e9fective description of the property, if was objected\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-6\">1st. That the second deed made by the sheriff on the 25th day of June, 1836, and the paper executed'on the 12th May, 1824, by the defendant in the judgment t\u00f3 the purchaser, and the act of the defendant professing to transfer the possession, are each and all of them, inadmissible as evidence to cover the defect in the description of the property contained' in the levy and proceedings under the <em>fieri facias, </em>and cannot be used for the1 purpose of identifying the land sol'd, and \u2014 2nd. That if such evidence be admissible, it cannot have'the effect of remedying the insufficiency of the levy, return' and first deed made by the sheriff, in which the property seized, sold and conveyed, is described as \u201cpart of a tract of land called <em>Palmer\u2019s </em>Forrest.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-7\">Again, the <em>fieri fad as </em>was exhausted many years since, and the power under it cannot now be exercised anew. Thepurchaser must se\u00e9 that the proceedings are right, and this within a reasonable period. The return, if amendable, must be amended on motion and leave' of the court. How far back will the court go on'such a motion? What sort of leave will they grant? The act of 1813, chap. 102, sec. 4, relates to omissions by the selling sheriff to make any deed. It does not affect those cases where a defective deed has been delivered, and give power to heal that. Amendments to sheriffs\u2019 proceedings must be made while his proceedings are in <em>fieri. Waters vs. Peach, </em>3 <em>Gill &amp; John. </em>408.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-8\">Hence his second deed of June, 1836, was too late.

That if the sale made by the sheriff was not void owing to the insufficiency of the description of the property, it could pass no title as against the appellant, because he was not made a party to the proceedings, or warned as the tenant, under the <em>scire facias </em>which issued to revive the judgment after he had acquired title to the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad4N\">Where a <em>scire facias </em>issues, every person having an interest in the land must be made a party. <em>Arnott </em>&amp; <em>Copper vs. </em>Nicholls, 1 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>471. <em>McEldery vs. </em>Smith, 2 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>72. <em>Hanson vs. Barnes, </em>3 <em>Gill &amp; John. </em>365; 2 <em>Harr.

That if the sale made by the sheriff was valid, and no <em>scire facias </em>warning the appellant necessary, still it will be insisted, that the deed under which the appellant claims, conferred a title paramount to that acquired by the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale. That after the lapse of the period within which <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Wilson </em>might have issued execution on their judgment, but neglected to do so, its lien was suspended, and the mortgage to the appellant <em>Murphy </em>obtained priority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-7\">The mortgage in this case under the circumstances, is the principal lien. Lapse of time here, is the loss of the lien. This lets in the mortgagee. The <em>scire facias </em>is a new judgment.

A warrant of re-survey thereupon issued, and plots were returned, after which the plaintiff and defendant filed a written statement of facts, from which it will appear\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-5\">That the appellant claims title to the premises in question, under a mortgage from one <em>John </em>Dallam, the former owner of the land in question-, dated on the 6th of February, 1822, with a condition annexed, that the same should be void on payment of $1,250, on or before the 6th February, 1824, and which has not yet been paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-6\">It will further appear, that the said <em>John Dallam,, </em>(the former proprietor-, and under whom both appellant and appellee claim title,), was lawfully seized- in fee of the premises in question, on and before the 12th March, 1821; on which day a judgment was rendered against him in <em>Harford </em>county court, at the suit of a certain <em>Johnson </em>and Wilson, which was after-wards revived by <em>scire faciasy </em>issued ' on the 21st February, 1823, and a <em>fiat </em>thereon entered on 9th March, 1824.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-7\">That a <em>fieri facias </em>issued on-the said judgment so revived on the 6th April, 1824, under which- the sheriff levied on the said land called <em>\u201cPalmer\u2019s </em>Forrest,\u201d and made the following return \u2014 \u201c7th May, 1824, sold all the right of <em>John Dallam, in </em>and to all the lands mentioned and described in the schedule, filed with the writ to <em>William D. Lee </em>for $1,741.09, and satisfied plaintiff\u2019s attorney $1,102.17, exclusive of commissions, and satisfied sheriff the residue.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-8\">And the schedule referred to and returned with said <em>fieri facias, </em>described the lands so sold by the sheriff, as follows :: \u201cPart of a tract of land called <em>\u201cPalmer's </em>Forrest,\u201d containing 825 acres, more- or less ; also part of one other tract of land called <em>Fox </em>Harbor,\u201d containing 27 acres, more or less. All which said land is now in the possession of the said <em>John Dallam, </em>appraised to $12 per acre.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-9\">It will alko appear, that on the 12th May, 1824, (five days after the sale,) the said <em>John Dallam, </em>(.the defendant in said <em>fieri </em>facias-, and-the party in possession-of said land,) surren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>dered the complete possession thereof to the said <em>Lee, </em>the purchaser, and executed at same time a formal deed of surrender of the land so sold, describing said tract therein as \u201cthe farm on which I now live, called <em>\u201cPalmer\u2019s </em>Forrest,\u201d containing 320 of land, more or less that said <em>Lee, </em>the purchaser, continued in possession thereof from that time until his death, which happened in August 1828; that said <em>Lee, </em>before his death, duly made his last will, and devised the said land to his two sons, <em>John B. Lee </em>and <em>Alfred B. Lee; </em>and that the appellee, as the tenant of said devisees, has been in possession of said land from the death of said <em>William B. Lee </em>to this time. It will also appear, that the said sheriff, on the 4th October, 1824, executed a deed to said <em>Lee, </em>the purchaser; and that on the 25th of June, 1836, the said sheriff executed another deed to the said devisees of the said <em>Lee, </em>for the purpose of conveying said land by a more accurate and certain description ; and therein the said land was fully set out and described by courses and distances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-5\">The county court thereupon gave judgment for the appellee, who will insist that the same should be affirmed for the following reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-6\">1st. Because the said <em>William D. Lee, </em>under whom the said appellee claims, purchased the said land under a <em>fieri facias </em>duly issued and executed, on a judgment older than the mortgage under which said appellant claims.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-7\">As to the character of the lien on lands at common law arising from judgment, 2 <em>Cru. Dig. </em>73; and that the execution relates to the judgment. 1 <em>Comyn. Dig. </em>245, <em>Ex. Letter D. </em>2 <em>Saunders R. </em>8, <em>note k.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-8\">A <em>scire facias </em>is not a new action. It is a judicial writ founded on matter of record. A release of all executions is a good bar to a <em>scire facias. </em>In no case where the original defendant is alive; where there is no act by law divesting him of all his rights, as in bankruptcy or marriage, has it been held necessary to warn any person claiming a part of the defendant\u2019s property to come in and defend a <em>scire facias. </em>A <em>terre tenant </em>need not be warned in conjunction with the original defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The defendant\u2019s interest must be gone and extinguished entirely, before other parties are to be brought in. 2 <em>Saun.

C. R. </em>269, contains a lucid review of the <em>English </em>cases on this subject. 7 <em>Law Lib. </em>136, 137. 13 <em>fiaw Lib. </em>69. <em>Jackson vs. Bartlett, </em>8 <em>John. </em>361. <em>Barney vs. Patterson, </em>6 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>204.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-4\">2nd. That the sheriff\u2019s return of said sale, accompanied as it was by the immediate transfer of possession, and the other circumstances identifying the land sold, is not so defective as to avoid the sale, and authorize the appellant to recover the land in this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-5\">The sheriff.\u2019s return is not incurably defective, but is sufficient <em>per se, </em>to pass the title. The land is identified by the words actual possession of <em>John Dallam. </em>This makes the return certain. Actual possession may be located and conveyed. <em>Fenwick vs. Floyd, </em>1 <em>Harr. &amp; Gill, </em>172. <em>Berry vs. </em>Griffith, 2 <em>Harr. &amp; Gill, </em>337. <em>Clark vs. Belmear, </em>1 <em>Gill John. </em>444.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-6\">3rd. That if the said return is so .defective, any such defects are abundantly healed by the two deeds which said sheriff subsequently executed. <em>Estep </em>&amp; <em>Hall vs. Weems, </em>6 <em>G. &amp; J. </em>303. <em>Carroll vs. Norwood, </em>5 <em>H. &amp; J. </em>173.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-7\">R. Johnson, also for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayv\">insisted\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-8\">1, That the sheriff\u2019s sale duly returned gives the purchaser title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-9\">2. Whatever is <em>levied </em>upon, however insufficient in description, may be sold, and the description amended by the subsequent proceedings; from these principles it results.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW8\">3. That the purchaser may look at all the proceedings emanating officially from the sheriff. He may look at the return to this <em>fieri facias. </em>The return to the <em>venditioni exponas: </em>and lastly, to the deed, whenever executed. The purchaser does not ,claim under the deed, but under all the proceedings, to. 'identify what was <em>originally </em>seized.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>4. The purchaser\u2019s title is a judicial conveyance. The deed when it is a judicial conveyance, comprises all the proceedings from judgment down. The whole constitutes the conveyance. It is valid or invalid, on the ground of uncertainty, like all other conveyances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-5\">Is not the title sufficient under the return of the <em>fieri facias </em>alone ? Its language is sufficient to validate a deed between parties. The action is brought for <em>Palmer\u2019s Forrest. </em>It is sufficiently identified by the return that on principles of location, the purchased part might be located. The degree of certainty depends upon the fact of whether, with the description the parts sold can be located. A part of that tract was certainly purchased. Who has the paramount title to that part \u2014 the part \u201cnow (then) in the possession of <em>John Dallam.\u201d </em>If those words exclude all other portions of <em>Palmer\u2019s Forrest, </em>except the 325 acres claimed, then it is conceded that they refer only to the part in his possession. The 325 acres are then identified. The question is the same as on a deed from <em>John Dallam. </em>If he had so conveyed the part, could it be located ? If ambiguity arises upon matter out of the return or deed, it may be cleared up by proof. There is no evidence to show the contents of <em>Palmer\u2019s Forrest; </em>nor proof of any more land in his possession. <em>Dallam </em>admits by his deed that <em>Lee </em>purchased all of <em>Palmer\u2019s Forrest, </em>which he <em>Dallam </em>then had. The plaintiff\u2019s own title is a conveyance; is <em>for </em>just the same quantity of 325 acres. All the proof confirms the fact that 325 acres were in the possession of <em>Dallam. </em>The title is to be reasonably construed; and it is to be presumed the sheriff acted rightfully. This is for the advantage of both parties. Before this return can be vacated, the court must interpolate words giving it another meaning. Under ordinary construction, it is certain enough. It is a seizure of what defendant had in his possession. Every word of the return must have its appropriate meaning. Then why did the return speak of possession at all? Why describe the part taken as, in possession \u2014 but for identification. If that be so, there is an end of this question. <em>Thomas vs. Turvey, </em>1 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>Gill, </em>435.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>If there was any defect, then it was cured by the deed of 1836. It professes to be a deed of confirmation. In 1 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>Gill, </em>174, this court says: \u201cThe sale may be proved by deed \u2014 or a return \u2014 or a memorandum to take the cause out of the statute of frauds.\u201d In 1 <em>Harr. &amp; </em>Gill, 439, the question is put on the ground that affects an <em>ordinary </em>conveyance. That case does not exclude the right, to look at other proceedings than the return. There must be some written evidence of title. But the title itself depends on the fact of purchase. It does not decide that, all matter <em>dehors </em>is excluded from the consideration of the court; but that the particular matter, <em>dehors </em>relied on in that case was not sufficient. Not to be explained by matters dehors, means <em>dehors </em>in a legal sense. <em>Clark vs. Belmear, </em>1 <em>Gill </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>444. <em>Hanson vs. Barnes\u2019 Lessee, </em>3 <em>Gill </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>359, 368, 369.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-5\">The return was evidence of the sale; there was also a deed; both were sufficient. In <em>Estep and Hall vs. Weems, </em>6 <em>Gill </em>&amp; <em>John. 303, </em>an insufficient return on a <em>valid </em>sale, may be corrected by deed at any time, as legal evidence of the title. <em>Barney vs. Patterson, 6 Harr. </em>&amp; <em>John. 182, 204.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-6\">The law will not suffer the sheriff to do any thing to defeat the title. If the levy is certain on its face, or refers to some thing certain, it is sufficient. <em>Nesbit vs. Dallam, </em>7 <em>Gill </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>484.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-7\">The purchaser may look to the sheriff\u2019s deed as well as to other portions of the papers returned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-8\">Then is there any limitation of time, beyond which a defect may not be cured ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-9\">There is no injustice as to the intermediate incumbrancer, for equity would protect him, if an innocent purchaser without notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-10\">What is the case as between the defendant at law, and the purchaser of his property. He has the purchaser\u2019s money; for it has paid his debt. It is, as if he had bought from the defendant; as to him, there ought to be no limitation of time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-11\">If the court would now oblige the sheriff to correct his return, and make it conform to the truth, it would seem strange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>that he may not now do it voluntarily, for the purposes of this action. The court will enforce that done by the sheriff which they would have ordered him to do. There is no limitation but the officer\u2019s life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-5\">This judgment is a prior lien. The case in 3 <em>Bland, </em>323, 324, as to effect of lien, is doubted. The act of 1785, chap. 80, sec. 7; 1798, chap. 101, sec. 8, sec 17 show the Chancellor\u2019s error as to judgments not being liens in <em>Maryland, </em>after a year and a day, or after <em>three </em>years. Questions of priority' are settled by the dates <em>of </em>judgments. But the rule relied on at bar determines the question, not with reference to the date, but with reference to the right to sue out immediate execution. <em>2 Tidd\u2019s Pr. </em>1152. <em>Hanson vs. Barnes, </em>3 <em>Gill </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>359.
