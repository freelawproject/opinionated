These schemes were to be approved of bythe Commissioners of Lotteries. By the act of 1839, confirmed in 1840, it bocame apart of the Constitution of Maryland, that \u201cno new grant to authorize the drawing of any lottery, or the traffic or dealing in lottery tickets, or schemes or devices in the nature of lotteries, &amp;c., shall be made.\u201d The commissioners of lotteries were public officers of annual appointment. By bill filed in 1843, the <em>Town Hall Commissioners </em>complained, that while they were endeavouring to sell the tickets in their schemes, the <em>Commissioners of Lotteries, </em>since the acts of 1839-40, \u201capproved, and allowed to be availed of, (and allowed tickets therein to be sold under licenses,) <em>schemes of lotteries for the State of Maryland, and schemes of lotteries granted and authorised by other States than Maryland; </em>stamped tickets in such schemes, and issued them to contractors for sale, and under pretext of licenses emanating from such <em>Commissioners of Lotteries, </em>that the same were largely sold, thereby violating the acts of 1839-40, also seriously interfering with the sales of the complainants, in their Town Hall schemes authorised by the act of 1838. To restrain this evil their bill prayed for an injunction against the <em>Commissioners of lotteries', </em>and the persons licensed by them, in relation to the approval of tickets in the lotteries for this <em>State and other States, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>sales of tickets therein and granting licenses therefor.

Ridgely, Oliver Holmes, George G. Bell </em>and <em>Chas. F. Mayer, </em>exhibited their bill of complaint against <em>Michael McBlair, George Cooke, Samuel Scribner, Henry M. Bash, William Pyfer </em>and <em>J. G. Gregory, </em>and other persons composing the partnership of <em>J. G. Gregory and Company, </em>alleging, that by an act of the General Assembly of <em>Maryland, </em>passed at December session of 1838, chapter 323, entitled, An act in aid of the construction of a State Armory and Town Hall in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>and the re-building and improvement of the Hanover Market House in said city. Your orators (excepting Holmes,) were appointed commissioners for the purpose of raising, by sales or drawing of schemes of lotteries, the requisite sum of money for the construction of the State Armory and Town Hall, which for the public convenience and defence, it was the purpose of said act lo have erected. And your orators further show, that at their December session, 1839, chap. 52, an act supplemental to that just mentioned, was passed fay said General A.ssembly, extending the term of operation of the original act, and of the privileges and rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>conferred by said act. And your orators pray reference to said original and supplemental acts, as they appear in the printed compilations of the acts of the aforesaid sessions, and that they be deemed and taken as part of this their bill. Your orators now further state, that the <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>whose property and interest are to be availed of, and to-be affected by the said acts, and by the' structure by the same required, did, in consideration that said structures should be made, become a party to said acts of Assembly, and grant their assent, and the privilege and control to the said commissioners in respect of the use of the ground and property of said corporation, which are contemplated in the fourth section of the said original act. And your orators state, that thereupon, and to accomplish the project so devised and ordained by the <em>State of Maryland, </em>and through the said assent and concession of said corporation, so stipulated for by the <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>the commissioners aforesaid proceeded to make contracts with persons for purchase of schemes of lotteries so authorised, which contracts were performed; and finally to cause schemes of lotteries to be drawn under their own direction, they by their agents selling the tickets therein. And your orators aver, that as commissioners under the acts aforesaid, they are now engaged in carrying out the objects of said acts, by sales in manner aforesaid, with reference to the said purpose of the General Assembly, and of the <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore. </em>And your orators give your honor to know, that <em>Solomon Hillen, </em>who by said original act was appointed one of said commissioners, resigned his said office, and that <em>Oliver Holmes, </em>your orator, was duly appointed a commissioner in his place, giving bond with approved security, as did each of your orators, according to the requirements of said acts of Assembly. And your orators suggest, that being thus the constituted agents of an undertaking of much public importance, and which it is the view of the <em>State of Maryland </em>and of the <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore </em>to have accomplished as promptly as may be, and for which it is the policy and intent of said acts, that means should be pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Cured as largely and surely as practicable, your oralors are specially interested in seeing maintained all the restrictive provisions of the law and Constitution of <em>Maryland </em>touching the privilege of lotteries. And now your orators show, that certain officers, by virtue of enactments of the General Assembly of <em>Maryland, </em>have been from time to time appointed, and now are officiating, called commissioners of lotteries, representing the State in reference to the revenue derivable to her from drawings of lotteries and sales of schemes, and licenses for selling lottery tickets, whose duties however, are particularly defined and prescribed in the several relevant acts of Assembly, to which in that respect your orators refer; your orators oho wing, that the actual commissioners now are, <em>Michael McBlair </em>and <em>George Cooke. </em>Your orators further show, that by the first section of the acts of the General Assembly of <em>Maryland, </em>passed at December session 1831, chap. 79, entitled, An additional supplement to an act to amend the lottery system, the said commissioners are empowered to grant at any time after the passage of said act, a license or licenses to any person or persons, to be in force for one year from the date of the grant thereof, to sell not only tickets in any scheme or schemes of a lottery or lotteries which the said commissioners shall form and dispose of, or authorise for the benefit of the State, but also to sell tickets in any scheme or schemes of a lottery or lotteries granted by any of the States of the Union, or by the <em>United States of America, </em>and submitted to and approved <em>by </em>said commissioners, it being further provided, that the person or persons so licensed, shall at or before the obtaining of the licenses, contract with the commissioners aforesaid, for the right to draw a scheme or schemes of a lottery or lotteries within the year for which the license shall be granted, which scheme or schemes shall produce to the Slate, at least the sum of fifteen thousand dollars within said year. And your orators now state, that in pursuance of the provision of law just recited, the commissioners of lotteries have habitually made contracts with certain individuals, for the benefit of such individuals, of certain schemes of lotteries, devised or approved by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the commissioners in behalf of the State; and with reference to the yearly profit of at least fifteen thousand dollars, contemplated to be assured to the State by the terms of the act referred to;' such schemes being thus created and operative for the benefit of the <em>State of </em>Maryland; and the fruit and profit thereof commuted by the contracts aforesaid, made by the commissioners as aforesaid, with certain individuals. And your orators show further, that conformably to said acts of Assembly, the commissioners of lotteries have been accustomed to grant licenses to said contracting individuals, authorising them or their assignees of the licenses, to sell tickets of lotteries of the State as aforesaid, or of foreign lotteries of other States, or of the <em>United </em>States, within the scope of the provision already herein before set forth, as to those licenses. And your orators state and charge, that under licenses so granted by the commissioners of lotteries, and under colour of the said act of Assembly, tickets have ever since the passage of said act been sold, and are now selling within the city of <em>Baltimore </em>and in the <em>State of Maryland </em>at large, in schemes of lotteries for the State\u2019s use as aforesaid, and of lotteries granted and sanctioned by only other States of this Union, or by the <em>United States of America, </em>such sales being made not only by the contracting individuals, and the grantees of the State of the said licenses, by numerous assignees of said licenses, under transfer of them respectively from said contractors. And your orators further show, that the contractors aforesaid, for the disposal of said licenses, and the sale of tickets to those using the licenses aforesaid, as grantees of said contractors, have customarily had, and now have, agents in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>such agents receiving from the commissioners of lotteries the tickets of the various schemes; that the commissioners have approved for the dealing of said contractors and the holders of said licenses, the tickets so delivered, being stamped by said commissioners in token of the approval of the schemes, as required by the act of Assembly aforesaid, of the year 1831. And your orators state, that the persons who have contracted as aforesaid with the commissioners of lotteries, and have so contracted since the tenth day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>of March, in the year 1841, the day of the passage by the said General Assembly of the act hereinafter mentioned, entitled An act to confirm an act entitled, an act to alter and amend the Constitution, so far as it relates to the power of the Legislature to grant lotteries, passed at December session 1839, chap. 31, are <em>J. G. Gregory </em>and other persons, to your orators unknown, composing the partnership of <em>J. G. Gregory and Company; </em>and that the agents aforesaid of said contractors, acting and managing for them, in manner aforesaid, in the city of <em>Balti</em>more, are <em>Samuel Scribner, </em>and <em>William Pyfer </em>and <em>Henry M. Bash, </em>doing business as such agents and managers, under the style of partnership, of <em>S. Scribner and Company. </em>And your orators state and charge, that at the December session of the year 1839, the General Assembly of <em>Maryland, </em>contemplating the evils of unlimited lottery dealings, and of the multiplied lotteries agitating and alarming the community, and absorbing their means in many instances, to be diverted to objects of other States, and to be accomplished beyond the borders of <em>Maryland, </em>and repudiating as a source of revenue to the State, the fruits of such inordinate dealing, struck from the ordinary powers of legislature the sanction of lotteries, by passing the act entitled, An act to alter and amend the Constitution, so far as relates to the power of the Legislature to grant lotteries, declaring, that from and after the confirmation of that act by the succeeding Legislature, \u201cno new grant should be made to authorise the drawing of any lottery, or the traffic or dealing in lottery tickets, or schemes or devices in the nature of lotteries, or the distribution of money or property by chance;\u201d and your orators state, at the next succeeding session of the Legislature, on the tenth day of March, in the year 1841, by an act entitled as above, an act to confirm the aforesaid act of the session of 1839, chap. 31; the act aforesaid forbidding to the Legislature the power of lottery grants, was confirmed and made part of the Constitution of <em>Maryland;\u25a0 </em>and the State itself, disabled from continuing the practice of lottery dealing, and drawing to the treasury the premium of the mischief which the Constitution thus marked and denounced. But your orators charge, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>notwithstanding this constitutional condemnation and inhibition, the commissioners of lotteries, although the agents of the State, who has thus interdicted herself the privilege and profits of lotteries, have nevertheless, in continuance of the evil repudiated by the constitution, entered into contracts of the same scope as those permitted before this Constitutional ordinance, and have approved and allowed to be availed of, (and allowed tickets therein to be sold under licenses as aforesaid,) schemes of lotteries for the Slate of Maryland, and schemes of lotteries granted and authorised above by other States, and have stamped as aforesaid tickets in such schemes, and issued them to the contractors or their agents aforesaid, which contractors and agents your orators have above named. And your orators aver and charge, that by sanction as aforesaid by said commissioners of lotteries, and by the instrumentality of said contractors and said agents, and under pretext of the licenses aforesaid, emanating from said commissioners of lotteries, schemes are every week approved for State lotteries aforesaid, and of lotteries granted and authorised above by other States, and tickets are largely and busily sold under many licenses issued as aforesaid, by said commissioners of lotteries to said contractors, and from them passing to the numerous grantees of the licenses, said commissioners stamping and authenticating thus, or by signature, the tickets so set afloat; and thus affording every ostensible warrant and all encouragement to a transgression of a solemn constitutional rule, and misinterpreting and exceeding the limits of their constitutional duty, as agents of the State. And your orators aver and charge, that by such action of said commissioners of lotteries and of the agents and persons aforesaid, not only is that social injury done which the Constitution so studiously sought to avert, but the \u00a1undertaking to which, as aforesaid, your orators have been appointed as representatives of important purposes of the State and of the city of <em>Balti</em>more, and which the State seeks to promote, has been seriously retarded, and its interests much prejudiced; and your orators aver and charge, that the project aforesaid of the State, over which they, as aforesaid, preside, must be long delayed, if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>utterly intercepted for its accomplishment, if the unconstitutional procedure aforesaid, of which your orators now complain, be not arrested. All which is much to the grievance of your orators; in tender consideration whereof, and forasmuch asno effectual remedy can be afforded in the premises, except in this honorable court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-5\">To the end, therefore, that said <em>Michael McBlair </em>and <em>George </em>Cooke, and said <em>J.

Those questions involve\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">The right and jurisdiction of the court to grant the preventive process of an injunction, as an appropriate remedy to arrest the mischief of which the appellants complain:</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">The true construction of the constitutional amendment inhibiting lottery grants and the dealing in lottery tickets in this <em>State:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b20-8\">The competency of the complainants in point of interest, to sustain the suit, and\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b20-9\">The propriety of the <em>State's </em>being represented by its Attorney General, as a necessary party to the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-10\">In reference to the <em>first </em>question, we think that a court of equity was the proper tribunal to take cognisance of the case; and that the prohibitory process of an injunction was the proper remedy to arrest the <em>gravamen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b20-11\">The difficulty of obtaining adequate redress in a court of law, is one of the well established grounds for resorting to a court of chancery; and more especially, where it may be necessary, in the pursuit of justice, to institute a multiplicity of actions for that purpose. The injury complained of in this case would necessarily lead to that result, if redress should be sought in a court of common-law jurisdiction; and it is mainly upon that ground, that an injunction is held to be the proper remedy, to secure to a party the enjoyment of a statute privilege, where it is of an exclusive character, and does not admit of any injurious competition. In 1 <em>John. Rep. </em>615, Chancellor <em>Kent </em>says, \u201cit is settled that an injunction is the proper remedy, to \u201csecure to a party the enjoyment of a statute privilege, of \u201c which he is in the actual possession, and when his legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u201c title is not put in doubt. The <em>English </em>books are full of \u201ccases arising under this head of Equity Jurisdiction.\u201d In the same case, he says: \u201cThe equity jurisdiction in such a \u201c case is extremely benign and salutary; without it, the party \u201c would be exposed to constant and ruinous litigation; as well \u201c as to have his right excessively impaired by frauds and eva- \u201c sion.\u201d It is true the right, which the complainants seek to protect from violation in this case, is not one absolutely and entirely exclusive in its nature, but it possesses the quality and attribute of exclusiveness, at least to a qualified extent; and sufficiently so, we think, to render the principle and practice, upon which the equity jurisdiction is founded, not inapplicable. It is moreover not unworthy of consideration, that the jurisdiction of a court of equity to apply a preventive remedy in this case, has, to a considerable extent, received the sanction of the Legislature in the act of 1828, chap. 129, sec. 21, where they direct an injunction to be obtained, to prevent or restrain the drawing of lotteries, which may be unauthorised by the laws of this State. The remedy by injunction, is there spoken of, as one already in existence, and not for the first time given or created for the purpose by that act. In a case of ordinary trespass, remedial justice, in the shape of damages, is only to be obtained in a court of law; but it is now settled, that where the injury would be irreparable, or to prevent a multiplicity of suits, the interference of a court of equity may be obtained to stay the mischief by the preventive process of an injunction.

In this case Chancellor <em>Kent </em>observes, that Lord <em>Eldon </em>said in 7 <em>Ves. </em>305, that the law as to injunctions, had changed very much, and they had been granted much more liberally than formerly. We think, therefore, that under the peculiar circumstances of this case, considering the difficulty of obtaining adequate redress at law, and the probability that a multitude of suits would necessarily be instituted to protect the complainants franchise, supposing it to exist, (which upon the present occasion must be assumed to be the case,) the process of an injunction was properly applied to arrest the mischief of which the appellants complained, and that a court of equity had jurisdiction to grqnt the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The next question to be considered, is <em>the </em>competency of the Complainants to file the bill to obtain the interference of a court of equity, to protect them in the. use and enjoyment of a statute privilege, of which they were trustees for great and important public purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">By the act of Assembly under which they received the appointment of commissioners, they were invested with a highly responsible public trust; the due and faithful execution of which depended upon maintaining inviolate, the lottery privilege which had been granted to those for whom they -were constituted agents, with full power and authority to act in that capacity. A large sum of money was to be raised by the lottery grant, to enable them to accomplish the object of their appointment, and in the language of the law, full power and authority were given to them for that purpose. To- enable them -to execute this important trust, all the appropriate means necessary to that end ought to be considered as incidentally granted, so far at least as the necessity of making parties of their principals may be involved. As trustees cloat'hed with an important trust, we think they had a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the suit, to enable them to file a bill for the purpose of obtaining an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">According to the principles of equity jurisprudence, it is not necessary in all-cases, that the <em>cestuique trust, </em>or parties beneficially interested, should be parties to the suit. A familiar instance to the contrary exists in the case of executors and administrators, who may sue or-be sued, as sufficiently representing the creditors, legatees, and distributees, for whom they are trustees. In <em>Story's Eq. Plead. </em>138, it is said:- \u201cIt has \u201cbeen well remarked by an eminent author, in many case's, \u201c that the expression, that all persons interested in the subject. \u201c must be parties to the suit, is not to be understood as ex- \u201c tending to all persons who maybe consequentially interested* \u201c In all cases of bills by creditors, and legatees, the persons en- \u201c titled to the personal assets-of a deceased debtor, or testator, \u201c after payment of the debts'or legacies, are not deemed necessary parties, though interested to contest the demands of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u201c the creditors and legatees.\u201d In page 139, the same author remarks: \u201cPerhaps the true explanation of this doctrine is, \u201c that in cases of this sort, courts of equity proceed upon the \u201c analogy of the common law, which treats the personal re- \u201c presentative of the deceased debtor or testator as the regular \u201c representative of all the persons interested in the personal \u201c assets, and bound by his <em>bona fide </em>acts, so far as third per- \u201c sons are concerned. If so, the doctrine stands upon a very \u201c intelligible and reasonable footing; and we shall presently \u201c see, that in this view, it is not peculiar to this class of cases. \u201c And this leads us in the next place to suggest, that courts \u201c of equity do not require that all persons having an interest in \u201c the subject matter, should under all circumstances, be before \u201c the court as parties. On the contrary, there are cases in \u201c which certain parties before the court are entitled to be \u201c deemed the full representatives of all other persons, or at \u201cleast so far as to bind their interests under the decree, al- \u201c though they are not or cannot be made parties. Thus, for \u201c example, where real estate had been purchased by a joint \u201c fund, raised by a subscription in shares of more than two \u201c hundred and fifty subscribers, and the property had been \u201c conveyed to certain persons as trustees for the subscribers ; \u201c and afterwards a bill was brought against the trustees for the \u201c sale of the real estate, under a mortgage made in pursuance \u201c of the trust, it was held, not necessary for the subscribers to \u201cbe made parties to bill; for the trustees, by the very nature \u201c and constitution of such a trust, must be held sufficiently to \u201c represent the interest of all the subscribers, and a different \u201c doctrine would be attended with intolerable hardship and in- \u201c convenience, as it might be impossible to make all the sub- \u201c scribers parties.\u201d So, in page 171, the principle is stated to be in accordance with the above doctrine, that \u201cwhere a \u201c mortgagor has conveyed his equity of redemption to trustees, \u201c for the benefit of his other creditors, the trustees alone are \u201c generally the proper parties to a bill to redeem; and not any \u201c of the creditors entitled under the trust.\u201d We therefore think, that under the circumstances of this case, the complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>ants, as trustees invested with full and plenary power to execute the undertaking confided to their management, had a competent standing in court, to ask for and to obtain the inr junction, which was granted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The objection that the <em>State </em>ought to have been a party to the proceeding, is of no avail at the present stage of the suit. In other words, it is no ground upon which to claim a dissolution of the injunction. If a <em>necessary </em>party <em>to </em>the cause which it is now not necessary to decide, that defect may be supplied at any time before the final hearing. It is true, it is in all cases the constant aim and object of courts of equity to do complete justice, by deciding upon and settling the rights of all persons interested in the subject matter of the suit, so that the performance of the decree of the court may be perfectly safe to those who are compelled to obey it, and also that future litigation may be prevented, and a decree made which shall bind all; but this object may be attained by having the necessary parties brought before the court at any time before the final decree is passed in the cause. And if all persons interested are not made parties to the suit, the court many times,' upon hearing, will not for want of them, proceed to a decree. See <em>Wyatt's Chan. </em>299.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">There remains but one other question to be considered and decided to make a final disposition of the matters in controversy in this case; and that is, the construction which ought to be given to the constitutional amendment upon the subject' of lotteries.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">We have no doubt, that it was the object and policy of the Legislature, in adopting that amendment, to prohibit in future, not only all lottery grants by the Legislature, but all grants of licenses to deal in lotteries by the Lottery Commissioners, so far as it could be done, without affecting antecedent or prior vested rights, secured by a constitutional sanction. In confirmation of this construction, we would remark, that as early as the year eighteen hundred and thirty-five, they expressed an anxious desire that the lottery system should expire at as early a day as practicable, and to effectuate that desire, and extir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>pate the whole system, the constitutional amendment was, we think, subsequently adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">By the act of 1831, chap. 79, the Commissioners of Lotteries are authorised to grant licenses to sell tickets, either in foreign or domestic lotteries, to be in force for the term of one year from the date thereof; and by the constitutional amendment, which originated in 1839, chap. 31, and was confirmed in 1840, chap. 261, it is provided, that &lt;cno new grant shall \u201c be made to authorise the drawing of any lottery, or the traffic <em>\u201c </em>or dealing in lottery tickets, or schemes, or devices in the <em>\u201c </em>nature of lotteries, or the distribution of money or property <em>\u201c </em>by chance.\u201d This language, we think, is too explicit tobe misunderstood. The term grant, is used indiscriminately as applicable, not only to the drawing of lotteries, but to licenses to sell tickets in any scheme or schemes of lotteries, which shall be approved by the said commissioners. The prohibition, therefore, was not exclusively confined to grants of lottery privileges by the Legislature, but was manifestly intended to cover the whole system of dealing in lotteries, and to prohibit likewise the granting of licenses to sell tickets by the Lottery Commissioners, and the sale of schemes by them. No other construction would, we think, be warranted by the terms used, or be calculated to carry into effect the policy and design of the Legislature in adopting the constitutional amendment. The object to be accomplished was the suppression of a great moral evil, and to effect so praiseworthy and laudable a purpose, the construction should be a benign and liberal one. A limited interpretation of the Constitution, confining the prohibition to legislative grants, whilst it would be inefficient and inoperative in alone suppressing the mischief, by leaving the door still open to foreign lotteries, would at the same time impute to the Legislature the folly and absurdity of accomplishing (he contemplated object only by halves. It is true, the title of the act is calculated to give countenance to such a confined and limited construction' \u2014 '\u201cit is to amend the Constitution, so far as relates to the power of the Legislature to grant lotteries.\u201d But the title of the act, and the preamble <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>to the act, are, strictly speaking, no part of it, though they may be resorted to in explanation of the enacting clause, if it be doubtful; or to restrain its generality, when it would be inconvenient if not restrained. This is the whole extent of the influence of the title and preamble in the construction of a statute. See 1 <em>Kent's Com. </em>460, 461. The same author says, that \u201cthe true meaning of the statute is generally and properly to be sought from the body of the act itself.\u201d Looking therefore in this case to the body of the act for the meaning of the Legislature, we think that their intention is too clearly expressed to admit of controversy; and that such intention was a total suppression in future, of all lottery grants by the Legislature; and of all licenses to deal in lotteries by the Lottery Commissioners, or sales of schemes by them. In adopting the constitutional enactment of 1839, it was not the design of the Legislature to interfere with existing private lottery giants, or to restrict or impair the powers it before possessed of regulating the same, or modifying or changing the means or mode by which such grants might be more effectually or speedily accomplished. Such legislation would promote rather than conflict with the constitutional provision, and tend to hasten the epoch when to draw a lottery in Maryland was no longer tolerated by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">ORDER REVERSED AND CAUSE REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
