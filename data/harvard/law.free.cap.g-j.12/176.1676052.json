That under the plea of his discharge under the insolvent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>laws, it was sufficient for the insolvent to prove his final discharge, and that it was not incumbent on him to exhibit the preliminary proceedings under his insolvent petition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-5\">2. That the order of the court awarding to the appellant a final discharge under the insolvent laws, was an adjudication by the court of the regularity of all <em>the antecedent </em>proceedings, which cannot be collaterally enquired into.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-6\">On the 2nd exception, it will be insisted\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-7\">1.

That the acceptance of the judgment, subject to the defendant\u2019s final discharge, was an admission of such final dispharge, and sufficient to bar the plaintiff\u2019s right of execution, as against the property of the defendant, subsequently acquired by purchase, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-10\">On the 3rd exception, it will be insisted\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-11\">That the property of the insolvent was transferred by operation of law to his trustee; that the deed from him to his trustee was consequently unnecessary; and that the court erred in deciding that his discharge was irregularly obtained and void, because of the supposed insufficiency of the acknowledgments of said deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-12\">On the 4th exception, it will be insisted\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-13\">That the omission in the <em>scire facias </em>\u201cto recite the suggestion of the defendant\u2019s discharge under the insolvent laws,\u201d was fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery under the issue joined on th&lt;5 plea of <em>nul. tiel record, </em>to sustain which the said judgment was offered in evidence by the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-14\">By Tuck and Randall, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-15\">\u2022The appellees will contend, on the 1st exception\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>1. That to support this issue it was incumbent on the defendant to produce the whole record of the insolvent\u2019s proceedings, and show by them a strict compliance with the acts of Assembly; that these docket entries in themselves are no evidence at all, unless preceded by such regular proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-5\">On the 2nd exception\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-6\">2. That the plea of <em>nul liel record, </em>as to the judgment in the <em>scire facias </em>stated, was, on leave granted to the defendant by order of court withdrawn, and therefore no such prayer as that contained in this bill of exceptions could be made, there being no foundation for it in the pleadings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-7\">3. That if the court could entertain such a prayer, they were correct in rejecting it, because the docket entries cannot control the original record of the judgment, which does not appear to be, nor is pretended to be, rendered subject to this discharge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-8\">4. That if so rendered subject to this discharge under the insolvent laws, advantage of this discharge could not be taken by the plea of <em>nul liel record, </em>&amp;c.; but the discharge must be specially pleaded, and the whole proceedings fully set out, and shown to be in conformity to the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-9\">On the 3rd exception\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-10\">5.
