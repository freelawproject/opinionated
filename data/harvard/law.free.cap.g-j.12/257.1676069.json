Y. Walsh for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUUB\">who maintained, that the act of 1840, chap. 211, was unconstitutional so far as it invests the judges of the city court with discretion to refuse to remove a cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-5\">That the act of 1805, chap. 65, was also unconstitutional; that the act of 1804- was imperative on the courts, until the Legislature provided some other remedy for a party indicted, to aid him in and secure to him the privilege of removing cause. The act of 1805 was no remedy; it gave no relief to the prisoner; it was a restriction upon his rights under the con*1 stitution as amended in 1804.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b267-6\">By Richardson, for the State\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-7\">I take no objection to this writ of error, that it was sued out before final judgment; before sentence. There is an important practical question involved in it, which we are desirous of having finally decided, and as speedily as may be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-8\">If a broad privilege is confirmed by the act of 1804,1 agree that it cannot be restricted by a single act of the Legislature. But is the <em>49th </em>section of that act obligatory ; mandatory upon the courts of original jurisdiction, or is it merely permissive. It says, it shall and maybe lawful for the courts to remove \u2014 is this imperative or discretionary ? It must be discretionary, for the Legislature is authorised by a single act, without altering the constitution, to provide another and further remedy in the premises. What is such further and other remedy? A remedy for what? That the Legislature may impose some restriction is decided. 6 <em>Harr. &amp; John. </em>270. It means, that the Legislature may remedy the evils resulting from the change of the constitution as provided by the act of 1804, and hence the act of 1841 is clearly constitutional.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b267-9\">Chambers, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1o\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">The court consider the case of <em>Dashiell and the </em>State, 6 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>J </em>268, conclusive upon this question. It is there said \u201cthe act of 1805 does not attempt to deprive the party of this right, but only points out the manner and terms upon which it shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>be enjoyed. It is not repugnant to the act of 1804, but only directs in detail how the general provisions of that act shall be carried into operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Without the aid of such decisive authority, it would require the most plain and palpable contradiction in the two enactments to force upon the court the conclusion, that the act of 1804 was violated by the provisions of the act of 1805, passed as it was by the same Legislature who adopted and ratified the act of 1804, thereby making it a part of the constitution, not only at the very moment when they had thus re-enacted it, but by the very act which was designed to carry out into full operation and effect the system which it was intended to introduce.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">We are driven to no such imperative necessity, but are of opinion, that the reserved power to legislate further in the premises, was intended specifically to authorise a detailed system, prescribing the \u201cmanner and terms\u201d to be observed by parties who are entitled to the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
