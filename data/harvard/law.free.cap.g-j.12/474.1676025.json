It is an amicable proceeding, instituted for the purpose of satisfying some of the legatees upon the question, whether the widow of <em>Morgan Harris </em>is entitled to a share of the personal estate of <em>Gwinn Harris. Gwinn Harris </em>executed his last will and testament in June, 1834, which was duly admitted to record in the orphans court of <em>Charles </em>county, by which he bequeathed to <em>Morgan Harris </em>one-fourth of his estate, after deducting the payment of certain legacies. <em>Morgan Harris </em>died in 1835, leaving a widow and five children. <em>Gwinn Harris, </em>the testator, survived <em>Morgan Harris, </em>and departed this life in August, 1837. By consent of parties, the orphans court of <em>Charles </em>county decreed, that <em>Etheldra J. Harris </em>should be paid by <em>Joseph Harris, </em>the executor of <em>Gwinn Harris, </em>one-third part of one-fourth of the residue of the personal estate of <em>Gwinn Harris.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-8\">It is contended by the children of <em>Morgan Harris, </em>that his widow is not entitled to any portion of the personal estate of <em>Gwinn Harris. </em>No right or estate in the property was transmitted to <em>Morgan Harris, </em>in his life time, and that his widow, <em>Etheldra J. Harris, </em>cannot legally claim, except through her husband, <em>Morgan Harris. Morgan Harris </em>had not such an interest in the property devised by <em>Gwinn Harris, </em>as to have devised or transferred it by any act of his. The time of the transfer of the property is the death of the testator. The act of 1810, chap. 34, was designed to remedy inconveniences growing out of the death of legatees before the will could operate. 7 <em>Gill </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>366.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-9\">The estate and interest devised and bequeathed by <em>Gwinn Harris </em>to <em>Morgan Harris </em>will not be considered assets of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number><em>Morgan Harris, </em>to go into the hands of his administrator, and to be distributed by him, but is transferred to those who are entitled to the same, as his next of kin.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-5\">It is contended, that as the legacy does not constitute a part of the personal estate of <em>Morgan Harris, </em>his widow is not entitled to any portion of it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b484-6\">By T. S. Alexander, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-7\"><em>Morgan Harris, </em>the legatee, having died in the life time of <em>Gwinn Harris, </em>the testator, the question arises, who are entitled to the legacy bequeathed by the last will of the latter to the former? The orphans court of <em>Charles </em>county decreed, that it should be distributed amongst the widow and children of the legatee, deceased, who were at the time of the testator\u2019s death, the representatives of the legatee, and as such, entitled to distribution of his personal estate. The present appeal is taken to contest the right of the widow to any share of this legacy, on the ground, as it would seem, from the statement filed on behalf of the appellant, that she is not one of the next of kin of her deceased husband. The answer to this objection is short, and it is believed, conclusive. There is nothing in the act of 1810, chap. 34, nor in the opinion of this court, in the case of <em>Glenn vs. Belt, </em>7 <em>G. &amp; J. </em>363, which requires the distribution in such case to be made amongst \u201cthe next of kin\u201d of the deceased legatee. The act provides generally, that no legacy shall lapse by reason of the death of any legatee, in the life time of the testator; but every such legacy shall have the same effect and operation in law, to transfer the right, estate, or interest in the property mentioned in such bequest, as if such legatee had survived the testator. And the opinion delivered in the case above referred to, shows, that the effect and operation of the act is to transfer the legacy \u201cto such persons <em>in esse </em>\u201c(at the death of the testator as are) entitled, by law to the \u201cdistribution of the legatee\u2019s estate, in case of intestacy, that \u201cis, his representatives;\u201d Who are the representatives? That is, who would be entitled by law to share in the distribution of the estate of the legatee, in case he had died intestate imme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>diately after the death of the testator? and not who were at that time his next of kin? is the proper inquiry. Now the act of 1798, chap. 101, sub. chap. 11, secures to the widow where \u2022the intestate left children, one-third part, and if he left no children, one-half part of the residuum of his estate. She is then \u2018\u201ca representative,\u201d and as such, \u201centitled by law to share in the distribution\u201d of her deceased husband\u2019s estate.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b485-5\">By the Court</author>\n<p id=\"AUV\">decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
