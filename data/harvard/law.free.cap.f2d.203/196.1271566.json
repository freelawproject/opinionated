Whitty v. Weedin, 9 Cir., 68 F.2d 127. Hence appellant was deportable under one of the provisions of 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 155(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> relating to criminals, namely, the provision that, At any time within five years after entry, * * * any alien * * * who admits the commission, prior to entry, of a felony or other crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude * * * shall, upon the warrant of the Attorney General, be taken into custody and deported\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-20\">A warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest was issued on June 20, 1951, by appellee H. R. Landon, the district director of Immigration and Naturalization in charge of District No. 16. Under that warrant, appellant was arrested at San Diego, California, on June 29, 1951, but was released on parole. Hearings were had at San Diego on July 12 and 20, 1951. On July 20, 1951, appellant applied for suspension of deportation. On July 26, 1951, the hearing officer decided that appellant should be deported. Appellant excepted to the hearing officer\u2019s decision, but the acting Assistant Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization made a decision on September 10, 1951, ordering that appellant be deported, and that his application for suspension of deportation be denied. Appellant appealed from the acting Assistant Commissioner\u2019s decision, but the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed that appeal on December 7, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-21\">Accordingly, on January 14, 1952, the Attorney General, acting by and through appellee Landon, issued a warrant of deportation commanding the district enforcement officer at Los Angeles, California, or \u2022 any officer or employee of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to deport appellant to Mexico'. That warrant was delivered to appellee U. L. Press, an officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, for execution. Acting thereunder, ap-pellee Press took appellant into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-22\">On May 26, 1952, while detained in custody of appellee Press, appellant, by his attorneys, filed with the clerk of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Southern Division, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>petition wherein appellees (Landon and Press) were named as respondents. The petition was addressed to District Judge Jacob .Weinberger. It alleged that the warrant of deportation was void, and that appellant\u2019s detention was illegal. It prayed for a writ.of habeas corpus directed to ap-pellee Press, commanding him to \u201chave the body\u201d of appellant before Judge Wein-berger at a 'time and place to be specified, \u201ctogether with the time and cause of his detention, and said writ,\u201d and that appellant \u201cbe restored to his liberty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">On May 28, 1952, the District Court (Judge Weinberger presiding) issued a writ of habeas corpus as prayed in the petition. In response thereto, appellant was produced and a return was filed by appellees. Thereafter the case was submitted, and on July 23, 1952, the District Court (Judge Weinberger presiding) entered an order which dismissed the petition or purported to dismiss it,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but did not discharge the writ of habeas corpus or remand appellant to the custody of appellee Press. From that order appellant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Appellant contends that the Attorney General had discretionary power to grant' appellant\u2019s application for suspension of deportation; that the Attorney General should have exercised his discretion with respect to appellant\u2019s application, but failed to do so; and that, because of th\u00e1t failure, the warrant of deportation was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Appellant\u2019s application was based on 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 155(c), as amended in 1948,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which provided: \u201cIn the case of any alien (other than one to whom [\u00a7 155(d)]<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is applicable) who is deportable under any law of the United States and who has proved good moral character for the preceding five years, the Attorney General may * *' * suspend deportation of such alien if he is not ineligible for naturalization or if ineligible, such ineligibility is solely by reason of his race, if he finds (a) that such deportation would result in serious economic detriment to a citizen or legally resident alien who is the spouse, parent, or minor child of such deportable alien; or (b) that such alien has resided continuously in the United States for seven years or more and [was] residing in the United States upon [May 1, 1917]. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">Section 155(d) provided: \u201cThe provisions of [\u00a7 155(c)] shall not be applicable in the case of any alien who is deportable under * * * any of the provisions of so much of [\u00a7 155(a)] as relates to criminals * <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">As indicated above, appellant was de-portable under one of the provisions of \u00a7 155(a) relating to criminals. Hence \u00a7 155 (d) was applicable to him, and \u00a7 155(c) was inapplicable. Hence the Attorney General had no power \u2014 discretionary or otherwise \u2014 to grant appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">The order here appealed from is modified so as to discharge the writ of habeas corpus and remand appellant to the custody of appellee Press or to the custody of any other officer or employee of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who is or may be authorized to execute the warrant of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">As thus modified, the order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-14\">. See California Penal Code, \u00a7\u00a7 281-283.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-15\">. Section 155 was repealed by \u00a7 403(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of June 27, 1952, c. 477, 66 Stat. 279, effective December 24, 1952, but was in effect at all pertinent times prior to December 24, 1952. This case is not affected by the repeal. See \u00a7 405(a) of the Act, 66 Stat. 280.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\">. Actually, the petition was granted, in part, on May 28, 1952, when the writ of habeas corpus was issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b246-21\">.
