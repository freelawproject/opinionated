Two questions are presented: first, whether the respondents\u2019 business was sufficiently interstate to give the Board jurisdiction, and second, whether there was proof of the alleged unfair labor practices. We are of the opinion that the showing as to the interstate character of the business was sufficient to avoid the <em>de minimis </em>rule. As for the alleged unfair labor practices, we think that the threats that if the employees were organized sundry miscellaneous benefits would no longer be furnished and that vacations would be withheld evidence violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1). The record also shows a threat of discharge. Respondents assert that there was no violation of \u00a7 8(a)(3) in that the employees in question quit of their own accord and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>were not discharged. This issue relates to a question of fact which was for the Board and we cannot disturb its finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Order enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
