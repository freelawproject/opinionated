Lemke, was indicted for violating Alaska Compiled Laws Annotated 1949, \u00a7 65-5-81, was arraigned, pleaded not guilty, was tried and, on February 27, 1952, was' found guilty. A judgment sentencing appellant was entered on March 14, 1952. From that judgment \u2014 the only judgment entered in the case \u2014 no appeal was taken. However, on March 11, 1952, three days before the judgment was entered, appellant took what purported to be an appeal from a judgment entered on March 10, 1952. There was no such judgment-Therefore the appeal is dismissed. CL Prickett v. Consolidated Liquidating Corp., 9 Cir., 180 F.2d 8.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b454-23\">POPE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AdF\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-24\">The judgment here discloses that on* March 10, 1952, defendant appeared with his counsel for sentence. It is apparent-that at that time sentence was pronounced,, to commence on that date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the judgment was not signed, dated or entered\u2019 until March 14. It follows from Criminal-Rule 32(b), 18 U.S.C.A., that the notices of appeal, filed March 11, was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>But the notice was still on file on March 14, and there is no doubt or uncertainty as to what sentence, or judgment, it was intended to reach. For reasons similar to those suggested in Luckenbach SS. Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 533, 47 S.Ct. 186, 71 L.Ed. 394, I think we should hold that the notice of appeal, though premature, was not a nullity. See the dictum in Richards v. United States, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 192 F.2d 602, 604. I think the defect and irregularity here is of the sort we are required to disregard by Criminal Rule 52(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-15\">.

It is Adjudged: That the defendant is guilty as charged * * * an&lt;j that he be confined in the Federal Jail at Fairbanks, Alaska, for a period of six (6) months, such sentence to commence on the 10th day of March, 1952;. * * *\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
