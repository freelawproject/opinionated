Appellant sought to review denial of an increase of pension or disability compensation, asked on the ground that he was in need of the regular aid and attendance of another person, as provided for by Public Law 356, 82nd Congress, 66 Stat. 90, Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act of 1944, Veterans\u2019 Regulation No. 1(f), pt. 3, 38 U.S.C.A. following section 745. The action was properly dismissed. The court, by express statutory provision, was without jurisdiction to review the decision of the Administrator of Veterans Affairs. 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 705; Lynch v. United States, 292 U.S. 571, 587, 54 S.Ct. 840, 78 L.Ed. 1434; Barnett v. Hines, 70 App.D.C. 217, 105 F.2d 96, certiorari denied 308 U.S. 573, 60 S.Ct. 88, 84 L.Ed. 480; Van Horne v. Hines, 74 App. D.C. 214, 122 F.2d 207, certiorari denied 314 U.S. 689, 62 S.Ct. 360, 86 L.Ed. 552. Since the action could not be maintained in any jurisdiction, it is not necessary to consider the point that the defendants could be sued only in the district or districts of their residence. Cf. Blackmar v. Guerre, 342 U.S. 512, 72 S.Ct. 410, 96 L.Ed. 534; Berlinsky v. Woods, 4 Cir., 178 F.2d 265, 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
