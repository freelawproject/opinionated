Accordingly on December 30, 1943, he was ordered retired from active duty, effective April 30, 1944, after expiration of his accumulated leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">However, following the formal request for retirement or after it became effective, Hanes made a series of unsuccessful moves, apparently designed to restore him to an active duty status. These included (1) a request for a court of inquiry to review evidence before the board recommending his removal from active duty, concerning which Hanes now contends the evidence was insufficient and the proceedings invalid and \u201cfraudulent\u201d; (2) a request under Army Regulation 605-245 to withdraw his application for retirement; (3) an application for correction of military record under provisions of \u00a7 207 of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946; <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (4) an application for consideration and hearing before a Board of Review pursuant to \u00a7 107 of the Act of June 29, 1948.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">Finally, May 21, 1951, some seven years after the order of retirement, Hanes filed his complaint in the District Court. He alleged with considerable particularity the facts we have recited; denied the truth of charges before the so-called reclassification board of failure and inattention in performing his military duties, and attacked in detail the regularity, sufficiency and validity of proceedings resulting in the recommendation by the board of general officers, provided by Act of July 29, 1941, for his removal from the active list under that statute. Further, Hanes charged that he was arbitrarily and unlawfully retired and has been deprived of the difference between retired and active duty pay and allowances, amounting to some $375 per month from April 18, 1944 (aggregating about $32,000 at time of suit).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">Concerning his notice to the War Department of a desire to retire voluntarily, Hanes alleged that it was made \u201cunder * * * compulsion and duress\u201d to state his wishes respecting retirement within three days, and at a time when he was extremely anxious to visit his ill wife and when he was \u201cnearly exhausted\u201d from ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>forts to obtain a fair and impartial consideration of his case;' therefore he charges that he was deprived of his free will in reaching the decision to retire rather than to further oppose removal from the active list of the Army.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Finally, the complainant prayed for (1) a determination and declaration as to his military status, especially with reference to the legality of his retirement; (2) an injunction restoring him to the active list of the Army and benefits which would have accrued without retirement; and (3) a \u201cdetermination\u201d that he was entitled to the difference between his retired and active service pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">&gt;[1 \u2014 3] Answering, the defendant denied all allegations of the complaint relating to charges of illegality (1) in proceedings culminating in the recommendation by the board of general officers for Hanes\u2019 removal from active service and (2) in his re--tirement. Further, he attacked the complaint as failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and lack of jurisdiction in the court over the subject matter. The defendant.also filed a motion, supported by affidavit, for summary judgment upon..the ground there was no genuine is\u2019sue of material fact and the defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law., The motion was granted and the complaint dismissed upon grounds that the court was without jurisdiction (1) to restore Hanes to the active list of the Army, citing cases ;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or (2) to declare the legality of Hanes\u2019 retirement, for the Declaratory Judgment Act does not confer jurisdiction in the courts over'cases in which it did not exist before such enactment, citing Clark v. Memolo, 1949, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 65, 174 F.2d 978, with cases therein referred to; and' (3) to determine Hanes\u2019 claim for the difference between his active and retired pay, since such determination is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">We agree with the conclusions of the District Judge. However, if we assume the court to have jurisdiction, the result must be the same. For we are convinced that the retirement of Hanes was valid and binding upon him. He attacks legality of the retirement by averring that his notice to the War Department of a desire to retire was not voluntary, but made \u201cunder the compulsion and duress of complying with a written military command to submit his answer\u201d to the War Department within three days, and that' the reply indicating his desire to retire was made in a state of worry and near exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">We do not doubt the validity of the War Department\u2019s requirement for a speedy reply to its communication. Although directing a reply, which could lawfully be done, it left Hanes entirely free to retire, or not, as he pleased. Having communicated his desire to retire we must regard his action as voluntary and the order of retirement as a valid and binding exercise of military authority. Obviously, if the retirement was valid, as we have indicated, that ends the matter. There can be no need to examine the additional points concerning proceedings resulting in the recommendation for his removal from active service, for his retirement cut short those proceedings without final action thereon by the War Department and rendered moot any questions concerning their regularity or validity. However, it is interest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ing to note from the War Department\u2019s sworn record supporting the motion for summary judgment, that when Hanes appeared with counsel before the board of general officers, convened under Act of July 29, 1941, he stated that he had no additional evidence to offer and desired to make no statement or call any witness in his own behalf (Appendix 19). It would therefore seem that any objections which Hanes had made before the so-called reclassification board concerning its proceedings, were waived by the position he took before the statutory board of general officers, who recommended his removal to the Secretary of War.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-14\">. 55 Stat. 606, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 571 note, provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay1\">\u201cSec. 2.
