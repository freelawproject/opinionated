In the Gaskin case, plaintiff\u2019s decedent was the driver of the automobile. The plaintiff in the Spikes case was a passenger therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-24\">The evidence is in conflict as to the speed of the tram, whether the blinker signal at the crossing was in operation, whether whistle and bell signals were sounded, whether the engineer and fireman were keeping a proper lookout as they approached the crossing which intersects a major highway near the center of the town of Alapaha, Georgia, and as to other facts bearing upon the question of negligence and contributory negligence. These conflicts were resolved by the jury. There is ample evidence to support the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-25\">The verdict in the Gaskin case for the death of John H. Gaskin, Jr., was for $4,-000. In the Spikes case for substantial injuries to Cliff Spikes the verdict was for $1,000. These amounts indicate that in each case the jury reduced the recovery-under the-Georgia comparative negligence statute. If there was error in so reducing the verdict in the Spikes case, such error was favorable to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-26\">Upon authority of the cases hereafter cited, the trial judge held that the evidence presented a jury question, and he approved the verdicts as rendered. There is no basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>upon which we can hold that error was committed in doing so. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Key, 5 Cir., 196 F.2d 64; Stanaland v. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co., 5 Cir., 192 F.2d 432; Seaboard Airline Ry. Co. v. Deese, 5 Cir., 185 F.2d 290; Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v.
