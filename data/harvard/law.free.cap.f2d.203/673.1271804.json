On March 18, 1953, appellant petitioned the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for a writ of habeas corpus. Thereupon, on March 18, 1953, the District Court issued an order requiring appellee, Bruce G. Barber, District Director of Immigration and Naturalization, to. show cause why the writ should not be issued. Appellee filed a return, a hearing was had, and on March 26, 1953, th.e District Court entered an order which discharged the order to show cause, dismissed the petition and denied the .writ, thus, in effect, refusing the writ and declining to grant .it. Appellant appealed and has applied to this court for an order releasing him from custody, pending appeal, upon his giving an appearance bond. This court is not empowered to grant such an order. See Rule 45 of the Supreme Court, 28 U.S.C.A., and Rule 29 of this court. Accordingly, the application is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
