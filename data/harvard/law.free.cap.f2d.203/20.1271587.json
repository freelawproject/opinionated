The question was whether he was or ever had 'been a member of the Communist Party, tie was tried by a judge of the District Court without a jury and was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>When appellant was asked the crucial question before the subcommittee, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-4\">\u201cMr. Quinn. I would like to make a statement along the lines that Mr. . Fitzpatrick made yesterday in regard to a question of that' nature. I feel that the political beliefs, opinion's, and associations of the American people can be held secret if they so desire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">\u201cMr. Wood. And for those reasons you decline to answer the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\u201cMr. Quinn. I didn\u2019t say I was declining to answer the question.

I don\u2019t feel I am hiding behind the Cbnstituf tion, but in this case I am standing before it, defending it, as small as I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-15\">* * * * - * - *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-16\">\u201cMr. Wood. You have stated your position. Having enunciated . your sentiments and your position, will you now answer the question whether you are now or ever have' been a member of the Communist Party, or do you decline to answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-17\">' \u201cMr. Quinn. I decline to discuss with the committee questions of that nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-20\">The record shows that on the day preceding that of the interrogation of appellant, the subcommittee had questioned one Thomas Fitzpatrick, who had made an extended statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-21\">Having been indicted for refusal to answer the question put to him, Quinn moved to dismiss the indictment upon a number of grounds. The motion was denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was tried by a judge without a jury. His defense, so far as pertinent to the present appeal, was in three contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-22\">1. Quinn says that he claimed the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. He says he did this by personally adopting the form of claim made by the prior witness, Fitzpatrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-23\">The trial court found as a fact that at no point did Quinn, while before the subcommittee, assert the privilege in explicit terms. The court then posed the question : \u201cCan one claim a personal privilege against selfdnerimination by reference to a position that another took ?\u201d. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-24\">\u201cOn that, this Court finds as a matter of law that one may not. Since the privilege is personal, the defendant must assert it himself, since another may not know what is in a defendant\u2019s mind at the time he is called before 'the Congress to testify on pertinent matters, to-proper inquiry, and therefore, one may not, by reference; assert that privilege.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-25\">The trial court therefore concluded that Quirin had'not asserted his personal privilege in respect to self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-26\">We are of opinion that a witness may claim the constitutional privilege by referring to and adopting language used by another, so long, of course, as that other\u2019s, language is identified. On that point we think the District Court was in error, and the Government so concedes. It is true that the privilege is a personal one<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the circumstances must be such as to indicate-that the witness himself personally asserts: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But, when a witness personally asserts that he adopts a described expression as his expression, the claim is personally made. No formula or specific term or expression is required. The language may be the witness\u2019s own composition or may be a quotation from another or may be the adoption of another\u2019s statement; so long as the witness himself personally makes the claim, either by words or by action, this requirement is satisfied no matter what form he uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Then the question is whether Quinn, by adopting Fitzpatrick\u2019s statement, asserted a privilege against self-incrimination. Basically, of course, that question <em>concerns </em>what was in Quinn\u2019s mind. But courts cannot act upon unrevealed intentions, and so the inquiry must be whether Fitzpatrick did or did not claim the privilege. If what he said did not amount to such a claim, Quinn\u2019s adoption of the statement did not amount to one. The trial court made no ruling upon the meaning or the sufficiency of Fitzpatrick\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Having held that Quinn could not as a matter of law adopt it, the court was not called upon to consider it. In the view which we take of the case the efficacy of Fitzpatrick\u2019s statement as a claim of the privilege must be determined. The problem is whether it should be determined by this court or by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The issue as to Fitzpatrick\u2019s statement, as we see it, is whether a reasonable auditor would understand from what Fitzpatrick said that he (Fitzpatrick) was claiming the right to refuse to answer because his answer might tend to incriminate him. The words which Fitzpatrick used are known, are in this record, and are not in dispute. What did those words mean as he uttered them?</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Fitzpatrick\u2019s discussion, which was lengthy, related chiefly to First Amendment rights. He did not at any point make a clear and unequivocal statement that he claimed the privilege against self-incrimination. The closest he came to it were two references to the Fifth Amendment in the course of his long discussion of rights of free speech and thought. Once, before any questions had been asked him, he said, \u201cThis is a protection of the First Amendment to the 'Constitution, supplemented by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d And once he said, \u201cI stand on the protection of the Constitution, the First and Fifth Amendments.\u201d There was no context indicating that a claim of the privilege was meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">We think the words \u201cFifth Amendment\u201d, considered alone, do not constitute a formula which invokes the privilege against self-incrimination. The Fifth Amendment contains more than one clause. It contains two which are possibly pertinent here, the privilege against self-incrimination and the due process clause. The expression \u201cI claim the protection of the First Amendment, supplemented by the Fifth\u201d may well and reasonably mean \u201cI claim the protection of the First Amendment to my rights of free speech and thought, supplemented by the guarantee of due process of law.\u201d The combination of First and Fourteenth Amendment protection is not unusual,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the combined reference has the meaning just expressed. Of course, as a matter of constitutional law, a reference to the Fourteenth Amendment as supplementing the First is a reference to the due process clause as a vehicle for applying the First Amendment restrictions to the states, and in that sense reference to the Fifth Amendment as supplementing the First has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>meaning in a. controversy over federal action. But we are considering an' expression used by a lay witness, and -familiarity with the combined phrase \u201cFirst and Fourteenth\u201d may account for the use of the phrase \u201cFirst and Fifth\u201d to indicate the full force of the First Amendment protections. .</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">In our opinion the question here. is - whether Fitzpatrick\u2019s statement, in full text and context, related only to the claim of the rights of free speech and thought under the-First Amendment, or whether an auditor could detect an intention to claim the privilege against self-incrimination,; protected by the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Words do not always have indisputable meanings.- When they do not, their interpretation is a matter of law in some instances and a matter of fact in others. If an ambiguous phrase appears in a statute, its meaning is a question of law. If one occurs in. a contract, its meaning depends' upon the intention of the parties; and that may be an unalloyed question of fact. If the dispute concerns the meaning of the whole of a lengthy recital by a witness on the stand, the meaning is a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Whether Fitzpatrick\u2019s meaning is a question of fact or a mixed question of law and fact is close to the borderline. Our opinion is that, in either event, the conclusion ought to be drawn in the first instance by the trial court. In the setting of a criminal case (which is all we have here), we do not think that strict analysis of whether a given inquiry presents a question of law or of fact or a mixed one of law and fact is controlling as to whether it may be determined in the first instance by an appellate court, especially where -that inquiry concerns the main issue in the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Perhaps, if we were of clear opinion that Fitzpatrick, and therefore Quinn, did claim the privilege and so must be acquitted, we should dispose of the matter finally here and now. Under such circumstances we , would reverse a judgment of conviction. But a majority of the court are not of that . clear opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">The affirmance of a judgment of conviction involves some considerations different from those involved in the reversal of such a judgment. Basically, an accused can be convicted only upon a trial, and the function of an appellate court in affirming a conviction is circumscribed by that principle. A reversal may result in another trial. Generally determinations upon which a judgment of conviction finally rests ought'to be made in the first instance by . the trial court, not by the appellate court. It is upon this phase of the problem presented by . this appeal that members of this court differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The judgment of the court is that the case should be remanded to the trial court for a new trial, at which the issue, if then raised, would -be whether Quinn claimed the privilege by adopting the statement made ' by Fitzpatrick. Either or both of two views lead us to that judgment. One view is that in a criminal -case an appellate court has no authority to make the initial determination of an issue such as this one, whether it be called a question of fact or a mixed question of law and fact, upon which a judgment of conviction would rest; that an initial decision upon such an issue must be made by the trial court, if a judgment of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>viction would follow. The other view is that an appellate court has some discretion in such circumstances hut that in the present case the discretion should he exercised to cause a determination of the issue by the trial court, rather than to affirm a conviction upon the decision of an issue not considered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Two reasons are suggested why it might be appropriate, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, for this court to determine whether the privilege was in fact asserted by Fitzpatrick. The first is that trial by jury was waived and the case was tried by a judge alone. The second is that the evidence consisted primarily of a reading, by counsel for the subcommittee, of, the transcript of the hearings before the subcommittee. But when a defendant waives trial by jury he does not thereby, consent to a determination of his guilt or innocence by an appellate court. . As to the second reason we think it is confused with the rule as to civil equity cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In those cases the trial judge makes specific findings upon the several facts and the appellate court must determine whether those findings are or are not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d. But no such situation exists in a criminal case. Moreover, one of the substantial rights accorded a criminal defendant by statute in the federal courts is the right of appeal. Were this court to affirm the conviction on a finding not considered below, the defendant would in effect be deprived of that right, for our finding, in the first instance, on the main issue, would be subject to review only on the grant of <em>certiorari </em>by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The Government urges that we affirm the conviction on the theory that the error of the trial court was harmless,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in that it could not reasonably be concluded from the evidence that Quinn by his adoption of Fitzpatrick\u2019s statements, asserted a claim of the privilege. We think that Rule 52(a) of the Criminal Rules should not he interpreted in the circumstances of this case to require the appellate court to assume the function of considering initially the basic issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">2. Appellant\u2019s second point is that, before a witness before a congressional committee can be held in contempt for refusing to answer a question, he must be specifically directed to answer and his reasons for refusing to answer rejected or overruled. We have passed upon the point contrary to appellant\u2019s contention in Emspak v. United States, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 378, 203 F.2d 54, decided today. As was pointed out in Bart v. United States, 91 U.S. App.D.C. 370, 203 F.2d 45, also decided today, to constitute an offense refusal to answer must be intentional. , It must appear that Quinn was aware of the intention of his inquirer that answers were required despite his objections.,, He said he adopted all of Fitzpatrick\u2019s statement. Fitzpatrick, \u00a1made a full statement before he was asked any questions, stating that he would refuse to answer, and before the questioning 'began the Chairman of the Subcommittee explained to him the necessity for answers. When Quinn himself was questioned, and after he had refused to answer, adopting Fitzpatrick\u2019s statement, the Chairman twice asked him to answer the, question. The deliberate and intentional character of the refusal is an element of the offense, to be determined from all the circumstances by the trier of the facts. That issue will be before the trial court if the case is retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">3. Appellant\u2019s third point is that, since ten members of the grand jury which indicted him were Government employees and two were wives of Government employees, he was entitled to a hearing on his motion to dismiss the indictment as void for that reason. We have also passed on this point contrary to appellant\u2019s contention in Emspak v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The judgment of the District Court will be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge, with whom EDGERTON, Circuit Judge, joins, concurring in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">While I agree to the reversal of the conviction and the remand for a new trial, I take a differing view with respect to some important questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The court\u2019 concludes that there was no error in denying appellant a hearing for the purpose of demonstrating that Government employees were not qualified to act as grand jurors in this case. This conclusion rests on this court\u2019s view in Emspak v. United States, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 378, 203 F.2d 54, that appellant \u201cdid no more than assert existence of a \u2018miasma of fear\u2019 so clearly rejected in the Dennis case.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I think the court misreads Dennis v. United States. Before discussing that phase of the court\u2019s opinion, however, I think it essential to consider the Government\u2019s contention that the rule of the Dennis case\u2014 whatever it is \u2014 applies only to a petit jury and not to a grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-16\">The Government says, \u201cIt is not free from doubt that partiality in a grand juror is <em>per se </em>disqualifying. * * * Historically, grand jurors were chosen for what they knew about affairs in the community, which in the case of a petit juror would be disqualifying.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cPartiality,\u201d resulting from knowledge, is one thing. But partiality resulting from fear induced by an atmosphere of intimidation, which appellant seeks to demonstrate, is quite another. In my view, the latter would be disqualifying. For \u201cpetitioner\u2019s federal constitutional right to a fair and impartial grand jury\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> can be no less than that his' indictors be free of fear that would paralyze the exercise of their free will.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>It is unconvincing to tell us, as the Government does, that the \u201cbias\u201d here asserted would not, if proved, disqualify a grand juror. Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has ruled on the question. Even in regard to bias arising from a direct financial interest, the state cases are in confusion and this court might well start afresh in fashioning a rule for this jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I have discovered no case \u2014 state or federal \u2014which \u00a1considers whether fear induced by an atmosphere of intimidation disqualifies a grand jury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">What the Government is proposing is <em>pro tanto </em>repeal of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s assurance of \u201ca presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is true that the grand jury has been criticized as an anachronistic institution. But, as the Supreme Court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">\u201cwhatever force may be given to this argument, it remains true that the grand jury is as valuable as ever in securing * * * \u2018individual citizens\u2019 .\u2018from an open and public accusation of crime, and from the trouble, expense, and anxiety of a public trial before a probable cause is established by the presentment and indictment of a grand jury;\u2019 and \u2018in case of high offenses\u2019 it \u2018is justly regarded as one of the securities to the innocent against hasty, malicious, and oppressive public prosecutions.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">The grand jury \u201cis designed as a means, not only of bringing to trial persons accused of public offenses upon just grounds, but also as a means of protecting the citizen against unfounded accusation, whether it comes from government, or be prompted by partisan passion or private enmity.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The grand jury system derives from the notion \u201cthat no one shall be subjected to the burden and expense of a trial until there has been a prior inquiry and adjudication by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>responsible tribunal that there is probable cause' to believe him guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">An ordinary citizen has slight protection from the activities of a grand jury. For example, he may be indicted without the benefit of a preliminary hearing before a committing magistrate,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and even though he has had no opportunity to appear on his own behalf.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As a witness, he must answer the questions of a grand jury which may be proceeding under an unconstitutional statute<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and questions which he thinks are not relevant to the subject of the grand jury\u2019s inquiry.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Delegation of such sweeping powers compels a balancing caution in the selection of those who exercise them. Freedom of will and conscience should be a minimal requisite in their' selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Preservation of the integrity of the grand jury system is not merely a matter of individual concern. \u2019 It touches our democratic insistence on the fair administration of law. When the grand jury is not properly constituted, \u201creversible error does not depend on a showing of prejudice in an individual case. * * * The injury is not limited to the defendant \u2014 there is injury to the jury system, to the law as\u2018an institution, to the community at large, and to the democratic ideal reflected in the processes of our courts.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For that reason, the Supreme Court has long included the grand jury within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> even in the absence of prejudice to an individual defendant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It would be highly anamolous, then, to hold that neither the grand jury clause nor the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment affords a defendant any protection in the presence of the prejudice of an intimidated grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-19\">I turn now to the court\u2019s application of the Dennis case. Like Dennis, the present case is one \u201cinherently touching the security of the Government, at a time when public feeling on these matters is notoriously-running high * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Of the twenty members of the grand jury which voted the present indictment, ten were Government employees and two others were wives of Government employees. By timely motion to dismiss (together with supporting affidavits) or, in the alternative, to grant a hearing in the matter, appellant called the-court\u2019s attention to the existence of both known and alleged circumstances from which it was charged that Government employees could not be suitable jurors in this particular case. If they could not, then the indicting grand jury was illegally constituted and its indictment void since there were less than twelve qualified grand jurors.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>In denying appellant\u2019s motion and striking .appellant\u2019s supplemental affidavit<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201cfor the reason that it is legally insufficient,\u201d the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">\u201cIn the absence of a showing of actual bias on the part of the members of the Grand Jury due to their employment in the Government of the United States or the Government of the District of Columbia, the indictment is not void. United States v. Wood, (1936) 299 U.S. 123 [57 S.Ct. 177, 81 L.Ed. 78] ; Frazier v. United States, (1948) 335 U.S. 497 [69 S.Ct. 201, 93 L.Ed. 187] ; Dennis v. United States, (1950) 339 U.S. 162 [70 S.Ct. 519, 94 L.Ed. 734], In a particular case Government employees serving as Grand or Petit Jurors might he barred for implied bias when circumstances are properly brought to the Court\u2019s attention which convince the Court that Government employees would not be suitable jurors. No such circumstances are present under the force of the present motion to dismiss, nor were any such circumstances indicated in defendant\u2019s proffer of proof in support of the motion for a hearing on the qualifications of the Grand Jurors.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">This court, like the trial court, relics on the line of cases culminating in Dennis v. United States as a basis for the denial of a hearing on bias. Because I think this court misreads Dennis,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> I cannot accept the conclusions built upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">When the Dennis case was called for trial, the accused moved for a transfer to-another district on the ground that prejudice against him in the District of Columbia would prevent a fair trial.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> He also challenged for cause all Government employees called to serve as petit jurors.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> A short affidavit, presented in support of the transfer motion, asserted: (1) that the effect of Executive Order 9835, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7631 note, known as the Loyalty Order,, would bar a fair trial; (2) that the possibility of the House Committee on Un-American Activities taking note of anyone voting for acquittal would prevent a verdict of \u201cnot guilty\u201d; and (3) that false rumors spread by the Washington press had discredited Dennis and prejudiced his right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Although the Dennis brief in the Supreme Court contained lengthy discussions seeking to establish a \u201cmiasma of fear\u201d which affected all Government employees, the record contained nothing but the affidavit with the assertions just described. The record also disclosed that no hearing was requested or proffer of proof made in connection with the issue of prejudice. In fact, counsel, for Dennis expressly stated that he could \u201cadd nothing to the affidavit.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The motion for transfer and the challenges for cause to the jury on voir dire were denied.. And it was the latter action that was sustained by the majority of the Supreme-Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">In the present case, however, counsel by extensive affidavits, request for hearing, and proffer of proof sought to develop and prove for the record certain circumstances bearing on the issue of bias. His attempt to show the impact of the loyalty and security programs on Government employees <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> differed materially from the showing in the Dennis case. There the Supreme Court carefully pointed out;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201c * * * the Loyalty Order preceded the instant trial only by about three months. It was promulgated by the President-on March 21, 1947. This trial began on June 23, 1947, and was concluded on June 26, 1947.- On May 9, 1947, the President submitted to Congress a request for an appropriation to carry out the Loyalty Order, which was not enacted into law until July 31, 1947. It was not until August 18, 1947, that Standard Form 84, requesting certain pertinent information from each federal employee, was made available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">\u201cThe administrative implementation of Executive Order 9835, which was yet to come, was apparently not the subject of anticipatory fear by these jurors.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A06\">In marked contrast, the indictment in the present case was returned in November of 1950, by which time the Loyalty Order had been in full operation for more than three years. The affidavits in support of appellant\u2019s motion contain a recital of some generally known events and procedures, and allegations as to others, relating to the operation of that Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Moreover, instead of the argument in the Dennis brief in the Supreme Court that the Un-American Activities Committee had given lists of federal employees to the Attorney General,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the present record contains an affidavit referring, <em>inter alia, </em>to the temper of congressional criticism of the outcome of the first Hiss trial and the admission of Harry Bridges to bail.. That criticism was directed against judges who enjoy the constitutional immunity of life tenure.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> On that basis appellant sought to show that it would not be \u201cfar-fetched and chimerical\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> to suppose that the challenged Government employees, who have no such immunity, might have feared the consequences of a similar attack following a refusal to indict.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">There would be no point to a more detailed cbmparison of the record in this case with that in Dennis. It suffices that appellant\u2019s affidavits went considerably beyond Dennis in attempting to demonstrate that \u201cGovernment employees * * * have been the subject of an active campaign to determine whether they are in any way sympathetic or tolerant to \u2018Communism\u2019 or \u2018Communists,\u2019 or sympathetic to any person who in turn is associated with \u2018Communism\u2019 or \u2018Communists\u2019 or with organizations which have , been called \u2018Communist Fronts\u2019 or with persons who may have been called \u2018Communist fellow travelers.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-15\">Resolution of the disqualification issue does not depend upon whether the loyalty program or investigations by Congress have exceeded lawful bounds. No such question is before us. It depends instead upon whether these activities prevent Government employees from exercising the free will essential to the impartiality required for their service as grand jurors in this case. \u201cThe problems of security are real. So are the problems of freedom. The paramount issue of the age is to reconcile the two.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-16\">Despite the differences between Dennis and the instant case, the Government argues that an attack on the qualifications of grand jurors must be \u201cbased on facts and not mere conclusions.\u201d The Government further asserts, without citing any authority, that unless appellant can advance a reason for \u201cnot making his whole showing in the usual form of affidavits * * * \u201d the trial judge can properly deny a hearing.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>This position rests on a misconception of the nature of the proof required to disqualify a Government employee, and on a failure to make allowance for the difficulties inherent in establishing a state of mind<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">It is well understood that a trial judge has wide latitude in disposing of objections to the qualifications of the grand jury. Where the grounds advanced in support of a motion to quash an indictment are clearly insufficient in law, a hearing would be without purpose. This was the situation in United States v. Rintelen,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> relied upon by the Government. In that case, a plea in abatement simply charged that the \u201cgrand jurors [in finding the said indictment] were actuated by a strong temper and prejudice against the defendants as the result of false statements and vicious newspaper publications.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The court held' that these were not allegations of ultimate fact. But the affidavits in the present case are markedly different both in their nature and specificity. Here they seek to show that in the prosecution of an alleged Communist, independent judgment cannot now be expected of Government employees because, as the President\u2019s Committee on Civil Rights said in 1947, \u201cThe freedom of opinion and expression enjoyed by these people is in many ways dependent upon the attitudes and practices of the government.\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> This charge of intimidation as a consequence, however unintended, of the loyalty and security situation,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> is the crux of the distinction between the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">A motion to quash an indictment should not, of course, be granted merely on legally sufficient allegations. The movant cannot insist that his allegations stand admitted in the absence of a denial.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Nor would I suppose that a trial judge must grant a hearing when it clearly appears that the factual basis on which the movant relies is frivolous. But where it appears from affidavits in support of legally sufficient allegations that their factual basis is not clearly frivolous and the movant seeks a hearing to prove them, it is reversible error to cut him short.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">Since appellant\u2019s legally sufficient allegations were supported by affidavits of circumstances which cannot be said to be frivolous, the foregoing principles required that his request for a hearing be granted in this case. It may well be that appellant will be unable to prove his allegations or to show such facts as would result in his securing the relief which he seeks. His burden of proof will undoubtedly be great. We might be unwilling to accept the sort of proof he may offer. But I cannot bring myself to concur in a view which forecloses all opportunity of showing the extent to which basic rights may have been infringed.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> I could reach a contrary result only by adopting the premise that the partiality of a class of persons cannot in any case be attributed to an individual. But I think the Supreme Court precluded this premise by its assurance in Dennis, precisely with respect to Government employees as a class, that \u201c[t]he way is open in every [such] case to raise a contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>of bias from the realm of speculation to the realm of fact.\u201d <footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The difficulty with the subject generally se\u00e9ms to result from lack of clarity as to the substantive grounds for disqualification. This lack of clarity appears in the trial court\u2019s statement on the one hand that \u201cGovernment employees * * * might be barred from implied bias\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and on the other hand that appellant was required \u201cto show actual bias.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The distinction between the concepts of \u201cactual bias\u201d and \u201cimplied bias\u201d is a problem in semantics arising from their chameleon-like quality.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> But whether we use one.term or the other, in their context here I think they necessarily mean a \u201cstate of mind\u201d (not a technical conception)<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> which can reasonably be expected to follow from the \u201ccircumstances * * * properly brought to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> It was the.trial court\u2019s apparent failure to bring the substantive grounds for disqualification into sharp focus which blurred the issue relating to the applicable criteria for hearing and proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u201cFor the -ascertainment of this [disqualifying] mental attitude * * * , the Constitution- lays down no particular tests and procedure is not chained-to any ancient and artificial formula.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The procedure which the appellant adopted in this case was to ask that \u201ca proper hearing be granted * * * that evidence may be produced in court to show actual bias did exist.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> I would reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial because I think the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-16\">The view I take of another question might dispose of the entire case upon retrial: Appellant contends, in substance, that a charge of contempt cannot lie since he was not \u201cspecifically directed to answer * * * and his reasons for refusing to answer * * * . were not rejected or ' overruled.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The nub of the problem rests upon the meaning of the key phrase \u201crefuses to answer\u201d in \u00a7 192. That section of the contempt statute provides in pertinent part :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-18\">\u201cEvery person who * * * summoned as a witness by the authority of either House of Congress, to give testimony * * * before * * * any committee of either House of Congress, willfully makes default, or who, -having appeared, <em>refuses to answer </em>any question pertinent to the * * * inquiry, . shall be * * * guilty of a misde-: meanor, punishable by a fine <em>* </em>* * and imprisonment in a common jail for not les.s than one month nor more than twelve months.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-21\">This problem is discussed in the opinion of the court in Bart v. United States.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> There the court establishes this basic principle: \u201cIf a witness interposes an objection or query to the propriety of a question, <em>e. g., </em>its pertinency, he may not be refusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>to answer. In such event both elementary-justice and statutory provision require that he be made aware, by some method <em>at some </em>time, that despite his position the inquirer means that he shall answer the question.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Although there is no talismanic formula which the Committee must use in directing the witness to answer, I would state the principle this way: It must appear from all the circumstances that (1) the witness was clearly apprised, and not left to the risk of guessing upon pain of criminal penalties, whether the grounds for his objection to answering were accepted or rejected, and that (2) if rejected, he was given another opportunity to answer. Under this view the Committee would necessarily have to inform the witness <em>in time </em>to allow opportunity for answering. I think it implicit in Bart that the ruling must be that of the inquiring authority (the Committee here}.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The court there says that \u201c[i]f the actual questioner be counsel instead of the inquiring authority, or a member of it, the attitude * * * of that authority may be made clear by prior announcement or by acquiescence or ratification. That phase of the matter must be determined from the circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> I take this to mean that it must clearly appear to a reasonable person in the position of the witness that the ruling is, in fact, that of the inquiring authority or its duly authorized presiding member acting on its behalf.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">A conclusive presumption of intent to violate the statute might attach to a naked refusal to answer, <em>i. e., </em>a refusal without a statement, at the time, of the reason therefor.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> But the court in Bart defines naked refusal as a refusal \u201cwithout asserted legal justification.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> If this means merely that an actual legal principle must be invoked to justify a refusal to answer, I agree. But if the court\u2019s opinion in Bart implies that the principle invoked, must in fact be applicable to the circumstances of the particular case,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> I disagree. The latter interpretation, by abolishing the distinction between the assertion of a claim, on the one hand, and its validity or applicability, on the other, would sap all substance from the basic principle enunciated! by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-16\">It is only after an intent to refuse has been established in accordance with die foregoing principles that the witness is \u201c\u00a1bound rightly to construe the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> And since, except for naked refusals, intent cannot be imputed to the accused as a matter of law, it must be determined as a question of fact, from all the circumstances, as an essential element of the crime. Before the court can consider the validity of any grounds, not plainly frivolous, for objecting to answer, intent to refuse must be thus determined.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-17\">The foregoing construction of the key phrase \u201crefuses to answer\u201d is clearly indicated by an examination of the legislative history and of the cases decided under this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-18\">In 1857 Congress enacted the contempt statute to supplement its inherent powers.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Congressman Davis, speaking for the proposing committee, said of the first section, which in all significant respects is identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>with \u00a7 192:<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> \u201c[I]t increases no power now existing in any committee and <em>confers </em>no power to be exercised either by the committee or the House. * * * I presume, therefore, that it does not <em>inflict </em>any burden on the citizen; that it throws guards around him,\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> It becomes pertinent therefore to determine the rights which conimittees'then afforded the witness during a hearing. At that time, the witness had the safeguards of 'the following procedure: The committee ruled on his objections, and, if adversely, provided at least one other opportunity to answer. Only then was the witness haled before the bar of the Senate or House to show cause why he should not'be 'held in contempt.for refusing to answer. The procedure of an 1857 House Committee investigating corruption illustrates the safeguards which Congress. intended .to preserve, not alter,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> by this statute. Because the Committee believed that testimony being withheld by one James W. Simonton was matefial to the inquiry, it postponed interrogation a short time \u201cto give the witness [who claimed that he would 'be breaching a confidence] time for reflection on the consequences of his - refusal.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> After recalling Simonton and informing him that a refusal would result in contempt proceedings,- the Committee again propounded the original question. Simonton for his for-mer reason refused <em>to </em>answer, and for that refusal was called before the bar of the House to show cause why 'he should not be cited for contempt<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> To construe \u201crefuses to answe'r\u201d as not requiring these committee safeguards would, contrary to congressional intent, \u201cconfer\u201d new power on congressional committees' and \u201cinflict\u201d \" new burdens on the citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">The intent of 'Congress is confirmed by what it has done since enacting the statute of 1857. It continued to deal with contempt tinder inherent powers and with the same procedures for 37 years, up to 1894,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>when the first indictment was obtained under the statute.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> In that case, In re Chapman, its constitutionality was upheld.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> No question as to the meaning of the phrase \u201crefuses to answer\u201d was raised, for the witness demurred to the charge and the Congressional Record shows that he had been apprised by the committee.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">It was 30 years after the Chapman case and 67 years after enactment that the next indictment under the statute was obtained.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> In that case, Sinclair v. United States,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> the Court held that a witness refusing to answer, though acting in good faith on advice of counsel, \u201cwas bound rightly to construe the statute.\u201d <footnotemark>75</footnotemark> The case cannot be read to support the contention that a committee\u2019s ruling and a subsequent opportunity to testify are not required before a witness is subjected to this burden.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> That question was not before the Court \u2014 no doubt because, as an examination of the record reveals, that committee had provided the safeguard we discuss here. Sinclair was clearly apprised that his reasons for withholding testimony were rejected by the committee. After his counsel had fully presented his grounds for not answering, the committee, in Sinclair\u2019s presence, voted \u201cthat [he] be called to the stand to give testimony before this committee.\u201d <footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Sinclair then refused to testify and for this refusal was cited for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-19\">A random check of the citations for contempt of Congress for each year since the Sinclair episode of 1924 further supports this construction of the statute.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Until 1946, except for cases of naked refusals,<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> contempt proceedings were initiated only after a witness, fully apprised that his grounds were unacceptable, still refused to answer upon direction.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> The Un-American Activities Committee itself, which confronts us with the problem here, originally provided this safeguard.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> At some undetermined time since the close of the last war, this Committee, unlike other congressional committees \u2014 the Kefauver <footnotemark>82</footnotemark> and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Senate Judiciary,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> for example \u2014 temporarily failed to do so.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Despite this Committee\u2019s lapse, there is no indication that Congress ever intended to give to the word \u201crefuse,\u201d in contempt cases, the new meaning the Government urges here. The legislative history is overwhelmingly to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Although United States v. Murdock<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> does not involve \u00a7 192 or its predecessors, it is the case most heavily relied upon by the Government to support the proposition that this section does not require the Committee to rule upon objections before a refusal constituting contempt can occur.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> I cannot agree. Murdock dealt with certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1926 and 1928. It merely held, <em>inter alia, </em>that an individual who withholds from an internal revenue agent information specifically required by statute<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> was not entitled under the prevailing statutory scheme to a separate court proceeding to test his grounds for refusal prior to indictment. The Court did not discuss whether the agent would be required to reject the grounds and to direct an answer before a \u201crefusal\u201d could occur. This question was not even raised.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has recently reminded us that in such circumstances a \u201ccase is not a binding precedent * * <footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">This question has, however, been directly considered in three recent district court cases. In United States v. Browder,<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> the court, in acquitting the defendant of contempt of Congress, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-13\">\u201cA search of the record will not disclose one instance when the Committee or its presiding member overruled the defendant\u2019s objections [based on per-tinency] or offered to set him right if, perchance, his observations were ill founded or his position untenable in the eyes of the Committee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0T\">\n<em>******</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-14\">\u201cHis objections were not acted upon and he had the right to believe that his views and explanations were acceptable to the Committee.\u201d <footnotemark>91</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_m\">This view was followed in United States v. Fox<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> where the court observed that \u201cthere is no reason why a different procedure [from that pursued in the courts] should be permissible in cases involving contempt of Congress.\u201d <footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AUa\">And again in United States v. Kamp,<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> the court declared:</p>\n<p id=\"b84-15\">\u201cCommittees of Congress must conduct examinations in such a manner that it is clear to the witness that the Committee recognizes him as being in default, and anything short of a clear cut default * * * will not sustain a conviction for contempt of Congress. * * * The witness is not required to \u2022 enter into a guessing game when called upon to appear before a committee. The burden is upon the presiding mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ber to make clear the directions of the committee, to consider any reasonable explanations given by the witness, and then to rule on the witness\u2019 response.\u201d <footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AR4\">Although the Supreme Court has not ruled directly on this question, there is support for this construction in United States v. Bryan.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> There, in holding that a witness is required to inform the committee of his grounds at the time he objects to answering, and that grounds first raised at a court proceeding will not be considered, the Court said: \u201cTo deny the Committee the opportunity to consider the objection or remedy it is in itself a contempt of its authority and an obstruction of its processes.\u201d<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> Underlying this decision is an assumption that a committee is required to rule on an objection. For if the committee is entitled to an opportunity to consider an objection, it would follow that the witness, in turn, is entitled to be clearly apprised of a committee\u2019s adverse ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">Considerations of fundamental fairness support this construction of the statute.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> In fact, I believe that this is only a minimal requirement and that Congress might well consider amending this statute to include the opportunity for purge which it accords in proceedings under its inherent powers.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Another important consideration stems from the fact that Congress has felt obliged to cite more witnesses for contempt during the last 2% years than during the preceding 92.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Although the procedure required by my view would not eliminate deliberately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>arbitrary and obstructive resistance to congressional authority,-it is calculated to eliminate \u25a0 resistance attributable to ambiguous procedures. It would thereby better serve the objectives of congressional power to compel, testimony, namely, to effectuate'the legislative function and to preserve the dignity of Congress.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> A clear ruling upon a witness\u2019 reason for objecting to answer, and another opportunity to reply, increases the probability of securing desired information. And such a procedure more nearly comports with our traditional concept of the worth of the individual personality upon which the dignity of Congress and of all free institutions so vitally depends.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The court below adopted the erroneous view that appellant could' not claim the privilege against self-incrimination by reference and adoption of the language used by another.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Thus it neither reached nor decided whether the adopted language amounted to a claim of the privilege against self-incrimination. I have \u25a0 joined with some of my brethren to constitute a majority of this court in ordering a new trial because I agree that minimally the court below ought to decide this question in the first instance.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> Under my view, however, the court must not only, determine (1) whether the adopted language amounted to a claim of'the privilege against self-incrimination but (2) whether it amounted to any other claim\u2019(not plainly frivolous), such as, lack of- pertinency or protection of First Amendment rights; and if it did amount to such a claim, then (3) whether the Committee clearly apprised appellant of its rejection and afforded another opportunity to answer; and only if this safeguard were provided, (4) whether the claim was valid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-18\">.

State, 12 Tex. 252, 268: \u201cThe better opinion, to be deduced from the authorities to which we have access, seems to be that irregularities in selecting and impaneling the grand jury, which do not relate to the competency of individual jurors, can, in general, only be objected by a challenge to the array. But that the incompetency, or want of the requisite qualifications of the jurors, may be pleaded in abatement to the indictment. And this doctrine and distinction seems founded on principle. It is the right of the accused to have the question of his guilt, decided by two competent juries before he is condemned to punishment. It is his right, in the first place, to have the accusation.passed upon, before he can be called upon to answer to the charge of crime, by. a grand jury composed of good and lawful men. If the jury be not composed of such men as possess the requisite qualifications, he ought not to be put upon his trial upon a charge preferred by them; but should be permitted to plead their incompetency to prefer the charge and put him upon his trial, in avoidance of the indictment. Otherwise he may be compelled to answer to a criminal charge preferred by men who are infamous, or unworthy to be his accusers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-18\">In United States v.

As the opinion states, the deliberate and intentional character of the refusal is an element of the offense. The necessity for awareness by the witness of the intention of his inquirer to require answers despite the witness\u2019 objections, and the necessity for a deliberate and intentional refusal, are shown by the analysis in Section II of Judge Bazelon\u2019s opinion. The formulation in Section III of his opinion of the issues involved furnishes a practical guide to the trier of the facts.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b86-11\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AGop\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\"> I agree with the majority that the trial judge erred in holding as a matter of law .that Quinn could not adopt Fitzpatrick\u2019s statements for whatever they were worth. But, for reasons to be stated later, my view is that Quinn was not prejudiced by that erroneous ruling, and therefore I think my brothers of the majority are wrong in reversing his conviction and remanding the case for the trial judge to say whether Fitzpatrick did or did not claim the protection of the Fifth Amendment against -being compelled to testify against himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">The court\u2019s action in reversing and remanding seems to me to arise from, and to depend entirely upon, the following statements in the majority opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u201c * * * The trial court made no ruling upon the meaning or the sufficiency of Fitzpatrick\u2019s statement. Having held that Quinn could not as a matter of law adopt it, the court was not called upon to consider it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Perhaps the trial judge was not \u201ccalled upon to consider it,\u201d but I cannot believe the judge\u2019s erroneous legal conclusion, that Quinn could not claim immunity by adopting Fitzpatrick\u2019s language, precluded him from considering whether that language was legally sufficient as a claim of immunity from self-crimination. If the trial judge actually considered Fitzpatrick\u2019s statements and held them insufficient as a claim of privilege, my view is that we should regard that holding as an alternative basis for the finding of guilt, which after all was the ultimate finding of the trial judge. I do not believe we should set aside a correct ultimate finding that a defendant is guilty because the trial judge gave two reasons for it, one of which was wrong and one of which was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">With those considerations in mind, I suggest the majority are incorrect in saying the district judge made no- ruling upon the meaning or sufficiency of what Fitzpatrick said in attempted justification of his refusal to answer the question. If I am correct in that belief \u2014 that is to say, if the district judge did make such a ruling \u2014 then the sole basis for reversal disappears, and the remand is for the futile purpose of permitting the trial judge to make a finding which he has already made.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Moreover, while I do not stress the point, I think it extremely doubtful whether the District Court was required, in the circumstances, to make a special finding concerning the sufficiency of Fitzpatrick\u2019s remarks as a claim of the privilege. Rule 23(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides: \u201cIn a case tried without a jury the court shall make a general finding and shall in addition on request find the facts specially.\u201d The general finding referred to in the rule is a finding o-f either guilty or not guilty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here the trial judge announced the general finding of guilty as charged. No request for special findings was submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-17\">I question whether, under Rule 23(c), a trial judge is required to make special findings on all the factual issues involved, when none had been requested, merely because he announced findings on some of the issues of fact in the course of the opinion which preceded his general finding of guilty. Be that as it may, however, I think it quite clear that in this case the trial court stated, while -delivering his opinion, a finding that Fitzpatrick\u2019s statements did not amount in legal effect to a claim of the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-18\">The erroneous legal ruling by the district court that Quinn could not adopt Fitzpatrick\u2019s language did not mean the judge had not read and considered that language, nor that he had not formed and expressed an opinion as to whether Fitzpatrick had actually claimed the privilege. The contrary appears. The trial judge\u2019s opinion shows he had read and considered Fitzpatrick\u2019s statements. He noted their nature and found them insufficient as a claim of immunity against compulsory self-incrimination. I quote from the District Court\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-19\">\u201c * * * the Court will not go into detail of the -position which Mr. Fitzpatrick took, other than to say that it certainly left much to be desired as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>to whether he was actually claiming self-incrimination or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\">\u201cIt is to be observed that his answers \u2014 and I speak of Mr. Fitzpatrick\u2019s \u2014 were long and rambling. They had a major th\u00e9me, which seemed to be that the committee was prostitu\u00ed- ' ing its office and seeking to aid a rival group in a forthcoming [local union] election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">To- be sure, the judge did not apply the \u201cfinding of fact\u201d label to this evaluation of Fitzpatrick\u2019s language, but that is immaterial. Whether the issue was on\u00e9 of fact or law, the judicial observations just quoted were tantamount to a finding that Fitzpatrick\u2019s remarks to the subcommittee did not' amount\u2019 to a reliance upon- the shelter of \u2022 the self-incriminaition clause. For, when the judge said those remarks \u201ccertainly left much to be desired as to whether he was actually claiming self-incrimination or not,\u201d he Was clearly saying Fitzpatrick had not asserted the claim in the way the cases say a witness must invoke it in order to be entitled to its protection. So, the erroneous legal ruling did not prejudice Quinn., .</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\"><em>The </em>privilege against self-incrimination, when invoked \u25a0 properly, is liberally construed and applied; but the language of the witness which is said to constitute a claim of the privilege is strictly construed and appraised. This will appear from cases hereinafter cited. Nor is the privilege automatically applicable to every question which requires an incriminating answer. It is personal to the witness, and is waived unless he claims it at the time when, and in the tribunal where, the question is asked. The Supreme Court said in United States v. Monia, 1943, 317 U.S. 424, 427, 63 S.Ct. 409, 410, 87 L.Ed. 276:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">\u201cThe Fifth Amendment declares that \u2018No person * * * shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u2019 * * * The Amendment speaks of compulsion. It does not preclude a witness from testifying voluntarily in matters which may incriminate him. If, therefore, he desires the protection of the privilege, he must claim it or he will' not be considered to have been \u2018compelled\u2019 within the meaning of the Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">What must a witness say in order to claim the privilege ? He must in some manner fairly bring to the attention of the tribunal which must pass upon it, the fact that he is invoking and relying upon the constitutional privilege. He must claim it in no uncertain terms. He must use some expression directly indicative of the intention to claim this particular protection of the Fifth Amendment, as distinguished from other constitutional rights. In United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, 1927, 273 U.S. 103, 113, 47 S.Ct. 302, 306, 71 L.Ed. 560, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\">\u201c * * * The privilege may. not be relied on and must be deemed waived \u2019 if not in some manner fairly brought to the attention of the tribunal which must pass upon it. See In re Knickerbocker Steamboat Company, D.C., 139 F. 713 [716]; United States v. Skinner, D.C., 218 F. 870, 876; United States v. Elton, D.C., 222 F. 428, 435.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">In the Knickerbocker Steamboat case, cited by the Supreme Court, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-15\">\u201c * * * Incriminating matter may appear but a party may not desire to resort to the privilege of not answering with respect thereto. If he does, he must say so in unmistakable language and give the reasons for shielding himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-17\">In the later case of Rogers v. United States, 1951, 340 U.S. 367, 370, 71 S.Ct. 438, 440, 95 L.Ed. 344, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-18\">\u201cIf petitioner desired the protection of the privilege against self-incrimination, she was required to claim it. United States v. Monia, 1943, 317 U.S. 424, 427, 63 S.Ct. 409, 410, 87 L.Ed. 376. The privilege \u2018is deemed waived unless invoked.\u2019 United States v. Murdock, 1931, 284 U.S. 141, 148, 52 S. Ct. 63, 64, 76 L.Ed. 210. Furthermore, the decisions of this Court are explicit in holding that the privilege against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>self-incrimination \u2018is solely for the benefit of the witness/ and 'is purely a personal privilege of the witness.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The following is from the opinion of the Eighth Circuit in Phelps v. United States, 1947, 160 F.2d 858, 872:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">\u201cThere is, of course, no prescribed or crystalized formula for claiming the privilege against self-incrimination. The provision in 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 922(g), (and in other recent statutes) that the privilege against self-incrimination must be \u2018specifically\u2019 claimed, would seem to imply, however, that there must he some expression, directly indicative of the intention to claim the particular privilege, as distinguished from other possible rights, and reasonably communicative of the fact that this is what is being done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in United States v. Miller, 1948, 80 F.Supp. 979, 982, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">\u201c * * * The witness, upon oath, must claim his privilege in no uncertain terms at the proceeding in which the information is sought or he will not thereafter he considered to have been \u2018compelled\u2019 within the meaning of the Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">To this the court cited the Vajtauer case, supra, United States v. Murdock, 1931, 284 U.S. 141, 52 S.Ct. 63, 76 L.Ed. 210 and United States v. Benjamin, 2 Cir., 1941, 120 F.2d 521, 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">The opinion m the Benjamin case was written by Judge Augustus N. Hand and was concurred in by Judges Learned Hand and Swan. The following quotation therefrom supports my belief that a witness cannot claim the privilege by announcing that he stands on his constitutional rights, thus leaving it to the court to guess the provision upon which he relies; and that he cannot claim it by saying he relies upon the First and Fifth Amendments without pointing out the particular protection which he seeks out of the several afforded by those two Amendments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-12\">\u201cThe appellant filed a plea in abatement in which he alleged that he had been subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury investigating the subject matter of the above indictment. He alleged that he thereupon appeared and asserted his constitutional .immunity against being compelled to testify, but notwithstanding this was examined and compelled to give testimony. Upon the trial of the plea it was shown that when he came before the grand jury he was told that he was at liberty to assert his privilege in respect to any answers to questions which might tend to incriminate him. He thereupon stated that he was going to stand upon his constitutional rights. In response to questions relating to his dealings with .Bob he answered the questions freely without raising constitutional objections. He was not only a lawyer himself but appears to have been advised by counsel. We have no doubt that his rights were not invaded. It is to be remembered that the appellant had not the constitutional privilege to refuse to testify which belongs to a defendant on trial. He was subject to call as a witness and only had the right of any witness to decline to give answers when interrogated which might tend to incriminate him. O\u2019Connell v. United States, 2 Cir., 40 F.2d 201, 205; Mulloney v. United States, 1 Cir., 79 F.2d 566. As Professor Wigmore has said, the privilege is \u2018an option of refusal and not a prohibition of inquiry\u2019. Wigmore Evidence, 2d Ed., \u00a7 2268. The appellant is apparently under the erroneous impression that a general statement that he would stand upon his constitutional rights was a substitute for objections to answering specific questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-15\">From these authorities I deduce the principle that a witness waives the privilege unless he claims it clearly, distinctly, expressly, specifically and in unmistakable terms. When the district judge said Fitzpatrick\u2019s position \u201ccertainly left much to be desired as to whether he was actually claiming self-incrimination or not,\u201d he was finding that Fitzpatrick had not claimed the privilege in the fashion the cases say it must he invoked if waiver is to be avoided. In order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>to amount to a claim, the language of a witness must leave <em>nothing </em>to be desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The majority of this court agree, I note, with the trial judge\u2019s appraisal of Fitzpatrick\u2019s statement. They say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">\u201cPerhaps, if we were of clear opinion that Fitzpatrick, and therefore Quinn, did claim the privilege and so must be acquitted, we should dispose of the matter finally here and now. * * * But a majority of the court are not of that clear opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">We should not let the fact that Quinn and Fitzpatrick would have been entitled to the privilege, had it been invoked,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> color our thinking as to whether the privilege was claimed. The question is not whether immunity should have been granted if claimed ; it is whether the privilege was claimed. For, as the Supreme Court said in United States v. Murdock, 284 U.S. at page 148, 52 S.Ct. at page 64, 76 L.Ed. 210:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">\u201c * * * The validity of his justification depends, not upon claims that would have been warranted by the facts shown, but upon the claim that actually was made. The privilege of silence is solely for the benefit of the witness and is deemed waived unless invoked. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, 273 U.S. 103, 113, 47 S.Ct. 302, 71 L.Ed. 560.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">A brief analysis of the statements made to the subcommittee by Quinn and Fitzpatrick will suffice to show adequate support for the District Court\u2019s holding that neither claimed the protection of the Fifth Amendment against being compelled to testify against himself. I agree with the majority that their statements should be considered and evaluated \u201cin full text and context.\u201d When Quinn was asked the crucial question, his immediate reply was this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">\u201cI would like to make a statement along the lines that Mr. Fitzpatrick made yesterday\u2019 in regard to a question of that nature. I feel that the political beliefs, opinions, and associations of the American people can be held secret if they so desire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">When the question was repeated, Quinn said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\">\u201cI decline to discuss with the committee questions of that nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">Thus Quinn gave his understanding of Fitzpatrick\u2019s reason for refusing to answer the question: he understood Fitzpatrick to have relied upon the constitutional right of the American people to keep secret their political beliefs, opinions and associations. This was an obvious reference to the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment and its correlative freedom of silence, and was by no means an assertion of a personal claim by Quinn to refrain from answering on the ground that in doing so he might incriminate himself. Having stated that Fitzpatrick\u2019s statements could be regarded as the expression of his own views, Quinn said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-15\">\u201c* * * I may add I feel I have no other choice in this matter, because the defense of the Constitution, I hold sacred. I don\u2019t feel I am hiding behind the Constitution, but in this case I am standing before it, defending it, as small as I am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-16\">This about covers Quinn\u2019s examination except for this further statement by him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-17\">\u201cYesterday one of the Congressmen on the committee made the statement that people brought down here were being given an opportunity to clear themselves-, as it were. I would like to say I don\u2019t feel it is an opportunity to. clear myself. I feel the opportunity I am given here is a -choice of clearing myself at the price of assisting this committee and destroying the Constitution, and I could not join the committee in doing that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-18\">* * * * * ' *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>\u201cI think it is clear this hearing was called solely for the purpose of interfering with our election.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ad-dedup-0\">Far from invoking a constitutional protection for himself, Quinn conceived that he was defending the Constitution against the encroachment of the subcommittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In the light of the foregoing, I suggest that no matter what Fitzpatrick had said, Quinn demonstrated his understanding of the statements he adopted as being that all the American people, including himself, had the right to keep secret their political beliefs, opinions and associations, and that he was prepared to defend this First Amendment freedom against the attack of the subcommittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Putting that suggestion aside, however, and assuming that Quinn\u2019s adoption of Fitzpatrick\u2019s language was without qualification on his part, so as to entitle him to the privilege if Fitzpatrick had in fact claimed it, 1 now consider Fitzpatrick\u2019s statements in full text and context. As the district judge observed, Fitzpatrick\u2019s remarks were long and rambling. He began by asking and obtaining permission to make a few preliminary remarks. After a diatribe against the committee, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cI will answer all honest questions put to me, but <em>l </em>have no intention of joining with the people who seek to destroy the Constitution of this country, whether witnesses or anybody else. To me, the Constitution of this country is not a scrap of paper.' It is something to be maintained. I have two sons. I want them to have the same freedoms and rights that I have enjoyed.- If I can\u2019t leave this world a better world, I want to leave it just as good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">\u201cThe Constitution of this country provides certain protection for minorities and gives the privilege for people to speak and think as they feel they should and want to. It also gives the privilege that people can have opinions or beliefs that may be unpopular. In my opinion, it gives them the right to hold those opinions secret if they so desire. This is a protection of the First Amendment to the Constitution, supplemented by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay8\">Following this, Fitzpatrick was asked the question whether he was or had ever been a member of the Communist Party. His immediate response was this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">\u201cMr. Chairman, in my opening remarks I gave quite a bit of my attitude on this question. I say that this committee has no right to pry into my mind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">Upon insistence by the committee counsel that he answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d or decline to answer, Fitzpatrick said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-13\">\u201cI will answer the question. The Constitution guarantees the right to me and every other citizen to have beliefs, whether they are popular or unpopular, and to keep them to themselves if they see fit, and I have no intention of being a party to weakening or destroying that protection in the Constitution. I feel when I take this position that I am one of the real Americans, and not like some of the phonies who appear here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ai\">After this statement the following colloquy occurred between Fitzpatrick on the one hand and the chairman and counsel on the other:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-14\">\u201cMr. Wood. Now will you answer the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-15\">\u201cMr. Fitzpatrick. I have answered the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-16\">\u201cMr. Wood. It is not an answer at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-17\">\u201cMr. Fitzpatrick. That is my answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-18\">\u201cMr. Wood. Do you mean that is the only answer you are going to give ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-19\">\u201cMr. Fitzpatrick. That is the way it ha-s to be answered, according to my conscience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-20\">\u201cMr. Wood. Is that the only answer you will give to the question whether you are now or ever have been a member of the Communist Party?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>\u201cMr. Fitzpatrick. That is the only-answer I can conscientiously give you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">\u201cMr. Tavenner. Mr. Fitzpatrick, you were present yesterday during the testimony here. You heard it stated under oath that you are a member of the Communist Party. Do you deny that accusation ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">\u201cMr. Fitzpatrick; The answer to my previous question is the answer to this question. I have no intention of permitting this committee to abridge my constitutional rights on political opinions, associations, who I work with, who I meet with, what I read or think, or anything of that kind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201cMr. Tavenner. So, in other words, you refuse to answer the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">\u201cMr. Fitzpatrick. I don\u2019t refuse to answer the question. I have answered the question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">During the remainder of his testimony Fitzpatrick made such statements as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">\" * * * I have no intention of discussing my political actions or activities with this committee, for the reasons that I have stated before.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">\u201cI say it is no affair of the committee what organizations I belong to. The previous answer applies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">\" * * * So far as my beliefs, my political activities, my associations, affiliations, what I read, those are rights guaranteed to me and every other citizen of this Nation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\"><em>\" * * * </em>The opportunity you give me is to join with you and these other witnesses who appeared here yesterday and say the Constitution is a scrap of paper and it gives no protection to the people and you fellows have a right to delve into the mind of everybody who comes here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">\u201c * * * Do you have thought control in the United States now? Are you going to convict people oh thinking? I think maybe you fellows should read that Constitution.,\u201d \u2018</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">I find nothing in Fitzpatrick\u2019s testimony which even indicates, that he refused to say whether he was or ever had been a member of the Communist Party because he feared his answer might incriminate him, or that he relied on the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment in declining to respond. It is true that he mentioned the Fifth Amendment twice. His first reference to it was a preliminary remark which I have quoted above, when he said people can have unpopular opinions or beliefs and hold them secret if they so desire. \u201cThis,\u201d he said, \u201cis a protection of the First Amendment to the Constitution, supplemented by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-16\">Thus he described his reference to the two Amendments as being the freedom of speech and silence guaranteed to all people by the First Amendment, as somehow supplemented by the Fifth, \u2014 perhaps the due process clause. His point was that all people have the right to keep silent as to their political opinions because the freedom of speech clause guarantees that right; that he shared in that right and refused to answer because of it, \u2014 not at all because to speak of his political opinions and associations might incriminate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-17\">A second time Fitzpatrick referred to the First and Fifth Amendments, when he was asked whether he had solicited one Copeland to join the Communist Party, and responded by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-18\">\u201cI will not talk about my association and actions with people who I know, what I did, or anything else. I don\u2019t think it reflects on my loyalty or disloyalty or anything else.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-19\">The chairman of the committee then inquired :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-20\">\u201cMr. Fitzpatrick,\u2019 did you ever at any time during, the year 1943 furnish an application blank and request Clarence D. Copeland to sign and make application for membership in the -Communist Political Association, or the \u2018Communist Party?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-21\">\u201cMr. Fitzpatrick. Mr. Chairman, do I have to give you my answer again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-22\">\u201cMr. Wood. I just want to know, whether you did that one thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201cMr. Fitzpatrick. I say if I did or if I did not, regardless of what I did, it is not the affair of this committee to pry into this kind of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">\u201cMr. Wood. And for that reason do . you decline to answer the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">\u201cMr. Fitzpatrick. I stand on the protection of the 'Constitution, the First and Fifth Amendments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">\u201cMr. Wood. And for those reasons decline to answer the questions further?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">\u201cMr. Fitzpatrick. I have answered the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">\u201cMr. Wood. I say, do you decline to answer it further?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">\u201cMr. Fitzpatrick. I have no further comment on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">In this instance also, Fitzpatrick made it abundantly clear he was not invoking the two Amendments to avoid giving an incriminating answer, but that he thought the Amendments barred the committee from asking the question which would pry into his mind and would violate his constitutional right to be silent if an answer were compelled. I find it impossible to regard Fitzpatrick\u2019s statements as amounting to a \u25a0claim to the constitutional immunity from self-incrimination. Measured by the strict standards announced in the cases I have \u25a0cited, by which the language of a witness must be measured in determining whether he actually intended to and did claim the privilege, Fitzpatrick\u2019s statements fall far short of constituting such a claim. As the trial judge said, they certainly leave much to be desired. Cf. Emspak v. United States, (1952) 91 U.S.App.D.C. 378, 203 F.2d 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">I conclude, therefore, that the district judge not only did in fact find that Fitzpatrick did not claim the privilege, but also that he was amply justified in so finding, \u25a0despite the fact that, after Quinn\u2019s conviction, Fitzpatrick himself was found not guilty by a different district judge, 1951, 96 F.Supp. 491, who seems not to have considered Fitzpatrick\u2019s statements \u201cin full text and context,\u201d but acquitted him solely because he used the words \u201cFifth Amendment.\u201d I think it is impossible to spell out a claim of the privilege from Fitzpatrick\u2019s references to the Fifth Amendment, when they are considered in full text and context. Considered in that realistic way, they show Fitzpatrick had no intention of invoking the Amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">I am authorized to say Judge PROCTOR concurs in this dissenting opinion; and that Judge CLARK also concurs except that, being of the opinion that the claim of privilege is a highly personal one and must be made by the person claiming it and not by reference, he thinks the trial judge was right in holding Quinn could not adopt the statements of Fitzpatrick.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-8\">. Furthermore, I doubt if the question whether Fitzpatrick\u2019s statements amounted to a claim of immunity is a question of fact at all. There is no issue as to what Fitzpatrick\u2019s language was, \u2014 there is no contrariety of proof as to what words he used. The question was, did that language, those words, constitute a claim of immunity? Counsel for Quinn conceded during oral argument that this is a legal question and not an issue of fact. But whether so or not, it is in my view unnecessary to decide, since I think the issue of fact (if it be such) which the majority say the trial court should have determined, and for the determination of which they remand the ease, was actually decided by the trial judge, as I shall show later in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-21\">. <em>4 </em>Barron, Federal Practice and' Procedure, \u00a7 2124.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b90-19\">.
