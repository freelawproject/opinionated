Under the lease, Deavers could be required to quit the premises within 60 days, if the owner should at any time sell the property. In April 1945, Deavers contracted to sell the business to defendant Belew. Belew took over the business and served as its manager under a \u201cManager\u2019s Operating Agreement\u201d with Deavers. He did not acquire title to the business, but by February 1946 he had a $3,400 equity in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">In October 1945 the business was offered for sale for $11,000 through defendants-appellants Young and Pastor, partners in a business-chance brokerage firm licensed in the District of Columbia. Plaintiff Ward, who had previously bought a similar \u2014 and entirely satisfactory \u2014 business through these brokers, investigated the proposal with the-aid of one of their employees. Shortly thereafter she put up $1,000, and offered to buy the business. Belew accepted the offer as \u201cowner.\u201d The sale hung in suspense, for various reasons, until mid-February of 1946, when Pastor, with whom plaintiff had been dealing for the most part, renewed his efforts to complete it. On February 14, Mrs. Ward raised her deposit to $2,500 and signed a new sales contract with Belew as owner. The next day she signed a \u201cManager\u2019s Operating Agreement\u201d offered by Deavers and similar to that he had given Belew, in lieu of a bill of sale. By its terms she was to pay Deavers part of the purchase price in installments during the remaining 13months of the lease on the premises, thereby acquiring the right to purchase the assets and good will of the business at the expiration of the lease for a nominal sum. At the same time, plaintiff gave Deavers a note for $4,000, covering the installments and final payment due him, and another note for $3,400 which he immediately indorsed to Belew \u201cwithout recourse,\u201d evidently to cover Belew\u2019s equity in the business. She also executed a note for the balance of the purchase price \u2014 $1,100\u2014to Young and Pastor, covering their commission on the transaction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff entered into possession immediately. Within three months the premises were sold and within seven months the new owner demanded possession. Approximately ten months after she bought the business, plaintiff surrendered the premises in which it was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">After the new owner\u2019s demand for possession, plaintiff brought this action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Her complaint was entitle \u201cComplaint for Rescission of Business Sales Contract; the Cancellation of a Certain Manager\u2019s Operating Contract, and of Certain Promissory Notes Representing Part of Consideration of said Business Sales Contract.\u201d The prayer for relief asked that these contracts and notes be surrendered to the court \"by [for?] cancellation,\u201d that plaintiff\u2019s total cash investment in the business be returned, that the court \u201cascertain the expenses and damages suffered by plaintiff\u201d and enter judgment therefor, and that further just and proper relief be granted. Plaintiff named as defendants, and served, Pastor and his statutory surety, Young and his statutory surety, and Belew.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Other named defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ants, among them Deavers, were never validly served with process, and the action proceeded without them. The court, after trial without a jury, entered a Memorandum Opinion <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in which it made findings of fraud, concealment and damage, and concluded \u201cas a matter of law, that the plaintiff is entitled to rescind and she is to have judgment to that effect.\u201d Then, seeking to restore the <em>status quo ante, </em>it entered money judgments against Pastor, Young and Belew, and decreed that \u201call notes * * * executed by plaintiff and arising out of this transaction, are herewith can-celled.\u201d Neither contract was specifically rescinded in the judgment. Plaintiff, dissatisfied with the sums awarded and the court\u2019s dismissal of the action \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d as to the two defendant sureties, appealed. Defendants Young and Pastor, dissatisfied with any finding for the plaintiff, filed a counter-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In their counter-appeal, the brokers contend that Deavers was an indispensable party and that by reason of his absence the trial court \u201cwas without jurisdiction to hear the case.\u201d The issue thus presented requires resolution at the outset. It is settled that \u201cRescission of a contract, or declaration of its invalidity, as to some of the parties, but not as to others, is not generally permitted.\u201d Roos v. Texas Co., 2 Cir., 1927, 23 F.2d 171, 172. In this case there were two writings' \u2014 the sales contract of February 14 signed by the parties Ward and Belew, and the Manager\u2019s Agreement of February 15 signed by Mrs. Ward and by Deavers, who was not a party to this suit. It seems reasonably clear that the sales contract of February 14 became a nullity on February 15 by merger in the Manager\u2019s Agreement. But even if it did not, we think it was not severable from the rest of the transaction for separate rescission, though the formal parties to it were before the court. Nor could the remainder of the transaction\u2014the Manager\u2019s Agreement, signed by Deavers\u2014be rescinded in the absence of Deavers. \u201c[T]here is a general rule that where rights sued upon arise from a contract all parties to it must be joined.\u201d Gauss v. Kirk, 1952, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 80, 198 F.2d 83, 84. Under the agreement, Deavers was entitled, <em>inter alia, </em>to prompt monthly payment of $250 for 13% months, or, failing this, restoration of the premises \u201cwith all of the equipment, furnishings, stock in trade, or other chattels therein contained * * unencumbered and in good condition. He was an indispensable party because a final decree rescinding the agreement could hardly be made without \u201caffecting\u201d his interest, Shields v. Barrow, 1854, 17 How. 130, 136, 15 L.Ed. 158. Because the transaction could not be rescinded as to Deavers, it could not be rescinded at all. Roos v. Texas Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">Although the District Court lacked jurisdiction to rescind, it did not therefore lack jurisdiction \u201cto hear the case,\u201d as Young and Pastor contend. Since the complaint alleged that \u201cthe entire transaction was fraudulent,\u201d and that others beside Deavers were implicated, the court should have considered whether relief other than rescission should not be granted, despite Deavers\u2019 absence, against parties actually before the court. Rule 54(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S. C.A., requires that the court\u2019s final judgment \u201cgrant the relief to which the party in' whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in his pleadings.\u201d Such a situation may present an occasion for application of Rule 19(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See Gauss v. Kirk, supra, 91 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>App.D.C. 80, 198 F.2d at page 86. On the other hand, if the court finds that plaintiff was entitled to tort damages against persons actually served Deavers\u2019 presence before the court is neither indispensable nor necessary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">We turn now to the merits of the case. The trial court\u2019s ultimate finding that fraud was committed by the brokers and by Belew appears to be based on its findings (1) that \u201call of the defendants concealed from the plaintiff the fact that Belew was not the owner of the property in question,\u201d and (2) that there were \u201coutstanding two other sales agreements of the same property.\u201d (Memorandum Opinion.)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We find no adequate support in the record for the first of these basic findings. Plaintiff knew that both Deavers and Belew were interested in the business (Complaint, par. 7; Tr. 72, 75). She knew that neither one was owner of the real estate itself (Complaint, par. 7). She dealt with both men, and clearly knew she was buying up their respective interests in the business.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We find no evidence of misrepresentation as to Belew\u2019s interest,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> much less any misrepresentation in that regard on which plaintiff relied and acted with consequent injury. Cf. Imperial Assurance Co. of N. Y. v. Joseph Supornick &amp; Son, 8 Cir., 1950, 184 F.2d 930, 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Again, we think the \u201ctwo other sales agreements of the same property\u201d afford no basis for the relief attempted. The court no doubt refers to the 1945 agreement-between Deavers- and Belew and to a contract made in 1946 between Deavers and a Mrs. Restine. The first of these was superseded by the plaintiff\u2019s purchase of the business. Belew joined in the transfer to her, and effectively parted with his interest. As to the contract between Deavers and Mrs. Restine entered into in January 1946: there is nothing to indicate that it was ever made the basis of any claim against Mrs. Ward or anyone else, or that any injury was caused plaintiff by it, or that any misrepresentation in connection with it was ever made to her.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">If the trial court's general finding of fraud is to be sustained, it must be on other grounds, not specified iby the court. We have reviewed the entire transcript of testimony, but find nothing in it which so decisively points to fraud as to dispense with the need for specific findings. We have considered whether to reverse outright, under the doctrine that fraud must be clearly and convincingly shown. Public Motor Service v. Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, 1938, 69 App.D.C. 89, 91, 99 F.2d 124, 126. But we recognize that the evidence here on many points is conflicting, and that the trial court, which heard the witnesses, is in a much better position than we to reach a conclusion on the question of fraud. Cf. Wynne v. Boone, 1951, 88 U.S. App.D.C. 363, 191 F.2d 220. Accordingly, we think the case should be remanded. Plaintiff must, of course, show fraud committed by or imputable to the defendants who are actually before the court, in order to justify relief as against them. And she must show that the fraud caused the injury of which she complains: damages therefor must be measured by the usual tests of causality rather than by ah effort to restore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>the <em>status quo ante.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Cf. Draisner v. Lowenstein, 1952, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 98, 198 F.2d 295. Here, again, new findings are called for. Upon remand, the court should also reexamine its dismissal of the action, without prejudice, as to the statutory sureties of Young and Pastor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Absent good reason for declining to decide it, we think the issue of the sureties\u2019 liability should be settled finally in the present action. No such reason appears in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment will be</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-10\">. The $3,400 note indorsed to Belew and the $1,100 note to Young and Pastor were at first issued in the form of a $4,500 note payable directly to Belew. The latter note was destroyed when the two replacements for it were executed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-16\">. Young\u2019s surety as a licensed <em>broker </em>was Maryland Casualty Company; Pastor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>was Aetna Casualty , Surety Company.

That rule provides: \u201cWhen persons who are not indispensable, but who ought to be parties if complete relief is to be accorded between those already parties, have not been made parties and are subject to the jurisdiction of the court as to both service of process and venue and can be made parties without depriving the court of jurisdiction of the parties before it, the court shall order them summoned to appear in the action. The court in its discretion may proceed in the action without making such persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>parties, if its jurisdiction over them as to either service of process or venue can be acquired only by their consent or voluntary appearance o.r if, though they are subject to its jurisdiction, their join-der would deprive the court of jurisdiction of the parties before it; but the judgment rendered therein does not affect the rights or liabilities of absent persons.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">. \u201cTort feasors are not indispensable or necessary to an action against one of their number, because \u25a0 their liability is both joint and several.\u201d 3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, par. 19.07; Wells v.

If, upon the remand, the court proceeds to an award of damages against any defendant properly served who remains in possession of notes arising from this transaction, cancellation thereof by physical destruction as an offset to the award may then bo within the range of proper relief.
