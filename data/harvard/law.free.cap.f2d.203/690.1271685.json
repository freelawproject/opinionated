M. Sibley Lumber Company, in the amount of $3,317.28, which reduced appellee\u2019s claim from $3,465.75;</p>\n<p id=\"b738-18\">And it appearing from the record on this appeal that the real issue in the case is merely a question of fact and that there is substantial evidence to support the finding of the referee as to that issue which pertained to the claimed mechanic\u2019s lien;</p>\n<p id=\"b738-20\">And no principle of law being more firmly established in this circuit than that the \u201cconcurrent findings of the referee in bankruptcy and the district judge are not to be set aside, except upon clear demonstration of mistake\u201d, see Cunningham v. Elco Distributors, 6 Cir., 189 F.2d 87, 89, 25 A.L.R.2d 1008; and the eight Sixth Circuit cases there cited;</p>\n<p id=\"b738-21\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
