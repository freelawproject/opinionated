C., for Commissioner of Patents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b816-7\">- Before GARRETT, Chief Judge, and O\u2019CONNELL, JOHNSON, WORLEY, and COLE, Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b816-8\">O\u2019CONNELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">This is an appeal from 'the decision' of the Commissioner of Patents affirming the decision of the Examiner of Trade-Marks denying appellant\u2019s application for registration on the Principal Register under the Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1051 et seq., of the mark \u201cEZ FLO\u201d for use on insecticides (dusts), plant and horticultural parasiti-cides, agricultural, crop and animal sprays, fungicides, and plant hormones for agricultural use.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">The sole, rej ection advanced by the examiner and approved by the commissioner is that the mark as a whole is descriptive within the purview of section 2(e) of the character or quality of the goods with which it is used,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the letters \u201cEZ\u201d together with the misspelled word \u201cFlo,\u201d are merely the phonetic equivalent of the words \u201cEasy Flow.\u201d 91 U.S.P.Q. 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">The Solicitor for the Patent Office in support of the decision appealed from properly urges that the involved dust is one which is sprayed; that the passage of dust through a spraying device, either in a solution of liquid or entrained in a gas, such as air, would ordinarily be described as a flow; and that the only reasonable impression which could be derived from the words \u201cEasy Flow\u201d when applied to material designed to be sprayed, is that such material would flow easily, uniformly, and without clogging the spraying device.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWR\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the words which constitute its mark are not descriptive but merely suggestive of the desirable character or quality of the goods with which the mark is used cannot therefore be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-15\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AG-\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-10\">.
