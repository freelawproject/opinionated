Marshall, a resident of Pennsylvania, for his wife, Dora, is includible in his gross estate under Section 811(c) (1) (C) of the Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-28\">The nub of the controversy is the provision in the trusts that in the event Mrs. Marshall did not exercise granted general powers of appointment the property was to go \u201cto such person or persons as would be entitled thereto under the intestate law of the State of Pennsylvania if she had at that time died seized and possessed of the trust estate\u201d, and the fact that under the intestate law of Pennsylvania Marshall would have been entitled to one-third of his wife\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-29\">The Tax Court, three judges dissenting, ruled against the inclusion of any part of the trust properties in Mr. Marshall\u2019s estate. In doing so it found facts establishing that the trusts for Mrs. Marshall were created by the decedent in consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>and: as restitution for property previously transferred by her to him and that the decedent had not by \u201cexpress terms\u201d retained a reversionary interest in the trust property and that the reversionary interest, if any, existed by reason of operation of. law.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The pertinent facts may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Marshall died on May 16, 1945; while a resident of Pennsylvania. He was survived by Mrs. Marshall and six children.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">On or about December- 31, 1930, at Marshall\u2019s request and because he required them for business purposes,. Mrs. .Marshall and the . six children transferred to him their second preferred stock holdings in the Mc-Clintic-Marshall Corporation. Marshall pledged he would malee proper restitution for the stock to Mrs. Marshall and the children. On February 23, 1931, he made out a memorandum indicating that he owed Mrs. Marshall $374,790 \u2014 the value of the stock she had given him.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">At or about that time Marshall submitted -to his wife and children the texts of two trust- instruments which he proposed to execute and asked them whether the provision of the trusts would be satisfactory restitution for the stock which they had transferred to him. They agreed that the trusts would be satisfactory restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">In March, 1931, Marshall created two trusts, for present purposes in identical terms, one-third of which was for the benefit of Mrs. Marshall and in consideration of and in restitution for her earlier stock transfer to him. The deeds of trust provided that the income from a specified part of each trust should be paid to Mrs. Marshall for life and at her death the trusts were to terminate as to those parts and the trustee was to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">\u201c * * * pay over and distribute the same in such manner and in such proportions as site shall by her last will and testament direct, limit, and. appoint,. and, in default of such appointment, shall pay over and distribute the same to such person or persons as would be entitled thereto under the intestate law of the State of Pennsylvania.if she had at that time died seized and possessed' of the trust estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">The intestate law of Pennsylvania in effect at the time of the execution of the two trusts provided that a surviving spouse is entitled to one-third of the estate of a deceased spouse where more than one child or one child and the issue of a deceased child survive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">Mrs. Marshall, on January 26, 1943, relinquished the powers of appointment given her by the trust deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">The fair market value of Mrs. Marshall\u2019s interest in the two trusts at the time of the transfers was $616,021.66, and at the date of decedent\u2019s death was $605,533.34. \u25a0 The value of Mrs. Marshall\u2019s life interest at the latter date was $156,972.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-17\">The Commissioner originally, in determining the deficiency, included in the gross estate $448,912.80 representing the value of the remainder interest after the life estate of Mrs. Marshall in the two trusts. He later revised his deficiency determination to the sum- of $448,560.93 and finally, at the hearing before the Tax Court, reduced his claim to one-third of the revised sum\u2014 $149,520.31 \u2014 conceding that the latter was the maximum amount which could have reverted to Marshall under the then (and present) Pennsylvania intestate law.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-18\">On this review the Commissioner contends the Tax Court erred in determining (1) the asserted reversionary interest arose by operation of law and not by express terms of the deeds of trust and (2) the indications were that Marshall was not thinking of himself and had no intention to retain a reversionary interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-19\">It must be noted at this point that the Commissioner does not here contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the Tax Court erred in its finding that the trusts were created in consideration of and .as restitution for the $374,790 stock which Mrs. Marshall transferred to him. Accordingly, the Commissioner\u2019s claim must be tak\u2022en to have been reduced (on this review) in consonance with the determined consideration under Section 811 (i) of the Internal Revenue Code<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which provides that the value of the property includible must be reduced by the value of consideration received for the transfer by the settlor-de-cedent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">In reply to the Commissioner\u2019s contention the taxpayer asserts that the Tax Court\u2019s decision should be affirmed, not only for the reasons which it assigned in its opinion, but Also because the necessary survivorship test for includibility under Section 811(c) (1) (C) is not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Upon consideration of the record, the provisions of Section 811 and their legislative history, we are of the opinion that the Tax Court\u2019s decision should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">First, we are in accord with the Tax \u25a0Court\u2019s determination that Marshall had not by express terms retained a reversion-ary interest nor indicated a conscious intent to affect such a retention. Second, we are of the opinion that the necessary sur-vivorship test for includibility was not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">On the first score:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">It would serve no useful purpose to restate here what has been so well said by the Tax Court in its opinion with reference to its determination that Marshall had not \u201cby express terms\u201d retained a reversionary interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">This case is governed by the provisions of Section 811(c) of the Internal Revenue Code as amended by Section 7 of the Technical Changes Act of October 25, 1949, c. 720, 63 Stat. 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">The Technical Changes Act was designed as relief legislation \u2014 relief that is, for the taxpayer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, it must be administered with that salient consideration in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">It is well-settled that words used in a statute must be considered to have been used by Congress in consonance with the common acceptance of the meaning of such words. Application of that principle to the instant case can have but one result. Section 811(c) (2) provides that \u201cAn interest in property of which the decedent made a transfer, on or before October 7, 1949, intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death shall not be included in his gross estate * * * unless the decedent has retain\u00e9d a reversionary interest in the property, arising by the <em>express terms </em>of the instrument of transfer and not by operation of law * * (Emphasis supplied.) The word \u201cexpress\u201d means \u201cdirectly and distinctly stated; expressed, not merely implied or left to inference\u201d;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u201cthat is express which is worded with intention.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Clearly there was not a reseryation \u201cby express terms\u201d in the instant case. The Commissioner does not even attempt to argue here that there was a retention of a reversionary interest <em>by </em>express terms. What he does say is that \u201cThe decedent, clearly had retained a <em>possibility </em>of reverter in the trust corpus\u201d. While he ignores the requirement that there must be a retention \u201cby express terms\u201d we, of course, cannot do so. The statute has spelled out the requirement that retention of a reverter must be \u201cby the express terms\u201d and \u201cexpress\u201d and \u201cpossibility\u201d cannot be construed as synonymous by any stretch of the imagination.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">On the second score :</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">As previously stated, the Tax .Court based its decision on the fact that there had not been a retention of reverter by \u201cexpress terms\u201d and for that reason apparently did not consider it necessary to rule on the taxpayer\u2019s further contention that the transfers made by Marshall were not \u201cintended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death\u201d within the meaning of Section 811(c) (1) (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The taxpayer has asked us on this review to consider the latter question. The sum and substance of its contention in this respect is that a transfer does not come within Section 811(c) (1) (C) unless the beneficiaries must survive the decedent to obtain possession or enjoyment of the transferred interest and in the instant case if the intestate law had been changed, or if decedent had divorced or failed to support his wife, the beneficiaries could have taken the entire remainder even if they had not survived the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">In our view the taxpayer is correct in its contention that the transfer was not intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the decedent\u2019s death. The \u201cnecessary survivorship\u201d rule became part of the Treasury Regulations in 1946, when the so-called \u201cHallock\u201d regulations, were promulgated. Reg. 105, \u00a7 81.17, T.D. 5512 (1946). As it originally appeared, the rule provided that a transfer is \u201cintended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death\u201d, and hence the value of the transferred property is includible in the decedent\u2019s gross estate, if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-12\">\u201c(1) possession or enjoyment of the transferred interest can be obtained only by beneficiaries who <em>must </em>survive the decedent <em>* </em>* (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-14\">The legislative history of the 1949' amendments to section 811(c) indicates-clearly that the necessary survivorship rule was to remain undisturbed. The Senate Committee on Finance, in approving the amendments, recognized the rule,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and, in its discussion of <em>the bill after it was in its-</em>final form the Conference Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-15\">\u201c * * * The existing rule that a transfer of a property interest is not intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the decedent\u2019s death unless the beneficiaries <em>must </em>survive the decedent to obtain possession or enjoyment is not disturbed.\u201d (Cum. Bull. 295, 298; Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-17\">The Hallock regulations promulgated on-March 8, 1951, to implement the 1949 amendments, are to the same effect.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-18\">Undoubtedly then, in determining whether a transferred interest which might revert back to the settlor-decedent was intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death, we must inquire whether it was possible, immediately prior thereto for some person who need not have survived him to take that interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Or, otherwise stated, we must determine whether there was any other con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>tingency, besides the settlor-decedent\u2019s death, upon the happening of which his re-verter interest would be entirely cut off. If there was, and that contingency was \u201creal\u201d, then the transfer was not intended to take effect in possession and enjoyment at or after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">At the moment preceding Marshall\u2019s death it was possible for beneficiaries to take the one-third interest without surviving him. This could have resulted (1) by a change in the intestate laws of Pennsylvania, mitigating or eliminating the surviving spouse\u2019s share; (2) under the present intestate laws if Marshall had divorced his wife or she had divorced him;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (3) if Marshall either wilfully neglected or refused to provide for Mrs. Marshall for one year previous to her death, or if he wilfully and maliciously had deserted her for that period.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Had any one of those things occurred, the one-third interest which decedent would otherwise have gotten, would have gone to persons (the children, if they survived their mother) who would not have had to survive the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Nor can these contingencies be disregarded on the ground that they are \u201cunreal\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> They cannot he regarded as \u201csham\u201d,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for, as the Tax Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">\u201cThe indications are that the decedent was not thinking of himself or intending to provide that a part of the trust property was to revert to him and was not to pass to others save upon the condition that he predeceased his wife * * * It seems unlikely that he had it in mind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>The possible contingencies taken together under which beneficiaries <em>could </em>have taken the interest without surviving Marshall cannot be regarded as so remote as to be \u201cunreal\u201d. . \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Thus, there being another event ' (or events) upon which the beneficiaries could have taken the one-third interest without surviving the decedent, the transfer was not \u201cintended .to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his (Marshall\u2019s) death\u201d and is therefore not includible in Marshall\u2019s gross estate..</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">For the reasons stated the decision of the Tax.Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-16\">.

An analysis of the examples provided in the 1946 Hallock regulations (see in particular Examples 3 and 8) and the 1951 regulations, indicates beyond a doubt that the necessary survivorship rule is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>to be applied to the circumstances as they existed <em>immediately prior </em>to the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The Commissioner relies on Goldstone v. United States, 1945, 325 U.S. 687, 65 S.Ot. 1323, 1326, 89 L.Ed. 1871, for the proposition that we must concern ourselves only with the <em>actualities </em>as they existed at the death of the decedent, and not with what <em>might still </em>have happened. The Court there said: \u201cEvents that might have but failed to take place so as to erase a decedent\u2019s reversionary interest must be ignored * * But that language was not addressed to the problem under consideration (the case was decided before the Hallock regulations were promulgated), but rather to the problem of whether the decedent had retained a reverter. Taxpayer there contended that since there was a contingency which might have cut off decedent\u2019s re-verter, decedent retained no reverter even though the contingency never occurred. The Court properly held that in determining whether there is a reverter, events which might have happened to cut it off, but did not in fact happen, must be ignored. In the instant ease the decedent retained a reverter, but under the regulations promulgated since the Gold-stone case more is required than a re-verter. It is now required that the beneficiaries who would take the retained interest if the decedent did not (in this case the children) must only be able to take that interest by surviving the decedent. If we must look only to actualities as they exist at the time of death, and ignore what might have happened but did not, the regulation would not say \u201cunless possession or enjoyment of the transferred property <em>can </em>* * * be obtained <em>only </em>by surviving the decedent\u201d.
