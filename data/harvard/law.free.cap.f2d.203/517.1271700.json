Plaintiff, upon institution of suit, sought a preliminary injunction, which Judge Btirke granted to the extent of requiring defendant to disclaim any connection between its goods and plaintiff and to take other steps to guard against deception of customers. Admiral Corp. v. Penco, Inc., D.C.W.D. N.Y., 101 F.Supp. 677. Then after a full trial he eventually found for the plaintiff, D.C.W.D.N.Y., 106 F.Supp. 1015, granting it a permanent injunction of yet more complete character, based upon findings of trade-mark infringement, unfair \"competition, and deliberate palming off by defendant of its products under the trade-mark \u201cAdmiral.\u201d Deeming defendant\u2019s action flagrant, he also awarded, in addition to ordinary costs, an extra sum of $2,000 for attorney\u2019s fees. But since the products of the two companies were not the same and no material damage had as yet been sustained by the plaintiff to its reputation or good will or through loss of sales, the court denied plaintiff an accounting for profits. Both parties have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">Judge Burke\u2019s opinion cited above sets forth the facts clearly and succinctly, and \u25a0we shall assume familiarity with it. Plaintiff owns and operates numerous manufacturing plants throughout the United States and maintains distributors in this country and throughout the world. It now manufactures or distributes television sets, radios, radio-phonograph combinations, refrigerators, electric ranges, and some miscellaneous appliances and parts. Defendant has an office and store in 'Rochester, and operates stores in Elmira, Binghamton, Syracuse, and Buffalo \u2014 all .in New York state. It does not manufacture the products it sells, which are electric vacuum cleaners, electric sewing machines, electric floor polishers, and parts for these appliances. It sells only at retail, principally to housewives and in homes. Defendant buys its vacuum cleaners in 'Chicago and they are shipped either to its affiliate, Price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Vacuum Stores, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Philadelphia, or direct to defendant\u2019s stores in New York state. Defendant\u2019s sewing machines are imported from Japan, where the trademark \u201cAdmiral\u201d is affixed. They, too, are delivered to Price Vacuum in Philadelphia and shipped from there to defendant\u2019s stores in New York state.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\u201cAdmiral\u201d was first adopted by Columbia Radio Corporation as its mark for radios in October, 1929. In 1936, Columbia assigned the trade-mark, with its good will, to Continental Radio and Television Corporation, which had been incorporated in 1934 and which in 1943 changed its name to Admiral Corporation. \u201cAdmiral\u201d has been used as its house mark since 1939 and has since been in continuous use as the dominant trade-mark for all its products. Current annual sales exceed $200,000,000. Since the adoption and use of the trademark \u201cAdmiral,\u201d plaintiff has sold in excess of $1,000,000,000 worth of its products valued at retail under the trade-mark \u201cAdmiral\u201d and has spent approximately $47,-000. 000.in thus advertising its goods. Its products are sold throughout the world. Its trade-mark \u201cAdmiral\u201d has been registered in the United States and thirty foreign countries. It is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of television sets. It has a large research staff and a sales organization of 81 distributors and over 31,000 dealers. Its products have attained general and wide acceptance and a reputation for quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Defendant did not use the trade-mark \u201cAdmiral\u201d for its electric sewing machines and vacuum cleaners until early 1950 or long after the plaintiff began its world-wide use. Before that, defendant had used the trade-mark \u201cAvalon\u201d to identify its vacuum cleaners. It then adopted the mark \u201cAdmiral\u201d because, as Price, its president, testified : \u201cWe thought \u2018Admiral\u2019 was a much nicer name as far as we were concerned. It meant tops in something. It meant the best of things, the tops of something. We thought it would be more receptive.\u201d Defendant did not advertise these products, but consistently advertised rebuilt Singer sewing machines and Electrolux vacuum cleaners at a very low price for the purpose, as the court found, \u201cof securing leads to sell its Admiral machines.\u201d 106 F. Supp. at page 1018. The court also goes into the testimony from purchasers of defendant\u2019s products as to failure to distinguish its products from plaintiff\u2019s, concealment of the stamp \u201cMade in Japan\u201d on the sewing machine, and other practices of this sort which, it found, induced actual confusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">In addition to contesting the jurisdiction of the court, defendant relies upon its right to share in the use of plaintiff\u2019s symbol, asserting (1) that the parties were not in competition, since the goods were not the same, but were \u201cradically different\u201d; (2) that the defendant adopted the mark only after a careful search disclosed that it was available, since it was being used generally for various products; and (3) that the mark \u201cAdmiral\u201d is a technically weak, \u201cself-praise mark,\u201d which was registered some 35 times in the United States Patent Office to persons other than the plaintiff for a wide variety of goods, and hence not considered exclusive by the Patent Office, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>which had accepted and published the applications of defendant\u2019s parent company for the registration of the mark \u201cAdmiral\u201d on sewing machines and vacuum cleaners. It also asserted that the evidence did not establish any deliberate misrepresentation by it of-the origin of its sewing machines and vacuum cleaners. -</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">.[1] We must first consider defendant\u2019s objection to \u2019the court\u2019s jurisdiction, although this contention is utterly lacking in merit. There was in any event diversity of.citizenship of the parties; and the court found the amount involved to exceed $3,00.0 \u2014a finding which is clearly supported by the evidence as to the plaintiff\u2019s business investment safeguarded in .this action.. The ground actually taken by the court was that of trade-mark infringement under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338,- where no jurisdictional amount is required. Applicable also is the express grant- of the Lanham Trade-Mark Act, 15 U..S.C. \u00a7 1121. The requirement, 15 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114, 1127, that the. infringing use shall be in commerce which is subject to congressional regulation is manifestly satisfied, since defendant transported its marked goods in interstate commerce from manufactory to sales outlet. Ironite Co. v. Guarantee Waterproofing Co., 8 Cir., 64 F.2d 608. -Hence it is not necessary to consider the interesting question discussed in Dad\u2019s Root Beer Co. v. Doc\u2019s Beverages, 2 Cir., 193 F.2d 77, 79-82, whether interference with plaintiff\u2019s use in interstate commerce is sufficient. Since defendant makes some gestures, noted below, toward attempted nullification of plaintiff\u2019s trademark, we should point out that there is clearly pendent jurisdiction for the claim of unfair competition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(b). Telechron, Inc. v. Parissi, 2 Cir., 197 F.2d 757. In view of all this, we need not discuss the question \u2014 also adverted to in Dad\u2019s Root Beer Co. v. Doc\u2019s Beverages, supra \u2014 whether the Lanham Act grants new and more extensive jurisdiction over unfair competition, as held in Stauffer v. Exley, <em>9 </em>Cir., 184 F.2d 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">On the merits the decision 'below seems clearly correct. The controlling principle is now succinctly stated in st\u00e1t\u00fctory form as imitating use \u201clikely to 'cause confusion or\u2019mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source of origin of such goods or services.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While this statute of course now governs, S. C. Johnson &amp; Son v. Johnson, 2 Cir., 175 F.2d 176, 178, certiorari denied 338 U.S. 860, 70 S.Ct. 103, 94 L.Ed. 527, the same rule was applied earlier. See, e. g., Landers, Frary &amp; Clark v. Universal Cooler Corp., 2 Cir., 85 F.2d 46; Aunt Jemima Mills Co. v. Rigney &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 247 F. 407, certiorari denied 245 U.S. 672, 38 S.Ct. 222, 62 L.Ed. 540; Standard Brands v. Smidler, 2 Cir., 151 F.2d 34, 37; Triangle Publications v. Rohrlich, 2 Cir., 167 F.2d 969; Stork Restaurant v. Sahati, 9 Cir., 166 F.2d 348, 354, 355; 3 Restatement, Torts \u00a7\u00a7 730, 731 (1938). It is not necessary to show actual cases of deception or confusion, since the test is the likelihood of such confusion. Pastificio Spiga Societa per Azioni v. De Martini Macaroni Co., 2 Cir., 200 F.2d 325; Miles Shoes, Inc. v. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 199 F.2d 602, certiorari denied 345 U.S. 909, 73 S.Ct. 650; LaTouraine Coffee Co. v. Lorraine Coffee Co., 2 Cir., 157 F.2d 115, 117, certiorari denied 329 U.S. 771, 67 S.Ct. 189, 91 L.Ed. 663; George W. Luft Co. v. Zande Cosmetic Co., 2 Cir., 142 F.2d 536, certiorari denied 323 U.S. 756, 65 S.Ct. 90, 89 L.Ed. 606. Here, however, there was evidence of actual confusion and the case was thoroughly proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Nor are defendant\u2019s answers persuasive. As clearly appears from the cases cited above, the fact that the products are not identical does not excuse if they are sufficiently similar to make confusion likely. Both plaintiff and defendant were marketing usual electrical household products; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>it cannot be said that electric ranges and refrigerators are so compartmentalized from electric sewing machines and vacuum cleaners that housewives would not (as they did) think that the name \u201cAdmiral\u201d applied to all signified a single source of origin. See also L. E. Waterman Co. v. Gordon, 2 Cir., 72 F.2d 272, 273; Yale Electric Corp. v. Robertson, 2 Cir., 26 F.2d 972, 974; Hanson v. Triangle Publications, 8 Cir., 163 F.2d 74, 78, certiorari denied 332 U.S. 855, 68 S.Ct. 387, 92 L.Ed. 424; Sunbeam Corp. v. Sunbeam Lighting Co., D.C.S.D.Cal., 83 F.Supp. 429; Lady Esther v. Lady Esther Corset Shoppe, 317 Ill.App. 451, 46 N.E.2d 165, 148 A.L.R. 6, with annotation 12-125. On the other hand, the various Admiral trade-marks issued to others, upon which defendant relies to show a nonexclusive right in plaintiff, applied to entirely different types of commodities: automotive products and motor fuels; alcoholic beverages; food, clothing, and fabrics; and various miscellaneous products ranging from anchors to smoking tobacco and bicycles. Moreover, as the plaintiff says, these are mere third-party uses, perhaps substantially or wholly wrongful and inadequate to justify defendant\u2019s wrongful use. Ward Baking Co. v. PotterWrightington, 1 Cir., 298 F. 398, 402; Bond Stores, Incorporated v. Bond Stores, Inc., 3 Cir., 104 F.2d 124, 125. And finally we have here the findings of actual and intended deception which we find supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\"> After the trial the defendant filed a motion below asking for t'he withholding of judgment pending decision by the Commissioner of Patents on certain petitions recently filed by the defendant for cancel-ling most of the certificates of registration relied on by the plaintiff or in the alternative for delay to take testimony respecting the invalidity of these certificates. The court denied this motion and defendant claims error. But there was no reason for the requested delay after completion of the full trial. Defendant\u2019s challenge to the validity of plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark registration could, and certainly should, have been prepared before trial. Further, there is no reason to expect success from this belated move; and if by chance it were successful, the relief granted below is justified by the findings of unfair competition, which were fully supported by the evidence as we have seen. We find no merit in defendant\u2019s further contention that the court was required to withhold its equitable relief on the purely conjectural possibility that defendant might so tardily show plaintiff to be tainted by unclean hands. The permanent injunction and the counsel fees awarded plaintiff were fully justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Turning to plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal, plaintiff urges that a right to an accounting has become mandatory under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117, thus superseding the earlier view, 3 Restatement, Torts \u00a7 747, that where the respective products were not directly competing, the plaintiff may not recover profits. We have held otherwise, however, and that now seems the settled construction of the statute. Triangle Publications v. Rohrlich, supra, 2 Cir., 167 F.2d at pages 973, 974; Chester H. Roth Co. v. Esquire, Inc., 2 Cir., 186 F.2d 11, 16, certiorari denied 341 U.S. 921, 71 S.Ct. 743, 95 L.Ed. 1354; Stardust, Inc. v. Weiss, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 79 F.Supp. 274, 281; Lorraine Mfg. Co. v. Lorraine Mfg. Co., D.C.N.J., 101 F.Supp. 967; see also Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Sanders, 331 U.S. 125, 67 S.Ct. 1136, 91 L.Ed. 1386. The court below found that plaintiff could not as yet show material damage. Plaintiff now says that the trial should have been in two stages, referring to certain patent cases. Cf. also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(4). The trial judge undoubtedly might in his discretion separate the issues and try them as convenient; but we know of no rule which would compel him to do so, particularly without warning or request therefor from a party. Denial of an accounting must therefore stand. Since, 'however, the plaintiff had to defend in this court to preserve its patently just judgment, it will be awarded appellate costs, together with additional attorney\u2019s fees of $500. R. F. C. v. J. G. Menihan Corp., 312 U.S. 81, 85, 61 S.Ct. 485, 85 L.Ed. 595; Century Distilling Co. v. Continental Distilling Corp., D.C.E.D.Pa., 102 F.Supp. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\">. Jack Price, defendant\u2019s president and sole stockholder, is president and majority stockholder of Price Vacuum. Defendant\u2019s activities are controlled from these Philadelphia offices where its records are kept. Most of defendant\u2019s product is shipped to it from Philadelphia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\">. This appears most pointedly in Finding of Fact 24: \u201cSeveral of defendant\u2019s customers, in and about Rochester, New York, have purchased either electric vacuum cleaners or electric sewing machines bearing the trademark Admiral from defendant, believing that such appliances were manufactured by or originated with plaintiff. The belief of such customers that defendant\u2019s products were manufactured by or originated with plaintiff was based either on the affirmative acts of defendant\u2019s salesman who either stated or clearly implied that defendant\u2019s products originated with the plaintiff, Admiral Corporation, or it was based on the consumer\u2019s conclusion that an electrical appliance such as a vacuum cleaner or sewing machine bearing the trade mark Admiral would, naturally originate with the Admiral Corporation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b568-5\">.
