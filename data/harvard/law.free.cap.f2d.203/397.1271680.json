On a prior appeal, 1950, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 242, 184 F.2d 263, the principal question was whether a gain upon a condemnation award was a capital gain. This depended upon whether the property was \u201cused in trade or business\u201d or was \u201cheld for the production of income.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We remanded for further proceedings and findings. The District Court took additional evidence and found that part of the property was \u201cused in trade or business,\u201d and the \u201cgain\u201d to be ordinary income. A recomputation upon that basis for the year 1941 resulted in findings of a tax of $1307.98 and a total refund of $1931.53, plus statutory interest, for which judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">On this appeal error is assigned in the taking of additional evidence. We think such action was permissible. Appellants also attack the findings in some particulars. However, they failed to bring to this court any record of the evidence upon which the findings were based. Therefore, we must assume that there was evidence to support the findings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and in the absence of evidence showing them to be clearly erroneous, we must affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-9\">.
