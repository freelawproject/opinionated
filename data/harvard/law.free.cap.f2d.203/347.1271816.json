He sold it on December 19, 1945, realizing a gain of $16,662.50, which he returned for income tax purposes as a long; term capital gain, taxable on a 50% basis. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue held that the gain was short term, taxable on a 100% basis, and redetermined petitioner\u2019s tax liability accordingly. See sec. 150(c) Revenue Act of 1942, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 117(b-e). This resulted in a deficiency assessment of $7,881.83, which the Tax Court sustained. Petitioner here seeks a review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">Section 117(a), Int.Rev.Code, 26 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 117(a), defines a long term capital gain as one from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for \u201cmore than 6 months,\u201d a short term capital gain as one from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for \u201cnot more than 6 months\u201d. The Tax Court held that in the computation of time under sec. 117(a)(4), the day of acquisition must be excluded, and that petitioner had therefore held this asset for exactly six months and no longer, so that the asset not having been held for \u201cmore\u201d than six months the gain was a short term gain under the above definitions. 10 Tax Ct. Mem. Dec. 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">Petitioner contends that the determinative period \u201cis a term of six calendar months measured by reading the calendar beginning with and including the date of acquisition of the asset and ending with the same date less one in the sixth subsequent month,\u201d which would qualify this as a long term gain. Alternatively, he contends that the period should be computed on the uniform basis of a 30 day month, so that.the determinative requirement, in every instance, would be that the asset be held for more than 180 days, with which this transaction complies.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">Petitioner further points out that if the period is computed on a basis of actual calendar months, there would be occasions \u2014depending upon the month of acquisition \u2014when an asset could be held two days less than petitioner held this one, and still a gain from its sale would qualify as a long term gain.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also points out that in Section 117(h), and in Treas.Reg. 111, sec. 29.117-4, which deals with the period for which a \u2022 taxpayer has held stock or se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>curities acquired from a corporation by the exercise of stock rights, that section provides that \u201cthere shall be included only the period <em>beginning with the date </em>upon which the right to acquire was exercised.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Italics supplied.) Petitioner contends that the same method should be followed in interpreting Section 117(a)(4), with which we are here concerned. But Congress was there dealing with quite a different problem, involving a different situation than that which confronts us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Lastly, petitioner points to 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 865, prescribing the method of computing Army pay, as an instance of Congressional requirement that a \u201cmonth\u201d should uniformly consist of 30 days. But there again Congress was dealing with another and highly specialized problem. It was free to prescribe a different basis of computation in these differing situations, and still he guilty of no inconsistency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Neither the Internal Revenue Code, nor the Treasury Regulations, define the word \u201cmonth\u201d as used in section 117(a). But the term is not a technical one, and when undefined, as here, it is commonly understood to mean a calendar month. Guaranty Trust &amp; Safe-Deposit Co. v. Green Cove Springs &amp; M. R. Co, 139 U.S. 137, 11 S.Ct. 512, 35 L.Ed. 116; Siegelschiffer v. Penn Mutual Life Ins. Co., 2 Cir., 248 F. 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">In computing a period of time, the beginning of which is determined by a given date, or by an event, the general rule is that the designated date, or the day of the event, is to be excluded, while the last day of the period is to be included. Sheets v. Selden\u2019s Lessee, 2 Wall. 177, text 190, 69 U.S. 177, text 190, 17 L.Ed. 822, text 826; United States v. Hardy, 4 Cir., 74 F.2d 841; Postel v. Broadway Trust Co., 7 Cir., 29 F.2d 281; Leeper v. Lemon G. Neely Co., 6 Cir., 293 F. 967; Eliot Nat. Bank v. Gill, D.C. 210 F. 933; United States v. Barber, D.C. 24 F.Supp. 229; 52 Am.Jur., page 350, sec. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">The rule just stated is not universally applied because the circumstances and consequences implicit in the problem under consideration sometimes dictate the application of another rule. Compare Taylor v. Brown, 147 U.S. 640, 13 S.Ct. 549, 37 L.Ed. 313; Arnold v. United States, 9 Cranch 104, 13 U.S. 104, 3 L.Ed. 671; Town of Louisville v. Portsmouth Saving Bank, 14 Otto 469, 104 U.S. 469, 26 L.Ed. 775; Honolulu Rapid Transit &amp; Land Co. v. Wilder, 211 U.S. 137, 29 S.Ct. 44, 53 L.Ed. 121; Lanham v. McKeel, 244 U. S. 582, 37 S.Ct. 708, 61 L.Ed. 1331; In re Gubelman, 2 Cir., 10 F.2d 926; In re Susquehanna Chemical Corp., D.C., 81 F. Supp. 1. But these are regarded as exceptions to the general rule. The tendency of the cases is to avoid, if possible, defeating a title or destroying a <em>bona fide </em>and completed transaction. Here, however, petitioner seeks a reduction in taxes, and he must bring himself clearly within the conditions. Deputy v. DuPont, 308 U. S. 488, 493, 60 S.Ct. 363, 84 L.Ed. 416, 421; Lykes v. United States, 343 U.S. 118, 72 S.Ct. 585, 96 L.Ed. 791; In Taylor v. Brown, supra, the court included the first day of the period but excluded the last day. So even that case does not sanction including <em>both </em>days. And the court recognized that the method of computation there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>employed was a departure from the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Although petitioner\u2019s arguments to the contrary possess the merit of ingenuity and resourcefulness, it is our view that in adopting the language under consideration, Congress had in mind ordinary calendar months, and that in computing the six month period the day of acquisition should be excluded, while the day of sale is to be included, according to the well established general rule. In re Harriet M. Hooper, 26 B.T.A. 758; In re E. T. Weir, 10 T.C. 996, affirmed 3 Cir., 173 F.2d 222; Sheets v. Selden\u2019s Lessee, supra. If this leads to inequalities in taxation, that is a problem for Congress, not the courts. Such inequalities are frequently encountered. The decision appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-11\">. Petitioner computes that if actual calendar months be used as the basis, a taxpayer who acquires a capital asset in February, September or November, need hold the same for only 182 days to qualify for a long term gain; whereas a taxpayer who acquires in October or December must hold for 183 days; one who acquires in April or June must hold for 184 days; and one who acquires in March, May, July or August must hold for 185 days. This petitioner, acquiring in June, held for 183 days, but was denied long term treatment, while one acquiring in February, September or November could qualify for long term treatment in 182 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\">. Tlio regulation says tlie period shall \u201cbegin with and include\u201d the date upon which the acquisition right was exercised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\">. On the other side of the picture, there is 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 980(c), relating to estate taxes, which defines \u201cMonth\u201d as meaning \u201ccalendar\u201d months for the purposes of that subchapter. In 26 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 48(a), relating to income taxes, \u201ctaxable year\u201d is defined as meaning \u201ccalendar\u201d year, or the fiscal year ending during such \u201ccalendar\u201d year. And in 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1602(e) (5), relating to employment taxes, the statute provides that the term \u201cyear\u201d means any 12 consecutive \u201ccalendar\u201d months. Section 1602(c) (7), also relating to employment taxes, provides that the term \u201ccomputation date\u201d means the date, occurring at least once in each \u201ccalendar\u201d year, etc. From those and other instances, it clearly appears that Congress usually contemplated \u201ccalendar\u201d months, and \u201ccalendar\u201d years in enacting tax statutes, unless a contrary intent is indicated. See also 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1030 (a) and Section 1001(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
