Smith as Collector of Internal Revenue assessed against and collected from Gehman the sum of $4,289.40 as taxes. See sections 2321 and 3206 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. Gehman sued Smith to obtain a refund of the full amount. The court below properly held that of the sum of $4,289.40 assessed, $4,037.40 was correct in amount and was assessed in accordance with the laws of the United States. The court below held \u00e1lso that the assessment of $252.00 against .the appellant was improper and unlawful since it was assessed against a \u2018product not constituting \u201cadulterated butter\u201d. The court thereupon gave judgment in favor of the appellant in the sum of $252.00. The appellant took the instant appeal in an attempt to collect from Smith the balance of $4,037.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">The findings of fact and conclusions of law of the court below are correct in every particular. See 105 F.Supp. 604. The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
