For no good cause to the contrary was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">While it is quite plain that the district judge thought that he was acting in accordance with the statute, it is equally plain that he was laboring under a mistaken opinion as to its provisions and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">In view of the fact that, because of the. error in denying removal of the cause, the judgment must be reversed, it is unnecessary, indeed inappropriate, for us to canvass and discuss the other errors assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-16\">For the error, therefore, of denying removal of the cause, the judgment is reversed and. the cause is remanded to the district court with directions to \u201cspecify a district of reasonable proximity to the claimant\u2019s principal place of business, to which the case shall be removed for trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A50\">Reversed and remanded with- directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\">. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 301 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-10\">.
