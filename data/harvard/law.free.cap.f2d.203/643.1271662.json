It brought,this action against the defendant Butt, alleging that he had converted to his own use, and sold, a portion of the mortgaged wheat which resulted in a loss to the United States. There was attached to the- complaint a copy of the note and mortgage, together with an assignment from the mortgagor which conveyed to the United States all the right, title and interest in the wheat converted by Butt, and any claim which the mortgagor might have for the conversion. The case was tried to the court without-a jury. It found that Butt had wrongfully removed a portion of the mortgaged wheat and converted it to his own use, and rendered judgment in favor of the United States for the value of the converted wheat.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">The defendant filed a motion for a new trial setting forth as grounds therefor that there was insufficient evidence to support the judgment, and that prejudicial error had been committed in the admission of evidence during the trial. Following the hearing on the motion for a new trial, the court entered an order setting aside the judgment and dismissing the action. This appe\u00e1l is from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-15\">The trial court was of the view that the action was based upon an assignment of an unassignable tort claim, upon which the United States could not sue. The United States may maintain this action for two reasons: 1. If it is considered an action on an assignment, a claim for the conversion of personal property ordinarily survives the death of the owner, is assignable, and. the assignee may maintain an. action upon the assignment. 4 Am.Jur., Assignments, Sec. 34; 6 C.J.

Generally, a mortgagee who has suffered a loss may maintain an action against a person who has wrongfully converted to his own use property included in the mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>which has been duly filed for record. 10 Am.Jur., Chattel Mtges., Secs. 176, 178; Loudon v.

Jurisdiction is given by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345. United States v. Sayward, 160 U.S. 493, 16 S.Ct. 371, 40 L.Ed. 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-11\">. In the Lawler Case, the Utah Supreme Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">\u201cUnder the statutes of Utah the assignee could bring this action in his own name. Rev.St. \u00a7\u00a7 2903, 2920. As a general rule, all choses in action and all rights of action arising out of contract may be assigned. The general test applied in determining the assignability of a chose in action is whether or not it would survive and pass to the personal representative of a decedent. If it would so survive, it may be assigned so as to pass an interest , to the assignee which he can enforce in his own name; if it does not so survive, it-is not assignable either at law or in equity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
