Plaintiff asserts that under prevailing federal prison practices the filing of the detainer \u201cconstitutes a highly prejudiced fact extremely detrimental to him, in that it has heretofore caused him injury, and is now causing him injury, and will bring further and more severe punitive measures against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Plaintiff apparently demanded by correspondence that the Illinois parole authorities withdraw the detainer, which was refused, and he charges that their refusal to do so is a result of an unlawful conspiracy, and that he has been and is being deprived of his rights without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, the second ground of said motion being, \u201cThe complaint fails to state a cause of action under the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d We shall construe this as a motion under Rule 12(b) (6), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., to dismiss for \u201cfailure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d. The district court granted the motion to dismiss and plaintiff prosecutes this appeal in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">Plaintiff apparently is a layman. We shall construe the complaint as broadly as possible to ascertain if, under any construction of the language used, a claim is stated upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Although plaintiff makes a general allegation that he has been damaged as a result of a conspiracy by the defendants, it clearly appears from the complaint taken as a whole, as well as the arguments made in his brief, that he is endeavoring to state a claim under the Civil Rights Act. Section 47 of the Act covers, \u201cConspiracy to interfere with civil rights.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s theory is that when the Illinois parole authorities, after his arrest in Ohio, failed to demand that he be returned to Illinois, which he says they had the right to do because of prior jurisdiction, they waived, any right to have him returned there later, even after the completion of his federal sentence. He urges, therefore, that the filing of the detainer works an injustice upon him and causes him damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">Plaintiff accepted a parole and; thereby assented to the terms upon which; the parole was granted. Illinois law is-applicable. The failure of Illinois parole authorities to act affirmatively to gain custody of plaintiff after he was apprehended in Ohio does not give rise to a cause of of action or a claim under the Civil Rights Act. The Illinois parole authorities are not personally liable for damages because federal prison authorities, in administering intra-mural prison discipline and regulations, take into account an unexecuted warrant charging, plaintiff with a violation of parole. See: United States ex rel. Meiner v. Ragen, <em>7 </em>Cir., 199 F.2d 798; United States ex rel. Jackson v. Ragen, 7 Cir., 150 F.2d 190; Davis v. Dowd, 7 Cir., 119 F.2d 338. We repeat what we said in Kelly v. Dowd, 7 Cir., 140 F.2d 81, 82, \u201cThe jurisdiction to interfere with the proceedings of state governmental bodies charged with the prosecution and punishment of offenders is an exceedingly deli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>cate one to be exercised with the greatest of care and nicest sense of propriety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The district court was correct in dismissing the complaint without leave to amend, since it appeared to a certainty that plaintiff would not be entitled to any relief under any state of facts which could be proved in support of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
