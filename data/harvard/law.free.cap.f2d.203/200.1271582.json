A week later appellant, who was represented throughout by counsel of his own choosing, gave notice of appeal. Application to appeal in forma pauperis was denied, and on May 21, 1951 the appeal was withdrawn and dismissed by stipulation of appellant\u2019s counsel. The present motion for records was filed in November, 1951, and was promptly denied by the trial court. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-18\">No valid appeal from the conviction could have been taken as of November, 1951 because the time for appeal had long expired. Nor was any appeal from the conviction attempted then to be taken. It would have been futile in the circumstances to have granted the \u201cMotion for Records\u201d or to have directed that the records be transcribed at public cost. iNo appeal from the judgment is pending in which the transcript could be used in this court. In this posture the order complained of is not reviewable here, and the appeal from it is accordingly dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
