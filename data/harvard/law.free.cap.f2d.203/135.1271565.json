The transaction, was intended by the parties as a cash sale, with the actual change of title being dependent on due payment of the draft for the purchase money when presented at the bank in Mobeetife, Texas, \u201crather than a sale without such reservation but instead passing title at once on receipt of the purchase draft and said delivery of the cattle.\u201d' (The q\u00fcotation is an extract from the special verdict of the jury.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">On the day of the sale, the purchaser transported said 66 'head of cattle to Amarillo, Texas. There they were delivered to the. appellants, a live-stock auction company, to be sold for the account of Johnny Johnson. The purchase-money draft in favor of the appellees was duly presented and payment refused. The cattle were sold by the appellants for $11,659.26, which they applied in part to an indebtedness of Johnny Johnson due themselves, which existed prior to October 5,1950. The balance of the proceeds 'of said sale, amounting to $1834.49, was paid to Johnny Johnson. The judgment appealed from was for the amount of the net proceeds of said sale which the appellants had applied to the pre-existing debt of Johnson. .</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">In substance, this is an action for money had and received. The appellants were not <em>bona fide </em>purchasers, and they did not become innocent parties by crediting part of the proceeds of the sale of appellees\u2019 cattle upon a pre-existing debt of the contemplated purchaser'. Where one of two innocent parties must suffer from the wrongful act of a third person, the one whose conduct enabled the third party to do the wrong must suffer; but this principle has no application to the collection of an old debt due by the wrongdoer to one of the innocent parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">We have noted no difference between Texas and Oklahoma with .reference to the rule of law that controls this case, which is that where goods are sold for cash and delivered, and the vendor takes the vendee\u2019s check for the price, which on presentment in due time is dishonored, the title does not pass and the vendor may reclaim the property from the vendee or from any other person who does not have any better equitable claim to it than the vendee.

They have not been hurt by the judgment, requiring them to account to the appellees for the proceeds of the sale of the cattle still in their hands, because Johnny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Johnson owed them over $42,000 before the transaction involved in the present controversy occurred. Not being <em>bona fide </em>purchasers for value, their former status as creditors of Johnny Johnson was not destroyed or adversely affected by the delivery of the drafts to Johnny Johnson, the book entries upon his account, or the result of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We find no reversible error in the record, and the judgment appealed from seems to us to be entirely correct. Consequently, it should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
