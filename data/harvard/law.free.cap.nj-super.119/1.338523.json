However, the court did not grant defendants\u2019 motions to inspect, copy or photograph other police reports relating to the investigation of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-10\">We have considered the arguments advanced by both the State and defendants on this appeal and conclude that the order should be affirmed substantially for the reasons expressed in the opinion of Judge Joelson in the Passaic County Court, 118 <em>N. J. Super. </em>299 <em>(Law Div. </em>1972). While the opinion did not specifically refer to defendants\u2019 argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>ment that they were entitled to discovery of all police reports because such reports might reveal exculpatory information, the judge ruled during the hearing that the prosecutor has an absolute obligation to reveal such information if it is disclosed during the State\u2019s investigation. We concur in that ruling. See <em>Disciplinary Rule </em>7-103, <em>R. </em>1:14; <em>Brady v. </em>Maryland, 373 <em>U. S. </em>83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 215 (1963), and comment to <em>R. </em>3:13\u20143, New Jersey Court Rules (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
