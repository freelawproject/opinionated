THOMAS ROUNDTREE, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b603-9\">Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b603-10\">Argued June 19, 1972</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AG1t\">Decided June 28, 1972.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b604-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Before Judges Sullivan, Leonard and Carton.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-8\"><em>Mr. Hugh J. </em>Mahoney, Assistant Deputy Public Defender, argued the cause for appellant <em>(Mr. Stanley O. Van </em>Ness, Public Defender, attorney).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-9\"><em>Mr. Thomas J. </em>Kapsak, Assistant Prosecutor, argued the cause for respondent <em>(Mr. John 8.

J. S. A. </em>24:21-27(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">In an affidavit affixed to the aforesaid motion, defendant\u2019s attorney stated that defendant had no prior record and he indicated that he was willing to receive \u201cdrug\u201d treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">Prior to making his motion, defendant had pleaded not guilty to the indictment. The trial court in denying the motion stated that there was a fixed policy that \u201cwe will not suspend the proceedings unless the defendant is pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>pared to plead guilty.\u201d Consequently, the court refused to consider the motion without such a guilty plea. Defendant refused to so plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Such a policy as enunciated by the trial judge is contrary to the present specific provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>24:21-27(a). This act grants the court the authority to suspend proceedings of a person who has not been previously convicted of any drug-related offense, who is <em>\u201ccharged with </em>or convicted\u201d of any such offense. [Emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The provision contained in the original act <em>(L. </em>1970, c. 226, \u00a7 27) which limited the authority to suspend proceedings solely to the situations when defendant \u201cpleads guilty or is found guilty\u201d was eliminated and replaced by the above-quoted language presently contained in the act <em>(L. </em>1971, <em>c. </em>3, \u00a7 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">That the Legislature fully intended that a plea of guilty should not be a prerequisite to suspension of proceedings is further demonstrated in \u00a7 b. of the present act. This section provides that \u201c[U]pon violation of a term or condition of supervisory treatment the court may * * * where there lias been no plea of guilt or finding of guilt, resume proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Under these circumstances, the order of the trial court is reversed and the matter is remanded for a hearing upon defendant\u2019s motion. At this hearing the trial judge shall exercise the discretion vested in him pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>24:21-27, without first requiring defendant to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Reversed and remanded in accordance herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
