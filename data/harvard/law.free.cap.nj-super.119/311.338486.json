J. Super. </em>165.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Although we are in accord with the conclusion of the trial judge that plaintiff is not entitled to exoneration for all or any part of the difference between the principal sum of the Bowery Savings Bank mortgage and the unpaid principal balance due on the previous mortgage, we reach that conclusion on the single ground that decedent never became per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>sonally liable to the Bowery for the mortgage indebteness. Absent decedent\u2019s personal liability, the widow is not entitled to exoneration without regard to whether or not decedent\u2019s estate was enhanced as a result of the mortgage loan. <em>McLenahan v. McLenahan, </em>18 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>101 (Ch. 1866); <em>Campbell v. Campbell, </em>30 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>415 (Ch. 1879).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In the course of this appeal defendants advanced the argument that if the widow\u2019s dower interest is not to be charged with any part of the portion of the required quarterly mortgage payments applied toward the amortization of the mortgage principal, she should be chargeable with a sum equivalent to one-half of the interest on the full amount of the balance of the principal of the mortgage indebtedness as it existed at the time of decedent\u2019s death undiminished by any reduction arising from the payments on account of principal made by or on behalf of the remaindermen subsequent to decedent\u2019s death. Despite the failure of defendant to raise the issue before the trial court, the point is sufficiently compelling equitably as to require a disposition on the merits by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The widow has a dower right only in the equity of redemption as it existed at the time of her husband\u2019s death. If the widow is charged with only one-half of the actual interest which accrues and is paid on the constantly reducing principal balance, the value of her dower interest is correspondingly increased as a result of the payments made on account of the principal \u2014 payments of principal made not by the widow, but out of funds belonging to the remaindermen. The consequent enrichment to the widow would be unjustifiable indeed, as well as contrary to established law. <em>Swaine v. Perine, </em>5 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>482, <em>493, 1 N. Y. Ch. </em>1148 (Ch. 1821); 4 <em>Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence </em>(5th ed. 1941), \u00a7 1223; 4 <em>Kent\u2019s Commentaries </em>(14th ed. 1896) 47; 4A <em>Thompson, Real Property </em>(1961 rep. ed.), \u00a7 1901 at 40-42; 5 <em>Powell, Real Property </em>(1971), \u00a7 668 at 129\u2014135; 1 <em>Scribner, Dower </em>(2d ed. 1883), \u00a7\u00a7 26-28; <em>Restatement, Property, </em>\u00a7 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>In light of the foregoing, during her lifetime the widows dower interest in the rents and profits of this real estate is chargeable with a sum equal to one-half of the interest on the full balance of the mortgage indebtedness as it existed at the date of decedents death, at the rate of interest fixed by the terms of the mortgage as it accrues \u2014\u2022 instead of with one-half the actual amount due and payable on account of interest on the declining principal balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Except as so modified, the judgment of the Chancery Division is affirmed in all respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
