Thereafter he was convicted of attempted larceny in municipal court and fined $50 plus $15 court costs. He thereupon appealed his conviction to the Monmouth County Court. The County Court judge dismissed the appeal, finding the County Court to be without jurisdiction. The County Court judge found that the proper forum for the appeal from municipal court, where the defendant waived indictment and a trial by jury, to be the Appellate Division of the Superior Court. The matter is presently before us on direct appeal.

See <em>State v. Yaccarino, </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>291 (1949). The only restriction contained in our practice related to such appeals where the conviction is for an indictable offense is that the appeal shall not operate as a consent for the complaint to be amended to charge an indictable offense. <em>R. </em>3:23-8(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We acknowledge with appreciation the objective and careful presentation of this matter by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Reversed and remanded to Monmouth County Court for a trial <em>de novo </em>on the record.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
