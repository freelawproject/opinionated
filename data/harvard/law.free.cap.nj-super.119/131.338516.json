J. S. A. </em>40:55-39(c) to permit the construction of a residence on an \u201cundersized\u201d lot; (2) granted plaintiff the requested variance, and (3) ordered the building inspector to issue a building permit authorizing the construction of the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Plaintiff cross-appeals from an interlocutory order which adjudged that it was not entitled to the benefit of a variance which had been granted to a predecessor in title some <em>5y2 </em>years before plaintiff purchased the property. The court ruled that the variance had expired by virtue of section 1709 of the borough zoning ordinance which provides that a variance or exception granted by the board \u201cshall expire if no construction, alteration or conversion has been commenced within one year from the date of granting such variance or exception.\u201d The court rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention that the ordinance limitation is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The cross-appeal lacks merit. It has long been settled that a municipality may by ordinance limit the time within \u2022which work must.start under a building permit. <em>Sun Oil Co. v. Bradley Beach, </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>307 (Sup. Ct. 1947), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>aff\u2019d o.b. 137 <em>N. J. L. </em>658 (E. &amp; A. 1948); 9 <em>McQuillin, Municipal Corporations </em>(3 rev. ed. 1964), \u00a7 26.219 at 566,</p>\n<p id=\"A2qc\">In <em>Sun Oil Co. v. Bradley Beach </em>the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">We cannot say that placing a time limit for the commencement of work under a building permit is unreasonable. It does not seem desirable that a permit holder should indefinitely delay the commencement of work. It is not unreasonable that there be a time limit when work must start under a building permit. [136 <em>N. J. L. </em>at 309]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The same considerations are applicable to and support the validity of an ordinance provision such as section 1709 fixing a reasonable period within which construction authorized by the grant of a variance must commence. It is not unreasonable or improper to require a new application for a building permit or a variance to be filed if construction pursuant to the permit or variance theretofore granted is not begun within the time limited by the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\"><em>Board of Education, Fort Lee v. Mayor, etc., Fort Lee, </em>31 <em>N. J. Super. </em>22, 29 (App. Div. 1954), on which plaintiff relies, is not to the contrary. In <em>Fort Lee, supra, </em>the ordinance did not contain a limitation of time \u201cwithin which a building permit may be issued following the grant of a variance.\u201d The decision in that case was but an application of the rule stated in 2 <em>Rathkopf, Zoning and Planning </em>(3 ed. 1966), c. 46 at 46\u20141 <em>et seq:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">When a variance or special exception is granted the use permitted thereby becomes a conforming use and such use is not lost through non-exercise, <em>in the absence of a time limitation set forth in the variance itself or in the zoning ordinance. </em>[Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\"><em>We </em>turn next to defendants\u2019 appeal. Plaintiff, on March 31, 1967, had purchased property designated as lots 9 and 10 in Block 49 on the Bernardsville tax map. Under zoning ordinance 230, adopted January 22, 1959, the lots are in an B-5 Besidential zone in which each building lot is required to have a frontage of at least 50 feet. Lots 9 and 10 each have a frontage of only 41.75 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>A house had been constructed on lot 10 in the 1920\u2019s. The board of adjustment in its resolution of July 1, 1970 found from the evidence offered before it that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">A. The house located on Lot 10 is set back 27 feet from the street. The said house is 16 feet 6 inches wide and the right side yard is 12 feet and the left side yard is 12 feet six inches.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">B. The lot in question, being Lot 9, Block 45, on the Tax Map of the Borough of Bernardsville, has been for more than 40 years last past a vacant lot used in common with the adjoining Lot 10 as if both were a single lot or home site (sic), there having been during said period of over 40 years:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">1. a lawn covering and common to both said Lots 9 and 10 and maintained by the resident, from time to time, of the house on Lot 10;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">2. a common row of shrubbery running across the frontage of both lots and maintained by the resident, from time to time, of the home located on Lot 10;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">3. a garden maintained and used for some years on Lot 9 by the resident, from time to time, of the home located on Lot 10; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">4. no natural or artificial boundary or division line between said Lots 9 and 10,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">and concluded that by reason of the incorporation and maintenance over the years of lot 9 as part and parcel of the homesite, there was no showing of \u201chardship,\u201d an element which must be shown to warrant a variance under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:55-39(e), and no justification for granting a variance \u201cwhich in effect would subdivide [plaintiff\u2019s] premises into two non-conforming parcels.\u201d <em>Bove v. Board of Adjust., Emerson, </em>100 <em>N. J. Super. </em>95, 101 (App. Div. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">Plaintiff, to quote from its brief,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">* * * recognize[s] the proposition that property owners have been denied variances for some substandard lots where the lot in question has, as a matter of use, been \u201cincorporated\u201d into (usually) the house-lot from which the owner now seeks its separation. The issue thus tendered goes to whether there is in fact a <em>bona fide </em>hardship for the owner, or whether the \u201chardship\u201d really results from a second guess by the owner as to how he wishes to use the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">However, it argues that the trial court was correct in its conclusion that the evidence does \u201cnot support the Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Adjustment\u2019s findings that the two lots have been so closely-tied together by use over the years so as to constitute one homesite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">We disagree. We conclude from our study of the record that the evidence furnishes adequate support for the board\u2019s findings and that its conclusions were neither arbitrary or unreasonable. See <em>Bove, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The final judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor from which defendants appealed is reversed. The interlocutory order from which plaintiff cross-appealed is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
