He further contends that the failure of the Commission to advise him of his right to counsel under the circumstances herein compels a reversal of its decision, particularly in view of the rules and regulations of the Commission which' permit counsel to he present during such investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\"> It is clear there is no <em>constitutional </em>basis upon which to require that a person appearing before an administrative agency he apprised of his right to have counsel present. <em>David v. Strelecki, </em>51 <em>N. J. </em>563 (1968); <em>State v. </em>Williams, 59 <em>N. J. </em>493 (1971). In the absence of a statute or administrative rule or regulation to the contrary, courts are reluctant to allow representation bjr counsel in administrative proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>ings of a purely investigatory nature. See Annotation, 33 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 229 (1970), \u00a7 2(a) at 239; \u00a76(b) at 249; Cooper, <em>State Administrative Law </em>(1965) 330; <em>In re Groban, </em>352 <em>U. S. </em>330, 77 <em>S. Ct. </em>510, 1 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 376 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Nor do we agree with appellant\u2019s contention that a provision in an administrative agency regulation providing that a person subject to an investigation under oath is entitled to counsel necessarily imposes upon the agency an obligation to advise the subject of the interview as to such a right. See Annotation, 33 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 229 (1970), \u00a7 2(a), at 239-240, nn. 4-5, and <em>Ussi v. </em>Folsom, 254 <em>F. </em>2d 842 (2 Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">To extend <em>Miranda </em>to a situation such as the one before the court would be stretching it beyond its applicability. Bufanio appeared voluntarily, without subpoena, and answered questions under oath, not while in \u201ccustody\u201d but only as part of the investigatory process of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\"> The Commission\u2019s order in this matter was not in any manner arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. Its findings that Bufanio did not possess good character and integrity within the meaning of the Waterfront Commission Act are supported by the record and hence the sanctions imposed upon appellant by the Commission do not constitute excessive punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
