Willfully defrauding certain stockholders of AAPCO, Inc. (a Pennsylvania corporation with manufacturing headquarters in Pennsauken, N. J., and which conducted shareholders\u2019 meetings within Camden County) by willfully failing to disclose that they were attempting to sell or selling a greater number of shares of AAPCO stock than was authorized by the corporate charter, in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>49:3-52 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>49:3-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">II. Willfully attempting to sell AAPCO securities which were not registered as required by the provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>49:3-60, contrary to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>49:3-60 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>49:3-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">III. Willfully conspiring to violate the provisions of the Uniform Securities Law <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>49:3-47 <em>et seq.) </em>to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">(a) defrauding stockholders;</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">(b) employing unregistered securities agents to sell, and by selling without being registered as licensed securities agents, the stock of AAPCO;</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">(c) attempting to sell unregistered securities;</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">(d) willfully disregarding the lawful orders and subpoenas of the Bureau of Securities, contrary to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:98-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">IY. Willfully attempting to sell through unregistered and unlicensed securities agents the stock of AAPCO. Defendants were arraigned and admitted to bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">In preparation for trial, the State filed and served a trial memorandum and requests to charge setting forth principles of law which the State sought to have applied. A pretrial conference was held pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:13\u20141. By order and memorandum the pretrial judge denied plaintiff\u2019s requests to charge as to the term \u201cwillful\u201d as used in the New Jersey Securities Law. Motion for leave to appeal was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">The two denied requests to charge were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-13\">3. As the term \u201cwilful\u201d is used in the New Jersey Securities Law, it is not necessary that the person committing a violative act do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>with an evil motive or with a will to violate the law. It is required only that he intended or willed to do an act, which act was prohibited under the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">4. It is no defense to a charge of willful violation of the New Jersey Uniform Securities Law that the defendant was ignorant of the law or its provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The State contends that the Uniform Securities Law as adopted in New Jersey mandates absolute liability for violations of its provisions and that such violations are punishable without regard to the existence of criminal intent as it is known in the criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>49:3-70(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">Any person who willfully violates any provision of this act, except section 7, or who willfully violates any rule or order under this law, or who willfully violates section 7 knowing the statement made to be false or misleading in any material respect, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000.00 or imprisoned not more than 3 years, or both; but no person may be imprisoned for the violation of any rule or order if he proves that he had no knowledge of the rule or order. No indictment or information may be returned under this law more than 5 years after the alleged violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Whether a statute provides criminal sanctions for proscribed conduct without the necessity of proving criminal intent is a matter of legislative intent. <em>Morss v. Forbes, 24 N. J. </em>341, 358 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">In support of its contention, the State argues the language in the statute regarding the section 7 exception clearly indicates a legislative intent that knowledge is necessary only in cases of such section 7 <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>49:3-54) violations. It states that such intention is further manifested by the provision that no one may be imprisoned for the violation of any rule or order if he proves that he had no knowledge of the rule or order.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">There is no reported decision in this State passing on this issue under the Uniform Securities Law. However, some guidance can be obtained from analogous federal decisions as well as decisions of sister states which have enacted the Uniform Securities Act, particularly in view of the declaration of statutory policy set forth in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>49:3-75:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>This law shall be so construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those States which enact similar laws and to co-ordinate the interpretation and administration of this law with related Federal regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The Commissioners\u2019 Note appended to section 409(a) of the Uniform Securities Act (the source of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>49:3-70(a)) refers to the comment under \u00a7 204(a) (2) (B) of the act with regard to the meaning of \u201cwillfully.\u201d Section 204(a)(2)(B) thereof provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">The [Administrator] may by order deny, suspend, or revoke any registration if [he] finds * * * that the applicant or registrant or, in the case of broker-dealer or investment adviser, any partner, officer or director, any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person directly or indirectly controlling the broker-dealer or investment advisor * * * has willfully violated or willfully failed to comply with any provision of this act or a predecessor act or any rule or order under this act or a predecessor act * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The Commissioners\u2019 Note under this section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">As the federal courts and the SEO have construed the term \u201cwillfully\u201d in \u00a7 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78o(b), <em>all that is required is proof that the person acted intentionally in the sense that he toas aware of what he was doing. Proof of evil motive or intent to violate the law, or knowledge that the lato was being violated, is not required. </em>The principal function of the word \u201cwillfully\u201d is thus to serve as a legislative hint of self-restraint to the Administrator. [Uniform Securities Act, \u00a7 204, 9C U. L. A.; emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78o(b), like section 204(a)(2)(B) of the Uniform Securities Act, provides for <em>administrative </em>sanctions for any willful violation of the provisions of the act. Although it might be argued that a more stringent requirement as to <em>mens rea </em>should be applied in a criminal prosecution than in administrative action, it is clear the Commissioners applied the same standard to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>The Commission has consistently held under \u00a7 15(b)(5), with some support from the courts both by way of review of the Commission\u2019s orders and more recently in criminal cases, that the term \u201cwillfully\u201d does not require proof of evil motive, or intent to violate the law, or knowledge that the law was being violated. All that is required is proof that the violator acted intentionally in the sense that he was aware of what he was doing. 5 <em>Loss, Securities Regulation </em>(2d ed. 1969) 3368-3374; see <em>e.g. Hughes v. S. E. C., </em>85 U. S. App. D. C. 56, 174 <em>F. </em>2d 969, 977 (1949); <em>United States v. Sussman, </em>37 <em>F. Supp. </em>294, 297 (E. D. Pa. 1941); <em>Gearhart and Otis, Inc. v. S. E. C., </em>121 U. S. App. D. C. 186, 348 <em>F. </em>2d 798, 802-803 (1965); <em>United States v. Custer Channel Wing Corp., </em>247 <em>F. Supp. </em>481, 494-495 (D. Md. 1965), aff\u2019d 376 <em>F. </em>2d 675, 681 (4 Cir.), <em>cert. </em>den. 389 <em>U. S. </em>850, 88 S. Ct. 38, 19 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">It is suggested in 2 <em>Loss, supra </em>at 1309, that \u201cwillfully\u201d might conceivably mean something less in \u00a7 15(b) than it does in the penal provisions of the SEC acts (15 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 78ff), and that it means something less when applied to a provision like \u00a7 5 of the Securities Act, which is <em>malum prohibitum, </em>than to one of the fraud provisions, which more nearly approaches <em>malum in se. </em>However, <em>Loss </em>states that, as nearly as one can say, the courts are more concerned in criminal cases under \u00a7 5 with knowledge of lack of registration than with evil motive or specific intent to violate the law. 6 <em>Loss, supra </em>at 4126. He also states that it seems reasonably settled that \u201cwillfully\u201d in the SEC statutes does not have any \u201c'bad purpose\u201d connotation (beyond whatever bad faith concept is inherent in the fraud provisions as distinct from the registration provisions and the like). 5 <em>Loss, supra </em>at 3374. See <em>United States v. Sussman, supra, </em>37 <em>F. Supp. </em>at 296; see also <em>United States v. Simon, </em>425 <em>F. </em>2d 796 (2 Cir. 1969), <em>cert. </em>den. 397 <em>U. S. </em>1006, 90 S. Ct. 1235, 25 <em>L. </em>Ed. 2d 420 (1970) (both cases involving criminal prosecutions for violations of provisions of the federal securities law).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>In the few jurisdictions that have decided the question of whether a criminal intent is necessary under the criminal penalty section of the Uniform Securities Act, the courts appear to have required only an intent to do the proscribed act. While the decisions of sister states are not binding, they are of signal import and value as guiding precedent where the objective of a statute is the standardization of a particular subject matter; in this case the area of securities regulation. <em>State v. Weissman, </em>73 <em>N. J. Super. </em>274, 281 (App. Div.), certif. den. 37 <em>N. J. </em>521 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">In <em>State v. Burrow, </em>13 <em>Ariz, App. </em>130, 474 <em>P. </em>2d 849, 851 (Ct. App. 1970) (which involved a prosecution for the sale of unregistered securities, and for carrying on transactions as an unregistered dealer), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">Our Supreme Court lias held that in the area of criminal intent, legislative policy fixes two types of crimes, those which require an evil intention and those which the mere doing of the act is criminal, in which case only an intent to so act is required. These latter acts, commonly denominated <em>malum prohibitum, </em>usually involve conduct which so threatens the public that there must be absolute prohibition. Troutner v. State, 17 Ariz. 506, 154 P. 1048 (1916) ; 21 Am. Jur. 2d Criminal Law \u00a7\u00a7 81-91.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">In the instant case we are confronted with statutes dealing with the sale and registration of securities and sales by unregistered dealers. The trial court, in delivering the instruction it did, obviously construed the statute as <em>malum prohibitum.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">The general rule is that the intent of the legislature is determinative of whether a criminal statute is <em>malum prohibitum or malum in se. </em>Troutner, supra; State v. Cutshaw, 7 Ariz. App. 210, 437 P. 2d 962 (1968) ; 21 Am. Jur. 2d Criminal Law \u00a7 91. The two sections here, A. R. S. \u00a7 44-1841 and \u00a7 44-1842, in all inclusive language prohibit the acts in question. No element of specific intent is mentioned, and the very subject matter of the statutes in question as a creature of modern commercial practice places them in the mainstream of modern \u201cstrict liability\u201d statutes as <em>malum prohibitum </em>crimes are sometimes denominated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">In accord is <em>State v. Hodge, </em>204 <em>Kan. </em>98, 460 <em>P. </em>2d 596 (Sup. Ct. 1969) (involving prosecution for the sale of unregistered securities, and failure to register as a broker-dealer), in which the court stated that no specific intent is necessary to constitute the offense where one violates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>securities act except the intent to do the act denounced by the statute. The court relied upon the Commissioners\u2019 Note relating to the manner in which the federal courts have construed the term \u201cwillfully\u201d in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. See also <em>Nelson v. State, </em>355 P. 2d 413, 419 (Okl. Cr. App. 1960) (prosecution for selling unregistered securities), in which the court stated that the burden is placed upon the offeror or seller of stock to ascertain if the security may be sold lawfully, and that the law requires registration of the security and the seller to guarantee protection to the public against blue-sky transactions. The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">The law, however, puts the bux-den of such investigation on the pax-ty selling, and it is no excuse if he fails to ascertain if such security cannot in fact be legally sold. He is bound to make such investigation, if the security is not issued by him, before attempting to make a sale thereof, and we may well presume that he did so, as it would not seem reasonable to presume that, knowing the law as he must, he would go ahead with the sale without an independent investigation. [at 419]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The public sale of corporate securities is a sensitive, highly and peculiarly specialized field of activity to which the investing public is exposed and one in which the public is generally not well versed. The potential for serious financial injury to the buying public mandates that all sellers of securities be charged with knowledge of and compliance with all rules and regulations governing such sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">In view of all of the foregoing, the history of the legislation on this subject and the nature and purpose of the act, it is our conclusion that a specific criminal intent, an evil motive, or knowledge that the law was being violated is not required in order to find a criminal violation of the New Jersey Securities Law. To the contrary, all that is required is that the State prove the defendant acted intentionally in the sense that he was aware of what he was doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The pretrial order denying the state\u2019s requests to charge is reversed and the matter remanded for trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
