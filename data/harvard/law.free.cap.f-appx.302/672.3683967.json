Villalobos also petitions this court to review the denial of his application for adjustment of status under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (\u201cIRCA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 99-603,100 Stat. 3359.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-22\">The parties are familiar with the facts of the case, so we repeat them here only to the extent necessary to explain our decision. Because we do not have jurisdiction to review discretionary determinations of extreme and unusual hardship, Villalobos\u2019s petition for review of the BIA decision denying his application for cancellation of removal is denied. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9; 8 \u25a0 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-24\">In 1987, Villalobos presented a completed application for adjustment of status un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>der IRCA, along with the requisite filing fee, to Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) officials.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The official staffing the front desk of the INS office erroneously informed Villalobos that he was not eligible for adjustment of status, and refused to process the application.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">We only have jurisdiction to review final determinations of applications for adjustment of status under IRCA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(f)(l), (4). Villalobos argues that, because his application was improperly rejected before processing, the application was constructively denied, and that the INS effectively made a final, adverse determination on the application. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The Supreme Court addressed this issue in <em>Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 43, 64, 113 S.Ct. 2485, 125 L.Ed.2d 38 (1993). <em>Reno </em>explicitly stated that \u201cin the case of a front-desked application, the term \u2018determination\u2019 is best read to exclude front-desking.\u201d <em>Id. (citing McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., </em>498 U.S. 479, 497, 111 S.Ct. 888, 112 L.Ed.2d 1005 (1991)). \u201cAlthough the phrase \u2018a determination regarding adjustment of status\u2019 could conceivably encompass a ... refusal to accept the application for filing at the front desk ..., nothing in the statute suggests, let alone demonstrates, that Congress was using \u2018determination\u2019 in such an extended and informal sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because there has been no \u201cdetermination\u201d on Villalobos\u2019s IRCA application, we do not have jurisdiction to review the IRCA claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">We do, however, have jurisdiction over Villalobos\u2019s final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because there has not yet been a determination of Villalobos\u2019s IRCA application, we order removal proceedings stayed until such time as a determination is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">\u201c[I]n the case of an alien who presents a prima facie application for adjustment of status under [IRCA] during the application period, and until a final determination on the application has been made ..., the alien \u2014 (A) may not be deported, and (B) shall be granted authorization to engage in employment....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(e)(2). The Supreme Court decision in <em>Reno </em>establishes that a front-desked applicant such as Villalobos has presented a prima facie application for adjustment of status. \u201c[B]y definition, each [applicant] who was front-desked presented at an INS office to an INS employee an application that under the terms of [IRCA] ... entitled him to an adjustment of status. Under any reasonable interpretation of the word, such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>individual \u2018applied\u2019 for an adjustment of status within the 12-month period under \u00a7 1255a(a)(l)(A).\u201d <em>Reno, </em>509 U.S. at 67 n. 29,113 S.Ct. 2485 (1993).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Here, Villalobos submitted his application for adjustment of status in 1987 and was front-desked. The INS (now DHS) has not yet issued a determination on that application. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(e)(2), Villalobos therefore cannot be removed from the United States. Villalobos\u2019s removal order must be stayed until he receives a final determination of his application from DHS.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Accordingly, the petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order denying Villalobos\u2019s application for cancellation of removal is DENIED. The petition for review of the IRCA claim is also DENIED. Villalobos\u2019s order of removal is hereby STAYED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b699-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist as an independent agency within the Department of Justice, and its functions were transferred to the newly formed Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d). <em>See </em>Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, \u00a7\u00a7 441, 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2192, 2205 (codified at 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, ei <em>seq.).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\"><em>. </em>This memorandum refers to this practice, which occurred with some frequency, by the common term \"front desking.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(f)(4)(C), enacted as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\u201d), does not conflict with the <em>Reno </em>Court's holding. As this court has held, \u00a7 1255a(f)(4)(C) was intended to distinguish front-desked applicants from those who had merely been discouraged from attempting to apply for IRCA relief. The statute did not expand the meaning of \"final determination\u201d to include front-desking, and therefore does not give us jurisdiction to consider Villalobos\u2019s IRCA claim. <em>Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc. v. Reno (\"CSS V\"), </em>134 F.3d 921, 925 (9th Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b700-14\">.

The Court also noted that \"there is no statutory deadline for processing IRCA applications.\u201d <em>Reno, </em>509 U.S. at 67 n. 29, 113 S.Ct. 2485.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b701-18\">. Of course, once Homeland Security does render a decision on Villalobos's IRCA application, this court will then have jurisdiction to review that final determination under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
