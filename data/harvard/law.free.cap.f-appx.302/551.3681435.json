Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2006). We review de novo questions of law, <em>Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003), and we review for substantial evidence the factual determinations underlying a denial of CAT relief, <em>Lemus-Galvan v. Mukasey, </em>518 F.3d 1081, 1084 (9th Cir.2008). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-17\">Co\u2019s contention that his refugee status was not properly terminated is foreclosed by <em>Kaganovich v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 894, 898 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201can alien who arrives in the United States as a refugee may be removed even if refugee status has never been terminated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-18\">A reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to reverse the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Co has not shown that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to Vietnam. <em>See Lemus-Galvan, </em>518 F.3d at 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-19\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s decision that Co was convicted of a particularly serious crime, and that he is consequently ineligible for withholding of removal, because the agency applied the correct legal standard in making the determination. <em>See Delgado v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 1017 (9th Cir.2008); <em>cf. Afridi v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 1212, 1217-21 (9th Cir. 2006), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Estrada-Espinoza v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 1147 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b578-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
