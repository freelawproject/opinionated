The issue in this case is whether a decedent\u2019s biological father is entitled to recover wrongful death benefits under Florida\u2019s Wrongful Death Act when another man was previously determined to be the decedent\u2019s legal father and was appointed as his personal representative. After carefully considering the briefs, reviewing the record on appeal, and having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>the benefit of oral argument, we answer this question in the negative and affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">In February 2007, Kenneth Miller, as legal father and personal representative of the estate of Jerrod Miller, filed a wrongful death action in Florida state court against the City of Delray Beach (City), numerous City representatives in their official capacities, and Darren Cogoni, individually, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Florida Wrongful Death Act, \u00a7 768.16-.26. The complaint alleged that in February 2005, Delray Beach police officers negligently shot sixteen-year-old Jerrod to death following a foot chase. The complaint sought damages for negligence and wrongful death arising from the incident. The City removed the action from state court to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on the basis of federal question jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). Miller and the defendants negotiated a settlement agreement for $1,000,000, and sought approval of the settlement in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">In October 2007, Glover, Jerrod\u2019s biological father, filed an objection to the settlement agreement, arguing he was a rightful beneficiary under the Florida Wrongful Death Act. On November 9, 2007, the district court found the Wrongful Death Act did not apply to Miller\u2019s case, and, therefore, it did not need to approve the settlement. Moreover, the district court noted Glover was not a \u201csurvivor\u201d under the Act who had standing to object to the settlement. It reasoned a Florida state court, in its personal representative determination, already had found Miller to be Jerrod\u2019s legal father. <em>See Glover v. Miller, </em>947 So.2d 1254 (Fla. 4th DCA 2007). On November 19, 2007, the district court entered an order affirming the parties\u2019 stipulation of dismissal and closing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">On appeal, Glover argues the district court erred in determining he had no right to the proceeds of the wrongful death claim and dismissing Glover\u2019s claims <em>sua sponte. </em>We have jurisdiction over this appeal. We review the dismissal of this action <em>de novo. See Piazza v. Ebsco Indus., Inc., </em>273 F.3d 1341, 1345 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Florida\u2019s Wrongful Death Act provides that actions are brought by the decedent\u2019s personal representative \u201cfor the benefit of the decedent\u2019s survivors[.]\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.20 (2007). The term \u201csurvivors\u201d includes the decedent\u2019s parents. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.18. Glover argues, as Jerrod\u2019s biological father, he is Jerrod\u2019s \u201cparent\u201d and is thus entitled to object to the settlement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Under Florida law, collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of an issue when \u201c(1) an identical issue, (2) has been fully litigated, (3) by the same parties or their privies, and (4) a final decision has been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Wingard v. Emerald Venture Fla. LLC, </em>438 F.3d 1288, 1293 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations and citations omitted). The litigation issue also must have been critical and necessary to the prior determination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">In this case, collateral estoppel precluded the district court from relitigating the issue of Jerrod\u2019s paternity. After Jerrod\u2019s death, both Miller and Glover previously contended he was Jerrod\u2019s father for purposes of determining who would be appointed Jerrod\u2019s personal representative. <em>See Glover, </em>947 So.2d at 1255. Florida\u2019s Fourth District Court of Appeal held Miller was entitled to preference as the personal representative because, <em>inter alia, </em>a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>1995 paternity action had determined that Miller was Jerrod\u2019s legal father. <em>Id. </em>at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>collateral estoppel does not apply, logic results in the conclusion Glover was not Jerrod\u2019s legal father. Miller <em>was </em>adjudicated to be his father in the 1995 paternity action, and, as the Florida court pointed out, Florida law does not allow a child to \u201chave two legally recognized fathers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Achumba v. Neustein, </em>793 So.2d 1013, 1015 (Fla. 5th DCA 2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district court properly found Glover was not entitled to object to the settlement and dismissed Glover\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal of Glover\u2019s claims and this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
