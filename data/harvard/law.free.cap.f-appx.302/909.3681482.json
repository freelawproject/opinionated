Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test and will affirm if the decision \u201cis supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). We review the IJ\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-14\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum, <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1), and the U.S. Attorney General or the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of \u201crefugee,\u201d <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB4p\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ..., and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-15\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-17\">To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. Not all \u201cexceptional treatment\u201d constitutes persecution, which is \u201can extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation....\u201d <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotations and citations omitted). A finding of past persecution creates the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution and shifts the burden to the government to demonstrate that either conditions have changed in the alien\u2019s home country, or the alien could avoid such persecution by relocating in the home country and that relocation is reasonable. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). To rebut such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>showing, an applicant must show that she faces a threat of future persecution country-wide. <em>Arboleda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>434 F.3d 1220, 1223 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">To establish a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution, \u201can applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. Evidence that a petitioner has relatives living unharmed in the home country diminishes a well-founded fear claim. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258-59 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">The evidence in this case consisted of a single 15-minute instance, wherein petitioner was held in a car against her will by FARC members with guns and told to stop her political activities. Petitioner did not report the incident to the police. Thereafter petitioner\u2019s parents received a letter indicating that petitioner should leave the city for five years. However, petitioner\u2019s similarly-situated relatives continue to live unharmed in the city. We find no error in the IJ\u2019s determination that petitioner did not suffer past persecution nor had established a reasonable fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-11\">. Because Mantilla-Ordonez does not raise any challenge in her brief to the denial of withholding of removal or CAT relief, she has abandoned those issues. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
