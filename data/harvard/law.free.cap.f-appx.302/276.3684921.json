At issue is whether the prosecution improperly attempted to impeach Navarre with his post-arrest silence and whether the trial court improperly commented on the evidence and bolstered the credibility of a state witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-22\">Under the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), habeas relief may not be granted to any issue that was adjudicated on the merits by the state court unless the state court\u2019s conclusions were \u201ccontrary to\u201d or involved an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court or were based on an unreasonable determinations of the facts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)', (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-23\">Navarre does not show that the prosecutor\u2019s question to which the defense counsel objected and the court sustained the objection, had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Chavez, </em>193 F.3d 375, 379 (5th Cir.1999). The factual situation in the instant case closely resembles that in <em>Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 764-66, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987), where the Supreme Court determined that a single question by the prosecution regarding the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence, followed by an objection and curative instruction did not result in a deprivation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-24\">Navarre\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s statement explaining its reason for denying defense counsel a copy of a transcript of a statement of a key eyewitness is also without merit. The trial court did not make an improper remark but rather ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>plained its reasons for denying the defense request. The state court\u2019s resolution of these issues is not contrary to clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
