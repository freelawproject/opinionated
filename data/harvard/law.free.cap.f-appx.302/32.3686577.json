Abrams denying petitioner\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>der the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Mersija Kolenovic, </em>No. A98 401 997 (B.I.A. Jan. 4, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 401 997 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Jan. 27, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">We find that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ found that Kolenovic provided inconsistent testimony, where she alleged in a 2006 sworn statement and testified at her merits hearing that she was raped in 2002, but omitted any such allegation from her original asylum application and asylum interview. In a preREAL ID Act case such as this, to form the basis of an adverse credibility determination, an inconsistency must be \u201csubstantial\u201d when measured against the record as a whole. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-309 (2d Cir.2003) <em>abrogated, in part, by Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162 (2d Cir.2008). Here, Kolenovic\u2019s omission of her alleged rape from her original asylum application<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and asylum interview <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is plainly substantial because it casts doubt on whether the alleged rape \u2014 a central element of her claim \u2014 ever occurred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">We accord the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding \u201cparticular deference,\u201d given that the IJ\u2019s ability to observe Kolenovic\u2019s demeanor placed him in the best position to evaluate whether apparent problems with her testimony suggested a lack of credibility. <em>See Shu Wen Sun v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>510 F.3d 377, 381 (2d Cir.2007). That finding, along with the inconsistency in the record and Kolenovic\u2019s failure to corroborate her claim, provide substantial evidence in support of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>Corovic, </em>519 F.3d at 95. Accordingly, the IJ properly denied her application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Finally, inasmuch as Kolenovic based her claim for withholding of removal and CAT relief on the same factual predicate as her asylum claim, and the IJ properly found that such claim lacked credibility, her withholding of removal and CAT claims necessarily fail. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\">. There is no merit to Kolenovic\u2019s argument that the IJ erred in finding that she omitted any mention of an alleged rape in her asylum application. The record reflects that Kolenovic filed her original application in 2004. That application made no mention of an alleged rape. In 2006, however, Kolenovic submitted a new version of her asylum application which included a sworn statement discussing the alleged rape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-14\">. Kolenovic does not challenge the reliability of the record of the asylum interview, and has therefore waived any such argument. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
