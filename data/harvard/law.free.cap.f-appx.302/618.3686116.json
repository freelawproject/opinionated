We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Garcia-Tax received sufficient notice of her hearing where the record contains the hearing notice addressed to counsel and a certified return receipt, and Garcia-Tax presented no evidence rebutting the strong presumption of service. <em>See Garcia v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (service of hearing notice on counsel sufficient); <em>Arrieta v. INS, </em>117 F.3d 429, 431 (9th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-16\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in affirming the IJ\u2019s determination that Garcia-Tax\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely because it was filed more than seven years after the IJ ordered her deported in absentia, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b) (4) (iii), and Garcia-Tax failed to establish she exercised the required diligence once she learned of her deportation order. <em>See Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897 (equitable tolling is available to a petitioner who is prevented from filing due to deception, fraud or error, and exercises due diligence in discovering such circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
