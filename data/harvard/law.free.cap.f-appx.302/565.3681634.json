We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm the sentence and judgment, but remand to correct the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-17\">Ortiz-Arroyo contends that the magistrate judge erred by refusing to accept his guilty plea in order to give the government the opportunity to file a superseding indictment. This contention fails because Ortiz-Arroyo waived his right to challenge any defect in his previous plea proceedings by subsequently entering a guilty plea to the superseding indictment. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Armenta, </em>400 F.3d 1173, 1175 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-18\">Ortiz-Arroyo also contends that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). Because Ortiz-Arroyo admitted the date of his pri- or removal, this contention fails. <em>See United States v. Covian-Sandoval, </em>462 F.3d 1090, 1097-98 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-19\">In accordance with <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>222 F.3d 1057, 1062 (9th Cir.2000), we remand with instructions that the district court delete from the judgment the incorrect reference to \u00a7 1326(b). <em>See United States v. Herrera-Blanco, </em>232 F.3d 715, 719 (9th Cir.2000) (remanding sua sponte to delete the reference to \u00a7 1326(b) because it is a sentence enhancement and not a separate punishable offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-20\">AFFIRMED; REMANDED to correct the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b592-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
