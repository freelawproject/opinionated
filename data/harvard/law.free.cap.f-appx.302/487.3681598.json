The parties agreed on page three of Miller\u2019s plea agreement to a specific sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 the mandatory minimum given the amount of cocaine and Miller\u2019s prior conviction for a felony drug offense. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B); Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C). The district court accepted the plea agreement and sentenced Miller, as agreed, to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimP. 11(c)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Miller filed a notice of appeal, but the government has moved to dismiss on the ground that Miller waived his right to appeal in the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Mason, </em>343 F.3d 893 (7th Cir.2003). Miller\u2019s lawyer concedes the point and agrees that the appeal should be dismissed. Miller himself opposes the government\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>Cir. R. 51(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">The appeal waiver aside, a defendant who agrees to a specific sentence cannot appeal the sentence imposed except in three narrow circumstances: if his guilty plea was involuntary, if the sentence he received is greater than the sentence he bargained for, or if his sentence was imposed in violation of law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1), (c)(1); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>490 F.3d 604, 607 (7th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Cieslowski, </em>410 F.3d 353, 363-64 (7th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>83 F.3d 934, 941 (7th Cir.1996). Miller does not want his plea set aside, eliminating the first possibility. The second possibility is not tenable because Miller\u2019s prison sentence tracks the agreement. As for the third possibility, Miller\u2019s sentence is the lowest permitted by law. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">Even if Miller\u2019s appeal was not precluded by \u00a7 3742(a)(1) and (c)(1), his plea agreement includes a clear and unambiguous appellate waiver, which is enforceable because the record shows that he knowingly and voluntarily entered into the agreement. <em>See United States v. Linder, </em>530 F.3d 556, 561 (7th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Blinn, </em>490 F.3d 586, 588 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">Accordingly, we GRANT government\u2019s motion to DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
