Upon the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, the Court granted defendant Hewlett Packard\u2019s (\u201cHP\u201d) motion to enforce the non-economic terms of a settlement reached at the parties\u2019 conference before the Magistrate Judge on April 21, 2005, and denied Ms. Shernoffs cross-motion to rescind that settlement. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-17\">We will assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history, and so will not recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-18\">The primary issue for our consideration is whether the District Court erred in enforcing the non-economic terms of an oral settlement agreement that had not yet been reduced to writing. Where, as here, there has been an evidentiary hearing and explicit findings of fact have been made, we review the decision to enforce a settlement agreement for clear error. <em>See Tiernan v. Devoe, </em>923 F.2d 1024, 1031-32 n. 5 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-19\">Having considered the briefs and appendices, including the transcript of the evidentiary hearing held on July 27, 2005, we find no basis to upset the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the Magistrate Judge, which the District Court adopted as its own in a thorough, well-reasoned opinion. Anna Stathis, Esq., who represented Ms. Shernoff as local counsel at the settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>ment conference, testified that the parties had reached a settlement \u201csubject to looking at the final details.\u201d (A. 71; <em>see also </em>A. 61-62, 69-70.) Ms. Shernoff testified that she understood that the settlement was contingent on her agreement to certain non-economic terms, including the \u201cno re-employment\u201d provision challenged here. (A.50-51.) Thus, although the parties did not finalize every last detail of their agreement, the record contains ample evidence of mutual assent as to its core terms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err in enforcing the settlement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-17\">. We reach our decision mindful of New Jersey\u2019s strong public policy in favor of settlement. <em>See Puder v. Buechel, </em>183 N.J. 428, 437-39, 874 A.2d 534 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b111-18\">. Ms. Shernoff also appeals the District Court\u2019s order of January 9, 2008, 2008 WL 114894, denying her Fed.RXiv.P. 60(b) motion for relief from its prior order. The two appeals have been consolidated. Given our disposition of the first appeal, we also will affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Ms. Shernoff\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, which was predicated on supposed \"admissions\" by HP in its brief in the first appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
