Two years after Defendant was removed to China, he illegally reentered Guam, via Saipan.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-19\">Defendant sought to present a defense of necessity, stating that he fled China due to a fear of persecution by the Chinese government for violating its one-child policy. The district court refused to allow the defense, and we affirm. Before being allowed to present a necessity defense, the defendant bears the burden of submitting evidence permitting a conclusion that when he took the illegal action: \u201c(1) [ ] he was faced with a choice of evils and chose the lesser evil; (2)[ ] he acted to prevent imminent harm; (3)[ ] he reasonably anticipated a causal relation between his conduct and the harm to be avoided; and (4)[ ] there were no other legal alternatives to violating the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1125-26 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Aguilar, </em>883 F.2d 662, 693 (9th Cir.1989)). Defendant has not carried that burden. He failed to establish that there were no lawful alternatives to reentering Guam illegally. Moreover, he has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>shown that he faced imminent harm in Saipan.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 by admitting the testimony of a fingerprint comparison expert. The court heard sufficient evidence of the expert\u2019s qualifications and experience. <em>See Hangarter v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>378 F.3d 998, 1015-16 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
