This case concerns three Biological Opinions issued by the FWS pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1586. If a federal agency action \u201cmay affect\u201d an endangered species, the agency is required to formally consult with the FWS. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536(a)(2); 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14(a). At the conclusion of the consultation process, the FWS issues a Biological Opinion assessing whether the proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the endangered species. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536(b)(3)(A); 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14(g)(4). The Biological Opinions at issue analyzed the impact of the Forest Service\u2019s proposed land and resource management plans for the Jefferson, Pisgah, and Daniel Boone National Forests, and concluded that the plans were not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the Indiana bat, an endangered species. Heartwood filed a complaint in federal district court, alleging that the Biological Opinions violated the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531, et seq., and the Administrative Procedures Act 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701, et seq. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, resulting in the denial of Heartwood\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the granting of the FWS and Forest Service\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">We review the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the appropriate standard of review to the agency action. <em>Steeltech, Ltd. v. EPA, </em>273 F.3d 652, 655 (6th Cir.2001). We will set aside an agency\u2019s decision only if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">After carefully reviewing the record, the applicable law, the parties\u2019 briefs and counsels\u2019 arguments, we find that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the FWS and the Forest Service. The district court carefully examined Heartwood\u2019s allegations, the FWS\u2019s obligations under the Endangered Species Act, and the administrative record. The district court then correctly found that there is no evidence in the record which would show that the FWS acted arbitrarily and capriciously or failed to act in accordance with the law in determining that Forest Service\u2019s proposed actions were not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the Indiana bat. Given the district court\u2019s comprehensive analysis, the issuance of a detailed opinion is unnecessary. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s granting of summary judgment for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
