The Government has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, asserting that pursuant to the appellate waiver contained in Bynum\u2019s plea agreement, there is no basis to challenge the sentence imposed. In response, counsel for Bynum concedes that the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss should be granted. Bynum\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he asserts there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but asks this court to review whether Bynum\u2019s guilty plea was valid and whether his sentence was reasonable. Bynum has filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he contends that: (1) the district court failed to ensure he had reviewed the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) with counsel; (2) his attorney provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to his career offender status; (3) the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing was invalid; and (4) his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, a defendant may waive his appellate rights under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2006). <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990) (waiver upheld as voluntarily and intelligently made). Whether a defendant has waived his right to appeal is an issue of law subject to de novo review. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). A waiver will preclude appeal of a specific issue if the record establishes that the waiver is valid and that the issue is within the scope of that waiver. <em>United States v. Attar, </em>38 F.3d 727, 731-33 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Bynum\u2019s first claim is that the Rule 11 hearing was inadequate because the district court failed to inform him that he could not withdraw his plea should the court reject the Government\u2019s sentencing recommendations. Pursuant to Rule 11(c)(3)(B), if the government agrees to request a certain sentence or sentencing range, or recommend that a particular sentencing factor does or does not apply, the district court \u201cmust advise the defendant that the defendant has no right to withdraw the plea if the court does not follow the recommendation or request.\u201d Because Bynum did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, any challenges to the Rule 11 hearing are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-25 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">During the plea colloquy, while the district court informed Bynum that it was not a party to the plea agreement and did not have to accept the Government\u2019s sentencing recommendations, the court failed to warn Bynum that its decision not to accept the Government\u2019s recommendations would not be grounds for withdrawing his guilty plea. However, Bynum has presented no evidence to demonstrate that \u201cbut for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). The plea agreement notified Bynum that the district court was not a party to the plea agreement and that the court\u2019s decision not to abide by the stipulations contained in the agreement would not be grounds for withdrawing the guilty plea. During the Rule 11 hearing, Bynum stated that he had reviewed the plea agreement with his attorney, understood each section, and was agreeing to the terms voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">There is no indication in the record that the omission by the district court affected Bynum\u2019s decision to enter his guilty plea, as Bynum has not identified any evidence demonstrating the probability of a different result \u201csufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. at 83, 124 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>S.Ct. 2333 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, we find that Bynum has failed to demonstrate the district court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights, as the record establishes that Bynum knowingly and voluntarily entered into his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Bynum\u2019s next claim is that the district court failed to verify that he and his attorney had read and discussed the PSR. Pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(l)(A), the district court \u201cmust verify that the defendant and the defendant\u2019s attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any addendum to the report.\u201d At the sentencing hearing, the district court asked Bynum\u2019s attorney whether he had reviewed the PSR with his client; counsel replied that he had \u201cread and discussed it with [Bynum] extensively.\u201d Despite counsel\u2019s assurances to the court, Bynum contends the district court was required to address him personally with regard to this matter. While the district court must determine the defendant has had an opportunity to review the PSR with counsel, this determination can be made by asking \u201c[the] defendant, his lawyer, or both.\u201d <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>849 F.2d 896, 897-98 (4th Cir.1988). Accordingly, we find the district court did not violate Rule 32(i)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Bynum next contends his attorney erred in conceding that the offenses identified by the Government at sentencing were sufficient to establish he was a career offender, as counsel did not consult with him regarding the validity of the convictions or whether he was actually convicted of those offenses. However, there is no evidence in the record to support Bynum\u2019s assertions. Because the record does not conclusively demonstrate ineffective assistance, this claim should be raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion rather than on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120-21 (4th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Finally, Bynum contends his sentence was unreasonable. However, this claim is squarely within the scope of the appellate waiver, as Bynum waived his right to appeal \u201cfrom any sentence within or below the advisory guidelines range resulting from an adjusted base offense level of 31.\u201d <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 172-73 (4th Cir.2005). Based on an offense level of 31 and a criminal history of VI, Bynum\u2019s Sentencing Guideline range was 188 to 235 months. Accordingly, because Bynum\u2019s sentence of 188 months was within the Guidelines range, his claim is barred by the appellate waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss in part as it relates to Bynum\u2019s sentence. As for Bynum\u2019s claims regarding the validity of his Rule 11 hearing, the district court\u2019s failure to abide by Rule 32(i)(l)(A), and ineffective assistance of counsel, we deny the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss as to those claims, but nonetheless affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
