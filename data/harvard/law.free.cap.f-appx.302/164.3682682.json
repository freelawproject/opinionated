Based on our review of the record, we agree that his third conviction under Virginia law for domestic assault and battery against a family member amounted to a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and was therefore an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (2006); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a) (2006). The Board therefore properly upheld the charge of removability on this ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (2006); <em>In re: Manosalva-Pena </em>(B.I.A. Aug. 22, 2007). Additionally, we reject Manosalva-Pena\u2019s argument that he was improperly charged with removability as an aggravated felon under \u00a7 237(a) (2) (A) (iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
