She also challenges the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings during the trial of her other claims. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Black\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim because her pleadings were insufficient. We review de novo a district court\u2019s determinations regarding pleadings. <em>See Cook, Perkiss &amp; Liehe v. Northern Cal. Collection Serv., </em>911 F.2d 242, 244 (9th Cir.1990). To prevail on a \u00a7 1983 free speech claim, Black must show that (1) she engaged in constitutionally-protected speech, (2) school administrators took adverse employment action against her, and (3) Black\u2019s constitutionally-protected speech was a \u201csubstantial or motivating factor\u201d for the adverse employment action. <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs, Wabaunsee County, Kan. v. Umbehr, </em>518 U.S. 668, 675, 116 S.Ct. 2342, 135 L.Ed.2d 843 (1996). In our prior decisions, we noted \u201ca free speech claim depends on speech.\u201d <em>Wasson v. Sonoma County Junior Coll., </em>203 F.3d 659, 662 (9th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Fogarty v. Boles, </em>121 F.3d 886, 890 (3d Cir.1997)). Moreover, \u00a7 1983 plaintiffs have the burden to show that they engaged in constitutionally-protected conduct. <em>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977) (citing <em>Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Housing Dev. Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 270-71, n. 21, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">Black\u2019s claim in Count One that Brewer \u201crefus[ed] to renew her employment contract in retaliation for actual and/or perceived exercises of her right to free speech\u201d is insufficient to meet this burden, because Black did not engage in \u201cspeech.\u201d Brewer\u2019s \u201cerroneous belief\u2019 that Black wrote the letter of concern is not speech. <em>Wasson, </em>203 F.3d at 663 (\u201cthere can be no First Amendment claim when an employee is falsely accused of making statements uttered by someone else\u201d). The allegations further do not indicate any violation of Black\u2019s right of association. Accordingly, her pleadings are insufficient to support a claim under the first prong of the \u00a7 1983 test.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">The district court also properly granted summary judgment on Black\u2019s wrongful discharge claim. Black entered into a one year contract for employment. This contract was not renewed. Black cannot cite any controlling statutory or common law precedent evidencing that the CNMI has \u201ca strong public policy\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>makes non-renewal of her fixed contract tantamount to a termination. Accordingly, the facts simply do not support her wrongful termination claim, and the district court was correct to grant summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Further, we find no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings made in the course of Black\u2019s trial on her other claims. The court properly (1) excluded testimony to be given by Dr. Dragan and Nariany Sikyang under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 403, (2) allowed PSS to cross examine Black under the same standard, and (3) allowed testimony regarding allegations of assault made against Black. Each of these rulings is supported by the record, and Black presents no justification for concluding that the court abused its discretion when weighing the evidence under Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">It appears that the trial court should have allowed Roland Brown to testify that he heard information regarding an outstanding arrest warrant issued for Black, because the statement was not being offered for its truth, but simply to show it was made. Any error was not prejudicial, because Black cannot show that the absence of the testimony, more probably than not, tainted the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Finally, we need not consider whether the trial court erred when it barred expert testimony regarding \u201cfront wage\u201d computation. Even if this decision was in error, it could not possibly have prejudiced Black because front wage computation speaks to damages, which requires a finding that the PSS and Brewer were liable on Black\u2019s tort actions. The jury found in Brewer\u2019s and the PSS\u2019s favor regarding liability, thus the front wage evidence would not have made any impact on the final result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
