He challenges the District Court\u2019s application of a two-level sentencing enhancement for abuse of a position of trust under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-28\">Grumt worked as a surveyor for a marine insurance adjusting company. As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>surveyor, Grumt inspected damaged boats and marinas and submitted damage estimates to insurance companies via fax and mail. The insurance companies would issue and mail checks to the insured parties based on Grumt\u2019s findings. From 1993 to 1996, Grumt engaged in a fraud scheme whereby he submitted inflated estimates and fabricated damages to insurance companies in exchange for a portion of the insurance proceeds from the insureds. Grumt also set up a sham boat repair business to facilitate the scheme. Grumt defrauded over $800,000 from the insurance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In 2001, Grumt pled guilty to one count of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 and \u00a7 2. At the sentencing hearing, the District Court adopted the Probation Department\u2019s recommendation and applied a two-level abuse of position of trust enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court sentenced Grumt to forty-eight months of imprisonment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Grumt challenges the District Court\u2019s application of the enhancement as not being supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, a two-level enhancement is warranted if a \u201cdefendant abused a position of public or private trust ... in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\u201d In deciding whether the enhancement is applicable, we must determine whether a position of trust existed and whether that position had been abused in a manner that significantly facilitated the crime. <em>United States v. Iannone, </em>184 F.3d 214, 222 (3d Cir.1999). We review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s determination of whether the defendant occupied a position of trust, and for clear error whether the defendant abused the position. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">We consider three factors in determining whether a position of trust exists:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">(1) whether the position allows the defendant to commit a difficult-to-detect wrong; (2) the degree of authority which the position vests in the defendant vis-a-vis the object of the wrongful act; and (3) whether there has been reliance on the integrity of the person occupying the position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 223 (quoting <em>United States v. Pardo, 25 </em>F.3d 1187, 1192 (3d Cir.1994)). Abuse of a position of trust in a manner that facilitated the crime occurs where a victim \u201crelies on another\u2019s integrity for protection against the loss occasioned by the crime, and where the trust aspect of the position made the commission of the crime easier.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>315 F.3d 190, 205 (3d Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Hickman, </em>991 F.2d 1110, 1112 (3d Cir.1993) (\u201cTo abuse a position of trust, a defendant must, by definition, have taken criminal advantage of a trust relationship between himself and his victim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">Here, the evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Grumt occupied a position of trust. His position as a surveyor enabled him to submit undetected fraudulent estimates for three years. Grumt did not dispute that there was a dearth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>oversight over his inspections and estimates. He also did not dispute that the insurance companies relied on his reports and estimates in paying out insurance claims. As the District Court noted, Grumt was hired \u201cto make sure the insureds were not trying to defraud the insurance company.\u201d (App.25.) The District Court also committed no error in concluding that Grumt abused a position of trust in a manner that significantly facilitated the crime, as the evidence shows that the insurance companies\u2019 reliance on Grumt as a surveyor made commission of the crime easier.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Based on the foregoing, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-29\">. The District Court applied the 1995 edition of the Guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-6\">. Both Grumt and the Government objected to application of the enhancement. Although, during the sentencing hearing, the Government \"stood by its stipulations in the Plea Agreement,\u201d which did not seek to impose the enhancement, it reserved the right to oppose any appeal of the sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b132-13\">. According to the PSR, Grumt had a criminal history category of VI and an offense level of 20, which yielded a sentencing range of seventy to eighty-seven months. The statutory maximum sentence, however, was sixty months. The District Court adopted the PSR's recommendations but granted a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
