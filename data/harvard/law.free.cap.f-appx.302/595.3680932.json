(\u201cIPC\u201d) and IPC employees Marybeth Bartlett and Michael Wilson. Treadwell\u2019s diversity action alleged various violations of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7\u00a7 12900 <em>et seq. </em>The final judgment incorporates a pretrial order dismissing Treadwell\u2019s hostile work environment claim based on sexual harassment of female co-workers against Wilson, an order granting partial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>summary judgment in favor of IPC on Treadwell\u2019s wrongful termination claim against IPC, as well as a verdict rendered after a bench trial in favor of IPC on Treadwell\u2019s hostile work environment claim based on Bartlett\u2019s racially charged comments. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The district court did not err in dismissing Treadwell\u2019s claim against Wilson because Treadwell lacked standing to bring that claim. Likewise, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of IPC on Treadwell\u2019s wrongful termination claim. Treadwell has not presented the substantial and specific evidence required to demonstrate that IPC\u2019s reasons for terminating his employment were pretext to mask an illegal motive. <em>See Aragon v. Republic Silver State Disposal, Inc., </em>292 F.3d 654, 661-64 (9th Cir.2002). Finally, on the one issue that survived IPC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, there is no basis for overturning the district court\u2019s finding, after a bench trial, that Treadwell had not been subjected to harassing conduct so severe or pervasive that it made his work environment hostile or abusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b621-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
