The district court dismissed the complaint as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and as repetitive and malicious. Johnson does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that his claims were barred by <em>Heck </em>or were repetitive and malicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">By failing to brief any argument challenging the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissal, Johnson has abandoned the only grounds for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). The appeal is wholly without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Johnson is warned that future frivolous filings will invite the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
