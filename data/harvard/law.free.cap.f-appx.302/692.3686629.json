Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>abuse of discretion the denial of both motions. <em>Malty v.

We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s prior order dismissing Cestari-Cuenca\u2019s direct appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision because she failed to file a timely petition for review of that order. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v.
