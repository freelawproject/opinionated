We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. \u2018When, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA.\u201d <em>Hoque v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1190, 1194 (9th Cir.2004). We grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">We review adverse credibility findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1274 (9th Cir.2007). Under this standard, credibility findings will be upheld unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir. 2003). False statements or inconsistencies \u201cmust be viewed in light of all the evidence presented in the case.\u201d <em>Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1066 (9th Cir.2005). We do not \u201caccept blindly an IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible,\u201d but must \u201cexamine the record to see whether substantial evidence supports that conclusion and determine whether the reasoning employed by the IJ is fatally flawed.\u201d <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). An IJ must articulate a legitimate basis to question the applicant\u2019s credibility, and must offer specific and cogent reasons for any stated disbelief. Id.; <em>see Rivera, </em>508 F.3d at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence. First, the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Kaur\u2019s claim was undermined by her unresponsiveness and \u201cevasive\u201d demeanor when asked to testify about her rape is based on speculation about how a rape victim should respond and cannot support an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Lopez-Umanzor v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1049, 1054-55 (9th Cir.2005). The IJ failed to consider the possibility that Kaur\u2019s refusal to answer these questions was affected by cultural factors. <em>See Abovian v. INS, </em>219 F.3d 972, 979 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cNon-evidence based assumptions about conduct in the context of other cultures must be closely scrutinized .... \u201d (internal citations omitted)). The Country Report for India supports the conclusion that Kaur\u2019s unresponsiveness was connected to Indian cultural attitudes regarding rape. U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, India: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2014 2003, http:// www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2003/27947. htm (\u201c[M]any rapes were unreported due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>to a sense of shame and a fear of retribution among victims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Second, Kaur adequately described the room in which she was sexually assaulted as small and dark with one window and one door, and reasonably explained that she could not remember anything else. <em>See Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 887-88 (9th Cir.2004) (holding alien\u2019s description adequate where he answered follow-up questions and the IJ\u2019s expectations for specificity were based upon speculation).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Third, the inconsistencies that the IJ cited do not form an adequate basis for the decision because they are of minor import and do not go to the heart of Kaur\u2019s claim. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1111-12 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Fourth, Kaur\u2019s failure to provide witness testimony, rather than a written affidavit, is not a valid basis for an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Gui, </em>280 F.3d at 1227 (holding that where petitioner provides some corroborating evidence, \u201chis failure to produce still more supporting evidence should not be held against him\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Finally, the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Country Report for India is not inconsistent with Kaur\u2019s testimony, but states that custodial rape is part of a pattern of broader custodial abuse. Nothing in the Country Report contradicts Kaur\u2019s story, and there is much to corroborate it. The IJ failed to conduct an individualized analysis of Kaur\u2019s situation as required, and thus cannot discredit her testimony on the basis of the Report. <em>See Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1069 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA to determine whether, with Kaur\u2019s testimony accepted as credible, she is eligible for relief. <em>See INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b740-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
