Elstein denying his motion to reopen. <em>In re Shakeel Akhtar, </em>No. A72 454 818 (B.I.A. Feb. 29, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A72 454 818 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 7, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">We review the agency\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)). Here, it is beyond dispute that the BIA accurately found that Akhtar\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely. Akhtar sought reopening of his exclusion proceedings in order to pursue relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) over eleven years after the BIA directed him to surrender for deportation and more than eight years after the June 21, 1999 deadline applicable to aliens deported before March 22, 1999 who seek reopening to apply for CAT relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(b)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-13\">An alien like Akhtar who missed the June 21, 1999 deadline may still invoke the general filing exceptions to the time limitations on motions to reopen in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4). The BIA may deny a motion to reopen invoking 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4), however, where the movant fails to establish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for relief. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>see INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (finding that the movant\u2019s failure to establish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for the underlying relief sought provides \u201cindependent grounds on which the BIA may deny a motion to reopen\u201d). Here, the BIA properly found that Akhtar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>failed to meet his burden of establishing that someone in his particular alleged circumstances is more likely than not to be tortured in Pakistan. <em>See Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 144 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">While Akhtar\u2019s evidence establishes widespread violence and an unstable political situation in Pakistan that resulted, in part, because of the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the former leader of the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (\u201cPPP\u201d), Akhtar failed to explain why \u201csomeone in his particular alleged circumstances\u201d would be subjected to torture if returned to Pakistan. <em>See id. </em>Akhtar argues that his evidence shows that he is still a member of the PPP and that party \u201cmembers are presently and routinely subject to murder, kidnapping, and arson.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 24. Contrary to Akhtar\u2019s arguments, however, his evidence does not demonstrate the latter proposition. At most, his evidence reflects on the general political instability in Pakistan and the targeting of high-profile leaders. In the absence of particularized evidence establishing a clear probability of torture, the agency properly found that Akhtar did not establish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that general evidence of human rights violations, including instances of torture, does not warrant CAT relief where it does not demonstrate that a petitioner is personally more likely than not to suffer torture upon removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
