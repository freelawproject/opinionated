The BIA found petitioner, who had been a lawful permanent resident of the United States, removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), and ineligible for cancellation of removal, pursuant to section 240A(a)(3) of the INA, because he had been convicted of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) (defining \u201caggravated felony\u201d). In particular, the BIA found that the second of petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>er\u2019s two convictions for simple possession of marijuana in violation of N.Y. PENAL LAW \u00a7 221.05 qualified as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B)\u2019s definition of that term because it might have been prosecuted as a recidivist offense under the Controlled Substances Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). Before this Court, petitioner contends that the BIA erred in determining that his New York marijuana conviction qualified as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Because the BIA adopted the order of the IJ without modification, we treat the IJ\u2019s order as the final order of the BIA. <em>See Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). While we must defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the INA, we owe no deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of federal or state criminal statutes. <em>See Dalton v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 200, 203-04 (2d Cir.2001). Therefore, we review <em>de novo </em>the BIA\u2019s determination that petitioner\u2019s second conviction for possession of marijuana constitutes an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the INA, which defines that term through reference to federal criminal statutes. <em>See Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In <em>Alsol v. Mukasey, </em>548 F.3d 207 (2d Cir.2008), we held that second conviction under New York law for simple drug possession, such as petitioner\u2019s, is not a felony under the Controlled Substances Act, and is therefore not an aggravated felony for immigration purposes, \u201csimply because it <em>could have been </em>prosecuted as a recidivist offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a).\u201d 548 F.3d at 210 (emphasis in original); <em>see also </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1) (setting forth procedural requirements for prosecution of reeidivist possession under \u00a7 844(a)). Rather, for the reasons we explained in <em>Alsol, </em>\u201cin order for a state misdemeanor offense to be treated as a recidivist offense and thus a federal felony under the CSA, the alien\u2019s status as a recidivist drug possessor must have been admitted or determined by a court or jury <em>within the prosecution for the second drug crime.\u201d Alsol, </em>at 216-17 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original). The same analysis applies to this case, where petitioner was convicted of a \u201cviolation\u201d under state law. Here, petitioner\u2019s alleged status as a recidivist drug possessor was neither admitted nor determined by a court or jury within the prosecution for his second drug offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Therefore, the petition for review is GRANTED, the decision of the BIA is VACATED, and the cause is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this summary order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-6\">. Title 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined by section 924(c) of Title 18)[.]\u201d In turn, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2) defines a \"drug trafficking crime\u201d as \"any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
