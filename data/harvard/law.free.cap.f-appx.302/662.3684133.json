We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-23\">Porter contends that the sentence is unreasonable because the district court: (1) gave greater weight to the Sentencing Guidelines than to the other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; (2) imposed a sentence that was greater than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing; (3) failed to adequately articulate its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by not discussing his request for a below Guidelines-range sentence; and (4) failed to explain the reasons underlying its sentence selection. The record does not support these contentions. The district court did not procedurally err, and that the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v.
