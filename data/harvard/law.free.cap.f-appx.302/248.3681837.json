(\u201cAmeristar\u201d) was not retaliatory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Barker continues to claim that Ameristar fired him for reporting the company\u2019s poor compliance with federal aviation safety regulations to the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d). Barker asserts that (1) the ARB was arbitrary and capricious in not reversing the ALJ because Barker demonstrated by substantial evidence that Ameristar\u2019s explanation for his dismissal was a pretext for retaliation, and (2) the ARB erred in affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision to exclude some testimony of his former co-worker, Thomas Clemmons, regarding the allegedly retaliatory reasons for Clemmons\u2019s dismissal. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Barker was chief pilot at Ameristar from September 2002 until mid-April 2003 when he and five other Ameristar pilots were laid off. During Barker\u2019s brief tenure at Ameristar, he raised numerous safety concerns about the planes that the company operated, directly notifying the FAA about these matters on at least one occasion. Management told Barker that it preferred he handle complaints \u201cin-house.\u201d During this time, the company was struggling to find business and become profitable; it lost $650,000 over 15 months. The mid-April lay-off that included Barker affected six of the company\u2019s 10 pilots, and the company was defunct soon after.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">We affirm a decision of the ARB unless it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law. Factual findings are subject to substantial evidence review.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>An ALJ is granted broad discretion to make evidentiary determinations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-16\">Barker had the burden of proving that Ameristar fired him at least in part for retaliatory reasons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ameristar could avoid liability by demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action regardless of Barker\u2019s behavior,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Barker could then respond by demonstrating that his former employer\u2019s proffered explanation was a pretext <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>for retaliatory discharge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Barker did this, offering evidence that Ameristar\u2019s proffered explanation was pretextual. He claims here that the ARB ignored his evidence, yet we find no support for this contention. Rather, we conclude that the ALJ found Ameristar\u2019s explanation was more convincing than Barker\u2019s, and the ARB concurred. On this record, we cannot agree that the ARB\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Finally, Barker contends that the ARB was arbitrary and capricious in affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision to bar portions of Clemmons\u2019s testimony. The ARB found no abuse of discretion in the ALJ\u2019s exclusion of the part of Clemmons\u2019s testimony that described his theory that he had been fired in retaliation for reporting the company\u2019s unsafe aviation practices to the FAA. Barker asserts that Clemmons\u2019s excluded testimony would have established a pattern of retaliatory firings by the company. But Clemmons was a manager who was fired individually months earlier. In contrast, Barker was one of six pilots (out of a total of 10) who were laid off just months before the company went under. The ARB viewed the situations as sufficiently inapposite to uphold the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Clemmons was not similarly situated to Barker, making the subject portion of his testimony irrelevant. The ARB also noted that the ALJ permitted Clemmons to provide other relevant testimony. Given the deferential standard of review applicable, we cannot agree with Barker that the ARB\u2019s conclusion was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
