He contends that the district court erred when it enhanced his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 because the Government failed to present any evidence that he recklessly created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury or death to an identifiable person during the course of his flight from law enforcement officers. Specifically, Delgado argues that the vehicular chase alone, absent some aggravating factor, was insufficient to support the reckless endangerment enhancement. The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance or, alternatively, for an extension of time in which to file a brief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The district court\u2019s factual finding that Delgado recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to others during his flight from law enforcement officers is plausible in light of the record as a whole. The applicability of \u00a7 3C1.2 is not limited \u201cto situations resulting in actual harm or manifesting extremely dangerous conduct by a defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>323 F.3d 320, 323 (5th Cir.2003). Further, \u00a7 3C1.2 does not require that other vehicles actually ended up in harm\u2019s way. <em>Id. </em>at 324. By leading officers on an eight-mile high speed chase at night along Interstate 35 through downtown Fort Worth, Texas, Delgado recklessly disregarded the safety of persons who might have been present along the chase route, as well as the officers involved in the chase. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, Delgado has not shown clear error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
