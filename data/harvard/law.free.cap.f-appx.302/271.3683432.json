He requests only that this court exercise its power pursuant to Fed. R. Crim P. 36 to correct an alleged clerical error in the judgment. Specifically, he alleges that the judgment of the district court misidentifies the nature of his offense as \u201c[r]e-entry of a deported alien\u201d when it should state that he was illegally found in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-21\">Rule 36 provides that the court may at any time, after giving whatever notice it deems appropriate, correct a clerical error in the judgment. The rule authorizes the court to correct only such errors that exist because \u201c \u2018the court intended one thing but by merely clerical mistake or oversight did another.\u2019 \u201d <em>See United States v. Steen, </em>55 F.3d 1022, 1025-26 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Dura-Wood Treating Co. v. Century Forest Indus., Inc., </em>694 F.2d 112, 114 (5th Cir.1982)). In the district court\u2019s judgment, the \u201cNature of Offense\u201d description, \u201c[r]e-entry of a deported alien,\u201d closely tracks the \u00a7 1326 title, \u201c[rjeentry of removed aliens,\u201d and, therefore, bears no indication that the district court made a mistake. Rather, it appears that the district court intended the \u201cNature of Offense\u201d to refer generally to the title of \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-22\">The method of reference to \u00a7 1326 in the instant case is not uncommon. This court has often used the term \u201cillegal reentry\u201d in reference to violations of \u00a7 1326 generally. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gunera, </em>479 F.3d 373, 376 (5th Cir.2007). Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>cause the district court\u2019s judgment in the instant case apparently used the term \u201c[r]e-entry of a deported alien\u201d intentionally in reference to \u00a7 1326 generally, there is no clerical error. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
