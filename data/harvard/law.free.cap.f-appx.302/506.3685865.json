We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b533-18\">On July 31, 2001, Mackmore pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base, i.e., crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(A). The plea agreement acknowledged Mackmore was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). It also provided the government would file a motion for downward departure \u201cfrom the guideline sentence\u201d if the government, in its sole discretion, found Mackmore provided substantial assistance. The agreement did not specify whether such a downward departure motion would be filed under \u00a7 3553(e) or \u00a7 5K1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but rather left the decision in the sole discretion of the government. Ultimately, the government moved for a downward departure under \u00a7 5K1.1, but not under \u00a7 3553(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-19\">At sentencing on January 3, 2002, Mack-more was assessed a total offense level of 33 and a criminal history category III, resulting in a guidelines range of 168-210 months. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure and sentenced him to 140 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>On July 27, 2007, Mackmore filed a motion to compel the government to file another downward departure motion \u2014 this time, under \u00a7 3553(e) \u2014 due to convictions of persons about whom he gave information subsequent to his sentencing. He also asserted the government\u2019s refusal to make a \u00a7 3553(e) motion was a bad faith breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The district court denied the motion, noting the government preserved its discretion in deciding whether to present such a motion, and Mackmore had failed to allege any legal cause to compel the government to seek a further reduction. Mackmore appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In February 2008, on its own motion, the district court reopened Mackmore\u2019s sentencing for a possible reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) due to the retroactive amendment of the guidelines for crimes involving crack cocaine. See U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 706. (2007) (adjusting downward by two levels the base offense level assigned to each threshold quantity of crack cocaine listed in the Drug Quantity Table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1), amend. 711 (Supp.2007) &amp; amend. 713 (Supp.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The district court found Mackmore was eligible for a sentencing reduction. Mack-more\u2019s amended guidelines range was 135-168 months. A proportional reduction for substantial assistance resulted in a revised range of 112-140 months. After noting the sentencing reduction could not be below the mandatory minimum sentence, the court reduced Mackmore\u2019s sentence to 120 months imprisonment. Mackmore appealed. This appeal was consolidated with his previously-filed appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">\u201cA district court may review the government\u2019s refusal to make a substantial assistance motion under section 3553(e) ..., if such refusal (1) was prompted by an unconstitutional motive, such as the defendant\u2019s race or religion; or (2) was not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>526 F.3d 1135, 1138 (8th Cir.2008). \u201cThere is an intra-circuit split whether bad faith is an additional basis for compelling a motion for downward departure based on substantial assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the denial of a motion to compel a \u00a7 3553(e) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">As Mackmore acknowledges, the government was \u201cnot strictly bound by the terms of the plea agreement to file a [\u00a7 3553(e) ] motion.\u201d He contends the government nonetheless had an obligation to file a \u00a7 3553(e) motion because he provided the government with \u201cextensive, significant, and useful information leading to the conviction and/or guilty pleas of at least six other individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">The law is clear, however, merely reiterating the extent of one\u2019s assistance and making generalized allegations of improper motive are insufficient to grant a motion to compel a \u00a7 3553(e) motion. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (\u201c[A] claim that a defendant merely provided substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Nor would additional but generalized allegations of improper motive.\u201d); <em>Perez, </em>526 F.3d at 1138 (holding that a defendant must show \u201cmore than the presentation of evidence of substantial assistance and general allegations of improper motive because we presume a prosecutor has properly discharged her duties absent clear evidence to the contrary\u201d); <em>United States v. Mullins, </em>399 F.3d 888, 890 (8th Cir.2005) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s bare assertions of assistance do not constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u2018substantial threshold showing\u2019 of improper conduct by the government.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Mackmore has proffered no evidence that the government\u2019s decision not to file a \u00a7 3558(e) motion was prompted by an unconstitutional motive or was not rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Nor, even if bad faith is a basis to compel a \u00a7 3553(e) motion, has Mackmore demonstrated bad faith. Because Mack-more has not satisfied his burden of demonstrating an improper motive, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to compel the government to file a \u00a7 3553(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">\u201cWithout a government motion, the district court is without authority to impose a sentence below a statutory mandatory minimum sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Holbdy, </em>489 F.3d 910, 912 (8th Cir.2007). This is true even in proceedings to reduce sentences under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Black, </em>523 F.3d 892, 892-93 (8th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Peters, </em>524 F.3d 905, 907 (8th Cir.2008); U.S.S.G \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) cmt. n. l(A)(ii) (2008) (sentencing reduction not authorized if the retroactive amendment does not lower the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range because of a statutory provision, e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Mackmore nonetheless argues the district court should have forced the government to file a \u00a7 3553(e) motion and sentenced him below the mandatory minimum when he was resentenced under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). But, as discussed above, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mackmore\u2019s motion to compel a \u00a7 3553(e) motion. In determining the revised guidelines range, the district court properly set the bottom of the range at the mandatory minimum. Therefore, the district court did not err by resentencing Mackmore to 120 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-14\">.
