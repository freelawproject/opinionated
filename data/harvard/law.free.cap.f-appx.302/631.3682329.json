We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Oh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 612 (9th Cir.2005), we grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-21\">Caldera-Saucedo\u2019s motion to reconsider attached several exhibits supporting his argument that his late-filed appeal be considered timely due to an escalating medical problem. <em>See </em>BIA Practice Manual, Ch. 3.1(c)(ii) (permitting submission of evidence with motions to re-file untimely appeals or motions). As the BIA\u2019s April 13, 2006 decision does not indicate that it considered Caldera-Saucedo\u2019s argument or evidence, we remand to allow the BIA to exercise its discretion regarding CalderaSaucedo\u2019s request. <em>See Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005) (BIA must provide specific and cogent reasons for its decision in order to provide court a reasoned decision to review).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b658-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
