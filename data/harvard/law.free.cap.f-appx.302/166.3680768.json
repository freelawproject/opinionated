The court also found that Howard had failed to make a prima facie showing of retaliation. On July 3, 2007, Howard filed a second suit against Inova, asserting an ADA claim based on the same events that formed the basis for his FMLA claims. The district court in that case granted Inova\u2019s 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Howard\u2019s complaint on the basis of <em>res judicata. </em>Howard now appeals the judgments of the district courts. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">Howard first began working for Inova as an operating room (\u201cOR\u201d) technician in 1993. In the fall of 1996, Howard informed Inova that he had been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d), triggered by exposure to blood or bodily fluids or the smell of burning flesh. He asked to be removed from his position for fear of endangering patients. Howard began using full-time and intermittent leave under the FMLA to address his PTSD and eventually was transferred to a supply and resource coordinator position that did not involve OR work.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-15\">Howard left Inova in 1997 and was unemployed for four years. In 2000, he sued Inova, alleging an ADA violation. While the lawsuit was pending, Inova rehired Howard in 2001 as a patient service coordinator, and the lawsuit was dismissed. Upon his reemployment, Howard was given access to Inova\u2019s employee booklet and FMLA policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-16\">On February 14, 2002, Howard was involved in a car accident and injured his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>back. He requested and was approved for 28 days of FMLA leave. He provided Inova with physicians\u2019 notes certifying that he was unable to attend work from February 14 to 19, 2002; February 27 to March 14, 2002; April 9 to 16, 2002; and April 19 to 26, 2002. J.A. 597-602. Howard was involved in a second car accident on November 26, 2002. He submitted physicians\u2019 notes certifying that he should work reduced hours with certain restrictions on physical activity from December 7 to 21, 2002; December 18, 2002 to January 10, 2008; and January 11, 2003 to February 22, 2003. J.A. 606-09. He also submitted a physician certification in May 2003 stating that he needed to work reduced hours for an unknown period. J.A. 610-12. Inova approved a reduced work schedule for Howard, but he eventually returned to a full-time schedule in 2003 or 2004. <em>See </em>J.A. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In 2005, Howard was verbally disciplined by his supervisor, Julie Quick, for \u201cabsenteeism and tardiness,\u201d and written documentation of the discipline was placed in his file. J.A. 104, 621. Quick explained that Howard had failed to report for work on February 2 to 7, 2005 and March 1 to 2, 2005; that he had left work early on February 9, 23, and 25, 2005; and that he was late on February 11, 14, and 18, 2005. <em>Id. </em>Howard asserted that he missed these days of work due to his back problems. J.A. 333-38. Quick provided Howard with FMLA forms for his doctors to certify that these absences were related to medical issues. If Howard could submit proper physician certification of these absences, Quick would withdraw documentation of the verbal warning from Howard\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">On April 15, 2005, Howard called in sick. On April 18, 2005, Quick gave Howard a written warning, noting that his April 15, 2005 absence was the ninth unexcused absence in three months. Again, Quick provided Howard with FMLA forms and said she would withdraw both the verbal and written warnings if he could provide physician certification for his absences.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Howard met with Quick and Tom Williams, an Inova HR representative, on April 28, 2005. Howard had not yet provided FMLA documentation to excuse his absences. Quick and Williams explained the forms to Howard and informed him that his failure to return them could be grounds for termination. J.A. 385-86. On May 4, 2005, Howard submitted a \u201cCertification of Health Care Provider\u201d that a physician had signed on March 29, 2005. <em>See </em>J.A. 623-25. Because the certification did not provide the physician\u2019s name or contact information and was evidently filled out by two different people, Williams met with Howard and told him that the certification was insufficient to excuse Howard\u2019s absences.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 6, 2005, Williams wrote Howard, explaining that Inova had no FMLA paperwork for Howard for the last two years. Williams\u2019s letter set a May 13, 2005 deadline for Howard to provide physician certification for his absences. Howard did not submit a complete certification from Dr. Rodney Dade until May 31, 2005. The certification stated that Howard had lower back pain that required a reduced work schedule for a period of six to eight months. Inova <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>approved a reduced work schedule for Howard based on this certification on June 1. 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">On June 13, 2005, Quick met with Howard and informed him that he would be transferred from the Surgical Business office to the Unit Management office to work in a supply distribution tech position. A letter from Quick to Howard memorializing their meeting stated that the new position would better accommodate his intermittent schedule and that Howard would work in the Unit Management office, \u201creorganizing and labeling; entering data for scrub users; [and] placing supplies ... in proper locations,\u201d for the duration of his approved reduced work schedule. J.A. 116, 642, 1485. The letter asked Howard to start in his new position on June 15, 2005. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Howard testified in his deposition that during the meeting he told Quick that he should not work near the OR because he needed to avoid exposure to blood. He did not report for work in the new supply distribution tech position until June 23, 2005. When he appeared for work, he presented a note from Dr. George H. Lawrence, a psychologist, stating that Howard \u201chas been suffering from debilitating stress and therefore unable to work from Wednesday, June 15th.\u201d J.A. 126; <em>see also </em>J.A. 420. The note stated that Howard was \u201cfit to return to duty\u201d on June 23, 2005 and should \u201cavoid unnecessary stress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">On June 27, 2005, Howard filed an EEOC charge of discrimination against Inova, alleging an ADA claim. On the same day, Quick and Williams met with Howard and requested FMLA paperwork to certify the \u201cdebilitating stress\u201d condition that Dr. Lawrence had identified. <em>See </em>J.A. 436. They provided Howard with the necessary forms and asked him to return them by July 13, 2005, which he did not. In the meantime he worked as a supply distribution tech, performing duties in and around the OR. He testified that while he worked in this position, he had four or five dissociative episodes related to his PTSD, only one of which he told Quick about. <em>See </em>J.A. 432-34. On July 12, 2005, Roxanne Kavros, one of Howard\u2019s old supervisors from his previous tenure with Inova, met with Williams to express her concern that she had seen Howard in and around the OR. She mentioned that she had supervised him in 1998 when he transferred from an OR tech position into a supply tech position because of his PTSD.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She was worried that \u201cbecause of changes in the design of the OR department he may currently be passing by OR rooms and seeing patients or blood products.\u201d J.A. 1492.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Howard met with Williams again on July 20, 2005. During this meeting, Williams gave Howard another week to submit FMLA certification for the \u201cdebilitating stress\u201d that Dr. Lawrence had diagnosed. Howard did not submit the paperwork. On the same day, Howard met with Quick, Williams, and other HR employees to discuss his concern that his current position was exposing him to blood. After the meeting, he was assigned to another position in the Unit Management office to perform data entry and began work in this position on July 21,2005.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>On August 10, 2005, Howard submitted an FMLA form requesting full-time leave from August 11 to 26, 2005. JA. 658. Accompanying the form was a \u201cCertification of Health Care Provider\u201d from Dr. Lawrence stating that Howard was \u201csuffering from seizure disorder and PTSD.\u201d J.A. 128, 654. The form further stated that Howard \u201cis at risk for seizure or possible self harm\u201d and \u201cneeds fulltime leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128-29, 654-55. Williams approved Howard\u2019s leave on August 15, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">On August 17, 2005, Williams sent Howard a letter confirming that Howard would return to work on August 29, 2005, the first business day after his approved leave would end. JA. 132-33, 659-60. The letter also asked Howard to contact the health care providers who had completed Howard\u2019s most recent FMLA paperwork. Williams wanted the physicians to review a proposed job description of the position that Howard would assume after returning to work. The letter also asked the physicians to provide information about whether Howard would require a reduced work schedule; whether Howard would experience episodes of incapacity due to his health; and whether Howard would be able to perform the proposed job duties. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">On August 23, 2005, Howard sent a letter to the Department of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Division to file an FMLA complaint against Inova for \u201cdiscriminat[ing] and retaliating] against me by overriding a position that was accommodating me for my disability.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> J.A. 676-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">On August 26, 2005, an Inova HR Coordinator sent Howard another letter confirming approval for his leave from August 11 to 26, 2005. J.A. 152-53. The letter also stated that Howard was \u201crequired to present a \u2018fitness-for-duty certificate from [his] health care provider, prior to [his] return to work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152. Howard testified that he understood this letter to request a \u201cfitness for duty certification from [his] doctor that provided support that [he was] ready to come back to work medically.\u201d JA. 485. By September 8, 2005, however, Howard had not submitted a fitness-for-duty certification and had not reported for work. <em>Id. </em>at 484. On that day, Williams wrote Howard to remind him that Williams had not received the information requested in his August 17, 2005 letter. J.A. 154. Williams also informed Howard that because Howard had not returned to work as expected, Inova required \u201cupdated Family Medical Leave paperwork from both of your Health Care Providers by Monday, September 19, 2005.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Williams warned Howard that \u201c[flailure to clarify [Howard\u2019s] employment status with us ... will be considered job abandonment and grounds for termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Howard did not provide the requested information. JA. 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>At Howard\u2019s request, Dr. Lawrence wrote to Williams on September 15, 2005. His letter explained that Howard \u201ccontinues to experience occasional stress-induced seizures and dissociative episodes\u201d and \u201cneeds evaluation and treatment by a neurologist,\u201d for which \u201creasonable time away from his work\u201d was required. J.A. 158. Dr. Lawrence stated that Howard \u201ccan soon begin to function effectively again as a Patient Coordinator or in some similar position.... [I]f he is treated with respect and consideration and allowed to return to appropriate work around the end of this month, part time at first, he will be a productive and above average ... employee.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">On September 28, 2005, Howard faxed Quick a letter informing her that he intended to return to work on October 3, 2005. J.A. 159. Williams contacted Howard that same day and confirmed receipt of Dr. Lawrence\u2019s September 15, 2005 letter, but reminded Howard that he still needed to provide FMLA paperwork from Dr. Lawrence and any other physician currently treating him for his medical conditions <em>\u201cbefore [he] retum[s] to work.\u201d </em>J.A. 161. Williams requested the paperwork by October 7, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Howard did not return to work on October 3, 2005 as he had indicated to Quick. He faxed a letter to Williams on October 7, 2005, asking for more time to complete the FMLA certifications. J.A. 165. On October 17, 2005, Howard had neither returned to work nor submitted any of the requested FMLA certifications. On that day, Inova\u2019s Assistant Director for Human Resources wrote to Howard and informed him that \u201cdue to the fact that we have not received any requested documentation to support your leave, your employment has been terminated effective immediately.\u201d J.A. 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Howard sued Inova Health Care Services on August 24, 2006, asserting interference and retaliation claims under the FMLA. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Inova and denied Howard\u2019s motion to dismiss his complaint without prejudice or, in the alternative, to amend his petition to add an ADA claim. On July 3, 2007, Howard filed a second suit against Inova, alleging that Inova had violated the ADA by discriminating and retaliating against him based on his PTSD. The district court granted Inova\u2019s 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Howard\u2019s second complaint on the basis of <em>res judicata. </em>Howard now appeals the judgments of the district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Howard appeals the district court\u2019s opinion granting summary judgment on both his interference and retaliation claims under the FMLA. Our review of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is de novo. <em>Jennings v. Univ. of N.C., </em>482 F.3d 686, 694 (4th Cir.2007) (en banc) (citing <em>Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., Inc., </em>354 F.3d 277, 283 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">In his interference claim, Howard asserts on appeal that Inova violated the FMLA by transferring him to an alternate position, disciplining him for unexcused absences, and terminating his employment. These claims are addressed separately below.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">Howard argues that his transfer from a billing position in the Surgical Posting office into a supply distribution tech position in the Unit Management office violated the FMLA because it worked a hardship on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>him in violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.204(d). Under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.204(a), an employer may transfer an employee \u201ctemporarily, during the period the intermittent or reduced leave schedule is required, to an available alternative position for which the employee is qualified and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than does the employee\u2019s regular position.\u201d The \u201cemployer may not transfer the employee to an alternative position in order to discourage the employee from taking leave or otherwise work a hardship on the employee.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.204(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Howard contends that the district court ignored the DOL\u2019s investigative finding that Inova had violated the FMLA when it transferred Howard. Howard further argues that his transfer from the billing position into the supply distribution tech position was unnecessary because \u201cInova filled Howard\u2019s billing office position with hours from existing employees who were asked to work overtime.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 11. In addition, Howard asserts that Inova \u201cignored the limitations noted in its own health file that Howard was restricted to work in the billing office,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 13, and that the alternative supply distribution tech position \u201cwas designed to work a hardship\u201d on him by moving him from a \u201csedentary white collar job\u201d to a position where he was exposed to \u201cblood and the smell of burning flesh,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Inova responds that \u201c[rjegardless of when Inova was able to replace [Howard] with another full-time employee, [Howard\u2019s old billing position] required a full-time employee, and both his first and second alternative positions did not.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Br. at 34. Inova also points out that the new position offered the same salary and benefits as the old position and involved \u201cjob duties that were a rough equivalent of his tasks in the billing office.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Br. at 35. Inova further emphasizes that contrary to Howard\u2019s contention, his medical record contained no restrictions as to the kind of work he could perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Howard\u2019s reliance on the DOL\u2019s investigative findings is unavailing. Courts have routinely declined to rely on agency findings, in part because such a finding does not result from an adjudicatory proceeding and consequently has no preclusive effect. <em>See Phipps v. County of McLean, </em>No. 07-cv-1160, 2008 WL 4534066, at *4 n. 3 (C.D.Ill. Oct. 7, 2008) (citation omitted); <em>cf. Brantley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>No. RDB-07-1322, 2008 WL 2900953, at *3-5 (D.Md. July 22, 2008); <em>Roberts v. The Health Ass\u2019n, </em>No. 04-CV-6637T, 2007 WL 2287875, at *4-7 (W.D.N.Y. Aug. 8, 2007); <em>Hamilton v. Niagara Frontier Transp. Autk, </em>Nos. 00-CV-300SR, 00-CV-863SR, 2007 WL 2241794, at *13-15 (W.D.N.Y. July 31, 2007). <em>But cf. Ammons-Lewis v. Metro. Water Reclamation Dist. Of Greater Chicago, </em>No. 03 C 0885, 2004 WL 2453835, at *9 (N.D.Ill. Nov. 1, 2004) (finding that the DOL report \u201cmay create an issue of fact as to whether [the plaintiffs] first leave request was improperly denied,\u201d but granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant because the plaintiff could not show damages (citation omitted)). The district court did not err in declining to rely on the DOL\u2019s findings, and we do not rely on them now in our de novo review.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Howard stresses that his duties in his billing position were absorbed by current employees working overtime, but this argument fails to raise a fact issue as to whether his old position required a full-time employee, as Inova contends. Nor does it address the more critical issue of whether his new supply distribution tech position better accommodated a reduced work schedule. Although Howard\u2019s new position required different job duties than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>his old position, an alternative position intended to accommodate a reduced work schedule \u201cdoes not have to have equivalent duties,\u201d just \u201cequivalent pay and benefits.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.204(c). Howard does not contend on appeal that the transfer to the supply distribution tech position resulted in a cut in his pay or benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Howard\u2019s argument that Inova transferred him to work a hardship on him is similarly unpersuasive. The record does not support his contention that Inova transferred him in bad faith with knowledge that exposure to blood in and around the OR would exacerbate his PTSD. The record shows that the most recent documentation that Inova possessed relating to his PTSD dated back to 2001. Howard testified in his deposition that he verbally told Quick he could not be exposed to blood and bodily fluids when she informed him of the transfer in 2005, but he had submitted no FMLA documentation of his PTSD for almost four years. All the FMLA documentation that he had provided in the preceding three years dealt solely with back problems from his car accidents in 2002. He submitted a note from Dr. Lawrence to excuse his six-day absence before beginning the new supply distribution tech position, but this letter did not notify Inova that Howard\u2019s PTSD had recurred. Rather, it stated only that Howard \u201chas been suffering from debilitating stress\u201d but was now \u201cfit to return to duty.\u201d J.A. 644. Howard has not shown that a fact issue exists as to whether Inova transferred him to \u201cwork a hardship\u201d on him under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.204.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Howard argues that Inova violated the FMLA by disciplining him for unexcused absences in the spring of 2005. He contends that the district court ignored evidence in the record that \u201cHoward had provided to Inova a FMLA form for intermittent leave in 2008 and that Inova had lost Howard\u2019s FMLA form.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 10. Relying on Williams\u2019s deposition testimony that \u201cdoctor[\u2019]s notes are not required for intermittent leave once it has been approved,\u201d Howard contends that Inova \u201cviolated the FMLA regulations by failing to keep FMLA forms submitted by Howard for the required three years pursuant to 29 C.F.R. [\u00a7 ] 825.500.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 14. Howard argues that this 2008 form provided sufficient certification to excuse his absences in the spring of 2005. Inova responds that contrary to Howard\u2019s contention, it does have the 2003 form that Howard submitted. Inova also points out that its policy, consistent with 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.308, entitles it to request recertification of an FMLA-qualifying chronic condition every 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Howard\u2019s argument is not persuasive. Regardless of whether Inova failed to retain Howard\u2019s 2003 FMLA form for three years as required by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.500(b), that regulation does not require an employer to consider FMLA documentation as effective for three years. To the contrary, as Inova points out, an employer may request recertification of a chronic or \u201cpermanent/long-term condition!;] under continuing supervision of a health care provider\u201d at least every 30 days, \u201cin connection with an absence by the employee.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.308(a); <em>see also Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., </em>257 F.3d 373, 383 (4th Cir.2001) (\u201cAn employer has discretion to require that an employee\u2019s leave request \u2018be supported by a certification issued by the health care provider of the employee.\u2019\u201d (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2613(a)) (punctuation omitted)). Although Howard ultimately submitted a Certification of Health Care Provider form from Dr. Dade on May 31, 2005 and received approval for leave on a going-forward basis from March 29, 2005 to March 28, 2006, he points to no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>evidence in the record showing that he submitted such a form or the necessary leave requests to excuse his nine absences in the spring of 2005. The lack of FMLA documentation for his absences in 2005 is especially apparent in light of the extensive documentation he provided in 2002 and 2003 to excuse numerous absences due to his car accidents. <em>See </em>J.A. 597-602, 604-013. The record does not support a fact issue as to whether Inova improperly disciplined Howard for his absences in the spring of 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Howard argues that Inova wrongfully terminated his employment for failure to provide fitness-for-duty certificates because Inova improperly required certificates from two doctors. He also contends that Inova improperly sought more than \u201ca simple statement\u201d as required by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.310(c). Howard notes that Inova required Howard to ask his doctors to review a job description and to provide additional information about his condition. He points out that the DOL found Dr. Lawrence\u2019s September 15, 2005 letter, which stated that Howard could \u201creturn to appropriate work around the end of this month,\u201d J.A. 158, to be an adequate fitness-for-duty certification. <em>See generally </em>J.A. 1154-68, 1195-96. In addition, Howard argues that \u201c[w]hen an employee is terminated prior to the conclusion of his 12 weeks of FMLA leave, the termination violates the FMLA.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Reply Br. at 4. He asserts that he was still eligible for FMLA leave that would have lasted until October 19, 2005, such that Inova\u2019s termination of his employment on October 17, 2005 violated the FMLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">In response, Inova argues that Howard failed to submit any fitness-for-duty certification, despite written requests on August 26, September 8, and September 28, 2005. Citing <em>Bloom v. Metro Heart Group of St. Louis, Inc., </em>440 F.3d 1025, 1030 (8th Cir.2006), Inova argues that Dr. Lawrence\u2019s letter was \u201ctoo vague and conditional\u201d to serve as a fitness-for-duty certification. Respondent\u2019s Br. at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\"><em>Bloom </em>is inapposite to this case. The <em>Bloom </em>court considered a diagnostic report from a non-treating physician that the employer had paid to examine the employee during her absence from work. When she wished to resume work, the employee had asked her two treating physicians to complete a fitness-for-duty certificate, but neither returned the form to her. As a result, she relied on the diagnosing physician\u2019s earlier report as \u201cequivalent to a fitness-for-duty certificate.\u201d <em>Bloom, </em>440 F.3d at 1030. The Eighth Circuit found this report to be \u201ctoo vague and conditional to constitute a statement that [the employee] was fit-for-duty.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Unlike the diagnostic report in <em>Bloom, </em>Dr. Lawrence\u2019s letter in this case was clearly intended to convey information to Inova about Howard\u2019s ability to return to work. The Sixth Circuit has held that a \u201cfitness-for-duty certification need only state that the employee can return to work.\u201d <em>Brumbalough v. Camelot Care Ctrs., Inc., </em>427 F.3d 996, 1003 (6th Cir.2005). The <em>Brumbalough </em>court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">While the employer may require more information, the regulation clearly states that the employer cannot delay reinstating the employee simply because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>employer is obtaining further information or clarification from the employee\u2019s health care provider....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">This view is bolstered by the fact that the FMLA and accompanying regulations lay out in specific detail what must be included in an initial medical certification, whereas the regulations expressly state that only a simple statement is needed in a fitness-for-duty certification. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">Accordingly, we hold that once an employee submits a statement from her health care provider which indicates that she may return to work, the employer\u2019s duty to reinstate her has been triggered under the FMLA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">427 F.3d at 1003-04 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">This circuit has not yet addressed what constitutes an adequate fitness-for-duty certification under the FMLA, but we need not reach this issue because Inova properly terminated Howard\u2019s employment under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.311. Section 825.311 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">When requested by the employer pursuant to a uniformly applied policy for similarly-situated employees, the employee must provide medical certification <em>at the time the employee seeks reinstatement at the end of FMLA leave </em>taken for the employee\u2019s serious health condition, that the employee is fit for duty and able to return to work if the employer has provided the required notice. ... <em>In this situation, unless the employee provides either a fitness-for-duty certification or a new medical certification for a serious health condition at the time FMLA leave is concluded, the employee may be terminated.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.311(c) (emphases added) (citations omitted). Under this section, Inova was entitled to terminate Howard\u2019s employment because he had not provided a fitness-for-duty certification or a new medical certification when his August 2005 FMLA leave expired.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The record shows that Inova approved Howard\u2019s request \u201cfor intermittent leave,\u201d which \u201cbegan on August 11, 2005 and will end on August 26, 2005.\u201d J.A. 679 (emphasis omitted). Inova expected Howard to resume work on August 29, 2005, <em>see </em>J.A. 659, and informed Howard that he needed to provide a fitness-for-duty certificate before returning to work, <em>see </em>J.A. 679. However, Howard did not return to work on August 29, 2005, and in fact did not attempt to return to work until October 3, 2005. Although Dr. Lawrence sent a September 15, 2005 letter stating that Howard could re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>turn to work \u201caround the end of this month,\u201d J.A. 158, nothing in the record shows that Howard submitted proper medical certification and sought reinstatement <em>at the end of his approved FMLA leave. </em>Under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.311(c), Inova was entitled to terminate Howard\u2019s employment because Howard had provided neither \u201ca fitness-for-duty certification\u201d nor a \u201cnew medical certification for a serious health condition at the time [his approved] FMLA leave [was] concluded.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Howard has not shown that a fact issue exists as to whether Inova\u2019s termination of his employment violated the FMLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In his retaliation claim, Howard asserts that Inova retaliated against him for exercising his rights under the FMLA by disciplining him for unexcused absences, transferring him to an alternative position that exacerbated his PTSD, and terminating his employment \u201cbefore his 12 weeks of medical leave was concluded.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Reply Br. at 7-9. His briefs focus on the alleged retaliatory transfer to the supply distribution tech position. He emphasizes that Inova transferred him to a position near the OR knowing that his PTSD could be triggered. He further contends that Williams and Quick, in conjunction with other Inova HR personnel, decided to leave Howard in the alternative position after learning of his EEOC complaint, even after both Howard and an old supervisor, Kavros, told them he should not be working around the OR.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">In response, Inova points out that Quick informed Howard of his transfer to the supply distribution tech position on June 15, 2005, and that Howard reported for work on June 23, 2005 with a note stating that Howard was \u201cfit to return to duty\u201d as long as he could \u201cavoid unnecessary stress\u201d if possible. <em>See </em>J.A. 126. Inova highlights that Howard returned to work \u201cwith full knowledge of his working environment,\u201d but the note failed to advise Inova of any problem Howard might have with his proximity to the OR. Respondent\u2019s Br. at 38-39. Inova further asserts that it did not receive \u201cnotice that Howard may have been in proximity to blood or other PTSD-triggering stimuli in his alternate position until July 12, 2005 at the earliest, and there was doubt as to whether this was true or not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39. Inova argues that \u201cas soon as Inova had confirmation that Howard had concerns about being exposed to blood, he was transferred to another position.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">We have held that \u201cFMLA claims arising under the retaliation theory are analogous to those derived under Title VII and so are analyzed under the burden-shifting framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green </em>[411 U.S. 792, 800-06, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)].\u201d <em>Yashenko v. Harrah\u2019s N.C. Casino Co., LLC, </em>446 F.3d 541, 550-51 (4th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). A plaintiff \u201cmust make a prima facie showing that he \u2018engaged in protected activity, that the employer took adverse action against him, and that the adverse action was causally connected to the plaintiffs protected activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551 (quoting <em>Cline v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>144 F.3d 294, 301 (4th Cir.1998)). If the plaintiff \u201cestablishes a prima facie case of retaliation\u201d and the employer \u201coffers \u2018a nondiscriminatory explanation\u2019 for his termination,\u201d the plaintiff \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is pretext for FMLA retaliation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Nichols v. Ashland </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>Hosp. Corp., </em>251 F.3d 496, 502 (4th Cir. 2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Applying this analysis, the district court found that Howard had failed to establish a prima facie retaliation claim because his transfer to the supply distribution tech position \u201cwas consistent with both FMLA regulations and Inova\u2019s Family and Medical Leave policy\u201d and did not constitute an \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> J.A. 77. The court held that even if the transfer did qualify as an adverse employment action, \u201cInova has met its burden of establishing a non-discriminatory reason for the transfer\u201d and Howard failed to offer \u201cany evidence of pretext.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Howard has not shown a prima facie retaliation claim. Although he argues that Inova transferred him to and retained him in the supply distribution tech position in bad faith, he has not identified evidence in the record to create a fact issue on this point. As noted above, the most recent documentation in Inova\u2019s files relating to Howard\u2019s PTSD dated from 2001. All the FMLA documentation that Howard had submitted in the three years preceding the recurrence of his PTSD related to his back problems. Although Howard missed a week of work due to \u201cdebilitating stress,\u201d when he returned the note from his health care provider did not state that Howard\u2019s PTSD had recurred or that he needed to avoid exposure to blood. Howard admitted in his deposition that he did not inform anyone at Inova about most of the dissociative episodes he experienced while working in the OR. J.A. 432-34. The record also shows that he did not submit FMLA certification of his PTSD until August 10, 2005. Howard has not shown that a fact issue exists as to whether Inova\u2019s decision to transfer him was retaliatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Howard has failed to establish a fact issue as to either his interference or retaliation claims. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Inova.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Howard also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his leave to dismiss his complaint without prejudice or, in the alternative, to amend his complaint. The denial of a motion to dismiss without prejudice is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Andes v. Versant Corp., </em>788 F.2d 1033, 1035 (4th Cir.1986). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2), a court may dismiss an action \u201cat the plaintiffs request only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper.\u201d The denial of a motion for leave to amend a complaint is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Franks v. Ross, </em>313 F.3d 184, 192 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>HCMF Corp. v. Allen, </em>238 F.3d 273, 276-77 (4th Cir.2001)). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2), \u201ca court should freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">Howard argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss his complaint without prejudice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2). The purpose of Rule 41(a)(2) is \u201cto allow voluntary dismissals unless the parties will be unfairly prejudiced.\u201d <em>Davis v. USX Corp., </em>819 F.2d 1270, 1273 (4th Cir.1987) (citations omitted). In deciding a motion to dismiss without prejudice under Rule 41(a), \u201ca district court should consider fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>tors such as \u2018the opposing party\u2019s effort and expense in preparing for trial, excessive delay and lack of diligence on the part of the movant, and insufficient explanation of the need for a voluntary dismissal,\u2019 as well as the present stage of litigation.\u201d <em>Miller v. Terramite Corp., </em>114 Fed.Appx. 586, 540 (4th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Phillips USA, Inc., v. Allflex USA, Inc., </em>77 F.3d 354, 358 (10th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Howard argues on appeal that granting his motion to dismiss without prejudice would not have prejudiced Inova. He asserts that Inova\u2019s efforts \u201cin this litigation need not be repeated in any future case\u201d because he has \u201cstipulated that any discovery shall be admissible in a future proceeding.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 22. He also contends that there was no excessive delay on his part and points out that Inova \u201cdelayed producing important discovery until the last week of discovery and even beyond the discovery period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In response, Inova notes that Howard filed his motion to dismiss two weeks before trial and asserts that it incurred substantial expense in preparing for trial. Citing <em>Andes, </em>788 F.2d at 1036-37, and related cases, Inova points out that \u201cthe expenses of discovery and preparation of a motion for summary judgment may constitute prejudice sufficient to support denial of a voluntary dismissal.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Br. at 47. Inova further argues that Howard was not diligent in pursuing his claims in this case and notes that in the initial discovery period, Howard\u2019s discovery efforts consisted of one set of interrogatories and document requests issued at the beginning of the period. Inova moved to extend the discovery deadline until April 6, 2007, because of alleged deficiencies in Howard\u2019s discovery responses. Howard only attempted to depose Inova\u2019s corporate representative on April 3, 2007, four days before the close of extended discovery. During this deposition, Howard made additional document requests based on the deponent\u2019s responses, and Inova complied. Inova stresses that it never withheld any nonprivileged responsive information from Howard at any time. In addition, Inova highlights that Howard did not file his motion to dismiss until more than three weeks after discovery closed, and after Inova had filed its summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Our jurisprudence on the issue of what constitutes sufficient prejudice to a nonmovant to support denial of a motion for voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a)(2) is not free from ambiguity. In <em>Davis, </em>we noted that \u201c[i]t is well established that, for purposes of Rule 41(a)(2), prejudice to the defendant does not result from the prospect of a second lawsuit\u201d or \u201cthe possibility that the plaintiff will gain a tactical advantage over the defendant in future litigation.\u201d 819 F.2d at 1274-75. Similarly, in <em>Fidelity Bank PLC v. N. Fox Shipping N.V., </em>we held that \u201cthe mere filing of a motion for summary judgment is not, without more, a basis for refusing to dismiss without prejudice.\u201d 242 Fed.Appx. 84, 89 (4th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Andes, </em>788 F.2d 1033, 1036 n. 4 (internal quotations and alterations omitted)). However, we have also found on multiple occasions that a district court does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for voluntary dismissal if the case has advanced to the summary judgment stage and the parties have incurred substantial costs in discovery. <em>See, e.g., Miller, </em>114 Fed.Appx. at 540 (affirming district court\u2019s decision that plaintiffs motion for voluntary dismissal was \u201cuntimely and would waste judicial resources\u201d because the motion was filed well after discovery had closed and a dis-positive order was imminent); <em>Francis v. Ingles, </em>1 Fed.Appx. 152, 154 (4th Cir.2001) (affirming district court\u2019s denial of motion to dismiss without prejudice be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>cause the \u201cplaintiff s motion came after a lengthy discovery period and merely one week before the scheduled trial date\u201d and because \u201cthe motivation for the motion appeared to be to circumvent\u201d a discovery ruling, which counsel could have avoided \u201cby deposing the witness within the discovery period\u201d); <em>Skinner v. First Am. Bank of Va., </em>64 F.3d 659, 1995 WL 507264, at *2-3 (4th Cir.1995) (stating that \u201c[t]he expenses of discovery and preparation of a motion for summary judgment may constitute prejudice sufficient to support denial of a voluntary dismissal\u201d and noting that granting a motion to dismiss is not required to allow a party to \u201cavoid an adverse ruling in federal court\u201d); <em>Sullivan v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>848 F.2d 186, 1988 WL 54059, at *2 (4th Cir.1988) (\u201cGiven the advanced stage of the proceedings, the district court\u2019s denial of [the plaintiffs] motion was not an abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">We conclude that Howard has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to dismiss without prejudice on these facts. The posture of this case is similar to that in <em>Andes </em>in which the court noted that the case did not present \u201cextreme prejudice to defendants,\u201d but nevertheless was \u201cmore advanced than a number of cases ... in which voluntary dismissal was held proper.\u201d 788 F.2d at 1036 (collecting cases). The defendants in <em>Andes </em>asserted that they had incurred significant expenses engaging in discovery and filing motions for summary judgment. The <em>Andes </em>court found that under the circumstances, \u201cthere was a sufficient basis for denying [the plaintiffs] Rule 41(a)(2) motion and thus we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to dismiss without prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1036-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In this case, the record fails to support Howard\u2019s explanation of the need for voluntary dismissal. Howard asserts that Inova\u2019s document production late in the discovery period revealed that Inova\u2019s reasons for transferring Howard were pretextual. He argues that \u201c[t]his showing of pretext warrants Plaintiff being allowed to join his FMLA claim with his ADA claim that he requested a right to sue letter from the EEOC on.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 23. As Howard\u2019s brief and the record show, however, Howard was well aware of the possibility of an ADA claim before he filed his complaint in this case. He filed an EEOC charge alleging an ADA violation on June 27, 2005. He filed his complaint alleging only his FMLA claims on August 24, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In addition, the record shows that Howard was not diligent in conducting the discovery that he asserts led to the new information that supports his motion for voluntary dismissal. Howard emphasizes that Inova was producing documents even after the close of discovery, but Inova points out that it only produced responsive documents due to Howard\u2019s last-minute requests at the end of the discovery period. Howard has not shown that Inova failed to provide responsive documents in a timely fashion related to any of his discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Given the stage of the litigation, Howard\u2019s insufficient explanation for a voluntary dismissal, and his lack of diligence in pursuing both discovery and his substantive claims, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding a \u201csufficient basis\u201d to deny Howard\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice. <em>Andes, </em>788 F.2d at 1036-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Howard also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to amend. Under Rule 15, the district court may grant a motion to amend the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>plaint \u201cwhen justice so requires.\u201d A district court does not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend if there is \u201cundue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party ..., futility of amendment, etc.\u201d <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Howard argues that he should be allowed to add an ADA claim based on the evidence that Inova produced toward the end of discovery, which Howard asserts supports his argument that Inova\u2019s reasons for transferring him were pretextual. Inova argues in response that Howard unduly delayed in moving to amend his complaint to add his ADA claims, noting that Howard could have requested a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC at any time after December 24, 2005 and that he did not seek to amend his complaint until almost two years after he filed his EEOC charge. Inova also contends that to allow amendment would prejudice Inova due to the advanced stage of the litigation and the different theories of recovery an ADA claim would involve.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">We have noted that \u201c[ajmendments near the time of trial may be particularly disruptive, and may therefore be subject to special scrutiny.\u201d <em>Deasy v. Hill, </em>833 F.2d 38, 41 (4th Cir.1987) (citation omitted). The <em>Deasy </em>court found that \u201ca motion to amend should be made as soon as the necessity for altering the pleading becomes apparent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 6 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 1488 (1971)). In this case, Howard has not shown that his proposed amendment to add an ADA claim resulted from the discovery of new facts that prompted his motion to amend. To the contrary, the record shows that Howard was aware of the possibility of an ADA claim almost a year before he filed his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">In ruling from the bench on Howard\u2019s motion to dismiss -without prejudice or to amend, the district court noted that \u201c[tjhis EEOC matter was a matter that had been known about. And while there was perhaps some information that came late, I don\u2019t believe there is any showing that that\u2019s a groundbreaking piece of information by any means.\u201d JA. 29. The district court did not abuse its discretion in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">We affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny Howard\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice or, in the alternative, to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">Lastly, Howard appeals the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss his ADA claim as barred by <em>res judicata. </em>We review de novo an order granting a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Giarratano v. Johnson, </em>521 F.3d 298, 302 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">Howard argues that Inova now \u201cseeks to benefit from the repose granted by res judicata when the facts demonstrate that in the FMLA case the facts that would have led to the early joinder of the ADA cause of action were withheld by the actions of [Inova].\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 25-26. He asserts that because Inova withheld critical information, his counsel \u201ccould not effectively question Williams\u201d or \u201cassert the ADA claim early in the previous litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">Inova argues that the elements for <em>res judicata </em>are satisfied because the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of Inova is a final judgment on the merits; the parties are identical in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>both actions; and the claims in both actions arise out of the same core of operative facts. Inova points out that Howard does not challenge the district court\u2019s <em>res judicata </em>analysis on appeal, but instead relies on his argument that Inova withheld critical evidence. Inova reiterates its assertion that it timely provided responsive documents to all Howard\u2019s discovery requests and did not withhold information.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u201cFor the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>to be applicable, there must be: (1) a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit; (2) an identity of the cause of action in both the earlier and the later suit; and (3) an identity of parties or their privies in the two suits.\u201d <em>Martin v. Am. Bancorporation Retirement Plan, </em>407 F.3d 643, 650 (4th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Pueschel v. United States, </em>369 F.3d 345, 354-55 (4th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The district court did not err in dismissing Howard\u2019s ADA claim as barred by <em>res judicata. </em>Quoting <em>Peugeot Motors of America, Inc. v. Eastern Auto Distributors, Inc., </em>892 F.2d 355, 359 (4th Cir.1989), the district court noted that <em>res judicata </em>not only \u201cbar[s] claims that were raised and fully litigated,\u201d but also \u201cprevents litigation of all grounds for, or defenses to, recovery that were previously available to the parties, regardless of whether they were asserted or determined in the prior proceeding.\u201d J.A 85. The district court found that Howard\u2019s ADA claims \u201cclearly rely on the same factual circumstances on which he relied in his prior FMLA claim, namely Defendant Inova\u2019s decision to transfer [Howard] to a post in the hospital that exposed him to blood and the smell of burnt flesh.\u201d J.A. 86. The record bears out this conclusion. As noted above, Howard filed an EEOC charge of discrimination asserting an ADA violation well before he filed his original complaint asserting FMLA violations arising out of the same core facts. Howard could have brought his ADA claim in his original complaint, but chose not to. \u201cBroadly speaking, a party always has the option or election of raising fewer than all the potential theories of relief that might be available.

The rest of the form, which stated that Howard needed to work a reduced schedule for an unknown duration of time, was written in another person\u2019s handwriting. Howard admitted that he filled out most of the form and asserted in his deposition that his physician, Dr. Rodney Dade, authorized him to do so.

The record contains conflicting evidence as to what duties Howard performed in his new position. Williams\u2019s personal notes reflect that on August 4, 2005, Julie Quick asked Howard to \u201cclean out a break room of supplies,\" but that Howard refused to do so unless the request was put in writing. J.A. 1493. Despite further negotiations between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Quick and Howard, Williams\u2019s notes state that Howard continued to refuse to perform any duties in response to verbal requests. Howard\u2019s brief states that he was \"required to clean out a storage room that had not been cleaned in years\u201d and that this room \"contained materials that exacerbated his PTSD.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 13-14. In his deposition, Howard testified that Inova \"moved [him] to a warehouse position where [he] worked by [him]self ... to clean out a warehouse which [he] was told by a personnel that worked in perioperative service no one had been in from anywhere from five to six years.\u201d J.A. 448. The tasks of cleaning the \u201cbreak room,\u201d \"storage room,\u201d and \"warehouse\" appear to be the same.

Howard argues that he still had additional FMLA leave at the time Inova terminated his employment and that this termination \"violates the FMLA\u201d because it occurred \"prior to the conclusion of his 12 weeks of FMLA leave.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Reply Br. at 4. Howard cites no regulation or statute to support this contention, which appears to rely on an untenable interpretation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.311(c). In requiring the employee to provide \"either a fitness-for-duty certification or a new medical certification for a serious health condition <em>at the time FMLA leave is concluded,\u201d </em>section 825.311(c) does not refer to all FMLA leave to which the employee is then entitled, as Howard seems to suggest. If it did, its requirement of a \"new medical certification for a serious health condition\u201d is nugatory, because an employee who has reached the end of all the FMLA leave to which he is entitled in a 12-month period has exhausted that leave and may not qualify for more, regardless of whether he submits a new medical certification. <em>See 29 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 825.200(a) (stating that an \"eligible employee's FMLA leave entitlement is <em>limited </em>to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-monlh period\u201d (emphasis added)). To give meaning to the entire regulation, section 825.311(c) must be interpreted to require an employee to provide a fitness-for-duty certification or a new medical certification at the time the employee\u2019s <em>scheduled, approved </em>FMLA leave-for which the employee has provided the necessary notice and certification-expires.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\">. The parties do not dispute on appeal whether Inova requested a fitness-for-duty certification from Howard \"pursuant to a uniformly applied policy for similarly-situated employees.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.311(c); <em>see also 29 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 825.310(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\">. The district court also noted that insofar as Howard argued that Inova wrongly disciplined him for absenteeism and tardiness, Inova properly considered Howard\u2019s absences unexcused because of his failure to provide FMLA certification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
