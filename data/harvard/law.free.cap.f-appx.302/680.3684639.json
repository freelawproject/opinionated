We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Husyev v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir.2008), and de novo claims of due process violations, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The record does not compel the conclusion that changed circumstances or extraordinary circumstances excused the untimely filing of Herwanto\u2019s asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D); <em>see also Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 648, 657-58 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding of no past persecution because Herwanto\u2019s experiences do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003). Furthermore, even if the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004) applies to withholding of removal claims, Herwanto has not established a clear probability of future persecution. <em>See Hoxha, </em>319 F.3d at 1184-85. Lastly, the record does not compel the conclusion that Herwanto demonstrated a pattern or practice of persecution against ethnic Chinese Christians. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1180-81 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to Herwanto\u2019s withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Herwanto has forfeited any challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not supported by argument in opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">To the extent Herwanto contends that his due process rights were violated, we reject this contention because he has j failed to demonstrate prejudice. <em>See Colmenar, </em>210 F.3d at 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b707-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
