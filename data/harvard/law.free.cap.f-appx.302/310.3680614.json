In the written judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ment, the district court stated the \u201cNature of Offense\u201d as \u201cAlien Unlawfully Found in the United States After Deportation, Having Been Previously Convicted of an Aggravated Felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The sole argument Gonzalez presents on appeal is that the written judgment, by indicating that he was convicted of the \u00a7 1326 offense of being unlawfully found in the United States, erroneously describes the \u00a7 1326 offense to which he pleaded guilty, which was attempted reentry. The Government concedes that there is a clerical error in the judgment and that the case should be remanded for the sole purpose of correcting the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">After the parties filed their initial briefs, the district court entered an amended judgment for the purpose of correcting the error. The amended judgment states that the \u201cNature of Offense\u201d is \u201cAttempted Illegal Re-entry into the United States After Deportation, Having Been Previously Convicted of an Aggravated Felony.\u201d Thus, the amended judgment correctly reflects the offense of conviction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1326(a)(2); <em>United States v. Angeles-Mascote, </em>206 F.3d 529, 531-32 (5th Cir.2000). As the amended judgment provides the sole relief that Gonzalez seeks, the appeal is moot. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>193 F.3d 845, 847 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
