In his complaint, Weatherspoon alleged that various officials affiliated with the Corrections Corporation of America-Delta Correctional Facility and the Mississippi Department of Corrections tampered with his mail. Weatherspoon specifically alleged that his legal mail, which was sealed and properly stamped, was improperly returned to him on the ground that it had not been processed in accordance with prison regulations. Weatherspoon argued that the defendants\u2019 actions denied him access to the courts and violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-24\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Weatherspoon is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. </em>Taylor; 117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3). For the reasons detailed below, Weather-spoon\u2019s motion for IFP is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-25\">A prison official\u2019s interference with a prisoner\u2019s legal mail may violate the prisoner\u2019s constitutional right of access to the courts. <em>Brewer v. Wilkinson, </em>3 F.3d 816, 820 (5th Cir.1993). However, to state a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>claim based on delay or interference with the mail, a plaintiff must show actual injury. <em>See Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998). In this context, an inmate shows an actual injury by establishing that \u201chis position as a litigant was prejudiced\u201d due to the disputed acts. <em>Walker v. Navarro County Jail, </em>4 F.3d 410, 413 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Weatherspoon has not alleged that he suffered any actual prejudice due to the defendants\u2019 purported interference with his mail. His claim that he was denied access to the courts therefore does not involve legal points arguable on their merits. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Accordingly, this portion of the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">However, although Weatherspoon alleged in his \u00a7 1983 complaint that the defendants\u2019 actions interfered with his right to be free from an illegal search and seizure, the district court failed to address whether Weatherspoon had stated a claim under the Fourth Amendment. Consequently, the district court\u2019s conclusion that Weatherspoon\u2019s complaint did not form a basis for relief, and its resulting certification that Weatherspoon\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal was not taken in good faith, were erroneous. Whether the facts ultimately establish a Fourth Amendment claim is not a question to be answered at this stage of the proceedings. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Weatherspoon\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim is VACATED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">MOTION FOR IFP GRANTED; AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
