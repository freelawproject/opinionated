Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. EliasZacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Khachatryan failed to demonstrate that her experiences in Armenia rose to the level of persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-18 (9th Cir.2003). In addition, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Khachatryan\u2019s fear of future persecution is undermined because her similarly situated husband remains in Armenia and continues to practice their religion unharmed. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, Khachatryan\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Khachatryan\u2019s contention that the IJ\u2019s decision was inconsistent with the BIA\u2019s March 8, 2004 decision because she did not raise it before the BIA. <em>See Zara v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 927, 930-31 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The portions of Khachatryan\u2019s opening brief regarding her membership in a particular social group and disfavored group status, state facts not present in the instant case and appear to have been cut and pasted from another petitioner\u2019s brief. We do not review these contentions as they are not based on the facts of Khachatryan\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">Because Khachatryan did not establish asylum eligibility, it necessarily follows that she did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">Khachatryan\u2019s counsel is cautioned that his opening brief does not meet this court\u2019s standards. <em>See generally </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28; 9th Cir. R. 28-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
