Mo-race, which denied, <em>inter alia, </em>their application for relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Hong Yun Qiu-Qiu, Hong Xing Qiu, </em>Nos. A98720-431, A97-959-093 (B.I.A. March 13, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>Nos. A98-720-431, A97-959093 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 9, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-16\">When \u201cthe BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and merely supplements the IJ\u2019s decision,\u201d this Court reviews \u201cthe decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA.\u201d <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-17\">Because petitioners only challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief before the BIA and this Court, petitioners have abandoned any other claims. <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-18\">We find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 applications for CAT relief. We have held that, without any particularized evidence, applicants cannot demonstrate that they are more likely than not to be tortured \u201cbased <em>solely </em>on the fact that [they are] part of the large class of persons who have illegally departed China\u201d and on general<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ized evidence concerning conditions in Chinese prisons. <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Pierre v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 109, 118-19 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that beyond evidence of inhumane prison conditions, a CAT claimant must provide some evidence that the authorities act with the specific intent to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering on those detained).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Here, petitioners provided no basis for the IJ to conclude that they, or someone in their \u201cparticular alleged circumstances,\u201d face an elevated risk of persecution or torture. <em>See Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 (2d Cir.2003). Petitioners rely on the State Department Reports, but these documents do not provide evidence that individuals similarly situated to them are imprisoned and tortured. Moreover, petitioners did not testify that they knew any individuals who were imprisoned or tortured for illegally departing China, and merely stated that they had \u201cheard of many people\u201d who had been mistreated in detention, and that \u201ceverybody in the world knows\u201d that prisoners in China are mistreated. (Hearing Transcript, May 9, 2006, at 19, 26.) Therefore, as petitioners failed to provide the particularized evidence necessary to demonstrate eligibility for CAT relief, <em>see Mu Xiang Lin, </em>432 F.3d at 160, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that they failed to meet their burden of proof. <em>See Mu-Xing Wang, </em>320 F.3d at 143-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We note that petitioners allege in addition that they will suffer torture at the hands of unidentified \u201ccreditors,\u201d from whom they borrowed money. This bare allegation does not change the result here, however, as the agency reasonably concluded that in the absence of sufficient evidence demonstrating that any individuals would torture them, and that Chinese officials would acquiesce in such torture, petitioners failed to meet their burden of establishing that it is more likely than not that they will be tortured if removed to China. <em>See Mu-Xing Wang, </em>320 F.3d at 143-44. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that petitioners failed to meet their burden of proof for their CAT claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
