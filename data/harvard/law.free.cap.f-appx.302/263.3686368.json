Mayes contends that the district court erred under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), in sentencing him because it calculated his offense level by applying the guidelines provision for cocaine base rather than powder cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-23\">The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance, arguing that the appeal is barred by the waiver-of-appeal provision in Mayes\u2019s plea agreement. Alternatively, the Government seeks an extension of time to file a merits brief. Our review of the record shows that Mayes\u2019s appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary and that, under the plain language of the plea agreement, the waiver applies to the circumstances at hand. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005). Therefore, Mayes\u2019s appeal waiver bars review of the issue he seeks to raise on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-24\">After counsel filed his brief, Mayes moved to relieve his counsel and for appointment of substitute counsel. \u201cCounsel may be relieved upon a showing that there is a conflict of interest or other most pressing circumstances or that the interests of justice otherwise require relief of counsel.\u201d Fifth Circuit Plan Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Criminal Justice Act, \u00a7 5(B). Mayes has not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED. Mayes\u2019s motion to relieve appointed counsel and to appoint new counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
