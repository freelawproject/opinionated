In No. 05-7138, Kissi appeals the district court\u2019s detention order entered in May 2005. In Nos. 05-7205/7212, Kissi appeals from a district court order denying fifteen pending motions. Our review of the record with respect to these appeals discloses no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Kissi, </em>No. 8:05-cr-00254 (D. Md. May 27, 2005; July 26, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Appeal 07-4916 is Kissi\u2019s direct criminal appeal. Kissi\u2019s appellate counsel claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek an expert witness to testify regarding Kissi\u2019s mental disorders. To allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant must ordinarily bring a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West 2006 and Supp. 2008) motion unless it conclusively appears on the face of the record that counsel provided inadequate assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). We find that the record does not establish ineffective representa-</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">tion. We have also reviewed the claims raised by Kissi in his supplemental pro se brief and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Kissi\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
