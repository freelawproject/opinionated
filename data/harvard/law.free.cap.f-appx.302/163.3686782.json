The district court denied the motion on the grounds that (1) the court lacked jurisdiction to further reduce the sentence which had already been reduced under Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(b) for Chamblee\u2019s substantial assistance and (2) the court had already considered the substance of the Amendments when granting the Rule 35 motion. Without further analysis of the district court\u2019s holding, we conclude that application of the amendments would not change Chamblee\u2019s pre-departure offense level or Guidelines range. Accordingly, a reduction in sentence under \u00a7 3582 was not appropriate. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 (a)(2)(B), p.s. (2007 &amp; Supp.2008). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Chamblee\u2019s motion for reduction of his sentence. We deny Chamblee\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and reconsideration. We grant his motion to amend his informal brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
