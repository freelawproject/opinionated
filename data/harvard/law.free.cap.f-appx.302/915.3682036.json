Peake, </em>No. 08-210, 2008 WL 1902504, at *1 (Vet.App. Apr. 22, 2008). Because we lack jurisdiction to review Ms. Winsett\u2019s appeal, we <em>dismiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-18\">Ms. Winsett appeals the CAVC failure to address the decision by the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (hereinafter \u201cBoard\u201d) not to remove the field examiner\u2019s report from Ms. Winsett\u2019s claims folder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s Br. 1. The government contends that this court lacks jurisdiction over this appeal because Ms. Winsett \u201cdoes not raise any constitutional issue, any issue concerning a decision of the Veterans Court on a rule of law, or any issue concerning the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation relied upon by the CAVC in dismissing her appeal.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 7-8. We agree that this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-19\">This court must first determine whether or not it has jurisdiction over an appeal. <em>C.R. Bard, Inc. v. Schwartz, </em>716 F.2d 874, 877 (Fed.Cir.1983). Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals of CAVC decisions. Except to the extent that an appeal presents a constitutional issue, we may not \u201creview (A) a challenge to a factual determination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2); <em>Flores v. Nicholson, </em>476 F.3d 1379, 1381 (Fed.Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">The CAVC dismissed Ms. Winsett\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction because no final decision had been entered by the Board. <em>Winsett, </em>2008 WL 1902504, at *1; <em>In re Quigley, </em>1 Vet.App. 1 (1990) (holding that a claimant may not obtain review of the Board\u2019s decision by the CAVC until that decision is final). In order to reverse the CAVC\u2019s dismissal of Ms. Winsett\u2019s case for lack of jurisdiction, this court would be required to find that the Board\u2019s decision was final. In <em>Fisher v. Gober, </em>this court held that a determination by the CAVC, that the Board had not entered a final decision, requires an application of the law to the facts of a case. 251 F.3d 167 (Fed.Cir.2000). Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2), this court lacks jurisdiction to review the CAVC\u2019s application of law to the facts of a case where, as here, the Appellant has not submitted any challenge to a statutory or constitutional issue. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cWe are barred by our jurisdictional statute from considering whether error has occurred in the application of unchallenged law to the facts of a case.\u201d). Thus, this court is without jurisdiction to consider Ms. Winsett\u2019s appeal from the CAVC\u2019s dismissal of her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Ms. Winsett\u2019s brief on appeal also raises allegations unrelated to the CAVC\u2019s decision to dismiss her appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Specifically, Ms. Winsett contends that her due process rights were violated due to the Regional Office\u2019s failure to notify her of the field examiner\u2019s report prior to submitting the report into the record. We note that the CAVC decision, however, did not decide any constitutional issues. Moreover, Ms. Winsett\u2019s characterization of a question as constitutional in nature does not confer upon us jurisdiction that we otherwise lack. <em>See Helfer v. West, </em>174 F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed.Cir.1999). Therefore, Ms. Winsett\u2019s undeveloped constitutional argument is insufficient to provide a basis for this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Because we lack jurisdiction to review Ms. Winsett\u2019s appeal, it is dismissed. No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-15\">. Ms. Winsett also raises two other arguments for the first time on appeal. First, Ms. Win-sett argues that \u201cthe Secretary has obstructed justice by reporting to the Court [tjhat no decision has been made by the Board on that date [January 31, 2008]. This has violated Due [P]rocess rights of the Appellant to her first amendment right under our Constitution to redress.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Nov. 13, 2008 Mem. 1. Secondly, Ms. Winsett alleges that the CAVC erred by accepting documents under Rule 46 without determining whether a proper notice of appearance had been filed. However, Ms. Winsett failed to raise these issues in her answer to the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss, her motion for reconsideration, or her motion for reconsideration by the full CAVC. It is well-settled law that appellants may not raise new issues on appeal. <em>Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976). Therefore, this court cannot review Ms. Winsett\u2019s arguments because she did not raise these issues at any time during the proceedings below.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
