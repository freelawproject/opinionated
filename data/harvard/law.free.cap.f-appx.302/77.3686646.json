Siler, Jr. Circuit Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b104-12\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"AWc\">McKee, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">Bernard Fields appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to modify his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). For the reasons set forth below, we will vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Fields\u2019 motion, and remand for reconsideration of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-17\">As we write only for the parties who are familiar with this case, a detailed discussion of the factual and procedural history is not necessary. We exercise plenary review of the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 570 (3d Cir.2007) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-18\">Fields makes numerous arguments in challenging the validity of his sentence, but his central claim is that the district court erred in concluding that Amendment 599 of the Sentencing Guidelines did not affect his sentence. Amendment 599 reduced the applicable sentencing range from life imprisonment to 324-405 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-19\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), allows a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when the applicable sentencing range is lowered by subsequent amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines if the Sentencing Commission intended the amendment to be applied retroactively pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See United States v. McBride, </em>283 F.3d 612, 614 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-20\">In imposing the sentence here, the district court considered the offense characteristic of possessing a firearm pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). To its credit, the government now concedes that \u201cthe court should not impose a specific offense characteristic for possession of a firearm in calculating the guideline range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>for the underlying drug trafficking offense.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 12. The government initially \u201cargued that this principle was not applicable in Fields\u2019 case,\u201d because the enhancement was not based on the firearm involved in the offense of conviction. <em>Id. </em>However, the government now candidly concedes that, based on \u201ca careful examination of the applicable law,\u201d that fact \u201cis irrelevant and ... application of the 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement in this case is inappropriate under the amended [G]uidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12-13. Rather, as the government states, \u201c[t]he district court, under 1B1.10, has discretion in determining whether to reduce the sentence to a term within [the applicable] range, and the case should be remanded for the court to make that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. <em>See United States v. Knobloch, </em>131 F.3d 366, 373 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Fields also argues that he should have the benefit of the holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), on remand. The government argues that we rejected this argument when we held that Fields could not file a second motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because <em>Booker </em>did not apply retroactively and was therefore not a basis for a new motion under \u00a7 2255. The government also argues that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because they do not constitute a \u201cfull re-sentencing,\u201d and because the policy statements of the Sentencing Commission limit the district court\u2019s discretion to a reduction that is within the newly calculated Guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">We need not discuss these arguments in detail because we have already held that resentencings pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are limited to applying the retroactive Guideline. <em>See McBride, </em>283 F.3d at 615 (a reduction in sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a full re-sentencing and the district court did not err in limiting its consideration to the effect of a sentencing amendment rather than considering an alleged <em>Apprendi </em>error). <em>See also Lloyd v. United States, </em>407 F.3d 608, 614-16 (3d Cir.2005) <em>(Booker </em>does not apply retroactively to concluded cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">For all of the above reasons, we will vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Fields\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and remand for reconsideration of an appropriate sentence within the amended Guideline range. In doing so, we note our appreciation of the government\u2019s candor. It is in the best tradition of advocacy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
