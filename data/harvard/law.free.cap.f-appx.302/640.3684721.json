We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion a denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Mendez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, </em>340 F.3d 865, 869 (9th Cir.2003), and we review de novo claims of constitutional violations, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The IJ did not abuse her discretion by denying Hehr\u2019s motion because Hehr failed to show prima facie eligibility for asylum. <em>See Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 785 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201c[A] motion to reopen will not be granted unless the respondent establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Hehr contends the IJ violated due process by not informing him of his right to apply for asylum in his own right. Hehr failed to show a due process violation by the IJ because the IJ asked if he had a fear of persecution and he answered in the negative. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error and prejudice to prevail on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b667-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
