We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">An alien may file one motion to reopen within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C) (2006); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (2008). A motion to reopen \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (2008). It \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2008); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Barry v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 741, 744 (4th Cir.2006). A denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor such motions. <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc). This court will reverse the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen only if the denial is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Barry, </em>445 F.3d at 745. \u201c[Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006). The Board\u2019s decision need only be reasoned, not convincing. <em>M. A., </em>899 F.2d at 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-18\">It is uncontroverted that the motion to reopen was untimely as it was filed more than ninety days after the Board dismissed Arcega\u2019s appeal. We find the Board did not abuse its discretion in finding that the ninety day period should not be equitably tolled. The evidence before the Board, including the letters sent by Arcega\u2019s counsel during the course of the appeal to the Board and immediately after the dismissal order was entered, does not compel a different result. We further find we are without jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s discretionary decision denying relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(iv)(III)(2006). <em>See </em>8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (2006); <em>see, e.g., Okpa v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 818, 317 (4th Cir.2001). The Board\u2019s findings that Arcega failed to show extraordinary circumstances as a result of her counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness or that her removal would cause an extreme hardship on her children were issues of fact and not law. <em>See Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 595-96 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Ignatova v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 1209, 1213 (8th Cir.2005). We further find we are without jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s decision not to sua sponte reopen the proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Tamenut v. Mukasey, </em>521 F.3d 1000, 1004 (8th Cir.2008) Accordingly, we find the record does not compel a different result and the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">We review the Board\u2019s decision to deny the motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2008). A motion for reconsideration asserts that the Board made an error in its earlier decision, <em>Turri v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 1306, 1311 n. 4 (10th Cir.1993), and requires the movant to specify the error of fact or law in the prior Board decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (2008); <em>Matter of Cerna, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 399, 402 (B.I.A.1991) (noting that a motion to reconsider questions a decision for alleged errors in appraising the facts and the law). The burden is on the movant to establish that reconsideration is warranted. <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 110, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). \u201cTo be within a mile of being granted, a motion for reconsideration has to give the tribunal to which it is addressed a reason for changing its mind.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 247, 249 (7th Cir.2004). Motions that simply repeat contentions that have already been rejected are insufficient to convince the Board to reconsider a previous decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">We find the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider. Insofar as the Board may have made a factual error concerning whether Arcega had notice of the Board\u2019s order dismissing her appeal, we find there was sufficient evidence in the record supporting the Board\u2019s decision that Arcega did not establish she did not have notice as a result of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Arcega failed to show how the Board erred as a matter of law or fact in reaching that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
