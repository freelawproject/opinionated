He was sentenced to a 41-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-24\">Moreno appeals his conviction for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment under Fed.R.Crim.P. 36, arguing that the judgment should be corrected to reflect that he was convicted of being found in the United States illegally, and not of illegal reentry, the offense that is listed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>judgment. He argues that these are distinct offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Rule 36 authorizes us to correct only clerical errors, which exist when \u201c \u2018the court intended one thing but by merely clerical mistake or oversight did another.\u2019 \u201d <em>See United States v. Steen, </em>55 F.3d 1022, 1025-26 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>DuraWood Treating Co. v. Century Forest Indus., Inc., </em>694 F.2d 112, 114 (5th Cir. 1982)). In the district court\u2019s judgment, the \u201cNature of Offense\u201d description, \u201c[i]llegal re-entry after deportation for an aggravated felony,\u201d so closely tracks the \u00a7 1326 title, \u201c[rjeentry of removed aliens,\u201d that it bears no indicia of the district court having made a mistake or oversight. The district court\u2019s judgment uses the term \u201c[ijllegal re-entry after deportation for an aggravated felony\u201d intentionally in reference to \u00a7 1326 generally; there is no clerical error. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
