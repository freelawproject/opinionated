Nov. 6, 2007); <em>In re Charan Singh Mangar, </em>No. A70 530 205 (B.I.A. Feb. 27, 2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-18\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006). We find no abuse of discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-19\">A. Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b68-20\">The BIA properly denied Man-gar\u2019s May 2007 motion to reopen as time and number barred, where it was his second such motion and it was filed almost 5 years after the BIA\u2019s final decision in his case. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). In some circumstances the time limitation may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, provided that the movant has exercised \u201cdue diligence\u201d in vindicating his or her rights. <em>See Cekic v. INS, </em>435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir.2006). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Mangar failed in his motion to establish that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>assistance of counsel claim where he failed to offer any explanation for the over five year delay in filing his motion. <em>Rashid v. Mukasey, </em>583 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir.2008) (reiterating that \u201cthe alien bears the burden of proving that he was in fact diligent ... [and] no matter how egregiously ineffective counsel\u2019s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence in pursuing his claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">B. Motion to Reconsider</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The BIA also properly denied Man-gar\u2019s December 2007 motion to reconsider. While a motion to reconsider must specify errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s decision, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1), Mangar sought to introduce new evidence in his motion to reconsider. The BIA acted within its discretion in denying a motion to reconsider that sought to remedy deficiencies in a prior motion to reopen. <em>See Jian Hui Shoo v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 168 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Finally, we are without jurisdiction to consider Mangar\u2019s argument that we should remand his case for the BIA to consider his request that it exercise its authority to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen his removal proceedings. <em>See Cyrus v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 197, 200-201 (2d Cir.2007). The BIA\u2019s decision to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority is \u201centirely discretionary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202 (citing <em>Ali, </em>448 F.3d at 518). We dismiss the petition for review to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petitions for review are DENIED in part, and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-13\">. We note that the Alien Number listed on the covers of both Petitioner's and Respondent's brief is erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
