Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Mashiri v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 1112, 1118 (9th Cir.2004), and de novo claims of due process violations, <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004). We deny in part, dismiss in part, and grant in part the petition for review, and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Prasetyo has established either changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing her untimely asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D); <em>see also Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 648, 657-58 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Further, we do not consider Winata\u2019s contention that changed and extraordinary circumstances excused his untimely asylum application because he failed to raise this issue to the BIA. <em>See Barron, </em>358 F.3d at 677-78. Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 asylum claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of Prasetyo\u2019s withholding of removal claim because she failed to establish that she was persecuted on account of a protected ground. <em>See Gormley v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir.2004). Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Prasetyo failed to establish a clear probability of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003). Lastly, we do not consider whether there is a pattern or practice of persecution of Chinese Christians in Indonesia because Prasetyo did not raise it in the opening brief. <em>See Bazuaye v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 118, 120 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam). Therefore, Prasetyo\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-16\">With respect to Winata\u2019s withholding of removal claim, substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>harm Winata experienced during the 1998 riots was not on account of a protected ground. <em>See Mashiri, </em>388 F.3d at 1121. To the contrary, the undisputed statements attributed to the rioters establish that Winata was harmed on account of his Chinese ethnicity. Accordingly, we grant the petition as to Winata\u2019s withholding of removal claim, and remand for the BIA to reconsider country conditions in Indonesia in light of the presumption of a clear probability of future persecution. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 CAT claims because they failed to show it is more likely than not that they will be tortured if they return to Indonesia. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In light of our disposition regarding Winata\u2019s withholding of removal claim, we do not address petitioners\u2019 due process contentions relating to the BIA\u2019s denial of this claim. Petitioners\u2019 remaining due process contentions fail for lack of prejudice, <em>see Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000), or because they are not supported by the record, <em>see Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error for a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b712-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
