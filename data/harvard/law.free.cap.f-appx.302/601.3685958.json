Because the ALJ offered clear and convincing reasons for partially discrediting Catalano\u2019s testimony, and because substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision upholding the ALJ\u2019s denial of Social Security disability benefits. <em>See Tommasetti v. Astrue, </em>533 F.3d 1035, 1038 (9th Cir.2008). The ALJ\u2019s decision must be affirmed if it applied the correct legal standard and is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Parra v. Astrue, </em>481 F.3d 742, 746 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">I. Credibility of Catalano\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b628-16\">\u201cTo determine whether a claimant\u2019s testimony regarding subjective pain or symptoms is credible, an ALJ must engage in a two-step analysis.\u201d <em>Lingenfelter v. Astrue, </em>504 F.3d 1028, 1035-36 (9th Cir.2007). \u201cFirst, the ALJ must determine whether the claimant has presented objective medical evidence of an underlying impairment \u2018which could reasonably be expected to produce the pain or other symptoms alleged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1036 (quoting <em>Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 341, 344 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc)). Catalano satisfied this step by presenting objective medical evidence of chest pains and physical deconditioning. Second, if \u201cthere is no affirmative evidence of malingering, \u2018the ALJ can reject the claimant\u2019s testimony about the severity of her symptoms only by offering specific, clear and convincing reasons for doing so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tommasetti, </em>533 F.3d at 1039 (quoting <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281 (9th Cir.1996)). Because there was no affirmative evidence of malingering, clear and convincing reasons were required to discredit Catalano\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-17\">To the extent the ALJ in fact discredited Catalano\u2019s testimony, he provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>three valid reasons for doing so. First, the ALJ found Catalano was unable to testify with specificity regarding her symptoms. <em>See Tommasetti, </em>538 F.3d at 1040 (ALJ may \u201crely on ordinary techniques of credibility evaluation,\u201d such as whether claimant was a \u201cvague witness\u201d). Second, the ALJ evaluated Catalano\u2019s testimony in light of the objective medical evidence in the record. <em>See Lingenfelter, </em>504 F.3d at 1040 (ALJ may consider \u201cwhether the alleged symptoms are consistent with the medical evidence\u201d when assessing credibility). Third, the ALJ observed Catalano\u2019s appearance and demeanor at the hearing, at which she did not have any apparent limitations. <em>See Orn v. Astrue, </em>495 F.3d 625, 639 (9th Cir.2007) (ALJ\u2019s \u201cobservations of a claimant\u2019s functioning\u201d at the hearing are permissible as part of the overall credibility assessment). Though perhaps none of these reasons <em>by itself </em>would be clear and convincing, <em>collectively </em>they provide a sufficient basis for partially discrediting Catalano\u2019s testimony. <em>See Tommasetti, </em>533 F.3d at 1039 (upholding adverse credibility determination where the \u201cALJ provided several permissible reasons\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">II. Catalano\u2019s Disability Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">A claimant is disabled only if she has a severe impairment, or combination of impairments, significantly limiting her physical or mental ability to do basic work activities. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(c), 1521(a). Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Catalano is not disabled because her residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) enables her to perform her past relevant work.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">As a preliminary matter, the record does not support Catalano\u2019s claim that the ALJ failed to consider a psychological cause for her symptoms: the ALJ noted the possibility that Catalano\u2019s symptoms were psychosomatic, and Dr. West opined that they may be caused by aggravation or emotional factors. Catalano\u2019s mental impairment claim also fails because there is no evidence of a functional limitation related to daily activities, social functioning, or concentration. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a(e)(3). On the contrary, psychiatrist Dr. Carone reported no problems with Catalano\u2019s intellect, judgment, manner of relating to others, or ability to engage in daily activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Catalano\u2019s challenges to the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination fail because the ALJ considered her capacity for sustained work, and Catalano never established any non-exertional impairments. RFC is the <em>most </em>a claimant can do in a work setting on a regular basis, despite her limitations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1545(a), (b), (c). After noting that employment would be difficult for someone whose impairments caused frequent absences from work, Dr. West concluded Catalano remained capable of sedentary to light work. To the extent Dr. West\u2019s testimony may have been ambiguous, this court will not second-guess the ALJ\u2019s reasonable interpretation. <em>See Edlund v. Massanari, </em>253 F.3d 1152, 1156 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe ALJ is responsible for determining credibility, resolving conflicts in medical testimony, and resolving ambiguities,\u201d and where \u201cthe evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation, the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the [ALJ]\u201d). Notably, Dr. West\u2019s assessment was not inconsistent with Catalano\u2019s own testimony, and it was in accord with the reports of every other treating, examining, and non-examining physician in the record, none of which indicated Catalano was incapable of sedentary to light work. Substantial evidence thus supported the ALJ\u2019s \u201csedentary to light\u201d RFC determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>When applied to her past relevant work, this RFC renders Catalano not disabled. Catalano does not allege her past relevant work involved more than \u201clight\u201d exertion, and the vocational expert testified that it is performed at the \u201csedentary\u201d level in the national economy. A claimant is not disabled if she is capable of performing her past relevant work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f). Therefore, the ALJ properly concluded that Catalano was not disabled because her \u201csedentary to light\u201d RFC enables her to perform her past relevant work.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b628-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b630-5\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ayx\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Often in this circuit, when we decide a case by memorandum disposition, we include language stating that \u201cbecause the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recite them.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This language has always struck me as odd, since the parties are \u201cfamiliar with the facts\u201d in every case. This case, however, shows why reciting at least <em>some </em>facts can be important: It prevents <em>us </em>from basing our decisions on illusory records and arriving at decisions that would be inconceivable under the actual records before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">I am not sure to what record my colleagues are referring when they say that \u201cthe ALJ offered clear and convincing reasons for partially discrediting Catalano\u2019s testimony\u201d that her medical impairment caused her to miss work regularly. Maj. op. at 602. They are most certainly not referring to the record in <em>this </em>case. In this case the ALJ did not even identify which portions of Catalano\u2019s testimony he was rejecting, nor did he offer any reasons for doing so, let alone provide specific, clear and convincing reasons for any such rejection. Moreover, the actual record reveals that there was no testimony or other evidence that contradicts or undermines the part of Catalano\u2019s testimony that the majority appears to speculate that the ALJ rejected, or indeed any part of Catalano\u2019s testimony. All in all, it is difficult to conceive of an ALJ decision that could violate more fundamental rules in one short opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">The majority and I do not disagree with regard to the law. We all recognize that because \u201cpain and other such symptoms\u201d are \u201chighly subjective and idiosyncratic,\u201d <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1282 (9th Cir.1996), a claimant\u2019s own \u201ctestimony as to subjective symptoms\u201d cannot be discredited \u201cmerely because [it is] unsupported by objective evidence.\u201d <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1996). To the contrary, as the majority purports to understand, \u201cthe ALJ can reject the claimant\u2019s testimony about the severity of her symptoms <em>only </em>by offering <em>specific, clear and convincing reasons for doing so.\u201d </em>Maj. op. at 602 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Tommasetti v. Astrue, </em>533 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir.2008)). My colleagues also undoubtedly recognize that \u201c[t]he clear and convincing standard is the most demanding required in Social Security cases,\u201d <em>Moore v. Comm\u2019r of the Social Security Admin., </em>278 F.3d 920, 924 (9th Cir.2002), and that to satisfy this demanding standard, the ALJ must make <em>\u201cspecific findings </em>[,] supported by the record,\u201d explaining why he believes the claimant is not credible with respect to some or all of her testimony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 341, 346 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Given these agreed upon legal rules, it is incomprehensible how the majority could come to the conclusion it does in this case. It could do so only by ignoring the facts and the actual record, and unthinkingly regurgitating abstract legal principles instead of undertaking the hard work judges are supposed to perform when applying the law to the facts. It is unfortunate for Mrs. Catalano that after waiting over twenty years to receive the benefits to which she is entitled she fell victim to such regrettable judicial treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Our analysis must begin by seeking to determine precisely what \u201ctestimony\u201d the ALJ \u201cpartially discredited].\u201d Maj. op. at 602. Here we run into our first encounter with the majority\u2019s failure to base its decision on the facts in the record: Contrary to what one might think from reading the majority\u2019s brief disposition, the ALJ in this case <em>did not say </em>what parts, if any, of Catalano\u2019s testimony he was rejecting. To the contrary, he held that Catalano\u2019s \u201ctestimony regarding [her] pain and other symptoms [was] <em>credible and reliable </em>to the extent it [was] consistent with [his] decision.\u201d How the majority sees in this statement a finding that a specific portion of Catalano\u2019s testimony was <em>not </em>credible is wholly beyond me. At best, all that the ALJ has provided us is a vague statement that he discounted <em>some </em>part of her testimony. That is plainly insufficient. The ALJ\u2019s \u201cfindings, properly supported by the record, <em>must </em>be <em>sufficiently specific </em>to allow a reviewing court to conclude the adjudicator rejected the claimant\u2019s testimony on permissible grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345 (emphasis added). We cannot properly review the ALJ\u2019s rejection of Catalano\u2019s testimony if we do not know <em>what testimony he rejected.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The majority commits the same offense as the ALJ. It leaves us to guess what portions of Catalano\u2019s testimony <em>it </em>guessed the ALJ rejected. Athough it is far from clear, the most plausible guess that a reader might make as to the testimony the panel had in mind would be Catalano\u2019s statements regarding the frequency of the episodes that rendered her unable to hold a regular job. If she were unable to work for two or three days each time she suffered from one of her regular episodes, then, as Dr. West \u2014 the medical expert upon whom the ALJ relied \u2014 testified, she would \u201chave a hard time maintaining employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Let us be clear as to what Catalano\u2019s testimony actually was: She stated that her psycho-physiological condition, which the ALJ specifically and unequivocally found to be a \u201csevere impairment,\u201d caused her to \u201ccrack[] many times under pressure and <em>landed [her] in the emergency room very often, </em>having to <em>stay home each time </em>this happened.\u201d In a letter admitted into the administrative record that Catalano wrote in 1981, when she was actually suffering from these episodes, she stated that her nervous attacks involved \u201cdeadening chest pains ... dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, plus numerous other symptoms [that rendered her] .... <em>completely useless for at least two days </em>\u201d after each of the numerous attacks. The majority apparently believes that the ALJ discredited these statements because he ultimately found, despite Catalano\u2019s missing work on a regular basis for days at a time, that her \u201cresidual functional capacity enable[d] her to perform her\u201d prior job. Maj. op. at 603. Curiously, the ALJ specifically acknowledged that <em>\u201c[d]ue to her missing so many days at work, </em>[Catalano\u2019s] files were taken away and given to others in the office.\u201d Given that the ALJ acknowledged that Catalano had to \u201cmiss[ ] so many days at work,\u201d it is impossible to determine pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>cisely what caused him to conclude that she had the residual functional capacity to perform her job, and it is not at all clear that he discredited Catalano\u2019s statements that her condition caused her to miss work regularly for days at a time. The ALJ\u2019s decision is absolutely silent on this point, which is why it was necessary for the majority to attempt to guess at what part of her testimony, if any, he actually discredited, and why it is particularly unfortunate that the majority fads to enlighten us as to what its guess was.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Although the ALJ\u2019s failure to state what portions, if any, of Catalano\u2019s testimony he disregarded is reason enough to reverse the decision below, the majority\u2019s creative reading of the record does not stop there. After deciding that the ALJ must have rejected some particular part of the testimony but failing to tell us what part it was, the majority next provides on behalf of the ALJ his <em>reasons </em>for rejecting that unspecified testimony, even though those reasons are neither stated in nor supported by the record. Because the ALJ failed to state that he was rejecting Catalano\u2019s testimony for any specific reasons, the majority has invented, <em>post hoc, </em>three explanations that the ALJ might have offered for his decision. It does so by seizing on three random statements at various points in the ALJ\u2019s opinion, at least two of which were not offered by the ALJ as a reason for his credibility finding. In so doing, the majority engages in the very \u201cspeculation] as to the grounds for an adjudicator\u2019s rejection of a claimant\u2019s allegations of disabling pain\u201d that our case law prohibits. <em>Bunnell, </em>947 F.2d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">What is more, the explanations that the majority puts forward on the ALJ\u2019s behalf are themselves either arbitrary and capricious or wholly irreconcilable with the record. The majority\u2019s first contention is that the ALJ discredited Catalano\u2019s testimony because he found her to be a \u201cvague witness.\u201d Maj. op. at 603. However, as the actual record reflects, the ALJ never made such a finding. The ALJ observed that \u201cCatalano could not testify with any specificity <em>as to her daily symptoms.\u201d </em>This is neither remarkable \u2014 since, as the ALJ stated, the symptoms occurred \u201ctwenty years\u201d prior to her testimony \u2014 nor relevant. Regardless of the specificity of her testimony as to what happened on a daily basis, the ALJ found that Catalano\u2019s medical condition <em>did </em>constitute a \u201csevere impairment.\u201d The relevant question is whether she suffered from regular episodes resulting from that condition frequently enough to cause her to miss substantial periods of work. On this question, the ALJ stated, as quoted above, that \u201c[d]ue to her missing so many days of work, [Catalano\u2019s] files were taken away and given to others in the office.\u201d He also related the testimony of Dr. West that the hospital records showed multiple admissions for complaints of chest pains during the relevant period. Far from finding that Catalano\u2019s testimony was \u201cvague\u201d with respect to whether her \u201csevere impairment\u201d caused her to miss work regularly, the ALJ implicitly acknowledged that she did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The majority next suggests, on the ALJ\u2019s behalf, that the ALJ rejected Catalano\u2019s testimony because it was in conflict with the \u201cobjective medical evidence in the record.\u201d Maj. op. at 603. The sole evidence to which the majority refers is the medical expert\u2019s \u201cconclu[sion that] Catalano remained capable of sedentary to light work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603. However, a reading of the actual record demonstrates that the majority takes this statement entirely out of context and that read properly the statement in no way conflicts with Catalano\u2019s testimony. Dr. West\u2019s testimony was that Catalano\u2019s <em>physical </em>deconditioning\u2014 meaning the fact that she was, in general, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>less physically fit \u201cthan the average 55-year-old\u201d woman \u2014 would place her in the \u201csedentary to light\u201d work-capacity range. He specifically said that he made this statement <em>\u201cbecause </em>[Catalano] is deconditioned.\u201d He was <em>not </em>speaking about her impairment or its consequences when he stated that her \u201cdeconditioned\u201d state rendered her capable of only \u201clight to sedentary\u201d work. When he was asked later about the impact <em>of her impairment </em>on her residual functional capacity, he testified that \u201cif somebody perceives that they have a severe ... chest ache or an abdominal pain ... if those symptoms are sufficiently debilitating, [that person] <em>will have a hard time maintaining employment.\u201d </em>Although he did not know the cause of Catalano\u2019s impairment, which he said could have resulted from \u201cemotional factors, could be esophegeal, could be other GI etiology, could be pulmonary, [or] could be cardiac,\u201d he specifically said that <em>\u201cemployment is going to be difficult </em>for a lady who, for whatever reason, is going to the emergency room quite frequently because of perceived chest pain.\u201d He later said, referring specifically to Catalano, that \u201ca major problem is going to be absence from work.\u201d Dr. West\u2019s testimony that frequent hospital visits will severely interfere with someone\u2019s employment capacity applies to any individual, whether ordinarily her work classification would be \u201csedentary to light,\u201d medium, heavy, or otherwise. If, as the majority assumes, the ALJ relied on Dr. West\u2019s testimony to reject Catalano\u2019s statements regarding the frequency and effect of the heart pains that regularly landed her in the hospital and caused her to miss work for two or three days at a time, then he did so without clear and convincing reasons supported by the record, because the doctor\u2019s testimony is not at all inconsistent with those statements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At no point did the medical expert suggest that the episodes Catalano experienced were nonexistent, exaggerated or, most important, inconsistent with her underlying impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The majority\u2019s third explanation for why the ALJ rejected part of Catalano\u2019s testimony is that \u201cthe ALJ observed Catalano\u2019s appearance and demeanor at the hearing, at which she did not have any apparent limitations.\u201d Maj. op. at 603. This is the most preposterous of the justifications the majority offers on the ALJ\u2019s behalf. Catalano testified before the ALJ <em>twenty years after </em>her \u201csevere\u201d and debilitating attacks caused her to miss work on a regular basis. What possible relevance is there in the fact that the long-since retired Catalano, testifying in 2002, \u201cdid not have any apparent limitations\u201d? The question at issue is whether her traumatic episodes in 1980 \u2014 when she worked full-time in a position that the ALJ acknowledged was \u201cof a high stress nature\u201d \u2014 occurred so frequently that she had to miss substantial periods of work. Catalano\u2019s uncontroverted testimony is that they did. Her physical appearance at a hearing twenty years later, following a long period of retirement, has absolutely no bearing on that question, and if the ALJ did in fact rely on this ground, then any decision he made to reject Catalano\u2019s testimony was arbitrary and capricious and made without clear and convincing reasons supported by the evidence, and must be rejected. <em>Cf. Orn v. Astrue, </em>495 F.3d 625, 639 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201c[An] ALJ\u2019s observations of a claimant\u2019s functioning [at the hearing] may not form the sole basis for discrediting a person\u2019s testimony.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>In sum, the question the ALJ was required to determine was whether, in light of the \u201csevere impairment\u201d he found Catalano to have had, she had a sufficient residual functional capacity to perform her job as an office manager and insurance clerk. The key factual question in this inquiry was how regularly her impairment caused her to miss work. As the government\u2019s own medical expert acknowledged, \u201ca major problem [for someone with Catalano\u2019s condition] is going to be absence from work,\u201d and no one disputes that absence from work for two or three days at a time on a regular basis renders a person unable to hold a job. There is no evidence in the record, medical or otherwise, to contradict Catalano\u2019s testimony that her impairment in fact \u201clanded [her] in the emergency room very often, having to stay home each time.\u201d Nor did any doctor or medical expert suggest that the subjective responses she experienced were in any respect inconsistent with her underlying impairment. Presumably the ALJ reached a contrary conclusion on his own, a conclusion that was in conflict with all the evidence in the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">For no reason evident in the record, the ALJ concluded that Catalano\u2019s \u201cimpairment [did not] preelude[ ] the performance of her past relevant work.\u201d As to his actual reasons, if any, the record is silent. Under our clearly established law, the ALJ\u2019s unexplained reasoning is insufficient to support his unexplained findings and unwarranted ruling. We cannot affirm a determination that is neither expressed nor supported by specific findings as well as by clear and convincing reasons. Nor can we affirm a determination that is contrary to all the evidence in the record. The ALJ\u2019s ruling fails to meet our legal standards in every respect. I therefore vote to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\">. Over four hundred of our memorandum dispositions from the past five years include some variant of this phrase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b633-5\">. Curiously, the majority acknowledges that \"Dr. West\u2019s assessment was not inconsistent with Catalano's own testimony,\u201d Maj. op. at 603, yet for some reason it affirms the ALJ\u2019s apparent decision to <em>disregard </em>Catalano\u2019s description of her subjective pain, contrary to the clear mandate of our circuit law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b634-5\">. As, due to the almost total absence of reasoning and explanation in the AU's opinion, we are required to speculate about most of the essential elements of his decision, I would speculate here that the ALJ simply never considered the determinative fact that Catalano\u2019s frequent hospital visits resulting from traumatic episodes involving heart pain, followed by the need for two or three days rest at home, rendered her incapable of holding any job. Despite Dr. West\u2019s supportive testimony on this point, the ALJ never mentions Catalano's inability to perform work on a full-time basis in his opinion and never accounts for this fact in his decision. Had he recognized the actual consequences of Catalano's \"severe disability,\u201d the result in this case would almost certainly have been different.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
