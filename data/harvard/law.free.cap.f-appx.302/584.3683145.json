The Nevada Supreme Court held that Moore\u2019s state petition was untimely, and therefore the petition was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <em>See Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 417, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">Moore is entitled to equitable tolling of the one-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) because his state habeas petition would have been \u201cproperly filed\u201d under our decision in <em>Dictado v. Ducharme, </em>244 F.3d 724 (9th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Harris v. Carter, </em>515 F.3d 1051, 1057 (9th Cir.2008). Moore relied on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Dictado, </em>and his federal petition became untimely when <em>Dictado </em>was overruled by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Pace. Id. </em>Moreover, the record establishes that Moore pursued his rights diligently. Therefore, Moore is entitled to equitable tolling of the one-year statute of limitations. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court dismissing Moore\u2019s federal habeas petition as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b611-12\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ASq\">. Although Moore did not raise this issue to the district court, we granted Moore's motion to expand his certificate of appealability to raise this issue. \u201cNow that the equitable tolling issue has been fully briefed on appeal, we may not review the merits of the [certificate of appealability] expansion ruling.\u201d <em>Smith v. Ratelle, </em>323 F.3d 813, 816 n. 4 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
