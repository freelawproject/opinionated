HOLMES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Xunsheng Li is a native and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China now living in the United States. Mr. Li entered this country in April 1998 without inspection and filed a timely asylum application one month later. He claims he will be persecuted on account of his political opinion regarding China\u2019s one-child policy if he is returned to China. He seeks review of a decision by a single member of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissing his appeal of the denial by an immigration judge (I J) of his application for asylum and restriction on removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In denying relief, the IJ determined that Mr. Li lacked credibility. Mr. Li argues that this finding is unsupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence, that the inconsistencies identified by the IJ and the BIA do not exist, and that neither the IJ nor the BIA provided cogent reasons for disbelieving Mr. Li. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">In adopting and affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, the BIA did not find the IJ\u2019s factual findings to be clearly erroneous. In so doing, the BIA expressly disagreed with Mr. Li\u2019s contention that the record was free of discrepancies, referenced the inconsistencies regarding when Mr. Li allegedly learned about his wife\u2019s treatment by Chinese family-planning authorities, and further noted that certain documentary evidence from Mr. Li\u2019s wife conflicted with certificates in the record. Admin. R., Vol. I at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final order of removal but \u201cconsult the IJ\u2019s opinion to the extent the BIA relied upon or incorporated it.\u201d <em>Sarr v. Gonzales, </em>474 F.3d 783, 790 (10th Cir.2007). \u201c[0]ur duty is to guarantee that factual determinations are supported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence considering the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Ismaiel v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 1198, 1205 (10th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). Credibility findings are among those determinations \u201csubject to the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Uanreroro v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 1197, 1204 (10th Cir.2006). We will sustain an adverse credibility finding as long as the IJ has given specific, cogent reasons for disbelieving an applicant\u2019s testimony. <em>Ismaiel, </em>516 F.3d at 1205. \u201cThe agency\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive unless the record demonstrates that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1204 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">To obtain asylum, Mr. Li had to prove he is a refugee. <em>See Yuk v. Ashcroft, </em>355 F.3d 1222, 1232 (10th Cir.2004). Under these facts, Mr. Li had to show that he was unable or unwilling to return to China or to avail himself of China\u2019s protection because he had been persecuted, or was afraid he would be persecuted, due to his political opinion regarding China\u2019s one-child policy. <em>See id. </em>Mr. Li had three options. He could demonstrate: a well-founded fear of future persecution, past persecution that would give rise to that well-founded fear, or past persecution so extreme that he would qualify for humani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>tarian asylum. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-38. After establishing refugee status, Mr. Li would then need to rely on the Attorney General\u2019s discretion as to whether to grant him asylum. <em>Id. </em>at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Mr. Li first applied for asylum in May 1998. In his application he described the evils that had befallen his grandfather and his father at the hands of the Chinese government. Admin. R., Vol. Ill at 1146. He further described an incident in which he had come into conflict with local population-control authorities who were investigating his brother for apparent noncompliance with China\u2019s one-child policy. <em>Id. </em>During that confrontation, Mr. Li \u201cunwittingly\u201d injured one of the population-control officers. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, despite being married and the father of two children, Mr. Li left his home and fled to Xiamen City. He \u201cwandered here and there,\u201d got a job on a fishing boat, and eventually arrived in Guam in April 1998. <em>Id. </em>Approximately a month later, with the help of an attorney, Mr. Li applied for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Although he now maintains that his opposition to China\u2019s population-control policies establishes his refugee status, there is no mention in Mr. Li\u2019s 1998 application of any problem involving his wife and the Chinese family-planning authorities, a fact central to his eventual claim. It was not until January 1999 that Mr. Li supplemented his application with an additional affidavit where, for the first time, he described a forced late-term abortion and sterilization of his wife, which he maintained occurred after he had taken the job on the fishing boat. <em>Id. </em>Vol. I at 310. His affidavit also stated that, because his wife was unable to deliver Mr. Li to state authorities, she was jailed for a week and eventually fled with her children into hiding at her parents\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">As mentioned, the IJ found that Mr. Li lacked credibility. The major reason for that determination was the numerous contradictions, which we have verified, among the facts stated in Mr. Li\u2019s application, his supplemental affidavits, and his testimony. Specifically, because Mr. Li\u2019s application made no mention of his wife\u2019s forced abortion and sterilization, Mr. Li was asked at the hearing to explain this discrepancy. He testified that when he submitted his application, in 1998, he did not know about his wife\u2019s February 1997 forced abortion and sterilization, even though he had spoken to her on the telephone at least once after she underwent the procedures. <em>Id. </em>at 153, 200, 208. According to Mr. Li, she withheld this information to protect him from worrying about her while he was engaged in his dangerous fishing job on the open sea. <em>Id. </em>at 170, 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">The IJ found this testimony \u201cunbelievable and implausible,\u201d given that, in his experience, other Chinese applicants who had endured forced late-term abortions and sterilization found it to be a \u201ctraumatic and emotional and devastating experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49-50. Further, the IJ did not believe that, even after Mr. Li was no longer at sea (during the month between the time he landed in Guam and the time he filed his application) his wife still failed to tell him what had happened to her, especially given Mr. Li\u2019s testimony that he called his wife whenever he got to Guam. <em>Id. </em>In summary, the IJ stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-9\">The Court in this case believes that had the wife undergone an abortion in February of 1997 that this would have been one of the primary things on the wife\u2019s mind during the call from the harbor in 1997 of April and it certainly would have been communicated to the respondent sometime between April of 1998 and May of 1998.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 50.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This finding is supported by substantial evidence in the record, and the IJ has given specific and cogent reasons for disbelieving Mr. Li\u2019s testimony in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The IJ also gave specific and cogent reasons for finding Mr. Li to have been less than credible about whether his wife had fled their home after the forced abortion and what her motive for such an action may have been. <em>Id. </em>at 50-51. Mr. Li testified that his wife feared that the authorities would come to her home to search for him. Yet by the time of her forced abortion, the IJ reasoned, Ms. Li knew that her husband was at sea and outside of the reach of the authorities. Again, the IJ has properly made and explained his credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">For his last point, Mr. Li argues that he should be afforded an opportunity to explain an inconsistency noted by the BIA. This contention is without merit. Having been adjudged not credible by the IJ, Mr. Li was \u201con notice\u201d to \u201cexplain all the inconsistencies in [his] testimony, not just the examples pointed to by the IJ to provide a basis for his conclusion.\u201d <em>Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 939 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The IJ gave specific and cogent reasons for disbelieving several aspects of Mr. Li\u2019s testimony. His credibility findings are substantially reasonable and supported by probative evidence of record. <em>See Ismaiel, </em>516 F.3d at 1205. The BIA\u2019s affirmance is similarly \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Yuk, </em>355 F.3d at 1233 (quotation omitted). Because Mr. Li has failed to sustain his burden of proof on his asylum claim, he cannot prevail under the more demanding standard for restriction on removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1236. We therefore DENY the petition for review and AFFIRM the BIA\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Li\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b866-7\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-11\">. Mr. Li has withdrawn his application for relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b868-7\">. Specifically with regard to the question of whether he knew about his wife\u2019s abortion when he filed his application, both the IJ and the BIA characterized that fact as at \"the heart\u201d of Mr. Li's claim. Admin. R., Vol. I at 2, 50. We note that, in a decision published since the BIA\u2019s affirmance, this circuit has refused to limit omissions in immigration matters for purposes of credibility findings to only those going to the \"heart of an asylum claim.\u201d <em>See Ismaiel v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 1198, 1205-06 (10th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). In this circuit, \"the significance of an omission must be determined by the context, and rigid rules cannot substitute for common sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1205.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
