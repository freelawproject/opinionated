Holmes argues that the district court erred by failing to reduce his sentence based upon Amendment 706 of the Guidelines, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) (2007 &amp; Supp.2008); USSG App. C, Amend. 706. (E.R.25). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm substantially for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>No. 7:96-cr-00108-002 (WD.Va. March 14, 2008).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b227-11\"><em> </em>We need not decide whether a defendant\u2019s history of institutional infractions is an appropriate consideration justifying the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Pena, </em>470 F.3d 431, 433 (1st Cir.2006) (holding post-judgment rehabilitation \u201cprovides no basis either for a sentencing reduction in its own right ... or for a further downward departure where a \u00a7 3582(c) reduction is ordered for some other reason\u201d); <em>United States v. Hasan, </em>245 F.3d 682, 690 (8th Cir.2001) (holding district court erred in granting \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on post-sentence conduct). Because the district court provided an adequate alternative rationale explaining why the original sentence remained appropriate pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the \u00a7 3582 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
