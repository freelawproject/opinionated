Because Zamarron had been convicted previously of a crime of violence, Zamarron\u2019s offense level was adjusted upward by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Zamarron requested a variance from the guidelines sentence. The request was denied, and Zamarron was sentenced in the middle of the guidelines imprisonment range to a 79-month term of imprisonment and to a three-year period of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Zamarron contends that his sentence of imprisonment was greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Zamarron concedes that this court ordinarily applies a presumption of reasonableness to within-guideline sentences. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he contends that the presumption should not apply in this case because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically supported. Zamarron points out that the instant offense did not involve violent conduct and did not pose a danger to others. He contends that the offense was not inherently evil and \u201cwas, at bottom, an international trespass.\u201d He contends also that the guidelines range did not account for his benign motivation for reentering the United States \u2014 to be with his sick mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-17\">We decline to reconsider the application of the presumption in light of the undeveloped record. Zamarron\u2019s reliance upon <em>Kimbrough </em>to challenge the appellate presumption is misplaced, and he has failed to show that the presumption should not be applied. The district court considered Zamarron\u2019s request for leniency in light of his personal circumstances, but it ultimately determined that a sentence within the guidelines range was appropriate. Zamarron\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338; <em>Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66. Because Zamarron has failed to make a showing sufficient to rebut that presumption, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
