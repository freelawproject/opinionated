Jackson appeals <em>pro se </em>from the District Court\u2019s post-judgment order denying his motion for transcripts and other documents. We will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6</p>\n<p id=\"b148-27\">In May 2005, Jackson pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of cocaine base in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a), respectively, and the District Court sentenced him to 48 months imprisonment. Jackson later filed a motion challenging his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. During that proceeding, the District Court entered an order noting that Jackson had twice been provided with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>copies of his entire criminal file with the exception of two hearing transcripts and directing the Deputy Clerk to provide Jackson with copies of those transcripts as well. The District Court ultimately denied Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on November 15, 2006, 2006 WL 3383838. Jackson appealed neither his sentence nor the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">On May 19, 2008, Jackson filed the document at issue here, which again requested transcripts and the production of \u201call documents\u201d pertaining to his criminal proceeding so that he could \u201cproduce a substantial and effective appeal.\u201d The District Court, construing the document as a motion for transcripts and other documents, denied it as moot by order entered May 21, 2008. Jackson appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Although this Court notified Jackson that this appeal would be submitted for possible summary action, he has provided no response suggesting that his request was not in fact moot. In addition, we are aware of no authority under which the United States may be required to pay the cost of transcripts when no proceeding is pending. <em>See United States v. Horvath, </em>157 F.3d 131, 133 (2d Cir.1998) (reviewing authority to the contrary). <em>See also Walker v. United States, </em>424 F.2d 278, 279 (5th Cir.1970) (\u201cA federal prisoner is not entitled to obtain copies of court records at Government expense for the purpose of searching the record for possible error.\u201d). Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. Jackson\u2019s motion for counsel and motion \u201cfor extended law library privileges until late November 2008,\u201d neither of which raises any substantive claim or sets forth any conceivable basis for relief, are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 because the District Court\u2019s post-judgment order is effectively final. <em>See Ohntrup </em>v. <em>Firearms Center, Inc., </em>802 F.2d 676, 678 (3d Cir.1986). We review the District Court's denial of a motion for transcripts and other services at the Government\u2019s expense for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Roman, 121 </em>F.3d 136, 143 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
