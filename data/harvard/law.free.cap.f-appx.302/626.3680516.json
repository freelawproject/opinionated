We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-18\">The agency concluded Andres was neither eligible for asylum nor entitled to asylum in the agency\u2019s discretion. The opening brief does not challenge the agency\u2019s dispositive discretionary denial of asylum and has therefore forfeited the issue. <em>Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-19\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that changed country conditions in Guatemala rebut Andres\u2019s presumption of a clear probability of persecution on account of the political opinion imputed to him in the past by the Guatemalan government. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998 (9th Cir.2003). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Andres failed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution against indigenous people in Guatemala. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1180-81 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (requiring that the government be unable or unwilling to control perpetrators of general violence for purposes of evaluating the source or agent of persecution). Further, the record does not compel the conclusion that the Guatemalan government is unwill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>ing or unable to control persecution against survivors of human rights abuses. <em>See id. </em>We therefore uphold the denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Finally, the opening brief does not challenge the agency\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT. Andres has therefore forfeited the issue. <em>See Martinez-Serrano, </em>94 F.3d at 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b653-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
