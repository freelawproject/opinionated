We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>dence, <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The BIA denied Rey\u2019s asylum application as time-barred. Rey does not challenge this finding in his opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Rey\u2019s testimony failed to meet his burden of proof with respect to past persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003). Furthermore, even if the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922 (9th Cir.2004) applies to Indonesian Christians seeking withholding of removal, Rey has not demonstrated a clear probability of future persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1185. Lastly, this record does not establish that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of Christians in Indonesia. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1180-81 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">We decline to consider Rey\u2019s CAT claim because he did not raise any arguments in his opening brief challenging the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b555-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
