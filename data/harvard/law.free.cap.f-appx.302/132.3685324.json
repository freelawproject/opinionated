Cartwright appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on his claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000). Cartwright raises only one issue in his informal brief. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b) (pro se appellants may obtain appellate review of only those issues explicitly raised in their informal briefs). Cartwright maintains that the district should not have granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment without allowing discovery. Plaintiff does not address his failure to file an affidavit under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) seeking a continuance to allow him to conduct whatever additional discovery he needed to adequately rebut Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-22\">This court has recognized that \u201c[a]s a general rule, summary judgment is appropriate only after \u2018adequate time for discovery.\u2019 \u201d <em>Evans v. Technologies Applications &amp; Serv. Co., </em>80 F.3d 954, 961 (4th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). However, as this court has also acknowledged, \u201cWe, like other reviewing federal courts, place great weight on the Rule 56(f) affidavit, believing that \u2018[a] party may not simply assert in its brief that discovery was necessary and thereby overturn summary judgment when it failed to comply with the requirement of Rule 56(f) to set out reasons for the need for discovery in an affidavit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Nguyen v. CNA Corp., </em>44 F.3d 234, 242 (4th Cir.1995)). In <em>Evans, </em>we cited with approval the Second Circuit\u2019s holding that \u201c \u2018the failure to file an affidavit under Rule 56(f) is itself sufficient grounds to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>reject a claim that the opportunity for discovery was inadequate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Paddington Partners v. Bouchard, </em>34 F.3d 1132, 1137 (2d Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">We therefore find no reversible error and affirm the order of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
