We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Toguchi v. Chung, </em>391 F.3d 1051, 1056 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-20\">The district court properly granted summary judgment to defendants on Watts\u2019 due process claim because he failed to raise a triable issue as to whether the prison lockdown imposed an \u201catypical and significant hardship on [him] in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-21\">The district court properly granted summary judgment to defendants on Watts\u2019 Eighth Amendment claim because Watts failed to raise a triable issue as to whether the restriction on outdoor yard privileges during the lockdowns was warranted by disciplinary needs. <em>See Hoptowit v. Ray, </em>682 F.2d 1237, 1259 (9th Cir.1982) (stating that in emergency situa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>tions such as lockdowns, prison officials may restrict outdoor exercise on the basis of disciplinary needs, and courts must give prison officials reasonable leeway in determining the existence of such needs).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The district court properly determined that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from Watts\u2019 equal protection claim because defendants\u2019 conduct did not violate clearly established law. <em>See Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 199, 201-02, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (explaining that for the purposes of qualified immunity the court must consider whether the infringed right was clearly established, and if so, must then \u201cdetermine if a reasonable officer could have believed, in light of the clearly established law, that his conduct was lawful.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b679-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
