MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b811-19\">Petitioner-Appellant Kelly Tigert is an Oklahoma state prisoner. When legal documents bearing Tigert\u2019s name were discovered in the locker of another inmate, he was charged with violating prison rules prohibiting inmates from \u201creceiving, trading, selling, giving or loaning\u201d property to another inmate. After a disciplinary hearing, Tigert was found guilty of Individual Disruptive Behavior and he lost sixty hours of good time credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-20\">Proceeding pro se, Tigert filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in federal district court. In his petition, Tigert alleged he was denied due process in the prison disciplinary proceeding. The federal magistrate judge recommended denying Tigert\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, concluding there was no due process violation because Tigert was provided with (1) at least twenty-four hours advance written notice of the claimed violations, (2) an opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense, and (3) a written statement identifying the evidence relied upon by the factfinders and the reasons for the disciplinary action taken. <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 564-66, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). The magistrate judge further concluded the record contained \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the disciplinary sanctions imposed on Tigert.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454-55, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and dismissed Tigert\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-21\">Tigert now seeks a certificate of appeal-ability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to enable him to appeal the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). This court will issue a COA \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). To satisfy this standard, Tigert must demonstrate \u201cthat jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">This court has reviewed Tigert\u2019s application for a COA and appellate brief, the district court\u2019s order, the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, and the entire record on appeal pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El </em>and concludes that Tigert is not entitled to a COA. The district court\u2019s resolution of Tigert\u2019s claim is not reasonably subject to debate and the claim is not adequate to deserve further proceedings. Accordingly, Tigert is not entitled to a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">This court denies Tigert\u2019s request for a COA and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-16\">. That evidence was the document found in the locker.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b812-6\">HARTZ, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AGJ\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">I concur in denial of the request for a COA and dismissal of the appeal. I write separately only to address an issue not mentioned in the Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">As I read Mr. Tigert\u2019s application for a COA and his original \u00a7 2241 application, one ground for his challenge to his discipline is that the rule he allegedly violated was unconstitutional in its application in this case. The discipline was based on possession by a fellow inmate of a document belonging to Mr. Tigert. The respondent acknowledges that the document is a legal document. Mr. Tigert\u2019s \u00a7 2241 application and his pleading to this court appear to contend (1) that the fellow inmate was Mr. Tigert\u2019s jailhouse lawyer and (2) that a prison rule cannot totally bar a jailhouse lawyer from possessing a \u201cclient\u2019s\u201d legal materials in his cell. The issue raised by these contentions, it seems to me, would be worthy of a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Mr. Tigert, however, failed to raise this issue in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation. Therefore, I do not think that the issue is properly before us and I concur in the Order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
