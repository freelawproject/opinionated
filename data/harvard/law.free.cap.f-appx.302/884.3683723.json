On appeal, Fox-worth argues that he qualified for a two-level sentence reduction, and that the district court did not properly analyze the pertinent factors, including those listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), before denying his motion. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">We review a district court\u2019s decision denying a sentence reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has the discretion to reduce the term of a defendant\u2019s previously imposed sentence when the term of imprisonment was based on a guideline range \u201cthat has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706, effective retroactively as of March 3, 2008, provides for a two-level reduction in the base offense level for certain crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713, U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706. Even so, a court may only reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to Amendment 706 \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); and <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">The Sentencing Commission has issued a policy statement instructing district courts that before they reduce a term of imprisonment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), they must consider the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a), and the nature and seriousness of danger to the community posed by the reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(B)). In analyzing these factors, district courts may also consider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">The factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a) include, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment; (4) the need for adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (5) the protection of the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">Accordingly, in addressing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis: (1) by recalculating the sentence based on the amendment, \u201cleav[ing] all other guideline application decisions unaffected;\u201d and (2) by exercising its discretion, based on the factors described above, to impose a new sentence or to retain the original. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l); <em>and see United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cAlthough the district court must undertake the two-step analysis outlined above, the district court is not required to reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">In addition, a \u201cdistrict court need only \u2018acknowledge\u2019 that it \u2018considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors[,]\u2019 and need not discuss each of these factors in either the sentencing hearing or in the sentencing order[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 671, 169 L.Ed.2d 526 (2007) (internal citation omitted). We have upheld the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on a brief statement by the district court that it was concerned with the defendant\u2019s \u201c\u2018demonstrated violence\u2019\u201d and had reweighed \u201c\u2018all of the other considerations that went into the establishment of [the] defendant\u2019s sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion, as it properly undertook the required two-step analysis before denying Foxworth\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. First, the district court correctly recalculated the amended guideline range. Second, it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and determined that Foxworth remained a danger to the community in light of his four post-sentencing disciplinary infractions. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Foxworth\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence is not an abuse of discretion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
