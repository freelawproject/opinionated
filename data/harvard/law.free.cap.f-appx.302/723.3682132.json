We conclude that the district court did not commit procedural error in imposing its sentence on Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">\u201cWe review sentences, including those imposed upon revocation of supervised release, for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Simtob, </em>485 F.3d 1058, 1061 (9th Cir.2007). When a defendant does not raise a particular objection to his sentence before the district court, we apply plain error review. <em>United States v. Waknine, </em>543 F.3d 546, 551 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-14\">We reject Anderson\u2019s claim that the district court improperly relied on factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) to justify its sentence. The district court may consider the seriousness of the offense underlying the revocation of supervised release \u201cas part of the criminal history of the violator,\u201d provided that such a consideration is not \u201ca focal point of the inquiry.\u201d <em>Simtob, </em>485 F.3d at 1062. Here, the district court focused, if anything, on the apparent failure of rehabilitation thus far in Anderson\u2019s case, as evidenced by his recidivism. As we have found in previous cases, \u201cgreater sanctions\u201d may be appropriate for defendants who violate their supervised release by committing an offense similar to that for which they were convicted originally. <em>See id. </em>at 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-15\">Next, Anderson argues that the district court gave an inadequate statement of reasons before issuing its above-Guidelines sentence. Like the court in <em>United States v. Leonard, </em>483 F.3d 635 (9th Cir.2007), \u201c[w]e have no difficulty in discerning the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the sentence that it did.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637. The court\u2019s reasons for imposing its sentence on Anderson, such as the escalation in Anderson\u2019s criminal conduct and his failure to comply with the terms of super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>vised release, \u201ccould not be much clearer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, precedent does not \u201cimpose any requirement that the district court state why it chose a particular sentence rather than other potential sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Maciel-Vasquez, </em>458 F.3d 994, 995 (9th Cir.2006). The court, therefore, gave a satisfactory explanation of its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Finally, Anderson contends that the district court improperly found that it could not consider his conditions of confinement as a factor in its sentencing decision. The district court, however, never stated that it was legally precluded from considering Anderson\u2019s argument; rather, once defense counsel fully explained his position, the court made clear that it \u201cwas not compelled\u201d by the argument. There was no error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Anderson correctly notes that the district court erred in stating that it previously had sentenced Anderson to a below-Guidelines sentence for his first conviction in 2002. To warrant reversal under plain error review, the applicable standard, the error must affect \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1078 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the district court\u2019s small error did not contribute to the sentence imposed on Anderson and thus did not affect his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b750-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
