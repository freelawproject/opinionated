Murphy, </em>516 F.3d 1117, 1122 (9th Cir.2008) (citations omitted). Any statements made by the agents regarding their ability to obtain a search warrant did not vitiate the voluntariness of her consent. <em>See United States v. Whitworth, </em>856 F.2d 1268, 1279 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201c[The agent\u2019s] statement indicating that a search warrant would likely be sought ... could not have, by itself, rendered Whitworth\u2019s consent involuntary as a matter of law.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Search of the computers was within the scope of Mrs. Thomas\u2019s consent. <em>See Florida v. Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. 248, 251, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 114 L.Ed.2d 297 (1991) (\u201cThe standard for measuring the scope of [an individual\u2019s] consent under the Fourth Amendment is that of \u2018objective\u2019 reasonableness ... \u201d) (citations omitted). The agents informed Mrs. Thomas that if they took the computers they would search them for evidence and Mrs. Thomas indicated her understanding of their stated intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b585-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
