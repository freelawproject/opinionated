TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Michael L. Riggs brings this direct appeal challenging the 180-month sentence imposed by the district court and the court\u2019s application of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). He contends (1) the district court erred by failing to have a jury perform the requisite analysis of his prior convictions under the ACCA, and (2) the mandatory minimum sentence imposed violates his Constitutional rights. Because Riggs proffers no arguments of merit, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">In 2007, Riggs was indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas on the charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2), and 924(e). Riggs subsequently pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">A presentence report (PSR) detailed Riggs\u2019s prior felony convictions. In particular, the PSR indicated that Riggs had previously been convicted in 1986 on two counts of first-degree robbery and in 2000 for second-degree burglary. As a result, the government contended these three pri- or convictions qualified Riggs for the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of the ACCA under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">Prior to sentencing, Riggs submitted a memorandum challenging the application of the ACCA to his 1986 convictions for armed robbery on two fronts. First, he asserted that these two convictions stemmed from a three-day robbery spree and were thus part of a single criminal episode. Second, he argued that the determination of whether the robberies were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another,\u201d as required by \u00a7 924(e)(1), was a fact question to be resolved by a jury rather than by the judge at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">At sentencing, Riggs renewed these same objections. The district court noted the objections, but determined that these \u201carguments were foreclosed by existing Tenth Circuit precedent.\u201d R., Vol. II, at 30. The district court concluded it had the authority to perform the necessary analysis and to apply the ACCA to Riggs\u2019s prior convictions. The court then held the two robbery convictions were separate and distinct under the ACCA, and when counted along with his prior second-degree burglary conviction, Riggs was subject to the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by \u00a7 924(e)(1) of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">Riggs now brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b833-16\">Riggs makes four distinct claims on appeal: (1) the district court erred when it, rather than a jury, determined his prior conviction on two counts of first-degree robbery was actually two separate and distinct convictions under the ACCA; (2) the recidivist goals of the ACCA are not furthered by counting these convictions separately; (3) the mandatory minimum sentence as prescribed by the ACCA violates \u201csociety\u2019s evolving standard of decency\u201d and therefore runs afoul of the Eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Amendment\u2019s proscription of cruel and unusual punishment; and (4) the district court violated his Fifth Amendment Due Process rights by imposing a mandatory minimum sentence under the ACCA. We discuss each in turn below and reject his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">\n<em>A. Prior Conviction Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AV71\">First, Riggs argues the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights when it determined his prior conviction on two counts of first-degree robbery was actually two separate and distinct convictions for ACCA purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In particular, he challenges the continued vitality of the prior conviction exception and contends that in light of <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), a jury rather than a judge should have conducted the ACCA analysis. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">We review an ACCA sentence enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 924(e)(1) de novo. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>401 F.3d 1220, 1226 (10th Cir.2005). The ACCA applies where the defendant \u201chas three previous convictions ... for a violent felony ... committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>447 F.3d 1300, 1303 (10th Cir.2006) (quoting \u00a7 924(e)(1)). Therefore, the \u201cimposition of the ACCA requires: (1) that at least three prior convictions exist, (2) that those convictions were either for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, and (3) that the prior offenses were committed on different occasions from one another.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">As an initial matter, we summarily reject Riggs\u2019s broader argument that the prior conviction exception is in decline, \u201cno longer viable[,] and on the path to being vacated.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 14. Under the prior conviction exception to the <em>Apprendi </em>rule, the existence of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction for a crime does not have to be tried to a jury. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) <em>(\u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (emphasis added)). This exception was reaffirmed in <em>United States v. Booker: </em>\u201cAny fact <em>(other than a prior </em>conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum ... must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Riggs\u2019s narrower argument that \u201conly a jury can make findings that increase the statutory maximum\u201d is similarly without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>merit. Aplt. Br. at 12. We have previously held \u201call three elements of the ACCA are properly assessed by the sentencing court.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>447 F.3d at 1303. First, in <em>Moore, </em>we held the requisite existence and number of prior convictions under the ACCA are not facts that must be charged to the jury. <em>Moore, </em>401 F.3d at 1226. Second, \u201c[i]t is a question of law whether a felony meets the statutory definition of a \u2018violent felony,\u2019 and such a question does not trigger the Sixth Amendment concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1225. Finally, in <em>Michel, </em>we held the determination of whether prior convictions occurred on different occasions was not a jury issue and could properly be made by a sentencing judge. 446 F.3d at 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Riggs nevertheless contends the line of Supreme Court jurisprudence since <em>Apprendi, </em>and especially in light of <em>Shepard, </em>necessarily signals a rale that only a jury can determine whether two prior convictions are distinct under the ACCA analysis. We previously considered this argument in both <em>Michel </em>and <em>Harris </em>and, cognizant of <em>Shepard, </em>held that \u201cwhether prior convictions happened on different occasions from one another is not a fact required to be determined by a jury but is instead a matter for the sentencing court.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>447 F.3d at 1303; <em>Michel, </em>446 F.3d at 1133. Because we are \u201cbound by the precedent of prior panels absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary decision by the Supreme Court,\u201d we reject Riggs\u2019s contention. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>518 F.3d 740, 752 n. 14 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Riggs also contends that, under <em>Shepard, </em>the distinct and separate nature of his prior convictions must be obvious from the face of the prior judicial record or otherwise admitted by the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Riggs, because the government failed to present any Shepard-approved judicial records from the prior robbery convictions, the district court could not properly enhance his sentence under the ACCA. However, Riggs only objected to the legal conclusions in light of the PSR\u2014 namely that his conviction on two counts of first-degree robbery was a single occurrence and not two separate and distinct convictions. Riggs failed to object to the factual contents of the PSR. <em>Harris, </em>447 F.3d at 1306 (\u201cCriminal Procedure Rule 32 requires the defendant to affirmatively point out any fact in the PSR that he contends is inaccurate. Absent an objection to the PSR, the district court may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact.... Thus, the district court could properly rely on the PSR to conclude that his prior crimes were separate [under the ACCA].\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). Therefore, the sentencing court here was entitled to use the undisputed facts within the PSR to perform the requisite analysis under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">Nevertheless, we must still determine whether the district court erred in actually finding Riggs\u2019s two prior robbery convictions were separate and distinct. Two convictions are distinct if they \u201carise from separate criminal transactions.\u201d <em>Michel, </em>446 F.3d at 1134 (quoting <em>United States v. Tisdale, </em>921 F.2d 1095, 1098 (10th Cir.1990)). In particular, multiple offenses must be \u201cdistinct in time\u201d to be considered separate convictions under the ACCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number><em>Tisdale, </em>921 F.2d at 1098-99 (focusing on the \u201coccasions different from one another\u201d language of the ACCA).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Here, the factual details of Riggs\u2019s prior conviction on two counts of first-degree robbery, contained within the undisputed PSR, are sufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding of separateness. According to the PSR, on one count of armed robbery that took place on November 29, 1985, Riggs pleaded guilty to \u201cforcibly t[aking] money from Peter Oil Company ... with the use of a weapon.\u201d R., Vol. Ill, 1132. On the other count, Riggs pleaded guilty to having committed the \u201carmed robbery of a Town and Country Market\u201d on December 1,1985. <em>Id. </em>If 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Riggs\u2019s argument that this \u201crobbery spree\u201d was a single criminal episode is untenable. These facts, even more starkly than those in <em>Tisdale, </em>illustrate the separate and distinct nature of Riggs\u2019s two prior convictions. First, these armed robberies were far more \u201cdistinct in time\u201d as they took place on two separate days. Second, after Riggs completed the first armed robbery, he was free to end his crime spree. Instead, he chose to commit the second armed robbery a full two days later. Finally, the robberies took place at two separate locations \u2014 one at \u201cPeter Oil Company\u201d and the other at \u201cTown and Country Market.\u201d Riggs presents no plausible argument as to how these two robberies did not \u201carise from separate criminal transactions\u201d worthy of distinct treatment under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">\n<em>B. Riggs\u2019s Other Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">Riggs\u2019s remaining contentions on appeal are similarly unavailing. As an initial matter, although Riggs objected to the application of the ACCA to his robbery convictions in his sentencing memorandum and at sentencing, he failed to raise any of his remaining three arguments. Consequently, we review these challenges to the district court\u2019s ACCA application for plain error. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>413 F.3d 1146, 1153 (10th Cir.2005) (\u201cPlain error occurs when there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, which (3) affects substantial rights, and which (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">Riggs first makes an argument more about policy than law. Without citing any controlling authority, he contends the district court\u2019s conclusion that his prior convictions for robbery were separate and distinct violates the recidivist goals of the ACCA by failing to require an <em>intervening </em>conviction. Riggs argues the sparse legislative history of the ACCA implicates a need for an intervening conviction for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>two prior convictions to be considered separate and distinct. But he fails to cite any authority that persuades us the ACCA was necessarily limited in this way. Because our controlling precedent is clear on how to determine whether two convictions are distinct \u2014 i.e., they \u201carise from separate criminal transactions\u201d and are for offenses \u201cdistinct in time\u201d \u2014 the district court did not commit any obvious error. Therefore, Riggs\u2019s contention fails the first two steps of plain error review and this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Second, Riggs asserts the district court\u2019s imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence under the ACCA violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. He cites the American Bar Association\u2019s Standards for Criminal Justice,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which he then argues evince \u201cour society\u2019s evolving standards\u201d and that his mandatory minimum sentence under the ACCA \u201cviolates the Eighth Amendment.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 20. As further evidence, he makes oblique references to a commission recommendation as well as to a Supreme Court dissent which argued for an abolishment of mandatory minimum sentences. We, as well as every other circuit to consider such Eighth Amendment challenges, have found mandatory m\u00ednimums under the ACCA constitutional and not cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See United States v. Angelos, </em>433 F.3d 738, 750-53 (10th Cir.2006) (finding mandatory minimum sentences \u201cwere intended by Congress to (a) protect society by incapacitating those criminals who demonstrate a willingness to repeatedly engage in serious felonies while in possession of firearms, and (b) to deter criminals from possessing firearms during the course of certain felonies\u201d and noting \u201cboth of these penological theories have been held by the Supreme Court to be valid and subject to deference by the courts\u201d); <em>United States v. Tenderholt, </em>149 Fed.Appx. 805, 810-11 (10th Cir.2005) (\u201c[Ejvery circuit that has addressed an Eighth Amendment challenge to a sentence imposed under the ACCA has upheld it.... [T]he Supreme Court expressly recognized that prior convictions are relevant to the sentencing decision. ... Notably, in enacting the ACCA, Congress chose to respond to this precise type of scenario by infusing federal law enforcement into efforts at curbing and incapacitating armed, habitual (career) criminals.\u201d (citations and quotations omitted)); <em>see also United States v. Helm, </em>502 F.3d 366 (5th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The law is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>on this issue and the district court did not commit plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Finally, Riggs argues the district court erred in applying the ACCA mandatory minimum sentence because he was denied the benefit of individualized sentencing. According to Riggs, the district court violated his due process rights when it failed to exercise its discretion and failed to consider all the \u201ccharacteristics \u2014 related to the person and offenses \u2014 that constitute the make-up and personality of Michael Riggs and the facts of the crimes of which he had been convicted; and without utilizing its training, experience, and conscience.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Like his arguments above, we have previously rejected similar due process contentions. In <em>United States v. Hatch, </em>we found:</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Hatch also contends that the mandatory sentence imposed by section 924(c) violates his constitutional rights.... [T]he gravamen of his contention is not that the sentence is disproportionate to the crime, but that the sentence is disproportionate in this case because the mandatory term removes the judge\u2019s sentencing discretion. Hatch is in substance attacking the mandatory sentence on due process grounds. The circuits which have specifically addressed this argument have rejected it. <em>See United States v. Hamblin, </em>911 F.2d 551, 555-56 (11th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Wilkins, </em>911 F.2d 387, 339-40 (9th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Goodface, </em>835 F.2d 1233, 1236-37 (8th Cir.1987). These opinions base their decisions on Supreme Court cases stating that the authority to define and fix the punishment for felony convictions is purely a matter of legislative prerogative, and that the prevailing practice of individualizing sentencing determinations generally reflects simply enlightened policy rather than a constitutional imperative .... The Supreme Court has clearly indicated that a mandatory minimum sentence which dictates the precise weight a particular factor must be given is not unconstitutional. Accordingly, we conclude that the mandatory sentence imposed by section 924(c) does not deny due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">925 F.2d 362, 363 (10th Cir.1991) (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Butters, </em>267 Fed.Appx. 773, 777 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201cThere is ... no due process right to a discretionary, individualized sentence in a noncapital case.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Like \u00a7 924(c), \u00a7 924(e) is the result of Congressional prerogative and its mandatory minimum sentences are based on a \u201cprecise weight [of] particular factor^].\u201d <em>Hatch, </em>925 F.2d at 363. Therefore, the district court did not commit plain error with respect to Riggs\u2019s due process rights in its application of the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">For the foregoing reasons we conclude the district court did not err in finding Riggs\u2019s three prior convictions were distinct, violent felonies under the ACCA and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>in imposing the commensurate mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b833-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-17\">. Section 924(e)(1) states: \"In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony ... committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be ... imprisoned not less than fifteen years....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b834-6\">. On appeal, Riggs does not challenge the classification of his 2002 second-degree burglary conviction as a violent felony under the ACCA. Consequently, we only address his Fifth and Sixth Amendment arguments in the context of his prior armed robbery convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b834-7\">. We have repeatedly stated \"[u]nless and until the Supreme Court determines otherwise, we will continue to follow applicable precedent,\u201d including our precedent which holds the application of the ACCA is a question for the sentencing court which need not be tried to a jury. <em>Harris, </em>447 F.3d at 1303 n. 1 (stating that despite \"recent doubts expressed by some members of the Supreme Court,\u201d the prior conviction exception remains applicable circuit precedent); <em>United States v. Michel, </em>446 F.3d 1122, 1133 n. 4 (10th Cir.2006) (rejecting the argument that the prior conviction exception laid out in <em>Apprendi, </em>which found its genesis in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is in decline); <em>Moore, </em>401 F.3d at 1224 (\"Although the Court may overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>at some point in the future, it has not done so, we will not presume to do so for the Court, and we are bound by existing precedent____\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\">.

However, just because the burglaries took place on the same night at the same general location did not necessarily require the court to find a single criminal episode had occurred. <em>Id. </em>Rather, in holding the defendant's three burglary convictions were distinct under the ACCA, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">Here, it is clear the defendant could not simultaneously burglarize three separate businesses____ After the defendant \"successfully completed\u201d burglarizing one business, he was free to leave.

Moreover, ... the defendant\u2019s burglaries did not occur at the same location.

In <em>Helm, </em>the Fifth Circuit dealt with the same argument and rejected it stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-11\">[Defendant] argues that the application of \u00a7 924(e) to him amounts to a punishment grossly disproportionate to the crime committed.
