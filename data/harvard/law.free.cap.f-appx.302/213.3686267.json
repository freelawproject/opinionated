We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2008). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Ndeh </em>(B.I.A. Mar. 25, 2008).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-26\"> We lack jurisdiction over Ndeh\u2019s argument that he effectively withdrew his request for voluntary departure on the ground that he failed to raise this claim before the Board. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2006) (\"A court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d); <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 359 n. 2 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that the court lacks jurisdiction to consider an argument that was not raised before the Board); <em>Astka v.
