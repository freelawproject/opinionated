We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b529-20\">On February 20, 2003, Coffey was charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, i.e., crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. During trial, the government presented its case through the testimony of one police officer and five co-conspirators. The co-conspirators, including Roderick Jennings, all testified pursuant to cooperating plea agreements. The jury found Coffey guilty. The district court sentenced Coffey to 324 months imprisonment, a five-year term of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Coffey appealed his conviction and sentence. We affirmed. <em>United States v. Coffey, </em>415 F.3d 882 (8th Cir.2005) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">On December 11, 2006, Coffey filed motions for a new trial, for an evidentiary hearing on this motion, and to suspend ruling on this motion pending submission of an additional supporting affidavit. As grounds for the motion for a new trial, Coffey argues Jennings recanted his trial testimony. As support, he submitted an affidavit by an inmate, referred to herein for anonymity purposes as \u201cC.\u201d C was told by Tony Alexander, another inmate, that Jennings told him he had fabricated his testimony at Coffey\u2019s trial. Coffey also asked the court to suspend ruling on the motion for a new trial until an additional affidavit could be provided from another witness \u201cwho can provide additional evidence in favor\u201d of the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">On February 22, 2008, 2008 WL 510141, the district court denied Coffey\u2019s motions. The court found, even assuming Jennings recanted his testimony, substantial evidence existed to support the guilty verdict. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Coffey\u2019s motion for a new trial. To the extent C\u2019s affidavit would be offered to impeach Jennings\u2019s testimony, such impeachment is insufficient to warrant a new trial. In addition, Jennings\u2019s recantation is not likely to produce an acquittal because of the strength of the evidence against Coffey.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">In order to prevail on his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, Coffey must demonstrate: \u201c(1) the evidence was unknown or unavailable at the time of trial, (2) the defendant did not lack diligence in attempting to uncover it, (3) the newly found evidence is material, and (4) the evidence is likely to produce an acquittal if a new trial is granted.\u201d <em>United States v. Grover, </em>511 F.3d 779, 783 (8th Cir.2007). \u201c[I]n order to meet the materiality requirement, newly discovered evidence must be \u2018more than merely ... impeaching.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>479 F.3d 574, 577 (8th Cir.2007) (ellipses in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Dogskin, </em>265 F.3d 682, 685 (8th Cir.2001)). We review the denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Rojas, </em>520 F.3d 876, 884 (8th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Assuming it could avoid the hearsay problem, C\u2019s affidavit would be offered merely to impeach Jennings\u2019s testimony, which is insufficient to warrant a new trial. <em>See Baker, </em>479 F.3d at 577 (collecting cases). Moreover, Jennings\u2019s alleged post-trial admission to Alexander constitutes recanted testimony, so \u201cwe view it and its potential evidentiary value at a new trial with suspicion.\u201d <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>421 F.3d 683, 688 (8th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Rouse, </em>410 F.3d 1005, 1009 (8th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe stability and finality of verdicts would be greatly disturbed if courts were too ready to entertain testimony from witnesses who have changed their minds, or who claim to have lied at the trial.\u201d). Although \u201crecanted testimony that bears ... directly on the defendant\u2019s guilt will warrant a new trial if it would probably produce an acquittal upon retrial,\u201d <em>Dogskin, </em>265 F.3d at 685, Jennings\u2019s recantation is not likely to do so, given the substantial evidence demonstrating Coffey\u2019s guilt. The other co-conspirators\u2019 testimony sufficiently demonstrated Coffey bought and sold large quantities of crack cocaine. <em>See United States v. Coffey, </em>395 F.3d 856, 860 (8th Cir.2005) (vacated on other grounds) (relying on testimony by co-conspirators other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>than Jennings to conclude the \u201cthe government\u2019s evidence showed that Coffey was deeply involved in a conspiracy to distribute crack\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Coffey has thus failed to demonstrate the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Because the judge who ruled on the motion for a new trial also presided over Coffey\u2019s trial and Coffey has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances warranting an evidentiary hearing, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Coffey\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">We review the denial of a motion for an evidentiary hearing on a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Rojas, </em>520 F.3d 876, 884 (8th Cir.2008). \u201cAbsent exceptional circumstances, a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence may be decided on affidavits without a hearing.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>479 F.3d at 579 (quoting <em>Dogskin, </em>265 F.3d at 687). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he necessity for a hearing is lessened in cases involving challenged testimony where the trial judge has had the opportunity to observe the demeanor and weigh the credibility of the witness at trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Having conducted Coffey\u2019s trial, the district court knew the facts of the case and had observed the witnesses and evidence. Therefore, the district court was able to determine the impact of the newly discovered evidence on Jennings\u2019s testimony and the strength of the government\u2019s case against Coffey. Because Coffey does not present exceptional circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for an evidentiary hearing on the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Coffey\u2019s motion to suspend ruling on his motion for new trial. Coffey asserts he has a witness who could provide evidence in favor of his new trial motion; however, he needs additional time to secure the person\u2019s affidavit. He provided no other details to the district court (or this Court). In addition, although his motion to suspend ruling was ultimately denied, Coffey had over six months to provide the district court with the affidavit of the alleged additional witness, and did not so do. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-9\">. The Honorable Laurie S. Camp, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
