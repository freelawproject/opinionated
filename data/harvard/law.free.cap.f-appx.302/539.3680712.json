Kim appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We have jurisdiction under to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">Kim contends that the district court erred by denying his motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines Amendment 634, which took effect November 1, 2001, because the Amendment should be applied to his sentence retroactively. We conclude that the district court did not err because the Guidelines list of retroactive amendments does not include Amendment 634, and only expressly retroactive amendments may be applied based upon a motion brought under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Cueto, </em>9 F.3d 1438, 1440-41 (9th Cir.1993); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">Kim also makes several collateral attacks on his sentence. We decline to address these contentions because they are outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and do not concern actions by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See Carrington v. United States, </em>503 F.3d 888, 890-91 (9th Cir. 2007), <em>amended by </em>530 F.3d 1183 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">Kim\u2019s pending motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b566-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
