Aviles, Ba-chiller, and Gomez pleaded not guilty. After a trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts against each defendant on each count charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">The district court sentenced Gomez to life imprisonment on Counts 1 and 2, 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 3 and 4, and 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 6, to be served concurrently. The district court also sentenced him to 84 months on Count 5 to be served consecutively to the term imposed on Counts 1 and 2. Bachiller and Aviles each received a sentence of life imprisonment on Counts 1 and 2, 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 3 and 4, and 180 months on Count 6, to be served concurrently, and 84 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 5 to run consecutively to the terms imposed on Counts 1 and 2. Defendants then perfected their appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">The issues presented on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">1. Whether sufficient evidence supports Bachiller\u2019s and Gomez\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">2. Whether the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of other crimes as inextricably intertwined and pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">3. Whether the district court abused its discretion by allowing the government to cross-examine Bachiller about the nature of his prior convictions, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">4. Whether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in closing argument denied Bachiller a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">5. Whether 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 851(e) are unconstitutional as applied to Aviles\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">6. Whether the district court incorrectly calculated Gomez\u2019s and Bachiller\u2019s advisory guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-16\">We review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction <em>de novo. United States v. McDowell, </em>250 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-17\">\u201cThis court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Dodds, </em>347 F.3d 893, 897 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1330-32 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-18\">Absent a contemporaneous objection, we review for plain error a prosecutorial misconduct claim based on improper vouching. <em>United States v. Newton, </em>44 F.3d 913, 920 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-19\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>constitutional challenges to a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number><em>Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1144 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of drug quantity used to establish a defendant\u2019s base offense level for clear error. <em>See United States v. McVay, </em>447 F.3d 1348, 1352-53 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that there is no merit to any of the arguments defendants make in this appeal. Accordingly, we affirm their convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
