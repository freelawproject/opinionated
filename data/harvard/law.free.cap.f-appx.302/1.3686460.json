Dec. 10, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 433 665 (Immg. Ct. N.Y. City, Jan. 24, 2006). Familiarity with the record and the issues raised on this appeal is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-23\">As a preliminary matter, because Diop does not address the agency\u2019s pretermission of his asylum application or the agency\u2019s denial of his application for CAT relief, we deem challenges to those determinations waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir. 2005). Accordingly, we review only Diop\u2019s challenge to the denial of his application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>When, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in some respects but not others, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding, process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">The BIA rejected the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and assumed that Diop demonstrated past persecution. However, the BIA concluded that because a fundamental change in circumstances had occurred in Mauritania, Diop had not shown a future threat to life or freedom. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i)(A) (providing that an IJ may deny withholding or removal if there has been a \u201cfundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would not be threatened on account of any of the [five protected grounds] upon that applicant\u2019s removal to the country\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">We find the BIA\u2019s decision sufficiently flawed because the BIA (1) based it view of changed circumstances in Mauritania on findings drawn from the 2004 U.S. Department of State Country Report (\u201cReport\u201d) that may not be applicable to the petitioner; and (2) appeared to ignore information in the Report suggesting the petitioner\u2019s ethnic group may face persecution in Mauritania. The BIA based its determination of changed circumstances in part on excerpts from the Report suggesting that prospects for the Black Moor ethnic group in Mauritania had improved, noting the Mauritanian \u201cgovernment is making strides in appointing Black Moors in positions within government\u201d and that Black Moors were recently appointed to two high-level government positions. The petitioner, however, is not a Black Moor, but a Wolof, so the Report\u2019s analysis of the experience of Black Moors is not especially relevant or helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Black Moors and Wolofs are two very different groups. Black Moors are part of the dominant Moor ethnic group in Mauritania, a group that itself subdivides into \u201cWhite Moors\u201d and \u201cBlack Moors.\u201d Wolofs, who principally reside in the south, are one of several groups that make up the \u201cBlack African\u201d ethnic group, which is distinct from the Moor ethnicity. The expulsion of blacks out of Mauritania and into Senegal in 1989-91, which the petitioner purports to have been the source of his persecution, confronted the Wolofs and other \u201cBlack African\u201d groups, but not Black Moors. Consequently, the current prospects of Black Moors in Mauritania may not be indicative of the circumstances facing Wolofs. Similarly, although the BIA noted that, according to the Report, :many refugees have had their original homes, some personal property, and at least a portion of their original land returned to them by the Mauritanian government, the Report did not indicate that this was true of members of the petitioner\u2019s Wolof ethnic group.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Moreover, the BIS\u2019s decision does not address the portions of the Report suggesting that Wolofs may still face persecution on the basis of ethnicity in Mauritania. Unlike the Report\u2019s assessment of the progress of Black Moors in Mauritania, the Report made no statement affirming the progress of Wolofs in rising to high-level political positions. Rather, the Report indicated that Wolofs \u201cwere underrepresented in the military and security sectors,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>that \u201cWolofs were underrepresented in senior government positions,\u201d and that \u201c[ejthnic tensions continued, and the largely southern-based ethnic groups [like the Wolofs] remained underrepresented in political life, and some of their members felt excluded from effective political representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Because the BIA appears not to have appreciated the ethnic group to which the petitioner belonged, we find the BIA\u2019s decisionmaking process flawed. Accordingly, the petition for vacatur of the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal is hereby GRANTED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings on petitioner\u2019s claims consistent with this order. Any pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
