(FMC) challenge the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on its fraud claims based on non-reliance language contained in the parties\u2019 settlement agreement. FMC also maintains that the district court erroneously dismissed its claims for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-25\">The district court properly granted summary judgment, as Washington law supports the conclusion that the settlement agreement\u2019s non-reliance language pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>eluded FMC\u2019s fraud claims. <em>See Kwiatkowski v. Drews, </em>142 Wash.App. 463, 176 P.3d 510, 519, <em>review denied, </em>164 Wash.2d 1005, 190 P.3d 54 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">In any event, summary judgment was warranted because \u201cin the context of a contentious adversarial relationship, reliance on misrepresentations or omissions is unreasonable as a matter of law between the parties negotiating a settlement agreement[J\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The district court also properly dismissed FMC\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty claims because the settlement agreement\u2019s specific contractual terms do not impose a duty to cooperate or a duty to disclose information. <em>See Seattle-First Nat. Bank v. Westwood Lumber, Inc., </em>65 Wash.App. 811, 829 P.2d 1152, 1156 (1992) (\u201c[T]he duty of good faith does not add substantive terms to the parties\u2019 contract. Instead, it requires only that the parties perform in good faith the obligations imposed by their agreement. Thus, the duty arises only in connection with terms agreed to by the parties.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>see also Kwiatkowski, </em>176 P.3d at 518.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b603-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
