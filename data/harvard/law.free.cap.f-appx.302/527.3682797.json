We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1018 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-15\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum because the single incident of physical harm Juma experienced did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1021. Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Juma failed to demonstrate that his fear of returning to Ethiopia is objectively reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 1022. Thus, Juma\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-16\">Because Juma did not establish eligibility for asylum, it necessarily follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-17\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Juma failed to establish that it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to Ethiopia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b554-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
