Kahn, United States District Judge for the Northern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b70-5\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Defendant-Appellant Andrea Nunez pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to conspiracy to distribute and possess, with the intent to distribute, cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Nunez appeals her sentence of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, five years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, and the issues presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Nunez pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement, which stipulated that the applicable Guidelines sentencing range was 135-168 months in prison. The district court sentenced Nunez to 135 months in prison, at the bottom of the range. Nunez argues that her case, and \u201call pending cases involving sentencing issues\u201d should be remanded for re-sentencing to give the judge the opportunity to reconsider the sentence in light of <em>Gall v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), a case decided after Nunez\u2019s sentencing. But, Nunez fails to explain how <em>Gall </em>allegedly affected district court judges\u2019 sentencing decisions in a case such as the one before us, except to say that <em>Gall </em>\u201cclearly recognized a great discretion in the district court to depart from the advisory guidelines where appropriate after considering all of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d While <em>Gall </em>contains some statements regarding proper sentencing procedures by district court judges, <em>see, e.g., Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594, 596-597, 598, they essentially reiterate the previously established requirements under <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), all of which were complied with by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">Under the terms of the plea agreement, moreover, Nunez agreed not to appeal \u201cany sentence within or below the Stipulated Guidelines Range\u201d set forth in the plea agreement. Because the Stipulated Guidelines Range in the plea agreement was 135-168 months in prison, and Nunez received a sentence of 135 months in prison, the waiver provision applies. <em>See, e.g. United States v. Haynes, </em>412 F.3d 37, 38-39 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam) (holding waiver enforceable when appeal was filed <em>post-Booker </em>and plea agreement was signed <em>pre-Booker). </em>Nunez is therefore foreclosed from appealing her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
