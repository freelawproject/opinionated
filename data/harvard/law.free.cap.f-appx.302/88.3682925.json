We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">Because we write only for the parties, we recite only those facts that are relevant to our analysis. Scuderi applied for DIB on September 13, 2002, when he was forty-six years old, alleging disability due to syringomyelia. Scuderi\u2019s application was initially denied, and a hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). On July 29, 2004, the ALJ issued a decision evaluating Scuderi\u2019s claim pursuant to the five-step sequential analysis in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520 and denying benefits. The Appeals Council reversed, however, finding that the ALJ should have obtained updated medical records, ordered a post-hearing consultative examination in the absence of current records, and consulted a vocational expert at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">A second hearing was held before the ALJ, and a vocational expert testified. On February 1, 2006, the ALJ again denied benefits, and, on March 17, 2006, the Appeals Council denied Scuderi\u2019s request for review. Scuderi appealed to the District Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). In a detailed opinion examining all of Scuderi\u2019s medical records and analyzing all of the testimony, the Court found that the Commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and upheld the Commissioner\u2019s final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-16\">Scuderi now argues that the ALJ erred when she: (1) failed to adequately consider whether Scuderi met Listing 11.19B, (2) failed to explain and identify which evidence supported and did not support her residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) finding and failed to consider the effect of Scuderi\u2019s pain in her RFC evaluation, and (3) relied on testimony from a vocational expert in response to inaccurate and inapplicable hypotheticals.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-18\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. As did the District Court, we review the ALJ\u2019s application of law de novo, and we review the ALJ\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Poulos v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>474 F.3d 88, 91 (3d Cir.2007). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Newell v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>347 F.3d 541, 545 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-19\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-20\">A. Step Three: Whether Claimant Meets a Listing of Impairment</p>\n<p id=\"b115-22\">Scuderi argues that the ALJ erred at step three of the 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>analysis because she did not specifically identify which Listing she was considering and did not adequately explain why Scuderi, despite his severe impairment, did not meet any Listing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Burnett v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>220 F.3d 112, 119-20 (3d Cir.2000), we held that an ALJ must provide an explanation of his or her reasoning at step three in order to allow us to engage in meaningful judicial review. As the District Court recognized, however, we also held in <em>Jones v. Barnhart, </em>364 F.3d 501, 505 (3d Cir.2004), that an ALJ need not \u201cuse particular language or adhere to a particular format in conducting his analysis.\u201d We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-4\">Rather, the function of <em>Burnett </em>is to ensure that there is sufficient development of the record and explanation of findings to permit meaningful review. In this case, the ALJ\u2019s decision, read as a whole, illustrates that the ALJ considered the appropriate factors in reaching the conclusion that [the claimant] did not meet the requirements for any listing\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><em>Jones, </em>364 F.3d at 505 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Thus, an ALJ need not specifically mention any of the listed impairments in order to make a judicially reviewable finding, provided that the ALJ\u2019s decision clearly analyzes and evaluates the relevant medical evidence as it relates to the Listing requirements. In this case, Listing 11.19B for syringomyelia is potentially applicable, and it requires \u201c[disorganization of motor function as described in 11.04B.\u201d 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1. Listing 11.04B requires \u201c[significant and persistent disorganization of motor function in two extremities, resulting in sustained disturbance of gross and dexterous movements, or gait and station.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The ALJ\u2019s decision reflects adequate consideration of the \u201cdisorganization of motor function\u201d requirement of Listing 11.19B, despite the fact that that specific Listing is not highlighted. The ALJ reviewed all of the medical evidence and accurately concluded from the opinions of Drs. Anthony Frempong-Boadu and Richard Siegfried that, except for decreased fine finger movements in his left hand and decreased sensation in his left upper extremity, Scuderi has normal motor, sensory, and reflex functions in the lower and upper extremities. The ALJ also noted that Scuderi reports being able to drive when necessary and perform housekeeping tasks including meal preparation, vacuuming, and shopping. Thus, the ALJ found, in a conclusion supported by substantial evidence, that Scuderi does not have significant and persistent disorganization of motor function in two or more extremities. The ALJ\u2019s analysis was sufficient to permit meaningful judicial review of her conclusion at step three of the sequential analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">B. Step Four: Determination of Residual Functional Capacity</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">Scuderi also argues that the ALJ did not provide an adequate evidentiary foundation to support the RFC determination. The ALJ ultimately determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGC\">claimant has the [RFC] to lift light objects, such as those weighing up to twenty pounds, and sit, stand, and walk as needed, but cannot perform more than occasional reaching, pushing, pulling or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tasks requiring feeling with the left upper extremity and non-dominant hand. Additionally, as the result of his medication, the claimant is unable to engage in complex or detailed tasks on a sustained basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">(A-21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In <em>Cotter v. Harris, </em>642 F.2d 700, 705 (3d Cir.1981), we held that an ALJ must discuss not only the evidence that supports his or her decision, but also the evidence that was rejected. The ALJ did so here. She analyzed the opinions of Scuderi\u2019s treating physicians, Drs. Frempong-Boadu, Siegfried, Motz, and Spinapolice, and the opinion of Dr. Weber, a physician who examined Scuderi on behalf of New Jersey\u2019s Disability Determination Services (\u201cDDS\u201d). Her ultimate conclusion is consistent with the opinions of Drs. Frempong-Boadu and Weber. Dr. Frempong-Boadu recommended that Scuderi avoid all heavy lifting and any work requiring the use of fine finger movements with his left hand. Dr. Weber found that Scuderi cannot do heavy lifting, is limited in his ability to push and pull with his upper extremities and in his abilities to reach and feel, and should avoid hazards due to limitations in his ability to balance. Another assessment from an unidentified DDS physician reports similar limitations. All of these limitations and conditions were taken into account in the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">To be sure, the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination is inconsistent with the reports of Dr. Motz and Scuderi\u2019s own statements about how his impairment affects his abilities. The ALJ explained, however, why she rejected these reports in favor of the reports by Drs. Frempong-Boadu and Weber, as required by <em>Cotter. </em>In addition to the limitations found by Drs. Frempong-Boadu and Weber, Dr. Motz found that Scuderi had a complete inability to balance and a limitation on his ability to stand or walk more than 15 feet. The ALJ explained that she placed less reliance on Dr. Motz\u2019s opinion because Dr. Motz \u201cprovided no specifics with respect to the degree of limitations imposed.\u201d (A-22, <em>see </em>Motz\u2019s RFC report at A-258-61.) Indeed, Dr. Motz\u2019s report provides little detail about Scuderi\u2019s impairments and stated that it was \u201cunknown\u201d how many pounds Scuderi would be able to lift or carry and how many hours Scuderi would be able to stand or walk in an 8-hour work day. The ALJ also explained that, based on Scuderi\u2019s continued activity level, his statements concerning the intensity, duration, and limiting effects of his impairments were not entirely credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Scuderi argues, for the first time, that the ALJ did not give adequate consideration to his complaints of pain. The ALJ\u2019s decision, however, specifically discussed treatment records from Ronald Spinapolice, D.O., a pain management specialist, whose most recent progress notes from 2005 state that Scuderi was \u201cdoing well [and] offers no complaints, with good pain relief\u2019 from the medications. (A-293.) The ALJ took Scuderi\u2019s pain into account in her RFC determination when she recognized Scuderi\u2019s need for constant pain medication and found that, due to the medication\u2019s side effects, he cannot engage in complex or detailed tasks on a sustained basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">C. Step Five: Availability of Jobs in the National Economy</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">Finally, Scuderi argues that the ALJ erred at step five of the analysis when she relied on testimony from the vocational expert that, he alleges, was given in response to hypotheticals not corresponding to the RFC determination eventually reached by the ALJ. Several hypotheticals were posed to the vocational expert by both the ALJ and by counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>for Scuderi, but the hypothetical relied on by the ALJ<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> involved a person who could do light work, with no frequent push-pull with the upper extremities, no ladders, ropes, or scaffolds, only occasional climbing of ramps and stairs, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling, no frequent fine fingering, and no hazards. The vocational expert responded that a person with this RFC could work as a Marker, DOT 209.587-034, or as a Sales Attendant, DOT 299.677-010. The ALJ thereafter confirmed that this hypothetical person would be employable provided that he could concentrate at a simple level, and if he could not do so, he would not be employable.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">This hypothetical compares favorably with the ALJ\u2019s ultimate RFC determination that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">claimant has the [RFC] to lift light objects, such as those weighing up to twenty pounds, and sit, stand, and walk as needed, but cannot perform more than occasional reaching, pushing, pulling or tasks requiring feeling with the left upper extremity and non-dominant hand. Additionally, as the result of his medication, the claimant is unable to engage in complex or detailed tasks on a sustained basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">(A-21.) While the hypothetical did not take into consideration the effect of Scuderi\u2019s pain medication on his ability to do work-related activities, the ALJ did follow up on the hypothetical to include consideration of Scuderi\u2019s ability to concentrate at a simple level. Therefore, the ALJ did not err when she relied on the vocational expert\u2019s testimony in response to this hypothetical.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the decision of the District Court affirming the decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\">. Scuderi raised this issue before the Appeals Council after the ALJ\u2019s decision of July 29, 2004, and argues that the Appeals Council remanded in part because of it. <em>(See </em>Appellant's Br. at 29.) We disagree. The Appeals Council found that \u201d[i]t seems fairly clear that the present record does not establish that the listing is met or equaled.\u201d (A-40.) It did not hold that the AU erred at step three and did not remand on that basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\">. Although Scuderi argues to the contrary, the ALJ did make clear which hypothetical she was relying on because she stated in her decision that, in response to the hypothetical, the vocational expert answered that the person would be able to perform the requirements of the \u201cMarker\u201d occupation, DOT 209.587-034. Review of the transcript indicates that the vocational expert gave \"Marker\u201d as an answer to only one hypothetical.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
