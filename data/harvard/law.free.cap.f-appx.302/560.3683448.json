The magistrate judge below gave this case careful and deliberate attention, and, like him, we are troubled that Luna\u2019s conviction and thirty-six-year sentence rest on testimony that has been recanted many times over. However, under clearly established Supreme Court law, the mere fact that the evidence upon which Luna was convicted \u2014 namely, the testimony of his then-wife that he raped her on two separate occasions \u2014 has been cast into serious doubt is not enough to grant the relief he requests. Rather, under <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959), and <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), in order to prevail Luna must demonstrate both that the evidence used to convict him was false and that the prosecutor knew or should have known that this was the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-22\">We need not sift through the various recantations, recantations of recantations, or the competing testimony offered at the evidentiary hearing below in order to resolve this appeal. That evidence goes to the first <em>Agurs </em>prong \u2014 whether Luna\u2019s conviction rests on false evidence. It may well do so. But it is the failure to satisfy the second prong that compels affirmance under the law that binds us. As Luna\u2019s own habeas counsel stated below, \u201cwhen all is said and done, this case boils down to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>one question: \u2018Who is more credible, [the trial prosecutor] or [Mrs.] Luna?\u2019 \u201d The magistrate judge found the prosecutor to be more credible, and we are in no position to displace that conclusion on this record. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>256 F.3d 922, 932 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[The Court of Appeals is] in no position to make a credibility assessment on a cold record.\u201d); <em>United States v. Steel, </em>759 F.2d 706, 714 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201c[T]he district court is in a far better position than are we to judge credibility. ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The magistrate concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence that the deputy district attorney knew or should have known that [Mrs.] Luna was lying at trial.\u201d Given that Mrs. Luna changed her story repeatedly \u2014 first testifying that her husband raped her, then recanting her testimony, then recanting the recantation, then partially recanting <em>that </em>recantation, and ultimately pleading the Fifth Amendment and refusing to set the record straight \u2014 it is no surprise that the magistrate judge credited the prosecutor\u2019s testimony over hers. It is nevertheless disturbing that a man who may be innocent has been sentenced to prison, and for a term of thirty-six years. At this point, only a parole board or a governor has the authority to correct what may be a serious injustice. We have no alternative but to affirm the magistrate\u2019s holding that the petitioner has not established \u201cthat the prosecution\u2019s case include^] perjured testimony and that the prosecution knew, or should have known, of the perjury.\u201d <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. at 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b586-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
