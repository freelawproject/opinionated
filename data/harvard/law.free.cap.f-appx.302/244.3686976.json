FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b271-20\">Netherland took up a position outside of Sidelines Grill (\u201cSidelines\u201d) on the evening of November 18, 2006. The parties disagree about what happened next. Nether-land claims that he was quoting Biblical scripture in a loud voice, including I Corinthians 5:9, saying \u201cKnow ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Neither fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, abusers of themselves with mankind, covetous, thieves, revelers, none of these shall enter into the Kingdom of God.\u201d He states that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>speaking from a grassy public easement between the Sidelines parking lot and the road. The City claims that Netherland was standing in the parking lot yelling at Sidelines customers that they were fornicators and whores and they were condemned to Hell for going inside the establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The police were called and Netherland was eventually threatened with arrest if he did not stop. He left the scene and later sued for damages, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201-02, alleging infringement of his First Amendment rights. Netherland also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which the district court granted after a hearing. The district court made several findings of fact, but granted the injunction on the ground that the Ordinance was unconstitutional on its face due to vagueness and overbreadth.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In order to obtain a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion on four elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">(1) a substantial likelihood that plaintiff will prevail on the merits, (2) a substantial threat that plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted, (3) that the threatened injury to plaintiff outweighs the threatened harm the injunction may do to defendant, and (4) that granting the preliminary injunction will not disserve the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-8\"><em>Canal Auth. of Fla. v. Callaway, </em>489 F.2d 567, 572 (5th Cir.1974). Each of these elements is a mixed question of law and fact where we review the factual findings of the district court for clear error and the legal conclusions <em>de novo. Hoover v. Morales, </em>164 F.3d 221, 224 (5th Cir.1998). A facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute, however, presents a pure question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Ctr. for Individual Freedom v. Carmouche, </em>449 F.3d 655, 662 (5th Cir.2006). \u201c[T]he ultimate decision whether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion,\u201d but if the decision is based on erroneous legal principles, it is reviewed <em>de novo. Hoover, </em>164 F.3d at 224; <em>Women\u2019s Med. Ctr. of Nw. Houston v. Bell, </em>248 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">The City\u2019s only basis for appeal is that the district court erred in evaluating Netherland\u2019s likelihood of prevailing on the merits by finding the Ordinance unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">Courts must \u201cproceed with caution and restraint\u201d when considering a facial challenge to the overbreadth and vagueness of a law. <em>Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 216, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975). \u201c[A] court\u2019s first task is to determine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d <em>Vill. of Hoffman Estates v. The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 494, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). In evaluating such a challenge, \u201ca federal court must, of course, consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n. 5; <em>see also Ward v. Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. 781, 795-96, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989). In the absence of a limiting construction from a state court, federal courts should \u201cpresume any narrowing construction or practice to which the law is fairly susceptible.\u201d <em>City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ\u2019g Co., </em>486 U.S. 750, 770 n. 11, 108 S.Ct. 2138, 100 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Erznoznik, </em>422 U.S. at 216, 95 S.Ct. 2268.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>In declaring the Ordinance unconstitutional on its face, the district court failed to consider any narrowing construction from Louisiana courts or determine, in the absence of state court decisions, if the Ordinance is \u201cfairly susceptible\u201d to a narrowing construction. The doctrines of overbreadth and vagueness apply to laws as construed by state courts \u2014 or as easily susceptible to construction by those courts \u2014 not as written. <em>See Osborne v. Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, 119-20, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990). The language of the Ordinance is identical to the general Louisiana disturbing the peace statute, La. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 14:103, and at least part of that statute has been given a limiting construction by the Louisiana Supreme Court. <em>See State v. Jordan, </em>369 So.2d 1347, 1350 (La.1979) (interpreting a local disturbing the peace ordinance the same as the identically-worded state statute). \u201c[I]n such a manner as would foreseeably disturb or alarm the public\u201d has been interpreted to apply only to \u201cconduct which is violent or boisterous in itself, or which is provocative in the sense that it induces a foreseeable physical disturbance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>State v. Heck, </em>307 So.2d 332 (La. 1975); <em>see also Garner v. Louisiana, </em>368 U.S. 157, 166-67, 82 S.Ct. 248, 7 L.Ed.2d 207 (1961) (accepting this interpretation from the Louisiana Supreme Court).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We offer no opinion on whether the Ordinance as construed by the Louisiana Supreme Court is constitutional or whether subsection (a)(2) may be \u201cfairly susceptible\u201d to a narrowing construction. Possible narrowing constructions of the Ordinance were not fully argued on appeal, and so we vacate the preliminary injunction and remand this case to the district court for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">We would, however, note that \u201cfor reasons relating both to the proper functioning of courts and to their efficiency, the lawfulness of the particular application of the law should ordinarily be decided\u201d before considering a facial challenge. <em>Bd. of Trustees, State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, </em>492 U.S. 469, 485, 109 S.Ct. 3028, 106 L.Ed.2d 388 (1989). That is the \u201cusual judicial practice,\u201d and in a case such as this one where the district court has already made extensive findings of fact, it may be appropriate to first consider the application of the Ordinance to Netherland before engaging in the \u201cmore difficult\u201d problem of determining if the statute is unconstitutional on its face. <em>See id. </em>at 484-85, 109 S.Ct. 3028.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the preliminary injunction and REMAND to the district court for reconsideration in light of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-6\">. It is also interesting to note that the language of subsection (a)(2) is very similar to the language found constitutionally acceptable \u2014 with a sufficiently narrow construction \u2014 by the Supreme Court in <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 569, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942). <em>See also Coates v. City of Cincinnati, </em>402 U.S. 611, 613 n. 3, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971) (quoting approvingly of the limiting construction given the statute in <em>Chaplinsky </em>in a case with a much broader interpretation of the word \"annoying\").</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-12\">The New Hampshire statute at issue in <em>Chaplinsky </em>stated that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-13\">No person shall address any offensive, derisive or annoying word to any other person who is lawfully in any street or other public place, nor call him by any offensive or derisive name, nor make any noise or exclamation in his presence and hearing with intent to deride, offend or annoy him, or to prevent him from pursuing his lawful business or occupation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">315 U.S. at 569, 62 S.Ct. 766.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
