RomanSalgado argues that the district court clearly erred in denying his request for a safety valve adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(f). He argues that his refusal to answer questions about one of his cell phones should not have precluded the adjustment because the cell phone in question was given to him by his girlfriend, Miranda; the phone was not given to him in connection with his drug trafficking; the phone was not activated; and the phone was not used in connection with his drug trafficking. Roman-Salgado argues that, if this court does not find clear error with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of a safety valve adjustment, this court should remand the case to the district court because the district court failed to make adequate findings regarding its denial of the adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a safety valve adjustment for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 963-64 (5th Cir.1999). As Roman-Salgado did not argue at resentencing that the district court failed to make adequate factual findings in connection with its denial of the safety valve, our review of that issue is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">The district court made an independent determination, based upon the testimony of Agent Hardwich, that Roman-Salgado had not provided truthful information that qualified him for the safety valve adjustment. The district court found that Roman-Salgado\u2019s testimony that Miranda was simply his girlfriend was not credible and that Agent Hardwich\u2019s testimony that Miranda was a coconspirator was credible. The district court noted that Agent Hardwich\u2019s version of what Roman-Salgado said during his initial interview was corroborated by the agent\u2019s report of that interview, which was prepared shortly after arrest. Roman-Salgado has not shown error, plain or otherwise, with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of a safety valve adjustment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(f)(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2; <em>United States v. McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d 454, 457-58 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Powers, </em>168 F.3d 741, 753 (5th Cir.1999). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
