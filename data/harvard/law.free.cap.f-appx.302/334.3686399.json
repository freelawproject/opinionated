We should affirm if the injuries were \u201cwork related\u201d because the Inmate Accident Compensation Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4126, provides compensation as the exclusive remedy for inmates\u2019 work-related injuries, thus barring tort actions. If, however, as the inmates contend, their injuries cannot be labeled work related, we should reverse to allow their tort claims to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b360-25\">The plaintiffs are inmates at a \u201cfederal prison camp\u201d located next to the Federal Correctional Institution at Ashland, Kentucky. In this minimum-security satellite camp, non-violent prisoners live in dormi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>tory-style housing and provide labor to FCI Ashland. Bureau of Prisons buses transport the inmates from their dormitories to various work sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In early 2007, a Bureau of Prisons bus arrived to pick up the plaintiffs and other inmates at the prison camp and headed to FCI Ashland\u2019s garage, where the inmates were scheduled to mow the lawn. (The Bureau of Prisons required the inmates to ride this bus to the garage and compensated the inmates for their time on it. <em>See </em>JA 28, 39, 92, 139, 188.) Halfway there, the driver jerked the steering wheel after suffering a back spasm, causing the bus to careen off the road and crash into a tree. The impact fractured Plaintiff Baynes\u2019s leg in three places, fractured Plaintiff Rogers\u2019s hip, and caused blunt-force trauma to several areas of Plaintiff Sykes\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Seeking compensation for their injuries, the plaintiffs filed administrative tort claims with the Bureau of Prisons, alleging that prison officials negligently assigned a medically unfit driver to operate the bus. The Bureau denied the claims, advising the plaintiffs to seek compensation under \u00a7 4126. The plaintiffs then filed separate personal-injury actions in district court under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Agreeing with the Bureau of Prisons that \u00a7 4126 foreclosed the plaintiffs\u2019 suits, the district court dismissed all three complaints for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The plaintiffs now appeal, triggering our de novo review. <em>Pieper v. Am. Arbitration Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>336 F.3d 458, 460 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">In challenging the district court\u2019s dismissal of their tort claims, the plaintiffs contend that \u00a7 4126 does <em>not </em>provide compensation for their injuries. Akin to state workers\u2019 compensation systems, \u00a7 4126 compensates inmates injured during the course of penal employment, but, as typical in workers\u2019 compensation schemes, this compensation is offered in lieu of tort damages. <em>United States v. Demko, </em>385 U.S. 149, 151-54, 87 S.Ct. 382, 17 L.Ed.2d 258 (1966) (holding that inmates are barred from bringing Federal Tort Claims Act claims for work-related injuries); <em>see also Wooten v. United States, </em>825 F.2d 1039 (6th Cir.1987) (same). Preferring a chance at tort damages, the plaintiffs maintain that they are ineligible for the penal workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Section 4126\u2019s implementing regulations guide our analysis. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4126 (authorizing the Federal Prison Industries Fund to pay, \u201cunder rules and regulations promulgated by the Attorney General ... compensation to inmates or their dependents for injuries suffered in any industry or in any work activity in connection with the maintenance or operation of the institution in which the inmates are confined\u201d). The regulations provide that \u00a7 4126 will compensate inmates for \u201cwork-related injuries\u201d \u2014 i.e., \u201cany injury, including occupational disease or illness, proximately caused by the actual performance of the inmate\u2019s work assignment.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.102(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Conceding that they rode the bus \u201cin connection with\u201d their work, the plaintiffs point to another section of the regulations, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 301.301, that articulates the \u201ccoming and going rule\u201d typical of workers\u2019 compensation statutes in general, <em>see Demko, </em>385 U.S. at 152, 87 S.Ct. 382 (stating that \u00a7 4126 is patterned after \u201ccompensation laws all over the country,\u201d with differences to accommodate the differing circumstances of prisoners and non-prisoners). That section states: \u201c[CJompensation shall not be paid for injuries suffered away from the work location (e.g., while the claimant is going to or leaving work, or going to or coming from lunch outside of the work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>station or area).\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.301(c). The plaintiffs contend that they suffered non-work-related injuries on the bus ride because they had yet to arrive at the work area \u2014 FCI Ashland\u2019s garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The Bureau of Prisons counters that the prison bus itself counted as a \u201cwork location.\u201d The regulations do not define \u201cwork location\u201d or \u201cwork area,\u201d but we note that the Bureau of Prisons defines these terms as \u201canyplace the inmate is authorized to be performing his assignment.\u201d BOP Program Statement 1600.08, 19 (Aug.1999). Here, the assignment included traveling aboard the employer-operated bus to FCI Ashland\u2019s garage, a fact confirmed by the Bureau\u2019s payment of wages to the inmates for their travel time. <em>Cf </em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 14.06 (2008) (\u201c[A] demonstration that travel time was specifically paid for is one of the most reliable ways of making a case for the compensability of a going or coming trip, and is ordinarily sufficient in itself to support such a finding ....\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 15.01 (\u201cIf the trip to and from work is made in a truck, bus, van, car, or other vehicle under the control of the employer, an injury during that trip is incurred in the course of employment\u201d and compensable under workers\u2019 compensation.). And although the Bureau of Prisons provides all transportation for its prisoners, including for recreational, educational, and administrative purposes, here the bus took the plaintiffs to the prison\u2019s garage to mow the lawn. We thus agree with the Bureau of Prisons and the district court that the inmates\u2019 injuries were \u201cproximately caused by the actual performance of the inmate[s\u2019] work assignment[s].\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.102(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b362-7\">MARBLEY, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A-K\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">I dissent because the inmates\u2019 injuries were not \u201cwork related,\u201d barring recovery under the Inmate Accident Compensation Act but permitting the inmates to sue in tort. Section 4126\u2019s implementing regulations define a work related injury as \u201cany injury ... proximately caused by the <em>actual performance </em>of an inmate\u2019s work assignment.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.302 (emphasis added). More importantly, the regulations set forth a \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">compensation <em>shall not be paid </em>for injuries suffered away from the work location (e.g., while the claimant is going to or leaving work, <em>or going to or coming from lunch outside of the work station or </em>area).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">28 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.301(c) (emphasis added). The inmates were injured on their lunch break when their bus, operated by the Bureau of Prisons, crashed into a tree. At the time of the accident, the BOP bus was transporting them from their dormitory to an adjacent work site where they were assigned to mow the lawn. Notably, the regulations prohibit recovery under the Act in the very scenario before us today\u2014 where inmates sustain an injury outside of the work area while they were coming back from lunch. The language could not be more explicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">The majority disagrees on two grounds. First, they contend that the bus is a \u201cwork location\u201d because it was operated by the inmates\u2019 employer and their assignment included travel to the work site. (Maj. Op. 336). But as the majority concedes, the BOP is the <em>exclusive </em>provider of inmate transportation for both work and non-work related events. So the fact that the inmates were injured while riding their employer\u2019s bus is of little relevance to a determination of whether the bus constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>a \u201cwork location.\u201d And while the Inmate Accident Compensation Act is modeled after other workers\u2019 compensation laws which carve out an exception to the coming and going rule where the assignment requires travel <em>between </em>different work sites, that exception does not apply here. Plaintiffs\u2019 work required travel \u2014 obviously, getting to the grass is a sine qua non of mowing the lawn \u2014 but their assignments did not require travel <em>between </em>work locations. It was not therefore an integral aspect of their landscaping duties and this narrow exception does not apply. Which leads to the second argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The majority hangs its hat on the fact that the inmates were being paid at the time of the accident. But of course the inmates were being paid \u2014 they were on their lunch break. Almost all employees are paid during their lunch break irrespective of whether they leave the work area. I would at the very least remand the case to determine whether the inmates would have been paid during the lunch hour regardless of whether they rode the BOP bus. Ultimately, the regulations expressly preclude recovery for injuries sustained while an inmate is \u201cgoing to or coming from lunch outside of the work station or area.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.301(c)(4). In this case, the inmates were injured coming back from lunch outside of the work area. The regulations could not be more explicit. The inmates are not entitled to recover under the Inmate Accident Compensation Act but they are entitled to sue in tort.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
