We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider, and review de novo claims of due process violations. <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>(9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Perez-Estrada\u2019s motion on the ground that he did not establish prejudice from the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 899-900 (9th Cir.2003). Although Perez-Estrada contends that his former counsel should have presented additional evidence, he fails to establish that the absence of additional evidence may have affected the agency\u2019s hardship determination. <em>See id. </em>at 902 (concluding there was no prejudice where evidence did not establish the requisite level of hardship).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b579-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
