Roth, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b598-4\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In this bankruptcy matter, the Chapter 7 debtor, Elegant Custom Homes, Inc. (\u201cECH\u201d), and its owners, the Robertsons, appeal the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court, after a bench trial, entered judgment in favor of Elaine M. Dusharm (\u201cDusharm\u201d) holding that \u201cECH was the alter ego of the Robertsons and that it would be an injustice not to require the Robertsons to pay Dusharm the money she loaned to ECH.\u201d The bankruptcy court also awarded Dusharm her attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to Arizona Revised Statute \u00a7 12-341.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">On appeal, the district court held that, under Arizona law, a corporation may not pierce its own corporate veil, and that there was injustice sufficient to sustain the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to permit Dusharm, a third-party creditor, to pierce the corporate veil. The district court also held that the bankruptcy court properly awarded attorneys\u2019 fees. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Under the circumstances presented here, Arizona law authorizes piercing of the corporate veil, see <em>Gatecliff v. Great Republic Life Ins. Co., </em>170 Ariz. 34, 821 P.2d 725, 729 (1991) (\u201cPlaintiffs must prove ... that observance of the corporate form would sanction a fraud or promote injustice.\u201d). Furthermore, under Arizona law, a corporation may not assert a cause of action to pierce the corporate veil against itself, <em>see Jones v. Teilborg, </em>151 Ariz. 240, 727 P.2d 18, 25 (1986) (\u201c[T]he doctrine of \u2018piercing the corporate veil\u2019 based on alter ego and fraud does not apply to claims asserted by corporate shareholders. This doctrine is only available to third parties who deal with the corporation.\u201d (citations omitted)). Observing the corporate form would be unjust to Dusharm because the Robertsons, as alter egos of ECH, borrowed the money from Dusharm when ECH was insolvent and the Robertsons should have known ECH could not uphold the corporation\u2019s obligation to repay Dusharm. Arizona Revised Statute \u00a7 12-341.01 also authorizes the award of attorneys\u2019 fees because the creditor\u2019s claim would not exist \u201cbut for\u201d the underlying contractual promissory note. <em>Hanley v. Pearson, </em>204 Ariz. 147, 61 P.3d 29, 33 (2003) (quoting <em>Sparks v. Republic Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>132 Ariz. 529, 647 P.2d 1127, 1141 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b598-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
