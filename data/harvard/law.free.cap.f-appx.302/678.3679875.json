R.App. Petr. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b705-25\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-26\">Stanley Reynaldo John Sumanti, a native and citizen of Indonesia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Husyev v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir.2008), and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>We lack jurisdiction to review Sumanti\u2019s contention that changes in asylum law excuse the untimely filing of his application because he failed to raise this issue to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Sumanti has otherwise established either changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing his untimely asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D); <em>see also Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 648, 657-58 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding of no past persecution because Sumanti\u2019s experiences do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003) . Furthermore, even if the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004) applies to withholding of removal claims, Sumanti has not established a clear probability of future persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1184-85. Lastly, the record does not compel the conclusion that Sumanti demonstrated a pattern or practice of persecution against ethnic Chinese Christians. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1180-81 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). Accordingly, Sumanti\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The record does not compel the finding that Sumanti has established that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured by, at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of the Indonesian government. <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 948-49 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b705-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
