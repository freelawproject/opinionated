He argues that the district court reversibly erred by imposing a 16-level increase to his base offense level based upon its determination that his prior Texas convictions for burglary of a habitation constituted crimes of violence. The Government has moved for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Gonzalez-Bautista concedes that his arguments are foreclosed and raises them to preserve them for further review. <em>See United States v. Cardenas-Cardenas, </em>543 F.3d 731, 731-32 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, and the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
