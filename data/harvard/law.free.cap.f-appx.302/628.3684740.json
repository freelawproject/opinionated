We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 888, 890 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The agency properly concluded that Palomares did not present sufficient evidence to establish that his failure to appear at his removal hearing was due to exceptional circumstances. The agency\u2019s denial of Palomares\u2019 motion to reopen was therefore not \u201carbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Palomares\u2019 contention that he was denied due process because he was ordered removed <em>in absentia </em>lacks merit, <em>see Singh-Bhathal v. INS, </em>170 F.3d 943, 946-47 (9th Cir.1999), as do his remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Palomares\u2019 counsel is cautioned that his opening brief does not meet this court\u2019s standards. <em>See generally </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28; 9th Cir.
