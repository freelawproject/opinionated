The district court found in favor of appellant, Odalys Perez (\u201cPerez\u201d), and entered a judgment for overtime compensation and statutory damages, retaining jurisdiction to award her attorney\u2019s fees. Perez appeals, contending that the district court erred in failing to find, in addition to the overtime violations, that the appellees, Palermo Seafood, Inc. and Juan Zieggenhirt (\u201cPalermo\u201d), had committed minimum wage violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-24\">More specifically, Perez asserts that the district court improperly failed to require Palermo to pay Perez the value of the \u201ctip credit\u201d taken by Palermo for all hours for which Perez was paid over the course of 46 work weeks. Perez asserts that she is entitled to the tip credit amount because Palermo failed to meet the FLSA conditions precedent to allowing an employer to deduct the tip credit from the cash wages paid to a tipped employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-25\">An appellate court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of a federal statute, <em>Burlison v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>455 F.3d 1242, 1245 (11th Cir.2006), as well as a district court\u2019s interpretation of a state statute. <em>Blasland, Bouck &amp; Lee, Inc. v. City of N. Miami, </em>283 F.3d 1286, 1294 (11th Cir.2002). We likewise review <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number><em>novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Wexler v. Anderson, </em>452 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 1111, 127 S.Ct. 934, 166 L.Ed.2d 703 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">After reviewing the record, reading the parties\u2019 briefs, and having the benefit of oral argument, we see no clear error in the district court\u2019s findings of fact or legal error in its application of the law to those findings. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
