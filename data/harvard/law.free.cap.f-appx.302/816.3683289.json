HOLMES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b842-22\">Defendant Severett Orval Cheek, a federal prisoner appearing pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) that would allow him to appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). We will issue a COA only if Mr. Cheek makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make this showing, he must establish \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Because the district court rejected the \u00a7 2255 motion on procedural grounds, Mr. Cheek must demonstrate both \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhere a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case, a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing the petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">As outlined by the district court, Mr. Cheek\u2019s conviction became final on March 4, 2002; he did not file his \u00a7 2255 motion until October 11, 2005. Accordingly, the district court determined that his motion was time-barred under the statutory provision now designated as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1). A one-year statute of limitations generally applies to \u00a7 2255 motions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A28\">The limitation period shall run from the latest of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-7\">(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">(3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Mr. Cheek argues that his motion is timely under \u00a7 2255(f)(3) because it was filed within one year of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Mr. Cheek\u2019s citation to <em>Dodd v. United States, </em>545 U.S. 353, 125 S.Ct. 2478, 162 L.Ed.2d 343 (2005), is not on point. In <em>Dodd, </em>the Supreme Court explained that while the \u00a7 2255(f)(3) one-year limitation period does begin to run on the date that the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, a federal prisoner may take advantage of that date only if the asserted right also has been made retroactively available to cases on collateral review. <em>Id. </em>at 358-59, 125 S.Ct. 2478. As the district court correctly observed, neither the Supreme Court nor this Circuit has made <em>Booker </em>retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. Thus, <em>Booker </em>does not serve as a basis for tolling or restarting Mr. Cheek\u2019s statute of limitations. <em>See United States v. Bellamy, </em>411 F.3d 1182, 1184, 1186-88 (10th Cir.2005) <em>(\u201cBooker </em>does not apply retroactively to criminal cases that became final before its effective date of January 12, 2005.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Cheek\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred is not reasonably debatable. For substantially the same reasons provided by the district court, we accordingly DENY Mr. Cheek\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b842-15\"> This Order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1. After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this three-judge panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not be of material assistance in the determination of this matter. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-24\">. Because Mr. Cheek is proceeding pro se, we review his pleadings and filings liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Howard v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, </em>487 F.3d 808, 815 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
