Gregory noted his appeal to this court. To the extent that Gregory seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order remanding the case and denying his motion for reconsideration, we lack jurisdiction over the appeal. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order Gregory seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">To the extent that Gregory seeks to appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order approving the settlement, this court also lacks jurisdiction. We have direct appellate jurisdiction in a bankruptcy case if the bankruptcy court or the district court certifies that: (1) an order entered in the case involves a question of law as to which there is no controlling decision of the court of appeals for the circuit or of the Supreme Court, or if it involves a matter of public importance; (2) the order involves a question of law that requires resolution of conflicting decisions; or (3) an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the progress of the case or proceeding. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(d)(2)(A) (West 2006 &amp; Supp.2008). No such certification was made here, and we decline to exercise direct appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
