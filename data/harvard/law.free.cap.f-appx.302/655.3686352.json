We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion a dismissal for failure to comply with an order requiring the timely submission of an amended complaint. <em>See Ferdik v. Bonzelet, </em>963 F.2d 1258, 1260 (9th Cir.1992). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Price filed his action against Food-4Less supermarket on September 12, 2005, alleging that he was discriminated against and falsely imprisoned after being accused of shoplifting. On September 23, 2005, Price filed an \u201camended complaint\u201d and a \u201ccomplaint for a temporary restraining order.\u201d On February 22, 2006, Price filed an \u201camended pleading.\u201d On February 28, 2007, a Magistrate Judge dismissed the pleadings and gave Price leave to file a second amended complaint with directions that he present all his claims in one pleading. The Magistrate Judge also advised Price that the complaint should allege in specific terms how each named defendant was involved in the alleged violations. Additionally, the Magistrate Judge warned Price that the action would be dismissed if he failed to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Rather than filing an amended complaint, Price filed objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order stating, among other things, that the order was clearly erroneous because Food-4-Less interfered with Price\u2019s rights and discriminated against him under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a et seq., on the basis of his \u201crace and color.\u201d The district court construed Price\u2019s objections as a request for reconsideration of the Magistrate Judge\u2019s February 28, 2007 order directing Price to file an amended complaint. Finding that the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order was not clearly erroneous, the district court affirmed and two months later dismissed the action for failure to file an amended complaint. We conclude that given the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Price\u2019s action for failing to submit a second amended complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 1260-61.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
