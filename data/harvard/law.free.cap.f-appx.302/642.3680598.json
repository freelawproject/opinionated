We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir.2002), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">Substantial evidence of inconsistencies in the presence or absence of eyewitnesses and the extent of injuries sustained supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on Kaur\u2019s failure to produce corroborating evidence regarding \u201cany of the material aspects of her case.\u201d <em>See Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085,1092 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[Wjhere the IJ has reason to question the applicant\u2019s credibility, and the applicant fails to produce non-duplicative, material, easily available corroborating evidence and provides no credible explanation for such failure, an adverse credibility finding will withstand appellate review.\u201d). Substantial record evidence supports the IJ\u2019s \u201creason to question\u201d Kaur\u2019s credibility. Moreover, in light of Kaur\u2019s communication with her mother-in-law in India, Kaur\u2019s submission of some background evidence from India that she requested and was sent to her, and Kaur\u2019s opportunity to reinforce her claim in the lengthy interval between hearings, a reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to conclude that Kaur was unable to produce any material corroborating evidence of her claimed persecution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">The agency therefore properly denied Kaur\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Because Kaur\u2019s Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) claim is based on the same evidence that the IJ concluded was not credible, her CAT claim also fails. <em>Id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b669-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
