We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Oh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 612 (9th Cir.2005), we grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Wijaya\u2019s motion to reconsider attached several exhibits supporting her argument that her late-filed appeal be considered timely due to ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See </em>BIA Practice Manual, Ch. 3.1(c)(ii) (permitting submission of evidence with motions to re-file untimely appeals or motions). As the BIA\u2019s December 17, 2004 decision does not indicate that it considered Wijaya\u2019s argument or evidence, we remand to allow the BIA to exercise its discretion regarding Wijaya\u2019s request. <em>See Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005) (BIA must provide specific and cogent reasons for its decision in order to provide court a reasoned decision to review).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
