McWILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">On November 30, 1999, in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, Keith Madrill Lee Bentley, the defendant, after pleading guilty to various drug charges, was sentenced to imprisonment for 100 months on each of five counts in the indictment to be served concurrently, and, on his release from imprisonment, he was to be placed on supervised release for a term of six years on each of the five counts, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">On October 3, 2006, upon his release from imprisonment, the defendant began his six-year sentence of supervised release. Conditions of that release included the following: (1) the defendant shall not commit another federal, state, or local crime; (2) the defendant shall not illegally possess a controlled substance; and (3) the defendant shall not leave Kansas without permission of the Court or the Probation Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">On May 17, 2007, and twice thereafter, the Probation Office filed in the District Court for the District of Kansas a petition to issue a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest based on his violations of the terms of his supervised release, including the following: possession of a controlled substance in St. Louis, Missouri; leaving Kansas and going to Missouri without permission of the Court or the Probation Office; and, on another occasion, possession of a controlled substance in Topeka, Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">After a full evidentiary hearing, the District Court on March 18, 2008, revoked the defendant\u2019s supervised release and pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) sentenced him to imprisonment for 36 months on each of the five counts, to run concurrently, with the recommendation that the sentence be served in a federal medical center facility. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">On appeal, defendant\u2019s counsel, who represented the defendant in the District Court, has filed a so-called <em>Anders </em>Brief. <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). A copy of that brief was served on the United States and the defendant, and, by letter, we have been advised that the United States would file no answer brief. In his <em>Anders </em>Brief, defendant\u2019s counsel stated that there were three possible issues that could be, and are, raised in the instant appeal. As framed by counsel, these issues are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-4\">Issue I: Whether the evidence was sufficient to support the revocation of Mr. Bentley\u2019s supervised release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-5\">Issue II: Whether the sentenced imposed was excessive in light of the nature of Mr. Bentley\u2019s violations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asf\">Issue III: Whether the issues Mr. Bentley wishes to appeal are without merit and accordingly whether court-appointed counsel should be allowed to withdraw pursuant to 10th Cir. R. 46.4(B)(1) and <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">After an extended evidentiary hearing on the Probation Officer\u2019s petition to revoke the defendant\u2019s supervised release, the District Court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had violated the terms of his supervised release in at least three particulars: on two separate occasions he had committed a federal, state, or local crime, i.e. he had illegally possessed a controlled substance and, in addition, he had failed to comply with the requirement that he not leave the judicial district of Kansas without the permission of the court or probation officer. On appeal, in his <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel first challenges the sufficiency of evidence to support the revocation of defendant\u2019s supervised release. Our review of the record convinces us that the evidence was amply sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">The record clearly shows that on one occasion a car which was owned by the defendant and in which the defendant was a front seat passenger was stopped by local police in St. Louis, Missouri, for a traffic violation, the driver of that car being defendant\u2019s fiancee, who had failed to stop at a stop sign. An arresting officer testified that just before the stop he had observed the passenger lean forward and apparently placed an object under his car seat, and then lean backward in his seat. After the stop was accomplished, the officer found a loaded gun under the seat where the defendant had been seated, and a subsequent search of the vehicle revealed controlled substances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">On a separate occasion, in Topeka, Kansas, a local resident called the local police and complained that her son\u2019s friend was \u201ctrashing\u201d her home and battered her. The police responded, however, by that time the \u201ctrasher\u201d had left the scene, but had left his vehicle in the driveway. The defendant later returned to the scene of the \u201ctrashing.\u201d A search of defendant\u2019s vehicle also disclosed the presence of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">Finally, by his presence in St. Louis, Missouri, it follows that the defendant had left Kansas and had gone to Missouri in violation of the provisions in his supervised release prohibiting interstate travel without the permission of the court or the probation officer, neither of which he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>In addition to the foregoing, it would appear that the defendant also violated the federal law prohibiting a felon from possessing a firearm. In any event, we agree with counsel that any \u201csufficiency of the evidence\u201d argument is \u201cwholly frivolous\u201d under <em>Anders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Counsel next argues that the sentence imposed, i.e., 36 months imprisonment on each of the five counts, to be served concurrently, is \u201cexcessive in light of Mr. Bentley\u2019s violations.\u201d Again we agree with counsel that this issue is also \u201cwholly frivolous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">As stated, after revoking defendant\u2019s term of supervised release, the District Court sentenced defendant to imprisonment for 36 months on each of the five counts to be served concurrently, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). That statute provides that after revoking a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release, the district court could impose a sentence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-7\">(3) revoke a term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision, if the court, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure applicable to revocation of probation or supervised release, finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release, except that a defendant whose term is revoked under this paragraph may not be required to serve more than 5 years in prison if the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a class A felony, more than 3 years in prison if such offense is a class B felony, more than 2 years in prison if such offense is a class C or D felony, or more than one year in any other case;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">The defendant in the instant case started his term of supervised release on October 5, 2006, and such release was revoked on March 18, 2008. Because defendant\u2019s original offense consisted of Class B felonies, the statutory maximum is three years imprisonment. The district court also consulted the United States Sentencing Guidelines policy statement on revocation of supervised release and based on defendant\u2019s Grade of Violation and Criminal History, found the range of imprisonment to be 30-37 months. It was in this setting that the District Court sentenced defendant to imprisonment for three years, i.e. 36 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) does state that in sentencing under that statute a court may consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. It is in this statutory setting that counsel suggests that the sentence of 36 months was \u201cexcessive\u201d and presumably \u201cunreasonable.\u201d However, we again agree with counsel that this issue is \u201cwholly frivolous\u201d under <em>Anders. </em>All things considered, defendant\u2019s sentence of 36 months was neither \u201cexcessive\u201d nor \u201cunreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">As to counsel\u2019s third so-called \u201cissue\u201d raised in this appeal, i.e. whether \u201cthe issues that Mr. Bentley wishes to appeal are without merit,\u201d and that counsel should be allowed to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we agree with counsel that they are \u201cwithout merit\u201d and therefore \u201cwholly frivolous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">Accordingly, under <em>Anders, </em>we dismiss the present appeal and grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b853-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-8\">. At the revocation hearing the defendant elected not to testify. His fiancee, however, did testify and stated that the contents of the car, i.e. guns and controlled substances, belonged to her, not the defendant. One of the arresting officers testified that the defendant asked the officer if Ms. Irons, his fiancee, could \"take the case for him\u201d because he was on federal release and she did not have a criminal record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
