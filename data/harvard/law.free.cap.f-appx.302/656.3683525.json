We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(h)(1). We review for clear error the denial of a petition to quash an IRS summons and de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute. <em>Fortney v. United States, </em>59 F.3d 117, 119 (9th Cir.1995). We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of Waller\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Cos. v. Alaskan Pride Pshp., </em>106 F.3d 1465, 1470-71 (9th Cir.1997). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">The district court did not err when it concluded that Waller lacked standing to petition to quash the nineteen summonses issued to entities that are not third-party record keepers. A person has standing to petition to quash only if he/she is entitled under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(a) to notice of issuance of a summons, and under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(a)(2)(A) notice was required to be given to Waller only for summonses issued to third-party record keepers as defined by Section 7063(b)(2). <em>See Ip v. United States, </em>205 F.3d 1168, 1170 n. 3 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Chen Chi Wang v. United States, </em>757 F.2d 1000, 1002 (9th Cir.1985). Because Waller lacks standing to petition to quash these summonses, we cannot consider his contentions that they were procedurally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">The district court also did not err in holding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition to quash the summonses issued to the twelve entities that neither reside nor are \u201cfound\u201d in Nevada\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(h)(1); <em>Fortney, </em>59 F.3d at 119 (holding that a district court lacks jurisdiction to consider petitions to quash summonses issued to entities not residing or \u201cfound\u201d in the court\u2019s geographical jurisdiction). We are not persuaded by Waller\u2019s contention that considerations of judicial economy are sufficient to overcome this jurisdictional defect. Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Waller\u2019s motion to alter the judgment. <em>See 389 Orange St. Partners v. Arnold, </em>179 F.3d 656, 665 (9th Cir.1999) (setting forth grounds for reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">Finally, the district court did not err in denying Waller\u2019s petition to quash the remaining two summonses over which it had jurisdiction. The United States made a <em>prima facie </em>showing, which Waller failed to rebut. <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>379 U.S. 48, 57-58, 85 S.Ct. 248, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964); <em>Fortney, </em>59 F.3d at 120 (petitioner has burden to rebut by showing lack of good faith or abuse of process). We are not persuaded by Waller\u2019s contention that the summonses were issued impermissibly to gather evidence for a criminal investigation; Waller has not shown that the IRS\u2019s investigation is for any purpose other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>to determine tax liability or to \u201cinquir[e] into any offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(a), (b). We decline to reach Waller\u2019s contention, first raised on appeal, that the district court\u2019s order is infirm because the summonses have not been enforced. <em>See Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999) (stating that, as a general rule, we will not consider arguments that are first raised on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b683-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
