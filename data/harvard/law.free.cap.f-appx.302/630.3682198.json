Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Aguirre Pineda failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">Aguirre Pineda contends the IJ violated his due process rights by refusing to accept evidence regarding voluntary departure, a form of relief he had previously been granted. He also claims the IJ exhibited bias in severing his cancellation of removal case from his mother\u2019s adjustment of status case. Contrary to Aguirre Pineda\u2019s contention, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [he] was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>Colmenar, </em>210 F.3d at 971. Moreover, Aguirre Pineda failed to demonstrate prejudice. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b657-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
