In his plea agreement, he stipulated to possessing 125 grams of cocaine base in furtherance of the conspiracy, subjecting himself to a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years of imprisonment and a maximum sentence of life. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Miller received the mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months (later reduced to 78 months based on Miller\u2019s substantial assistance) and the mandatory minimum five-year term of supervised release. After being released from prison, Miller violated the terms of his supervised release by committing second degree murder in Illinois. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> revoked Miller\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to five years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Notwithstanding the stipulation contained in his plea agreement, which subjected him to a maximum term of life imprisonment, Miller now appeals his revocation sentence contending he pleaded guilty to a drug offense which only carried a maximum sentence of twenty years of imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) because his indictment did not charge a specific drug quantity. Because the maximum revocation sentence for a Class C felony under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) is two years of imprisonment, Miller contends the district court violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), by sentencing him to five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">This argument is without merit. Miller admitted to possessing 125 grams of cocaine base in his plea agreement and therefore was convicted of a Class A felony carrying a maximum sentence of life under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). <em>See United States v. Hicks, </em>411 F.3d 996, 997 n. 2 (8th Cir.2005) (noting a \u201cdistrict court may sentence a criminal defendant based upon admitted facts without running afoul of <em>Apprendi\u201d). </em>A conviction for a Class A felony allows a maximum revocation sentence of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We affirm the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">. The Honorable John A. Jarvey, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
