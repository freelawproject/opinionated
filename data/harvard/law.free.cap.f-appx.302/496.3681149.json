On appeal, he argues the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> erred in 1) considering his prior criminal history, 2) failing to adequately explain the sentence, and 3) imposing an unreasonable sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>As a convicted felon, Arnold is prohibited from possessing firearms and ammunition. He has been convicted of felony robbery and three drug-related felonies. The Presentence Investigation Report (PSIR) determined Arnold was subject to enhanced penalties under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), and the Armed Career Criminal enhancement under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A). Arnold\u2019s Guidelines sentencing range was 188-235 months, and he was subject to a fifteen-year minimum term of imprisonment under \u00a7 924(e)(1). Arnold did not object to the PSIR\u2019s Guidelines calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Arnold asked for a sentence of 180 months. The government argued for a within-Guidelines sentence. The district court considered Arnold\u2019s criminal history, focusing specifically on his \u201crunning around with guns, bullets and drugs,\u201d and imposed a 200-month sentence. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">We review the district court\u2019s sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Austad, </em>519 F.3d 431, 434 (8th Cir.2008). We first</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX62\">ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-9\"><em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. If the sentence is procedurally sound, we review \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA sentence within the Guidelines range is accorded a presumption of substantive reasonableness on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>516 F.3d 716, 717 (8th Cir.2008). Arnold does not argue the district court committed a significant procedural error. Thus, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">Arnold first contends the district court erred in taking his criminal history into account when applying \u00a7\u00a7 924(e), 4B1.4(b)(3)(A), <em>and </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Section 3553(a) expressly mandates a district court consider the \u201chistory and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d and the need \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d We have previously held the Guidelines permit district courts to take a defendant\u2019s criminal history into account for multiple and distinct sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Saffeels, </em>39 F.3d 833, 836-37 (8th Cir.1994). Here the district court\u2019s consideration of criminal history properly served to quantify the seriousness of Arnold\u2019s conduct and to aid in fashioning the appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">Arnold next argues the district court failed to explain the basis for its sentence. A district court need not categorically recite all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cas long as it is clear that the court considered those factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>518 F.3d 613, 616 (8th Cir.2008). Further, \u201cwhen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We may appropriately conclude \u201cthe judge rests his decision upon the Commission\u2019s own reasoning that the Guidelines sentence is a proper sentence' (in terms of \u00a7 3553(a) and other congressional mandates) in the typical case, and that the judge has found that the case before him is typical.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>We are satisfied the district court considered all the relevant sentencing factors. The record demonstrates it considered Arnold\u2019s addiction to methamphetamine, work history, depression, criminal history, etc., and determined a within-Guidelines sentence was appropriate. Further, we find nothing in Arnold\u2019s arguments to overcome the presumption of reasonableness accorded this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AYO\">.
