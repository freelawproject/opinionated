Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In February 1992, LWC, a municipal water utility, hired Vaughn as a Right of Way Administrator. She was responsible for acquiring easements and obtaining permits for LWC to install water facilities. Because Vaughn\u2019s position was \u201cexempt,\u201d she was not entitled to overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In 1996, LWC combined the Right of Way and Survey departments into one \u201cprocess.\u201d A position was created for the supervisor, or \u201cprocess owner,\u201d of the new Survey and Easements department. The position required the applicant to have a surveyor license. Although Vaughn wanted to apply for the position, she did not have a surveyor license. Ron Eiler, the head of the Survey department, applied for and received the position. He was the only employee to apply. Vaughn alleges that the process owner job description included the surveyor license requirement specifically to exclude her from applying for the position. She apparently told her supervisors, Jim Asseff and Greg Heitzman, that she did not believe a surveyor license was necessary to perform the job. According to Vaughn, the two female employees who were later hired into the same process owner position did not possess a surveyor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Nonetheless, Vaughn claims she was told not to worry about the process owner position. Asseff and Heitzman apparently told her that her job responsibilities would not change. They also apparently said that Eiler\u2019s process owner position was not at a higher pay grade, nor was it a promotion for Eiler. Vaughn admits that her job responsibilities did not change after Eiler became process owner. She remained at a grade 9 pay level and retained the same job title. In February 2002, however, Vaughn claims she became concerned that she was doing the work of a process owner without the title or salary. She claims she expressed her concerns to Eiler, who condescendingly told her to \u201cjust keep doing things the way you are and everything will be just fine.\u201d Vaughn Aff. 1129, J.A. at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">In May 2002, Vaughn alleges she reviewed LWC\u2019s employment records and discovered that Eiler was being paid at a grade 10 pay level \u2014 one level higher than her. At that time, she also claims she discovered that LWC paid overtime to some male employees in positions, such as hers, that were exempt. She claims the male employees were either exempt and paid more than her, or non-exempt and paid overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Vaughn also alleges that when she and Eiler interviewed applicants for available positions, Eiler would only hire males. Specifically, in 1997, she claims Eiler told a female applicant that he would not hire a female for a survey position. She also claims that Eiler hired white applicants over African Americans. In 2001, Eiler apparently made a statement regarding the file of a property owner whose last name was Bigot. Vaughn claims he said, \u201cI\u2019m a bigot, my wife\u2019s a bigot too!\u201d Vaughn Aff. K 23, J.A. at 168. According to Vaughn, she was offended and insulted by this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">After Eiler\u2019s \u201cbigot\u201d comment, Vaughn alleges she complained to Jim Wehrle, LWC\u2019s Vice President of Human Resources. Eiler apparently accused her of \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d and was \u201cirate\u201d that she did not address her problems with him first. Vaughn Aff. H 24, J.A. at 168. As a result of her complaints, Vaughn participated in a series of meetings with Eiler. She claims these meetings made Eiler angry and resentful toward her. In the first meeting, she alleges Eiler was \u201cstone faced\u201d and \u201cslammed his hands on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the table\u201d at her. Vaughn Aff. 1126, J.A. at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Vaughn also alleges that a known \u201cgood old boy\u201d atmosphere persisted at LWC. Vaughn Aff. 1169, J.A. at 179. According to Vaughn, females were treated as lower class employees and were subjected to \u201copen mockery and verbal abuse\u201d by Eiler and other male employees. <em>Id. </em>She claims Eiler treated females in a \u201chostile, harassing way with an air of intimidation and discrimination.\u201d Vaughn Aff. 1140, J.A. at 171. She also claims that Eiler frequently made negative, hostile remarks to Diana Cecil, another LWC employee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She claims that in early 2002, Eiler began monitoring his female employees more closely than the male employees. Vaughn also alleges that Greg Heitzman, LWC\u2019s Vice President, made disparaging remarks about Laura Douglas, LWC\u2019s corporate counsel, in meetings Vaughn attended. Vaughn claims Heitzman never made these types of comments about male employees. She alleges that she was typically the only female who attended these meetings, and that all of the other males would laugh in response to Heitzman\u2019s comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In May 2002, Vaughn discussed her concerns with Rhonda Plunkett, LWC\u2019s Director of Cultural Diversity. John Anderson, the Employee Relations Manager, subsequently began an investigation into Eiler\u2019s conduct. In June 2002, while the investigation was still ongoing, Vaughn claims she was leaving the office when Eiler walked out behind her, drove his car behind her car, and \u201cjust sat there and stared [her] down.\u201d Vaughn Aff. 1147, J.A. at 173. In July 2002, at a retirement party for one of the company\u2019s secretaries, Vaughn claims Eiler spent the entire time staring at Vaughn, Cecil, and another female employee \u201cin a very intimidating manner.\u201d Vaughn Aff. K50, J.A. at 174. After the party, Vaughn claims she met with Greg Heitzman to discuss her concerns. Heitzman apparently indicated he would consider all options and \u201cultimately turn it over to God.\u201d Vaughn Aff. 1151, J.A. at 174. At some point, Heitzman also apparently told Vaughn that she would not be receiving or submitting her work directly through him anymore. Throughout Anderson\u2019s investigation of Eiler, Vaughn also claims the male employees turned against her and the other female employees who had complained. She claims they \u201cput up every road block possible\u201d and eliminated the females from contact with consultants, which made it difficult for them to complete their work. Vaughn Aff. 1152, J.A. at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">On July 26, 2002, Vaughn\u2019s doctor placed her on short term disability leave, as a result of depression, anxiety, and stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">In early September 2002, Anderson completed his investigation of Eiler and cited him with a code of conduct violation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He referred to Eiler\u2019s \u201cinappropriate and unnecessary comments and statements that leave a \u2018perception\u2019 of unacceptable biases towards certain individuals and/or groups of people.\u201d J.A. at 240. A few days later, Eiler was removed from his position and later transferred to a resource coordinator position, apparently due to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>reorganization of the Right of Way department.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">After being informed of Eiler\u2019s transfer, and a few days before she was scheduled to return to work, Vaughn claims she discussed her concerns about Eiler with her supervisor, Edwin Chestnut. She apparently told Chestnut that she was afraid of Eiler and wanted to make sure that Eiler would be relocated before she returned. Chestnut discussed Vaughn\u2019s concerns with Heitzman, who apparently indicated that Eiler would not be relocated unless Vaughn presented a doctor\u2019s note. Vaughn did obtain a doctor\u2019s note extending her short term disability leave for a few days. She returned to work on October 3, 2002. When she came to work that day, Vaughn claims Eiler \u201cwas standing directly in front of my cubicle, forcing me to walk past him and very confrontational at a time when almost no one was in the building.\u201d Vaughn Aff. 1155, J.A. at 176. Eiler remained in the same work location as Vaughn until November 2002. Even after he relocated, Vaughn claims Eiler periodically visited her floor for no apparent business purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">After she returned to work, Vaughn claims her job title was changed in retaliation for her complaints. She was designated as a \u201ccoordinator,\u201d a non-management position, instead of an \u201cadministrator,\u201d a management position. As a result of her new title, Vaughn alleges that she was ineligible for the company\u2019s Leadership Institute training. Without such training, Vaughn claims she was denied access to information about LWC\u2019s operations, which prevented her from obtaining promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In October 2002, Vaughn also claims she received a negative performance evaluation from her new process owner, Cindy Kowalski.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">On December 12, 2002, Vaughn filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), alleging sex discrimination and retaliation under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">Vaughn again took short term disability leave on February 3, 2003. She was scheduled to return to work in late April, but she claims she could not return to the adverse atmosphere. She was again placed on short term disability leave until September 8, 2003. Vaughn did not return to work on September 8, however. She claims she was physically incapable of returning because of the problems that remained unaddressed at LWC.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">LWC discharged Vaughn on May 10, 2004. The company informed her that she had failed to return to work in September 2003, had exhausted all of her leave options, and had offered no medical documentation for her failure to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">Also on May 10, 2004, Vaughn filed a complaint of discrimination with the Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (\u201cOFCCP\u201d). The OFCCP notified LWC of the complaint and began an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">After receiving a right to sue letter from the EEOC, Vaughn timely commenced this action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She asserted claims of gender discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliation. On two occasions thereafter, LWC\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, John Huber, sent an email to all LWC employees informing them of the discrimination lawsuits filed against the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>After completion of discovery, and after Vaughn had been discharged, LWC moved for summary judgment on all claims. Before the district court ruled on the motion, the OFCCP issued a Notification of Results of Investigation (\u201cNORI\u201d) stating that it had found sufficient evidence to conclude that sexual harassment had occurred and a hostile work environment existed at LWC. The district court permitted Vaughn to supplement the record with the NORI, holding that it was admissible as an investigative report of a government agency under Rule 803(8)(C) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. It then granted LWC\u2019s summary judgment motion in full. Vaughn timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">A. Standard of Review and Summary Judgment Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. White v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>533 F.3d 381, 389 (6th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). A \u201cgenuine\u201d dispute is one that would permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Henderson v. Walled Lake Consol. Schs., </em>469 F.3d 479, 487 (6th Cir.2006). A fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d only if its resolution could affect the outcome of the litigation under the applicable law. <em>Id. </em>At the summary judgment stage, the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); <em>Jones v. Potter, </em>488 F.3d 397, 403 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">B. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">LWC first argues that any incidents of discrimination, hostile work environment, or retaliation that occurred before February 15, 2002 \u2014 300 days before Vaughn filed her EEOC charge \u2014 are barred by Title VII\u2019s statute of limitations. To recover under Title VII, a plaintiff must first timely file a charge with the EEOC. <em>Amini v. Oberlin Coll., </em>259 F.3d 493, 498 (6th Cir.2001). Both parties agree that Vaughn had 300 days to file her EEOC charge. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1) (providing that in a state or locality where an agency is authorized to grant or seek relief, an individual must file a charge with that state or local agency, and must file any charge with the EEOC 300 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">\u201cA discrete retaliatory or discriminatory act \u2018occurred\u2019 on the day that it \u2018happened.\u2019\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 110, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002). A pay-setting decision is a discrete act and the period for filing an EEOC charge begins when the act occurs. <em>Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Inc., </em>550 U.S. 618, 127 S.Ct. 2162, 2165, 167 L.Ed.2d 982 (2007). Accordingly, Vaughn\u2019s claims that she did not receive the Survey and Easements process owner position in 1996, was paid less than Eiler as a result of his promotion, and did not receive the same overtime pay as other exempt male employees, are time-barred because they occurred more than 300 days before Vaughn filed her EEOC charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Vaughn alleges that these claims are not barred because she did not discover the discrimination regarding the promotion, pay, and overtime until June 2002, when she reviewed employee job descriptions. The Supreme Court has \u201cpreviously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>declined to address whether Title VII suits are amenable to a discovery rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2177 n. 10. Even were we to agree that the discovery rule should apply in Title VII cases, this would not be the case in which to announce it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Vaughn reasonably should have discovered any discrimination after she did not receive the position in 1996. Although she claims she was told that Eiler had not received a promotion, it is simply incomprehensible to believe that she had no idea Eiler had received a higher, supervisory position \u2014 particularly given that she reported to him, <em>see </em>J.A. at 80-81, 290, 292-95. A diligent employee would have discovered discrimination or a disparity in pay at that point. Because the discovery rule would not save Vaughn\u2019s untimely claims, the district court properly granted summary judgment to LWC.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">C. Disparate Treatment</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it \u201can unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s ... sex.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). Aside from her untimely claims, Vaughn alleges that LWC discriminated against her because of her sex when it altered her job title and, as a result, denied her Leadership Institute training.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">A plaintiff may establish discrimination by either direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>Grizzell v. City of Columbus Div. of Police, </em>461 F.3d 711, 719 (6th Cir.2006). Direct evidence is \u201cevidence that proves the existence of a fact without requiring any inferences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is evidence which, \u201cif believed, requires the conclusion that unlawful discrimination was at least a motivating factor in the employer\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Jacklyn v. Schering-Plough Healthcare Prods. Sales Corp., </em>176 F.3d 921 (6th Cir.1999). Vaughn argues that the evidence of Eiler\u2019s specific bias against females, the company\u2019s own reference to such a \u201cperceived bias,\u201d and the OFCCP\u2019s findings constitute direct evidence of discrimination. At best, however, the company\u2019s finding only acknowledges that Eiler \u201cperiodically\u201d made inappropriate comments that left a \u201c \u2018perception\u2019 of unacceptable biases towards certain individuals,\u201d J.A. at 240; it does not concede that an objectively discriminatory environment actually existed for Vaughn individually. And although the NORI may acknowledge a discriminatory environment at LWC generally, its findings do not specifically refer to Vaughn and it defers any individual findings to the federal court. J.A. at 297. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Because this evidence does not require us to conclude that Vaughn was subjected to discrimination, it is not direct evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In the absence of direct evidence, we analyze discrimination claims under the burden-shifting framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Vincent v. Brewer Co., </em>514 F.3d 489, 494 (6th Cir.2007). Where, as here, a case is at the summary judgment stage, \u201cthe plaintiff must submit evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude both that she has established a prima facie case of discrimination and that the defendant\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action, if any, is pretext for unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.; see also McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817. To establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment, a plaintiff must show that 1) she is a member of a protected class; 2) she was subjected to an adverse employment decision; 3) she was qualified for the position; and 4) she was replaced by a person outside the protected class, or treated differently than similarly situated non-protected employees. <em>Vincent, </em>514 F.3d at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Vaughn has failed to establish that the change in her job title from administrator to coordinator in 2002, and her resulting inability to attend Leadership Institute training, resulted in any adverse employment action. An adverse employment action is \u201ca significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\u201d <em>Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>533 F.3d at 402 (quoting <em>Burlington Indus, v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 761, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998)). It must be \u201cmore disruptive than a mere inconvenience or alteration of job responsibilities.\u201d <em>Michael v. Caterpillar Fin. Servs. Corp., </em>496 F.3d 584, 594 (6th Cir.2007). Here, the terms and conditions of Vaughn\u2019s employment did not change after the change in her job title. She admitted that her duties, salary, and benefits remained the same. Vaughn Dep. 194-95, J.A. at 522. And although \u201ca deprivation of increased compensation as the result of a failure to train constitutes an adverse employment action,\u201d <em>Clay v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>501 F.3d 695, 710 (6th Cir.2007), Vaughn has failed to present any evidence that she was passed up for promotions because of her inability to attend the Leadership Institute training. She only alleges that the training \u201cwould have ... allow[ed] me to be able to be promoted to another position ... when and if something else opened up.\u201d Vaughn Dep. 192, J.A. at 521. But her own conclusory assertions as to the value of the training and her inability to receive promotions are insufficient to survive summary judgment. <em>See Arendale v. City of Memphis, </em>519 F.3d 587, 605 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Even were we to assume, for the sake of argument, that Vaughn has established a prima facie case, LWC has nonetheless offered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. The employer need only articulate a nondiscriminatory rationale; it need not prove it. <em>Hartsel v. Keys, </em>87 F.3d 795, 800 (6th Cir.1996). Here, LWC contends that Vaughn\u2019s new job title was simply a re-tooling of job descriptions based on a change in management.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Further, Vaughn cannot demonstrate that LWC\u2019s legitimate reasons for its actions were in fact only a pretext for intentional discrimination. To do so, the plaintiff must show that the employer\u2019s proffered reasons 1) had no basis in fact, 2) did not actually motivate the challenged conduct, or 3) were insufficient to motivate the challenged conduct. <em>Grace v. USCAR </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>&amp; Bartech Tech. Servs., LLC, </em>521 F.3d 655, 677 (6th Cir.2008); <em>Cicero v. Borg-Wamer Auto., Inc., </em>280 F.3d 579, 589 (6th Cir.2002). Vaughn does not address the issue of pretext on appeal. She has not offered any proof that LWC\u2019s reason lacks a factual basis, was insufficient to motivate its actions, or was anything but the product of sound and honest business judgment. She has also failed to offer evidence that LWC\u2019s actions had anything to do with her gender. Ultimately, her theory of gender discrimination is based solely on her unsupported speculations of an anti-female bias at LWC. That is not enough to establish pretext or to survive summary judgment. <em>See Sutherland v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>344 F.3d 603, 623 (6th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of LWC with respect to Vaughn\u2019s disparate treatment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">D. Hostile Work Environment</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Title VII also prohibits conduct which is \u201csufficiently severe and pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment.\u201d <em>Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 </em>U.S. 57, 67, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986); <em>see also Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993). To establish a prima facie case of hostile work environment, a plaintiff must prove that: 1) she is a member of a protected class; 2) she was subjected to unwelcome harassment; 3) the harassment was based upon her protected status; 4) the harassment unreasonably interfered with her work performance by creating a hostile, offensive, or intimidating work environment; and 5) there is a basis for employer liability. <em>Thornton v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>530 F.3d 451, 455 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">LWC first argues that any alleged harassment had nothing to do with Vaughn\u2019s sex. Title VII protects any unequal treatment that would not have occurred but for the employee\u2019s sex, even if the conduct is non-sexual. <em>Williams v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>187 F.3d 553, 565 (6th Cir.1999). Here, however, many of the incidents Vaughn seeks to include in her hostile environment claim occurred after she reported Eiler for his \u201cbigot\u201d comment. For example, she claims that Eiler \u201cstared her down\u201d in the parking lot and at the retirement party specifically because of her complaints of discrimination. This suggests that \u2014 if anything \u2014 much of Eiler\u2019s conduct was retaliatory, not gender-based. <em>See Morris v. Oldham County Fiscal Court, </em>201 F.3d 784, 790-91 (6th Cir.2000) (refusing to include alleged retaliatory conduct in the hostile work environment calculus because plaintiff did not suggest the conduct was committed \u201cbecause of sex\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Even if some the alleged harassment was based on Vaughn\u2019s sex, it still must be severe and pervasive to be actionable. In evaluating the severity and pervasiveness of workplace harassment, we consider the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Williams, </em>187 F.3d at 562; <em>see also Harris, </em>510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. 367. Relevant circumstances include the \u201cfrequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. 367. Viewed as a whole, the environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive, hostile, and abusive. <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 787, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998). \u201c[Sjimple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to\u201d a hostile work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>environment. <em>Id. </em>at 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275. Rather, \u201cconduct must be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have consistently rejected any invitation to convert Title VII into a \u201ccode of workplace civility.\u201d <em>Grace, </em>521 F.3d at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Viewing Vaughn\u2019s allegations as a whole, we agree with the district court that the incidents were not so severe and pervasive that a reasonable person would find her work environment hostile and abusive. Eiler\u2019s actions and comments appear to have been isolated incidents that occurred over a period of ten years. <em>See Morris, </em>201 F.3d at 790 (holding that several dirty jokes, a verbal sexual advance, a one-time reference to plaintiff as \u201cHot Lips,\u201d and comments about plaintiffs state of dress were not sufficiently severe and pervasive). Moreover, Vaughn has not presented evidence indicating that any of the alleged incidents of harassment interfered with her work performance. While Eiler\u2019s presence on Vaughn\u2019s floor after he was reassigned in 2002 may have been uncomfortable, he was relocated within a reasonable time. Vaughn even testified that during that time she was not prevented from performing her job duties. Finally, Vaughn\u2019s general allegations of \u201copen mockery and verbal abuse\u201d and the \u201chostile\u201d and \u201charassing\u201d environment that was \u201cpervasive\u201d are not enough to survive summary judgment. <em>See Arendale, </em>519 F.3d at 605 (holding that plaintiffs conclusory assertions of continuous \u201cracial harassment\u201d were insufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Vaughn attempts to bolster her hostile work environment claim with the OFCCP\u2019s general findings of a hostile work environment and the company\u2019s own findings of Eiler\u2019s \u201cperceived bias\u201d against females. LWC contends that the OFCCP\u2019s findings are inadmissible under Rule 803(8)(C) because the sources of information and the circumstances of the investigation indicate a lack of trustworthiness. Yet, even assuming the NORI is admissible as a public record, <em>see Chandler v. Roudebush, </em>425 U.S. 840, 863 n. 39, 96 S.Ct. 1949, 48 L.Ed.2d 416 (1976), it does not specifically address whether the environment was hostile \u2014 both subjectively and objectively \u2014 for Vaughn individually. And it specifically \u201cdefer[s] any findings as to Ms. Vaughn\u2019s individual claims to the results of the U.S. District Court\u2019s opinion.\u201d J.A. at 298. Further, the company\u2019s own finding of a \u201c \u2018perception\u2019 of unacceptable biases\u201d by Eiler, creating \u201can adversarial environment especially among female employees,\u201d J.A. at 240-41, indicates that LWC may have acknowledged the subjective perceptions of some of its female employees, but it does not admit that an objectively hostile, severe, and pervasive atmosphere existed for Vaughn individually. Even considering this evidence, Vaughn has not satisfied her burden of showing a hostile work environment, and summary judgment for LWC was therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">E. Retaliation</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Under Title VII, it is an unlawful employment practice \u201cfor an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Vaughn claims eight incidents of retaliation: 1) denying her a promotion to process owner after Eiler was reassigned; 2) changing her job title; 3) terminating her health benefits under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Recon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>ciliation Act (\u201cCOBRA\u201d) in May 2004;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 4) Eiler\u2019s actions in the parking lot and other intimidating behavior; 5) the overall threatening work environment; 6) the negative evaluation in October 2002; 7) Huber\u2019s company-wide emails regarding Vaughn\u2019s lawsuit in September 2003; and 8) her May 2004 discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">In the absence of direct evidence, we review Vaughn\u2019s retaliation claims under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework. <em>Weigel v. Baptist Hosp., </em>302 F.3d 367, 381 (6th Cir.2002). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that: 1) she engaged in activity protected by Title VII; 2) the employer knew of her exercise of protected rights; 3) the employer took a materially adverse action against the plaintiff or subjected her to severe and pervasive retaliatory harassment; and 4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Abbott v. Crown Motor Co., Inc., </em>348 F.3d 537, 542 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Many of the retaliatory acts Vaughn alleges are insufficient to constitute materially adverse actions. A materially adverse action in the retaliation context is not limited to those actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment, or even acts that occur in the workplace; it is sufficient to show that the action would have \u201cdissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe. Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). A materially adverse action does not include trivial harms, such as \u201cpetty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Vaughn first argues that it was retaliatory for the company to deny her a promotion to process owner after Eiler was reassigned in October 2002. She claims she was never considered for this position, but there is no evidence that she applied for it. Not receiving a promotion for which one did not apply would not dissuade a reasonable worker from engaging in protected conduct, and accordingly does not constitute a materially adverse action.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Several of Vaughn\u2019s other allegedly retaliatory acts do not rise to the level of a materially adverse action. \u201c[Mjarkedly lower performance-evaluation scores that significantly impact an employee\u2019s wages or professional advancement\u201d may be materially adverse actions. <em>Halfacre v. Home Depot, U.S.A., Inc., </em>221 Fed.Appx. 424, 433 (6th Cir.2007); <em>see also James v. Metro. Gov. of Nashville, </em>243 Fed.Appx. 74, 79 (6th Cir.2007). But Vaughn has not shown that the negative performance evaluation she received in October 2002 significantly affected her salary or professional advancement. Further, Huber\u2019s company-wide emails simply informed LWC employees of the lawsuit and emphasized the company\u2019s commitment to diversity; they would not have dissuaded a reasonable worker from filing a charge. Eiler\u2019s presence on Vaughn\u2019s floor for one month may have been uncomfortable, but he was eventually relocated. And the few times he expressed his anger to Vaughn were isolated incidents. Vaughn has not presented enough evidence to show that these incidents were so important as to dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>has she shown that, even viewing them as a whole, she was subjected to severe and pervasive retaliatory harassment. <em>See Morris, </em>201 F.3d at 793 (finding retaliatory harassment where plaintiffs supervisor visited her department over fifteen times, called her over thirty times, followed her home from work, and threw nails on her driveway).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Even if she can show that the change in her job title, denial of COBRA benefits, and discharge resulted in materially adverse actions, Vaughn must produce evidence of a causal nexus between those actions and her protected activity. Temporal proximity is usually not enough to show causation. <em>Nguyen v. City of Cleveland, </em>229 F.3d 559, 566-67 (6th Cir.2000); <em>Cooper v. City of N. Olmsted, </em>795 F.2d 1265, 1272 (6th Cir.1986). \u201cWhere an adverse employment action occurs very close in time after an employer learns of a protected activity,\u201d however, temporal proximity may be enough. <em>Mickey v. Zeidler Tool &amp; Die Co., </em>516 F.3d 516, 525 (6th Cir.2008). But \u201cwhere some time elapses between when the employer learns of a protected activity and the subsequent adverse employment action, the employee must couple temporal proximity with other evidence of retaliatory conduct to establish causality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Mickey, </em>the plaintiff was found to have satisfied his burden of proving causation where his employer fired him the very day it learned of his EEOC charge. <em>Id. </em>at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">We are not convinced that the temporal proximity between several of the allegedly adverse actions and any of Vaughn\u2019s protected conduct is sufficient to give rise to an inference of causation. Vaughn received a letter regarding the termination of her COBRA benefits on May 3, 2004, seven days <em>before </em>she filed the OFCCP complaint. J.A. at 249. She was also discharged before she filed the OFCCP complaint, because she referred to her discharge in the complaint itself. J.A. at 231. In addition, the discharge and denial of benefits occurred approximately one and a half years after Vaughn filed her EEOC charge and approximately eight months after she filed suit in federal court. In contrast to the same-day firing of the employee in <em>Mickey, </em>these lengthy gaps are insufficient, on their own, to create a reasonable inference of causation. <em>See Hamilton v. Starcom Mediavest Group, Inc., </em>522 F.3d 623, 629-30 (6th Cir.2008) (holding that a nine-month gap, standing alone, is insufficient). Vaughn\u2019s job title was changed after she returned to work in October 2002, approximately four months after she had complained to LWC management. It is a closer call whether this four-month gap is sufficient to show causation after <em>Mickey. See Cooper, </em>795 F.2d at 1272 (holding four months insufficient pri- or to <em>Mickey)-, Goller v. Ohio Dept, of Rehab. &amp; Corr., </em>285 Fed.Appx. 250, 257 (6th Cir.2008) (holding two-month gap sufficient after <em>Mickey). </em>We need not make that call today, however, because even if Vaughn\u2019s is one of those few cases in which temporal proximity is enough, LWC has offered legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for its actions and Vaughn is unable to show that they are pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Assuming without deciding, then, that Vaughn has established a prima facie case of retaliation, LWC has produced legitimate business reasons for its actions. LWC claims the change in Vaughn\u2019s job title was simply a re-tooling of job descriptions based on a change in management. The company discharged her because she did not return to work after she exhausted all of her medical leave and vacation time. Finally, it terminated her COBRA benefits because she stopped sending her premium payments to LWC.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>And ultimately, as with her claims of disparate treatment, Vaughn cannot disprove LWC\u2019s proffered reasons or present evidence that they were insufficient to motivate the company\u2019s actions. \u201c[A]s long as an employer has an honest belief in its proffered nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for taking an adverse employment action, \u201cthe employee cannot establish that the reason is pretextual simply because it is ultimately shown to be incorrect.\u201d <em>Majewski v. Automatic Data Processing, Inc., </em>274 F.3d 1106, 1117 (6th Cir.2001). \u201cAn employer has an honest belief in its rationale \u2018when it reasonably relied on the particularized facts that were before it at the time the decision was made.\u2019\u201d <em>Caterpillar Fin. Servs. Corp., </em>496 F.3d at 599 (quoting <em>Majewski, </em>274 F.3d at 1117). The key inquiry is whether the employer made a \u201creasonably informed and considered decision,\u201d not whether the decisional process was optimal or \u201cleft no stone unturned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598-99 (quoting <em>Smith v. Chrysler Corp., </em>155 F.3d 799, 807 (6th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Here, Vaughn has failed to submit evidence showing that the allegedly retaliatory actions were anything but legitimate and honest business decisions. As to the denial of COBRA benefits, Vaughn admitted that \u201cI cannot prove that my checks were sent and received (and should have sent them with return receipt coverage).\u201d J.A. at 250. Regarding her discharge, Vaughn claims LWC did not notify her that she would be discharged if she did not return to work in September 2003. But she admits she knew she was expected to return to work on that date. Whether, as she argued, she could physically return to work is irrelevant. Based on all of the facts before LWC, the company had a reasonable basis and an honestly held belief that Vaughn\u2019s absence from work was grounds for discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Moreover, Vaughn has failed to present evidence \u2014 aside from unsupported, eonclusory assertions \u2014 indicating that retaliation was the true reason for LWC\u2019s actions. We conclude, therefore, that LWC was entitled to summary judgment on Vaughn\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Because Vaughn has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact on her claims of disparate treatment, hostile work environment, and retaliation, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of LWC.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\">. Cecil also filed a lawsuit against LWC, alleging disparate treatment, hostile work environment, and retaliation. <em>See Cecil v. Louisville Water Co., </em>No. 3:03CV-540-S, 2007 WL 2746667 (W.D.Ky. Sept. 18, 2007). Cecil's appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of LWC is also before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b367-13\">.

Accordingly, we express no opinion today as to the applicability of the discovery rule in Title VII cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">. Even if her claims are timely, Vaughn cannot make out a prima facie case of discrimination based on LWC\u2019s failure to promote her to the process owner position. To establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on a failure to promote, a plaintiff must show that 1) she is a member of a protected class; 2) she applied and was qualified for the promotion; 3) she was considered for and denied the promotion; and 4) other employees of similar qualifications who were not members of the protected class received promotions. <em>Grizzell v. City of Columbus Div. of Police, </em>461 F.3d 711, 719 (6th Cir.2006). Vaughn neither was qualified nor applied for the position, and therefore cannot make out a prima facie case. She has also failed to present any evidence that the requirements of the position were drafted in a discriminatory way so as to prevent her from applying.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b370-12\">. Vaughn also argued before the district court that her work was outsourced and that she did not receive the position of Business System Owner of Supplying Customer Service in 2001. Because she has not challenged either of these actions on appeal, we decline to address them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\">. The district court refused to consider Vaughn\u2019s claim regarding her COBRA benefits because she raised it for the first time in her response to LWC's motion for summary judgment. Although that likely amounted to a waiver of the argument and a failure to preserve it for appeal, <em>see Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Flowers, </em>513 F.3d 546, 553 (6th Cir.2008), Vaughn\u2019s claim of retaliation based on the denial of benefits fails on the merits as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
