Mukasey, </em>541 F.3d 257, 263 (4th Cir.2008). A motion for reconsideration must specify the errors of law or fact in the previous decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C) (2006); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(2) (2008). We will reverse the Board\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion only if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. <em>Barry v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 741, 745 (4th Cir.2006). \u201c[Ajdministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-18\">We find the Board did not abuse its discretion in affirming the immigration judge\u2019s order denying the motion to reconsider. We further note we do not have jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s finding that there were no circumstances present warranting sua sponte reopening. <em>See Tamenut v. Mukasey, </em>521 F.3d 1000, 1004 (8th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-19\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
