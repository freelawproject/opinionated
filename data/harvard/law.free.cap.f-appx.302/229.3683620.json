Because Olympio failed to raise this claim before the Board, we find that she has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and we therefore lack jurisdiction over the petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2006) (\u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir. 2004) (holding that the court lacks jurisdiction to consider an argument that was not raised before the Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
