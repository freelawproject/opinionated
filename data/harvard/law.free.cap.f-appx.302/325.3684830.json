He argues that the district court erred by declining his request for a minor role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) because he acted only as a courier for the drugs at issue. Whether a defendant is a minor participant in a drug offense is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-18\">An adjustment for a minor role applies to a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5). To be eligible for a minor role adjustment, a defendant \u201cmust have been peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 447 (5th Cir.2001). The burden is on the defendant to establish his entitlement to the reduction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Burton v. United States, </em>237 F.3d 490, 503 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-19\">A defendant\u2019s role in the offense \u201cturns upon culpability, not courier status.\u201d <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989). Consequently, drug couriers are not necessarily eligible for a reduction of their offense level under \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>65 F.3d 430, 434 (5th Cir.1995). To the contrary, couriers are often \u201can indispensable part of drug dealing networks. Without somebody to take the drugs across the border, the drugs will never reach their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>illicit market.\u201d <em>Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In denying Preciado a minor role adjustment, the district court observed that Preciado was arrested while transporting from Mexico to Memphis, Tennessee, an \u201cexorbitant\u201d amount of marijuana (474.9 kilograms) with a market value of $834,000. The district court did not clearly err in denying Preciado a minor role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Gallegos, </em>868 F.2d 711, 712-13 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
