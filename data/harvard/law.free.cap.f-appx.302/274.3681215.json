The district court granted the defendants\u2019 Fed. R.CivP. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss because it determined that Parks\u2019s claims are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). We review this determination de novo. <em>See In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1230, 170 L.Ed.2d 63 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-21\">Parks\u2019s claims concerning his conviction are barred by <em>Heck </em>because he has failed to establish that the conviction has been reversed, expunged, or otherwise invalidated. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Thus, the appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-22\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim for relief and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Parks is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will be barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
