Ghartey, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Miro Mamic, </em>No. A70 900 307 (B.I.A. Sept. 7, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A70 900 307 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Apr. 14, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">When the BIA\u2019s decision affirms in part and modifies in part the decision of the IJ, we review the decision of the IJ as modified by the BIA. <em>See Brito v. Mukasey, </em>521 F.3d 160, 163 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">An alien is \u201celigible for asylum only if they fear persecution in the country of their nationality or, if they have no nationality, in the country in which they most recently \u2018habitually resided.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wangchuck v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland See., </em>448 F.3d 524, 529 (2d Cir.2006) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)). Therefore, an asylum applicant\u2019s nationality, or lack thereof, is a threshold question when determining eligibility for asylum, <em>id. </em>at 528, and it is the applicant\u2019s burden to establish that eligibility, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-13\">Before analyzing Mamie\u2019s eligibility for the requested relief, the IJ found that Mamie failed to adequately support his claim that he was stateless. The IJ concluded that Mamie was a citizen of Croatia and, after finding him ineligible for relief, ordered him deported to that country. Mamie\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s designation of Croatia as the country of deportation \u2014 the country that he designated through counsel \u2014 is not equivalent to a challenge to the threshold issue of nationality relative to his asylum eligibility. <em>Compare Wangchuck, </em>448 F.3d at 528-29 (discussing the applicant\u2019s nationality), <em>with id. </em>at 530-31 (discussing the designation of the country of removal); <em>see also Jama v. ICE, </em>543 U.S. 335, 337-38, 125 S.Ct. 694, 160 L.Ed.2d 708 (2005). Because Mamie\u2019s brief before the BIA challenged neither the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Mamie is a native and citizen of Croatia, or her order that he be deported there, and because his arguments before this Court focus only on whether he was properly ordered deported to Croatia, he has abandoned any challenge to the agency\u2019s conclusion that he is a native and citizen (and, therefore, a \u201cnational\u201d) of Croatia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007) (discussing abandonment of arguments). Accordingly, we find no reason to disturb the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the issue of whether Mamie may face persecution or torture in Bosnia and Herzegovina is irrelevant given the IJ\u2019s finding that Mamie is a national of Croatia, and ordered him deported there.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b30-10\">. Even if we construed Mamie\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s designation of Croatia as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>country of deportation as a challenge to its determination of his country of citizenship, we would still deny his petition for review. The record evidence indicating Mamie's Croatian citizenship was substantial. Indeed, he was born in Croatia, he attended university there, he served ten months in the Croatian army, and his amended asylum application listed a Croatian address as his last address before his entry into the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
