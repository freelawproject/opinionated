May 16, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 718 249 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 2, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Mei Chai Ye v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>489 F.3d 517, 523 (2d Cir.2007). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007). For applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see Matter of J-Y-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">As an initial matter, because Lin failed to raise before this Court any challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of her CAT claim, we deem any such argument waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">As to Lin\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims, we find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. In her brief to this Court, Lin does not challenge many of the IJ\u2019s credibility findings, including his findings that: (1) her testimony that her parents fled their home after the authorities confiscated it was inconsistent with her application and her mother\u2019s letter, which listed the mother\u2019s current address as the address of the allegedly confiscated property; (2) Lin\u2019s explanation for the discrepancy concerning the address\u2014 that her parents moved back to the house without any problems even though Lin never surrendered and her mother still practices Falun Gong (\u201cFLG\u201d) \u2014 was implausible; (3) Lin\u2019s failure to provide any evidence that she practices FLG in the United States, despite fleeing to the United States in part to have the freedom to practice FLG, was a \u201cbehavioral inconsistency\u201d; (4) her demeanor while testifying and her inability to provide details about pivotal facts undermined her credibility; and (5) Lin\u2019s claim that she was able to depart China using her national I.D. card was implausible. Because Lin was waived any challenge to these findings, they stand as proper bases for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">As to the few findings Lin does challenge, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. For example, we are not compelled to disagree with the IJ\u2019s finding that Lin\u2019s explanation as to her mother\u2019s ability to write the letter, despite her lack of education, was not believable. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, as Lin\u2019s testimony was not otherwise credible, it was not improper for the IJ to rely on the absence of any evidence corroborating her claim that her mother joined FLG to improve her health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>or Lin\u2019s own alleged practice of FLG in the United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006). Under the REAL ID Act, these findings were sufficient to support the Id\u2019s conclusion that Lin was not credible. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 166-67 (2d Cir.2008). Therefore, the IJ properly denied Lin\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal because the only evidence that she would be persecuted depended on her credibility. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-7\">. We are mindful that Lin appears before the Court <em>pro se. </em>However, even construing her submissions broadly, we cannot find that she has offered any arguments as to these findings. <em>Cf. Weixel v. Board of Educ., </em>287 F.3d 138, 145-46 (2d Cir.2002) (in the context of a motion to dismiss) construing <em>pro se </em>plaintiff\u2019s pleadings so as to raise \"the strongest arguments that they suggest\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b67-14\">. Where the IJ's findings left little doubt that he did not believe Lin to be a genuine adherent of Falun Gong, the adverse credibility determination prevented Lin \"from establishing the subjective prong of the well-founded fear standard.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 183 (2d Cir.2004)(same); <em>See also Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
