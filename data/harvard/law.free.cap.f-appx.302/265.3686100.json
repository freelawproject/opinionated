When, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. See <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-25\">Bukhari, who sought withholding of removal based on his political opinion, argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not supported by the record. Our review of the record establishes that the IJ\u2019s findings that Bukhari\u2019s testimony is incredible is supported by the record. For example, Bukhari testified that he was his district\u2019s General Secretary for a political party that opposed the government of Pakistan, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>he organized and engaged in anti-government demonstrations, and that he published anti-government pamphlets. None of those facts were mentioned in Bukhari\u2019s application for withholding of removal. Bukhari also testified that he was hospitalized after being jailed and beaten by police for three days because of his political activities. However, he did not produce any documentation of his hospitalization and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Bukhari has not shown that the record compels this court to substitute its judgment for that of the IJ. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
