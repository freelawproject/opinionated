The district court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s denial and this appeal followed. We \u201cindependently determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision (1) is free of legal error and (2) is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1279 (9th Cir.1996). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-15\">1. Psychological Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b772-16\">The ALJ properly complied with an Appeals Council remand order requiring the ALJ to obtain evidence of Widman\u2019s mental impairments and incorporate that evidence into his calculation of Widman\u2019s residual functioning capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d). Widman was examined by Dr. Starr, who conducted a mental examination lasting at least 90 minutes and whose report shows that he collected narrative background information, inquired into Widman\u2019s psychological and pain symptoms and incorporated that information into his conclusions. The ALJ\u2019s discussion of Dr. Starr\u2019s evidence referred to the appropriate regulations, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a, and concluded that Widman\u2019s mental impairments were not severe, thereby discharging the ALJ\u2019s duty to \u201ctake any action that is ordered by the Appeals Council.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.977(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-17\">The ALJ did not err by rejecting Dr. Starr\u2019s conclusion that Widman suffered from moderate to severe impairment in social functioning. The ALJ found evidence in Dr. Starr\u2019s report that Widman exaggerated his symptoms, which is a clear and convincing reason to reject the doctor\u2019s conclusions. <em>See Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 958 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-18\">2. Medical Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b772-19\">The ALJ had specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting Dr. Sandefur\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>conclusion \u2014 endorsed by Widman\u2019s former treating physician, Dr. Burns \u2014 that Widman was able to work only part time with very limited duties. The ALJ was not required to discuss Dr. Burns\u2019 endorsement of Dr. Sandefur\u2019s conclusion. Although an ALJ must discuss all probative evidence, <em>see Vincent ex rel. Vincent v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 1393, 1394 (9th Cir. 1984), whether Drs. Burns and Sandefur ultimately agreed about Widman\u2019s disability was beside the point. The ALJ simply noted that the absence of severe symptoms in Dr. Burns\u2019 records was inconsistent with the severity of symptoms found by Dr. Sandefur and, moreover, that Widman\u2019s history of symptom exaggeration tainted the medical conclusions. By discussing these inconsistencies, the ALJ fulfilled his duty to resolve ambiguities in the medical evidence. <em>See Andrews v. Shalala, 53 </em>F.3d 1035, 1039-40 (9th Cir.1995). The ALJ discounted Dr. Sandefur\u2019s medical report because it was solicited by Widman\u2019s counsel for litigation purposes. <em>See Saelee v. Chater, </em>94 F.3d 520, 522-23 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam); <em>Burkhart v. Bowen, </em>856 F.2d 1335, 1339 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The ALJ\u2019s rejection of treating physician Dr. Smithson\u2019s conclusion was supported by clear and convincing evidence, because that conclusion was inconsistent with Widman\u2019s capabilities as they were described in many of Dr. Smithson\u2019s clinical notes. <em>See Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 725 (9th Cir.1998). \u201cSuch a discrepancy is a clear and convincing reason for not relying on the doctor\u2019s opinion regarding [the claimant\u2019s] limited ability ....\u201d <em>Bayliss v. Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1216 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">3. Hearing Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Widman introduced evidence of impairments that would reasonably be expected to produce his subjective symptoms of pain and depression and testified to the severity of those symptoms. \u201cIf the claimant produces [such] evidence ... <em>and there is no evidence of malingering, </em>the ALJ can reject the claimant\u2019s testimony about the severity of [his] symptoms only by offering specific, clear and convincing reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1281 (emphasis added). The ALJ noted several instances of malingering, including treating physician Dr. Smithson\u2019s conclusion that Widman often amplified his symptoms and the report of an examining physician, Dr. Allen, who observed Widman purposefully underperforming on a medical exam. The ALJ properly rejected Widman\u2019s testimony by using \u2018\u201cordinary techniques of credibility evaluation,\u2019 \u201d and by observing Widman\u2019s tendency to exaggerate. <em>Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1148 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 341, 346 (9th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">The ALJ did not err in rejecting Janine Errend\u2019s lay testimony, noting that Errand\u2019s testimony about the extent of Widman\u2019s symptoms was inconsistent with medical reports that Widman had been chopping and hauling wood during the same time period. <em>See Bayliss, </em>427 F.3d at 1218 (holding that \u201c[i]nconsistency with medical evidence is [a germane] reason\u201d for rejecting lay testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">4. The RFC Calculation and Step Five Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">The ALJ did not fail to provide for Widman\u2019s inability to work \u201con a regular and continuing basis (i.e., 8 hours a day, for 5 days a week, or an equivalent work schedule)\u201d in calculating Widman\u2019s RFC. SSR 96-8p. The ALJ specifically found how many hours out of an eight hour work day Widman could be expected to stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>and walk and identified his RFC as the <em>most </em>he could do.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The ALJ need not conduct a \u201cfunction-by-function analysis for medical conditions or impairments that the ALJ found neither credible nor supported by the record.\u201d <em>Bayliss, </em>427 F.3d at 1217. Because the ALJ properly rejected evidence of Widman\u2019s mental impairments, the ALJ did not err by failing to alter Widman\u2019s RFC to reflect these impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The vocational expert\u2019s testimony at Widman\u2019s hearing was proper. \u201cAn ALJ may take administrative notice of any reliable job information, including information provided by a VE. A YE\u2019s recognized expertise provides the necessary foundation for his or her testimony.\u201d <em>Bayliss, </em>427 F.3d at 1218 (citation omitted). \u201cThus, no additional foundation is required.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b772-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
