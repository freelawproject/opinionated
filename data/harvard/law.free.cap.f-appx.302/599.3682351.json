We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1160(e)(3), 1252, and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The LAU did not make findings that were \u201cdirectly contrary to clear and convincing facts contained in the record considered as a whole,\u201d abuse its discretion, or violate due process in concluding that Lopez Garibaldo failed to establish the requisite period of qualifying employment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1160(b)(3); <em>Perez-Martin v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 752, 758-59 (9th Cir.2005). In rebuttal, the government offered evidence which called into question Lopez Garibaldo\u2019s claim of employment. The letter Lopez Garibaldo submitted on appeal was insufficient to negate the inference of the government\u2019s showing. <em>See Perez-Martin, </em>394 F.3d at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">We conclude that the BIA acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence presented with the motion to reopen was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
