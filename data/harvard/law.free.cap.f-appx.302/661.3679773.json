We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-24\">Cobbs contends that: (1) the trial court erred by denying his request for a \u201cclaim of right\u201d jury instruction; (2) there was insufficient evidence that the murder was the natural and probable consequence of his unarmed assault of the victim; (3) the trial court erred by denying his request for a jury instruction stating that the shooting was not a natural and probable consequence of the assault if it was the independent act of one of the participants; (4) the jury instructions improperly permitted the jury to consider whether the crime of murder in the abstract is a natural and probable consequence of the crime of assault in the abstract; (5) the natural and probable consequences doctrine violates due process because it permits conviction based on ordinary negligence; (6) the natural and probable consequences doctrine creates an unconstitutional presumption of the presence of malice; (7) the trial court erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>admitting certain expert testimony; (8) the trial court erred by denying his motion to strike his prior juvenile adjudication; and (9) his due process rights were violated by the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct a continuous preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">We conclude that the state court\u2019s decision rejecting these claims was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Lackawanna v. Coss, </em>582 U.S. 394, 121 S.Ct. 1567, 149 L.Ed.2d 608 (2001); <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993); <em>Estelle v.
