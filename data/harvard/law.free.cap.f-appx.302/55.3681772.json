Jan. 22, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-26\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-27\">We find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. A motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days after the date on which a final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Here, it is undisputed that Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>time limit does not apply to a motion to reopen that is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Such changes are regularly referred to as \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d and distinguished from \u201cchanged personal circumstances.\u201d <em>Jian Huan Guan v. BIA, </em>345 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Here, Zheng argued in his untimely motion that his proceedings should be reopened because: (1) his wife is a Falun Gong practitioner, and he feared harm \u201cas a close relative of [a] Falun Gong practitioner\u201d; (2) his wife was six months pregnant, and his detention in this country brought her anxiety and depression; and (3) his deportation would mean that his child would never see her father. Because none of these assertions describe changed country conditions, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Jian Huan Guan, </em>345 F.3d at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">To the extent Zheng argues that his case is analogous to <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109 (2d Cir.2006), we will not consider that unexhausted argument. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007) (describing issue exhaustion as \u201cmandatory\u201d). Finally, to the extent that Zheng challenges the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen, we are without jurisdiction to consider that decision. <em>See Azmond Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517-18 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. However, Zheng claims to have been removed to China in March 2008 notwithstanding his filing of a motion for a stay of removal pending decision of his petition, the government\u2019s representation that it did not oppose the motion, and the forbearance agreement between the government and this Court by which an alien who has filed such a motion would not be removed pending decision of the motion. As the government did not respond to this claim in its brief, the government IS HEREBY ORDERED to file in this Court, within fifteen (15) days of the date of this order, an affidavit indicating: (1) whether it breached the forbearance agreement and/or contradicted its representation that it did not oppose the stay, and (2) if so, why it should not be sanctioned as a result. <em>See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 46, 50, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991) (holding that federal courts have the inherent power to sanction \u201ca full range of litigation abuses\u201d). The petitioner may file a response to the government\u2019s affidavit within fifteen (15) days of the date on which the government\u2019s affidavit is filed. As we have otherwise completed our review of the petition, the pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
