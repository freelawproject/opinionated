We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 n. 4 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-20\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Sumanti has shown changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the untimely filing of his asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4), (5); <em>see also Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 657-58 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-21\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because the petitioners have not established past persecution. <em>See Hoxha, </em>319 F.3d at 1182. Further, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that the petitioners did not show a clear probability of future persecution because their similarly situated Christian family members remain in Indonesia without incident. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-22\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT because the petitioners failed to demonstrate that they were ever tortured in the past, or that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>more likely than not they will be tortured upon returning to Indonesia. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b557-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
