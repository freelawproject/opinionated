The government agreed to drop all other charges. In May 2003, he was sentenced in United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania to a term of imprisonment of 480 months, to be followed by five years of supervised release. We affirmed in <em>United States v. Craft, </em>139 Fed.Appx. 372, 374-75 (3d Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In December 2006, the District Court denied Craft\u2019s timely filed motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We denied his request for a certificate of appealability in July 2007 in <em>United States v. Craft, </em>No. 07-1060 (3d Cir. July 30, 2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-16\">In October 2007, Craft filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, the common-law equivalent of a section 2255 motion, which the District Court denied on October 23, 2007. In November 2007, he filed a second ad subjiciendum petition, which the District Court denied on November 13, 2007, 2007 WL 3491286. In December 2007, Craft filed a Rule 60(b) motion to void the criminal judgment based on fraud upon the court, which the District Court denied on February 11, 2008. Since that date, Craft has filed several motions seeking to void the criminal judgment, all of which were denied by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>At issue in the instant appeal, on June 16, 2008, Craft filed an item titled \u201cMemorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Court to Assign Hearing for Court to Prove Jurisdiction^enue,\u201d seeking a hearing on the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction over his criminal case. In an order entered on June 17, 2008, the District Court denied the motion. Craft timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Our Clerk notified Craft by letter that this appeal was subject to summary disposition under Third Cir. LAE 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. He was invited to submit argument in writing, but he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6, we may summarily dispose of an appeal when it clearly appears that no substantial question is presented by the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">We will summarily affirm the order of the District Court denying the motion for a hearing on jurisdiction and venue. In view of his history of direct and collateral challenges to his criminal judgment, the District Court correctly denied Craft a hearing on his \u201cforeign sovereign immunity\u201d jurisdictional argument. It clearly appears that no substantial question is presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court, denying Craft\u2019s motion for a hearing on jurisdiction and venue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-12\">. Craft argued on direct appeal that the government breached the plea agreement because he had agreed to plead guilty only to manslaughter under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(j)(2). We rejected the claim as meritless on the ground that the superceding information charged Craft with murder, and the plea colloquy clearly indicated that he was pleading guilty to murder, not manslaughter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-17\">. Craft alleged in his section 2255 motion that his guilty plea was involuntary, trial counsel was ineffective at sentencing, and the District Court improperly departed upward from the Guidelines without giving him advance notice. After holding a hearing, the District Court rejected these arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-10\">. We will treat this as a final and appealable post-judgment order. <em>See Isidor Paiewonsky, Inc. v. Sharp Properties, Inc., </em>998 F.2d 145 (3d Cir. 1993); <em>Plymouth Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.
