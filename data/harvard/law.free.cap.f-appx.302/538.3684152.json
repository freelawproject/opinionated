Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">The BIA acted within its discretion in denying Calderon Flores\u2019 motion as untimely because it was filed more than eighteen months after the BIA\u2019s final order, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (motion to reopen must generally be filed within ninety days of the final administrative decision), and Calderon Flores failed to establish grounds for sufficient equitable tolling, <em>see Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897 (equitable tolling is available \u201cwhen a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud or error,\u201d as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">We lack jurisdiction to review Calderon Flores\u2019 contention that his first immigration attorney provided ineffective assistance because Calderon Flores failed to raise that issue before the BIA. <em>See Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring \u201can alien who argues ineffective assistance of counsel to exhaust his administrative remedies by first presenting the issue to the BIA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to invoke its sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b565-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
