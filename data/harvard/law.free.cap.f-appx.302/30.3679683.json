Feb. 29, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity -with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that such motions are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)). Here, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Qosaj\u2019s motion to reopen. A party may file a motion to reopen removal proceedings no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1), (c)(2). However, this time limitation does not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings to apply or reapply for asylum \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-14\">It is undisputed that Qosaj filed his November 2007 motion to reopen more than 90 days after the BIA\u2019s September 2002 final order of removal. In support of his motion, Qosaj provided two affidavits, one detailing the political situation in Albania for the last half century, and the other from an individual alleging that Qosaj\u2019s mother had been beaten and interrogated by authorities about Qosaj\u2019s whereabouts. As to the first, at best, it demonstrates that the difficult political conditions in Albania have continued, not worsened. Furthermore, as the BIA noted, Qosaj acknowledged that the Democratic Party\u2014 the party he supported \u2014 was now in control. Such changed circumstance seemingly makes it less, not more, likely that Qosaj would be persecuted for his allegiance to the Democratic Party if returned to Albania. <em>See Hoxhallari v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 179, 187-88 (2d Cir.2006). While the other affidavit alleges that Qosaj\u2019s mother was beaten and threatened by secret police looking for him, that affidavit relates to the same claim the agency previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ously found not credible. Given that Qosaj never overcame that credibility determination, the BIA was not required to credit the evidence he submitted with his motion to reopen. <em>See, e.g., Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 234 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that the BIA does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to reopen where the evidence submitted with that motion relates to the same claim the agency found not credible in the underlying proceeding); <em>see also Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143,147-48 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
