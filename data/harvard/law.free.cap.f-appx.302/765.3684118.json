R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">The Defendant-Appellant challenges the length of his forty-one month sentence for illegal re-entry by a deported alien. Mr. Ruiz-Velgara pleaded guilty to the charge without a plea agreement. The district court then sentenced him to forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment, at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range. On appeal, Mr. Ruiz-Velgara challenges only the procedural reasonableness of the sentence. Because the district judge adequately explained the sentence, we AFFIRM the forty-one month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">In November 2007, ICE agents took Mr. Ruiz-Velgara into custody after he had been arrested in Topeka, Kansas. Officials then discovered that Mr. Ruiz-Velgara was in the United States illegally, having previously been deported. He was convicted in 2000 of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, an aggravated felony. He was deported to Mexico in 2002 and re-entered the United States illegally in 2005. Mr. Ruiz-Velgara pleaded guilty to illegal re-entry by a deported alien. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">At sentencing, Mr. Ruiz-Velgara did not challenge the calculation of the applicable Guidelines range, forty-one to fifty-one months. Mr. Ruiz-Velgara instead argued for a downward variance to a thirty-month sentence. He asserted that the sixteen-month enhancement \u2014 taking his offense level from 8 to 24 \u2014 for his prior drug conviction overstated the severity of the prior crime. He also argued that because Kansas does not have a \u201cfast-track program\u201d that would potentially have reduced his sentence, the forty-one month sentence created an unwarranted sentencing disparity between him and defendants in jurisdictions that utilize fast-track programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-16\">The district judge went into great detail in explaining the sentence, but touched only briefly on the fast-track argument. In explaining the sentence, the judge first explained the Guidelines calculation. He then stated that he had considered the parties\u2019 statements and the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The judge noted Mr. Ruiz-Velgara\u2019s previous conviction and recent arrest for domestic battery. He considered and rejected Mr. Ruiz-Velgara\u2019s argument that the sixteen-level enhancement represented unfair double-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>counting. He noted the \u201cserious risk\u201d of a defendant with this criminal history returning illegally to the United States, as well as Mr. Ruiz-Velgara\u2019s \u201clack of respect for the laws of this country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Regarding Mr. Ruiz-Velgara\u2019s argument that fast-track programs in other jurisdictions lead to a sentencing disparity, the judge said, \u201cNotwithstanding the defendant\u2019s position over what he calls an unwarranted disparity with fast track jurisdictions, the Court believes the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s offense and the need to protect the public fully warrant a sentence at the low end of the guideline range of 41 months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">On appeal, Mr. Ruiz-Velgara asserts that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not adequately address his fast-track argument. Mr. Ruiz-Velgara does not challenge any of the district court\u2019s substantive conclusions, either its acceptance of the sixteen-level enhancement or its decision not to vary based on fast-track programs in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">Mr. Ruiz-Velgara\u2019s argument fails because it is based on the inaccurate notion that the district court must fully address all of a defendant\u2019s arguments for a lower sentence. His argument is based on language from our decision in <em>United States v. Hall, </em>478 F.3d 1295 (10th Cir.2007). We wrote that \u201cwhen a district court fails to consider a defendant\u2019s non-frivolous argument that a variance from the Guidelines is warranted under \u00a7 3553(a) ... the failure renders the sentence procedurally unreasonable such that resentencing is required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314. The district court\u2019s brief reference to the fast-track argument, Mr. Ruiz-Velgara asserts, did not adequately address the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Mr. Ruiz-Velgara then explained why the court should find that fast-track programs in other jurisdictions create unwarranted sentencing disparities. Essentially, that argument is substantive. Presumably, Mr. Ruiz-Velgara makes that argument to demonstrate that his previous argument was not \u201cfrivolous,\u201d tracking the language in <em>Hall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">First, it is worth noting that <em>Hall </em>vacated a sentence that was outside the recommended Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 1313-14. By the terms of the sentencing statute, district courts are required to give more specific explanations of the reasons for imposing sentence outside than for imposing a sentence within the recommended Guidelines ranges. Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) requires the district court, in all cases, to state the \u201creasons for its imposition of the particular sentence,\u201d but if the court imposes a sentence outside the Guidelines range, the statute requires the court to provide \u201cthe specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from [the Guidelines range],\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>Hall </em>is therefore distinguishable from this case, in which the district court sentenced Mr. Ruiz-Velgara within the Guidelines. However, <em>Hall </em>cites <em>United States v. Sanchez-Juarez, </em>446 F.3d 1109 (10th Cir.2006), in which this court did vacate a within-Guidelines sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1118. We discuss briefly how our case law has evolved since <em>Sanchez-Juarez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">In February 2007, we stated that when a district court sentences a defendant within the Guidelines range, \u201cSection 3553(c) requires the court to provide only a general statement of the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz-Terrazas, </em>477 F.3d 1196, 1199 (10th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted). In March 2007, we rejected the notion that <em>Sanchez-Juarez </em>requires judges to ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>dress \u201ceach and every argument for leniency.\u201d <em>United States v. Jarrillo-Luna, </em>478 F.3d 1226, 1229 (10th Cir.2007). We held that the sentencing judge merely \u201cmust somehow indicate that he or she did not rest on the guidelines alone, but considered whether the guideline sentence actually conforms, in the circumstances, to the statutory factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1230 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">In June 2007, the Supreme Court addressed sentencing issues in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The Court wrote that \u201cwhen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2468. The Court said that a judge would \u201cnormally\u201d address nonfrivolous arguments for a different sentence, <em>id., </em>but the Court did not require such a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Subsequently, we held that \u201c[a] court\u2019s brief explanation for a Guidelines sentence may be sufficient when the context and the record clearly show that the court listened to and considered the evidence and the arguments.\u201d <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>510 F.3d 1209, 1218 (10th Cir.2007). In another case we wrote that, despite the district court\u2019s failure to address the defendant\u2019s request for a departure, \u201cits citation of the PSR\u2019s calculation method and recitation of the suggested imprisonment range amply fulfilled \u00a7 3553(c)\u2019s requirement of a general statement noting the appropriate guideline range and how it was calculated.\u201d <em>United States v. Cereceres-Zavala, </em>499 F.3d 1211, 1217 (10th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">In this case, the district court\u2019s explanation easily cleared the bar set by our precedent. The district judge did everything done by the judge in <em>Cereceres-Zavala, </em>and much more. Like the judge in <em>Cereceres-Zavala, </em>the judge discussed the PSR calculation and the suggested imprisonment range. In addition, he discussed Mr. Ruiz-Velgara\u2019s previous conviction and arrest; he discussed Mr. Ruiz-Velgara\u2019s disregard for the law; he discussed whether Mr. Ruiz-Velgara\u2019s criminal history score was fair; and he mentioned the \u00a7 3553(a) factors three times. Though not required to do so by our precedent, the judge fully addressed one of Mr. RuizVelgara\u2019s arguments for a variance, the sixteen-level enhancement. The judge even made reference to the argument that Mr. Ruiz-Velgara claims he failed to address \u2014 the alleged disparity based on fast-track programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Clearly, the district court did everything required of it and more. We therefore reject Mr. Ruiz-Velgara\u2019s contention that the sentence was procedurally unreasonable. Because Mr. Ruiz-Velgara has made no claim that the sentence was substantively unreasonable, we need not consider whether fast-track programs in other jurisdictions create unwarranted disparities in sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">The district court adequately explained its reasons for sentencing Mr. Ruiz-Velgara to forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. We therefore reject Mr. Ruiz-Velgara\u2019s argument that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable, and we AFFIRM the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b792-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
