Esparza-Medrano argues that although his sentence was within the recommended guidelines range, it should not be presumed reasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is flawed under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), wherein the Supreme Court recognized that certain Guidelines do not take account of empirical data and national experience. Esparza-Medrano also argues that his guidelines sentence was unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-25\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we consider whether the sentence imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>is procedurally sound. <em>Id. </em>at 597. Thereafter, we consider whether the sentence is substantively reasonable, using an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>A sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575, Esparza-Medrano argues that the within-guidelines sentence imposed in his case should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness. Esparza-Medrano contends that the justification for applying a presumption of reasonableness in his case is undercut because \u00a7 2L1.2, the Guideline used to calculate his advisory sentencing guidelines range, was not promulgated according to usual Sentencing Commission procedures and did not take into account \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d He portrays the <em>Kimbrough </em>decision as having \u201csuggested\u201d that the appellate presumption should not be applied to Guidelines that did not take account of this data and experience. He also argues that the appellate presumption should not apply because \u00a7 2L1.2 gives heavy weight to prior convictions, which effectively double counts a defendant\u2019s criminal record in establishing his guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary5 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008), which involved a similar challenge to \u00a7 2L1.2. The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Esparza-Medrano has demonstrated neither that there was any procedural error with respect to his sentence nor that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Nor has he rebutted the presumption of reasonableness afforded his sentence. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554. Accordingly, he has not shown that his sentence was an abuse of discretion by the district court. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
