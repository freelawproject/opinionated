McCONNELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b795-23\">Jose Esteban Guerrero, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) that would allow him to appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). Because we conclude that Mr. Guerrero has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d we deny his request for a COA and dismiss the appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-24\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b795-25\">Mr. Guerrero was charged with illegal reentry and distribution of methamphetamine. The distribution charge was initially dropped, and Mr. Guerrero pled guilty to the reentry charge. He was sentenced to eighteen months. But the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>ernment again brought distribution charges, apparently based on the same transaction as the previously dropped distribution charge. Mr. Guerrero was convicted on all charges, and sentenced to life in prison because he had two prior felony drug convictions. The convictions were affirmed on appeal. <em>See United States v. Guerrero, </em>89 Fed.Appx. 140 (10th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Mr. Guerrero then sought \u00a7 2255 relief, raising two issues: 1) that his counsel had coerced him into pleading guilty to the illegal reentry charge; and 2) that his counsel was ineffective. The magistrate recommended that the \u00a7 2255 motion be denied, and the district court accepted the recommendation. A final order of dismissal was entered on May 80, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Mr. Guerrero filed a notice of change in the law on February 19, 2008, more than eight months after the final order was issued. The district court, treating the notice as a Rule 60(b) motion, denied it. Mr. Guerrero then filed a \u201cmotion to be provided with court\u2019s judgment order rendered sometime in 2007.\u201d Mr. Guerrero claimed that he had never received notice of the final judgement on his \u00a7 2255 motion. He prayed for \u201c\u2018out-of-time\u2019 leave for notice of appeal.\u201d The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Mr. Guerrero filed another motion on March 13 \u2014 this one explicitly a Rule 60(b) motion \u2014 stating that he had no \u201copportunity to appeal and apply for COA.\u201d He asked to be provided with a copy of the judgment against him, and also for leave to appeal. This order was denied on May 22, 2008, with the court noting that Mr. Guerrero had filed a notice of change of address on May 7, 2007 (before the final order went out) and the court sent the order to that address in Tucson, Arizona. The court also observed that Mr. Guerrero mailed his notice of change of law (dated February 4, 2008) \u201cfrom the same Arizona address.\u201d The district court deemed that the order was therefore \u201cproperly served\u201d on Mr. Guerrero.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Mr. Guerrero filed yet another motion, this one for reconsideration, on June 23, 2008. He stated again that he had not received the notice of final judgment, and swore an affidavit to that effect. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Mr. Guerrero then filed another motion, entitled \u201cDefendant\u2019s Excusable Negligence Notice of Appeal.\u201d The district court, treating it as an application for a certificate of appealability, denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">Mr. Guerrero now seeks a COA from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">The denial of a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 may be appealed only if the district court or this Court first issues a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). A COA will issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make such a showing, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B), in cases where the United States is a party, a notice of appeal must be filed within 60 days. Mr. Guerrero did not file <em>anything </em>until nearly a year after the final order was issued in his \u00a7 2255 motion. Ordinarily, Mr. Guerrero\u2019s appeal could be dismissed as untimely. <em>See Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>2860, 2363-64, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007) (taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d). Mr. Guerrero says, however, that he never received the final order, and in his appeal before this court he includes an affidavit from Jose Gonzalez \u2014 who claims to have (mistakenly) received Mr. Guerreo\u2019s final order. Mr. Guerrero does seem to have a copy of the district court\u2019s opinion now, as he refers to it in his notice of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">According to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6), a district court may reopen the time for filing an appeal upon a motion that is \u201cfiled within 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 7 days after the moving party receives notice ... of the entry, whichever is earlier[.]\u201d Mr. Guerrero\u2019s first motion, indicating a change in the law, was filed over 180 days after the final order was issued; moreover, it appears Mr. Guerrero did not file his motion for leave to appeal until more than seven days after he claims he received actual notice of the judgment. The order denying his \u201cnotice re: change in the law,\u201d which informed him of a judgment against him in 2007, was entered on February 29, 2008, and Mr. Guerrero did not file his next motion until March 13, 2008. This latter point is of course irrelevant, as the federal rule specifies, clearly, that there is a 180-day limit to the filing of appeals. Even if Mr. Guerrero had filed his appeal immediately after the district court denied his notice regarding the change in the law, his appeal would still have been untimely. And \u201cnothing within Rule 4(a)(6) indicates it is permissive or that its limitations may be waived for equitable reasons.\u201d <em>Clark v. Lavallie, </em>204 F.3d 1038, 1040 (10th Cir.2000). Accordingly, Mr. Guerrero\u2019s appeal was untimely and he is not entitled to a COA.. No reasonable jurist would conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">We pause to observe that it is unclear whether all of the confusion regarding Mr. Guerrero\u2019s address was due to the court system or to Mr. Guerrero himself. The district court seems to have reasonably relied on the information Mr. Guerrero himself supplied about his location in his notice of change of address. Moreover, \u201cparties have a duty to inquire periodically into the status of their litigation.\u201d <em>Latham v. Wells Fargo Bank, </em>987 F.2d 1199, 1201 (5th Cir.1993). Mr. Guerrero might have taken it upon himself to investigate why so long a period of time had passed before he heard anything \u2014 good, bad, or indifferent \u2014 about his suit. He did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Accordingly, we DENY Mr. Guerrero\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS this appeal. Mr. Guerrero\u2019s request to proceed <em>informa pawperis </em>is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b795-16\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
