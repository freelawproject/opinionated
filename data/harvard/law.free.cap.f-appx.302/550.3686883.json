We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo due process claims, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">We agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that petitioners\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails because they did not establish that the alleged ineffective assistance may have affected the outcome of their proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 899-900. Petitioners\u2019 evidence was insufficient to establish the requisite level of hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 902 (concluding there was no prejudice where the evidence did not establish the requisite level of hardship).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b577-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
