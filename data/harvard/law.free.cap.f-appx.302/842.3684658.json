O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Michael Dean Helton was convicted in a bench trial of producing child pornography and was sentenced to 300 months imprisonment. He contends the district court erred in concluding a secret videotape he made of an eleven-year-old girl wearing opaque underpants is a \u201clascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area\u201d prohibited by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a). He also argues the court erred by calculating his mandatory minimum sentence on the basis of a prior conviction which was not charged in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">The facts are uncontested.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On or about January 3, 2007, Helton\u2019s brother and sister-in-law found a camcorder and two videotapes in Helton\u2019s bedroom at his residence in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. After viewing the tapes and discovering the contents, they delivered the tapes to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Government\u2019s Exhibit 1 is a copy of one of the videotapes found in Helton\u2019s bedroom. It was made by Helton in the fall of 2005. It is approximately ninety minutes long, but the majority of it is blank. One portion of the tape depicts a group of adults sitting around a kitchen table playing cards. The incriminating portion of the tape shows Helton placing a camcorder in the bathroom of his residence at approximately the level of his head. He is later shown retrieving the camcorder and placing it at floor level directly across from the toilet. Helton is shown positioning the camera to angle upward toward the toilet. He is also shown placing paper around the camera to secure and conceal it. Approximately two and one-half minutes of the videotape depict B.M., an eleven-year-old girl, who, along with her mother, M.H., stayed with Helton at his residence in the fall of 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Helton knew B.M. was under the age of eighteen. B.M. is first seen seated upon the toilet facing the hidden camera located below. B.M.\u2019s face and upper body are visible and she is wearing a bra. M.H. was with B.M. in the bathroom and a portion of M.H.\u2019s body is also visible. B.M. stands up and pulls up her underpants. Her underpants are the center of the focused area. A portion of her bare midriff and upper legs is visible, but the underpants and pubic area comprise the primary image for one and one-half to two minutes. B.M. then pulls on shorts and walks away from the camera\u2019s view. B.M. and M.H. were not aware they were being recorded. Government\u2019s Exhibit 1A is an excerpt of Exhibit 1 showing only Helton setting up the camera and B.M. and M.H. in the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">Government\u2019s Exhibit 2 is a copy of the second videotape found in Helton\u2019s bedroom. It was made by Helton at his residence in Borger, Texas. It is approximately ninety minutes long. A portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>the tape shows Helton concealing a camcorder in a waste basket in the bathroom and arranging it so as to point upwards. A later portion shows Helton entering the bathroom and rearranging the camcorder, adding toilet paper around it to secure it and adjusting it several times. Among the depictions shown is an image of M.G., the six or seven-year-old daughter of DA.G. M.G. is seen entering the bathroom and sitting on the toilet. Her pubic area and genitals are not exposed. Also depicted is J.J., who was fourteen years old at the time, undressing for a shower. J.J.\u2019s breasts and buttocks are displayed but her pubic area is not visible. Government\u2019s Exhibit 2A is an excerpt of Exhibit 2 showing only Helton setting up the camera and M.G. and J.J. in the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">After Helton\u2019s brother and sister-in-law delivered the videotapes to the police, a search warrant was executed at Helton\u2019s Oklahoma City residence; the police searched Helton\u2019s mobile home, pickup truck and semi-tractor truck. The search resulted in the seizure of approximately 247 items of evidence which reveal Helton\u2019s preoccupation with images of women and girls in their underwear. The police discovered five \u201cPanty Play\u201d magazines which depict images of women in their underwear. They also found a number of DVD jackets or containers including: \u201cReal Hidden Panties 6,\u201d \u201cReal Hidden Panties 7,\u201d and \u201cReal Hidden Panties 8.\u201d The DVD covers depict images of women photographed from a lower level so as to reveal the underwear underneath their clothing. The cover to \u201cReal Hidden Panties 6\u201d advertises: \u201cOur hidden cameras sneak in all the places you ever dreamed of going\u201d to \u201cget a glimpse of beautiful females\u2019 undies!\u201d (R. Vol. I, Doc. 26 at 5.) A DVD entitled \u201cPerverted Peep Show\u201d was found in Helton\u2019s DVD player at his residence. In Helton\u2019s pickup truck, the police found 156 photocopied pages showing images of women and girls in their underwear focusing on their genitals or pubic area.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Based on the images depicted in Government\u2019s Exhibit 1A, Helton was indicted with one count of sexual exploitation of a child in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a). Specifically, the indictment charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azb\">MICHAEL DEAN HELTON [ ] used a minor girl to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of that conduct and the visual depiction was produced using materials that had been mailed, shipped, and transported in interstate or foreign commerce, in that, the defendant secreted a video camera in a bathroom and video-taped an 11-year-old girl in a manner depicting a lascivious exhibition of the genitals and public area of the girl.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">(R. Vol. I, Doc. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">The parties jointly requested a non-jury trial pursuant to Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the court granted the request. The parties stipulated to many of the relevant facts discussed above. They also stipulated the camcorder and videotapes were manufactured outside the State of Oklahoma and therefore traveled in interstate commerce. They further stipulated Government\u2019s Exhibits 1, 1A, 2 and 2A were true and correct copies of the videotapes Helton produced and were admissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">The court found Helton guilty though \u201cacknowledg[ing] that [Helton\u2019s] bizarre conduct here is far different from the profoundly unspeakable and destructive types of child pornography usually brought before this court under \u00a7 2251(a).\u201d (R. Vol. I, Doc. 26 at 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">A presentence report (PSR) was prepared. It stated Helton was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>five years (300 months) imprisonment because he had a prior conviction for sexual abuse of a minor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on a total offense level of 35 and a criminal history category of V, the advisory guideline range was 262 to 327 months imprisonment. Helton submitted written objections to the PSR arguing his prior conviction was an element of the offense and had to be charged and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The court overruled Helton\u2019s objection and sentenced him to 300 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">A. <em>Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">The court found Helton guilty of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) which provides: \u201cAny person who ... uses ... any minor to engage in ... any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct ... shall be punished as provided under subsection (e) ... if that visual depiction was produced or transmitted using materials that have been mailed, shipped, or transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means.... \u201d Helton challenges his conviction on the basis that the videotape he produced (Government\u2019s Exhibit 1) did not result in the depiction of a minor engaged in \u201csexually explicit conduct.\u201d For purposes of \u00a7 2251(a), \u201csexually explicit conduct\u201d is defined as an \u201cactual or simulated \u2014 ... lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(2)(A)(v). Helton contends the videotape of B.M. was not: (a) an exhibition of her genitals or pubic area; or (b) lascivious.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">On the mixed question of whether the facts satisfy the proper legal standard, we conduct a de novo review where, as here, the question primarily involves the consideration of legal principles. <em>See United States v. Patzer, </em>15 F.3d 934, 939 (10th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Rayl, </em>270 F.3d 709, 714 (8th Cir.2001) (\u201c[T]he meaning of \u2018lascivious exhibition of the genitals\u2019 is an issue of law.\u201d); <em>United States v. Knox, </em>32 F.3d 733, 744 (3d Cir.1994) (\u201cBecause the meaning of the statutory phrase \u2018lascivious exhibition\u2019 ... poses a pure question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d); <em>but see United States v. Boudreau, </em>250 F.3d 279, 283 (5th Cir.2001) (reviewing for clear error the district court\u2019s determination that a photograph did not depict a lascivious exhibition of a minor\u2019s pubic area).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">Government\u2019s Exhibit 1 clearly constitutes an exhibition of the genitals or pubic area within the meaning of the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statute does not specify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>genitals or pubic area must be fully or partially uncovered in order to constitute an exhibition and, like our sister circuits, we decline to read such a requirement into the statute. <em>See </em>Knox, 32 F.3d at 744, 746 (rejecting the government\u2019s argument that \u201cthe depiction in question [must] render the minor\u2019s genitals or pubic area visible or discernable in some fashion in order to constitute an exhibition\u201d and holding \u201cnudity or discernability are not prerequisites for the occurrence of an exhibition\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Carroll, </em>190 F.3d 290, 298 n. 7 (5th Cir.1999), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>227 F.3d 486 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201cLascivious exhibition of the genital or pubic area does not require full or partial nudity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">In <em>United States v. Horn, </em>the Eighth Circuit held a reasonable jury could conclude that images of minor females at a beach wearing swimsuit bottoms constituted a lascivious exhibition of the pubic area because of the way in which the pictures were framed. 187 F.3d 781, 789-90 (8th Cir.1999). The same holds true here. The tape Helton produced was designed to, and succeeded in, capturing an image of B.M.\u2019s minimally-clothed genitals or pubic area. Though covered, the image of B.M.\u2019s genitals or pubic area is the focus of the camera for over one minute. As such, it easily satisfies the statutory requirement of being an exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">We next consider whether the exhibition is \u201clascivious.\u201d The word \u201clascivious\u201d is not defined in the statute. We have previously held \u201c \u2018lascivious\u2019 is no different in its meaning than \u2018lewd.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Reedy, </em>845 F.2d 239, 241 (10th Cir.1988) (quotations omitted); <em>see also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 886 (7th ed.1999) (defining \u201clascivious\u201d as \u201ctending to excite lust; lewd; indecent; obscene\u201d); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1274 (1993) (defining \u201clascivious\u201d as \u201c1: inclined to lechery: LEWD, LUSTFUL ... 2: tending to arouse sexual desire: LIBIDINOUS, SALACIOUS\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Along with all of the other federal appellate courts who have considered the question, we have looked to a set of six factors developed in <em>United States v. Dost, </em>636 F.Supp. 828 (S.D.Cal.1986), to determine whether an exhibition is lascivious within the meaning of the statute. <em>See Wolf, </em>890 F.2d at 244-47; <em>see also United States v. Rivera, </em>546 F.3d 245, 250 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201cAlthough the <em>Dost </em>factors are not definitional, they are useful for assessing the sufficiency of evidence, and pose questions that are (at least) germane to the issue of lasciviousness.\u201d); <em>United States v. Hill, </em>459 F.3d 966, 972 (9th Cir.2006) (noting the district court\u2019s critique of <em>Dost </em>but stating \u201cwe do not think it necessary to adopt a new test or to deny the utility of <em>Dost\u201d); Carroll, </em>190 F.3d at 297 (\u201cWe apply the six factor <em>Dost </em>test to determine whether a visual depiction of a minor constitutes an actual \u2018lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area\u2019.... \u201d); <em>United States v. Amirault, </em>173 F.3d 28, 32 (1st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Cir.1999) (\u201cWe believe that the <em>Dost </em>factors are generally relevant and provide some guidance in evaluating whether the display in question is lascivious.\u201d); <em>Horn, </em>187 F.3d at 789 (\u201cIn attempting to determine the limits of this category of sexually explicit conduct, we find helpful the six criteria suggested in <em>[Dost </em>].\u201d); <em>United States v. Villard, </em>885 F.2d 117, 122 (3d Cir.1989) (\u201cIn determining the meaning of \u2018lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area\u2019 ... we are aided in particular by [the <em>Dost </em>factors].\u201d). These factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-4\">1) whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child\u2019s genitalia or pubic area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-5\">2) whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-6\">3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-7\">4) whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-8\">5) whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-9\">6) whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-10\"><em>Dost, </em>636 F.Supp. at 832. In discussing these factors in <em>Wolf, </em>we \u201cwholly agreefd] with the Third Circuit [in <em>Villard </em>] that all six factors need not be present in order to bring the depiction under the proscription of the statute.\u201d 890 F.2d at 245. And we noted in a footnote that we did not \u201chold that more than one <em>Dost </em>factor must be present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">The district court found the first <em>Dost </em>factor was present. The court afforded the second factor \u201csome weight\u201d because it found the setting to be \u201csexually suggestive\u201d based on Helton\u2019s staging of the video camera. (R. Vol. I, Doc. 26 at 11.) The court found the third and fifth factors were not present and the fourth factor was not present in any significant degree. The court concluded the sixth factor was present when analyzed subjectively. The court determined a subjective analysis was appropriate because such analysis \u201cbest serves the statutory purpose of prohibiting the sexual exploitation of children.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">Helton contends the district court erred in analyzing the sixth factor subjectively and asserts the video he created is not the kind the statute intended to reach. We disagree. In <em>Wolf, </em>\u201c[w]e agree[d] with the Ninth Circuit that ... lasciviousness is not a characteristic of the child photographed but of the exhibition that the photographer sets up for an audience that consists of himself or like-minded individuals.\u201d 890 F.2d at 247 (discussing <em>United States v. Wiegand, </em>812 F.2d 1239, 1244 (9th Cir.1987)); <em>see also Horn, </em>187 F.3d at 790 (\u201cThe \u2018lascivious exhibition\u2019 is not the work of the child, whose innocence is not in question, but of the producer or editor of the video.\u201d); <em>Knox, </em>32 F.3d at 747 (\u201c[A] \u2018lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area\u2019 of a minor necessarily requires only that the material depict some \u2018sexually explicit conduct\u2019 by the minor subject which appeals to the lascivious interest of the intended audience.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">\u201cA depiction of a child is a lascivious exhibition of the genitals\u201d when, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe image is intended to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.\u201d <em>Rayl, </em>270 F.3d at 714 (quotations omitted). <em>Compare Carroll, </em>190 F.3d at 298 (affirming defendants\u2019 sentences for violating \u00a7 2251(a) where, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe totality of the circumstances ... indicate that the video was intended to elicit a sexual response in the viewer\u201d), <em>with Boudreau, </em>250 F.3d at 283 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>(affirming the district court\u2019s conclusion that a photograph did not depict a lascivious exhibition of a minor\u2019s genitals or pubic area where, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe photo ... did not appear to be designed to elicit a sexual response\u201d). Thus, in <em>Horn, </em>the Eighth Circuit rejected the defendant\u2019s argument \u201cthat an otherwise innocent video tape of nude children cannot be made into a lascivious exhibition of the genitals by freeze-framing.\u201d 187 F.3d at 790. The court explained: \u201cBy focusing the viewer\u2019s attention on the pubic area, freeze-framing can create an image intended to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Defined in this way, our task is simply to determine whether Helton intended the videotape he produced to elicit a sexual response in the viewer \u2014 defined as himself and like-minded individuals. Clearly, he did. The trial court found Helton had an \u201cextreme interest in visual depictions of female underpants.\u201d (R. Vol. I, Doc. 26 at 13-14.) Helton does not appeal from this finding and would be hard-pressed to do so in light of the volume and type of materials found in his home and vehicle. The video he produced, containing a visual depiction of a young girl in her underpants, was intended to elicit a sexual response in Helton and like-minded individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Like the district court, we recognize Helton\u2019s conduct was not as egregious as the conduct of others convicted of violating 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a). And the 25-year mandatory minimum sentence may be more than condign punishment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But the government\u2019s discretion in charging is beyond the purview of our review. <em>See United States v. Robertson, </em>45 F.3d 1423,1437-38 (10th Cir.1995) (noting \u201c[cjharging decisions are primarily a matter of discretion for the prosecution\u201d and prosecutorial discretion in charging \u201cis nearly absolute\u201d). Our task is to determine solely whether the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding the videotape Helton produced (government\u2019s Exhibit 1) was a lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of B.M. We see no error and fully agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">B. <em>Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">Helton contends the court erred in overruling his objection to the application of the 25-year mandatory minimum sentence contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(e) because his prior conviction was neither charged in the indictment nor proved beyond a reasonable doubt. He raises this issue to preserve his argument that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>should be overruled. 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">The court overruled this objection based on <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>where the Supreme Court held the existence of a prior conviction is a sentencing factor and not a separate element of the offense which must be pled in an indictment. <em>See id. </em>at 228-35, 118 S.Ct. 1219. As a result, the government is not required to allege in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>indictment the fact or existence of a prior conviction. <em>See id. </em>at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219; <em>see also United States v. Martinez-Villalva, 232 </em>F.3d 1329, 1332 (10th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">The holding of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been questioned by the Supreme Court. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (stating \u201cit is arguable that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided\u201d); <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 27, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\u201c[A] majority of the Court now recognizes that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was wrongly decided.\u201d). Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has yet to overrule the case and we are bound by it. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>401 F.3d 1220, 1224 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b870-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel.

R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-10\">. The parties filed a joint stipulation prior to trial and Helton does not dispute the district court's factual findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b870-13\">. The presentence report reveals M.H. is Helton\u2019s biological daughter and B.M. is Helton\u2019s biological granddaughter.

The penalties for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) are set forth in subsection (e).

The Third Circuit has cautioned against interpreting the word \" 'exhibition' divorced entirely from the context in which it is used\u201d\u2014 \u201clascivious exhibition.\u201d <em>See Knox, </em>32 F.3d at 745; <em>see also Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 132, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993) (it is a \"fundamental principle of statutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself) that the meaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, but must be drawn from the context in which it is used\u201d). We do not adopt a two-pronged approach nor do we accept Helton's argument that the determination of whether an exhibition of the genitals or pubic area exists constitutes a \"[t]hreshold [\u00a1Inquiry.\u201d (Appellant's Opening Br. at 19.) We address the exhibition and lascivious requirements separately, though cognizant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>their interdependency, simply because Helton separately challenges both and the district court separately considered both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b873-8\">. Interestingly, the original legislation, the Protection of Children Act of 1977, used the term \"lewd\" instead of \"lascivious.\u201d That Act was amended and renamed the Child Protection Act of 1984 following \"the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982), wherein the Court recognized child pornography as a category of material outside First Amendment protection regardless of whether it was obscene under <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973).... The amendment included the substitution of \u2018lascivious\u2019 for \u2018lewd.\u2019 \u201d <em>See United States v. Wolf, </em>890 F.2d 241, 243 n. 2 (10th Cir. 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b875-7\">. Helton was originally charged in State court with violating Oklahoma\u2019s \"Peeping Tom\u201d statute. Helton\u2019s counsel advised the trial court that charge was dismissed when the federal indictment was filed. Though the record does not contain the statutory reference, we presume Helton was charged with violating Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, \u00a7 1171(B) which makes it a felony to: \"use[ ] ... video equipment in a clandestine manner for any illegal, illegitimate, prurient, lewd or lascivious purpose with the unlawful and willful intent to view, watch, gaze or look upon any person without the knowledge and consent of such person when the person viewed is in a place where there is a right to a reasonable expectation of privacy....\u201d A violation of this statute is punishable by imprisonment in the State Penitentiary for a term of not more than five years, a fine not exceeding $5,000, or both. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
