Magarrell filed a products liability claim in Lassen County Superior Court against the manufacturer of the metal detector, Garret Metal Detectors. According to Magarrell, the lawsuit resulted in a summary judgment against him. Magarrell subsequently filed this \u00a7 1983 action in district court, asserting that the Superior Court allowed perjured evidence, improperly denied his request for a special investigator and made numerous evidentiary and procedural errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-20\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Magarrell\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action improperly sought review of his state court litigation. Because Magarrell\u2019s action amounted to a \u201cde facto appeal seeking federal relief from state court orders and judgments,\u201d and his constitutional claims were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with those state court decisions, the district court lacked jurisdiction over the action under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Exxon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>Mobil Corp. v.
