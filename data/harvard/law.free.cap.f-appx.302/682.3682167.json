We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>The record does not compel the conclusion that Siahaan has demonstrated changed circumstances that excuse the untimely filing of his asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4); <em>see also Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 657 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to Siahaan\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because the harassment and physical harm Siahaan suffered in Indonesia did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003). Furthermore, the record does not compel the conclusion that Siahaan established a clear probability of future persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1184-85. Lastly, substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Siahaan did not show it would be unreasonable to relocate to another part of the country. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Siahaan failed to show it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to Indonesia. <em>See Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 1114, 1122-23 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b709-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
