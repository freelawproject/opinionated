Roberson argues pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 and Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines that he is entitled to resentencing. We review the district court\u2019s ruling for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Townsend, </em>55 F.3d 168, 170 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In the circumstance where a prisoner\u2019s guidelines range has subsequently been lowered as a result of a listed amendment to the Guidelines Manual, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only if such a reduction is consistent with policy statement \u00a7 1B1.10. \u00a7 lB1.10(a). Amendment 706 is listed as a \u201ccovered amendment,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c); however, \u201c[eligibility for consideration under [\u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] is triggered only by an amendment ... that lowers the applicable guideline range.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Based upon his guilty plea in the instant case to possession of more than 50 grams of crack cocaine and, additionally, the penalty enhancement he received for his 2002 Texas felony drug offense, Roberson faced a mandatory minimum 20-year term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). A guidelines sentence may not be imposed that is less than the statutorily required minimum sentence. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2). The guidelines amendment would therefore not have the effect of lowering his applicable guidelines range, and the district court\u2019s denial of his motion was not an abuse of discretion. <em>Cf. United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
