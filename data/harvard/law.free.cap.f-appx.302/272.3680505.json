Lynn has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-20\">Article III, section 2, of the Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to actual eases and controversies. <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). The case-or-eontroversy requirement demands that \u201csome concrete and continuing injury other than the now-ended incarceration or parole \u2014 some \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 of the conviction\u2014 must exist if the suit is to be maintained.\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>523 U.S. at 7, 118 S.Ct. 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-21\">Counsel asserts that there are no non-frivolous issues relating to the district court\u2019s initial revocation of Lynn\u2019s supervised release term in May 2007, Lynn\u2019s 120-day restraint in a halfway house, and the continuation of supervised release with additional conditions of release. During the pendency of this appeal, the district court again revoked Lynn\u2019s term of supervised release and sentenced him to six months in prison, which he has completed. The judgment imposed no further supervised release term. Accordingly, there is no case or controversy for this court to address. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal as moot is GRANTED, and this appeal is DISMISSED. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
