We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s order of dismissal and grant of summary judgment, <em>Whitaker v. Garcetti, </em>486 F.3d 572, 579 (9th Cir.2007), <em>Toguchi v. Chung, </em>391 F.3d 1051, 1056 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-21\">The district court properly dismissed Christman\u2019s claims against the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation because the state agency is not a \u201cperson\u201d under section 1983. <em>See Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-22\">The district court properly dismissed Christman\u2019s claims against defendants Knowles, Kernan and Robinson because Christman failed to allege specific facts showing that defendants acted with deliberate indifference to serious threats to his safety. <em>See Gibson v. United States, </em>781 F.2d 1334, 1338 (9th Cir.1986) (stating that to obtain relief under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to show that the defendants acting under color of state law deprived plaintiff of rights secured by the federal Constitution or statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>The district court properly granted summary judgment to defendant Micheletti because Christman failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Micheletti was aware of or disregarded a serious threat to Christman\u2019s safety;\u2019 <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Christman\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel because Christ-man did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances. <em>See Agyeman v. Corrs. Corp. of Am., </em>390 F.3d 1101, 1103 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Christman\u2019s motion for change of venue because Christman failed to show transfer was warranted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a). <em>See Ventress v. Japan Airlines, </em>486 F.3d 1111, 1118 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The district court properly denied Christman\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction because Christman failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury. <em>See Los Angeles Mem\u2019l Coliseum Comm\u2019n v. Nat\u2019l Football League, </em>634 F.2d 1197, 1201 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">We do not consider Christman\u2019s arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999) (stating that, as a general rule, the court will not consider arguments that are raised for the first time on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b769-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
