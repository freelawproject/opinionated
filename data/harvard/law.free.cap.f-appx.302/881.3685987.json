Because the district court resentenced Clarke at the low end of the adjusted guidelines range and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>considered the mitigating factors and sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) before determining a reasonable sentence, any error in the court\u2019s conclusion that it lacked authority to consider a sentence below the guidelines range is harmless. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">In 2006, Clarke pleaded guilty to six drug and firearm related offenses and was sentenced to 160 months\u2019 imprisonment. This sentence included 100 months\u2019 imprisonment on several drug offenses and being a felon in possession of a firearm (Counts 2, 3, and 6), with 60-month concurrent sentences for conspiracy and sale of a firearm (Counts 1 and 5), and a 60-month consecutive sentence for use of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense (Count 8). The original guidelines calculations determined the base offense level for the drug offenses to be 31 and a guidelines range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because Clarke cooperated with authorities, he received a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">After the U.S. Sentencing Commission enacted Amendment 706 to address the disparity in sentencing for crack offenders, Clarke moved for a reduction in sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). He noted that, with the 2-level reduction in his base offense level under the amendment and his prior reduction for substantial assistance, his sentencing range was 84 to 105 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 2, 3, and 6. He asked the court to impose a sentence of 84 months on these counts, unless the court found a lower sentence to be appropriate in light of his rehabilitation, his attempts to complete his education, and his responsibility to his minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">The district court granted the motion for a reduction in sentence but rejected Clarke\u2019s claim that it had the authority to sentence Clarke below the new guidelines range. Specifically, the court found that <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>did not apply to resentencing under \u00a7 3582. After determining the new range to be 84 to 105 months\u2019 imprisonment, the court imposed a sentence of 84 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 2, 3, and 6,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-14\">a review of the circumstances of this case, including the pre-sentence report and the matters offered by Clarke in support of a reduction in sentence under <em>Booker, </em>confirms that the sentence that results form the present adjustment under the newly retroactive and reduced \u2018crack\u2019 guidelines is a \u2018reasonable sentence\u2019 as defined by <em>Booker </em>and effected by application of the factors arrayed at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-15\">This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-16\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b908-17\">Clarke argues that the district court erred by concluding that it lacked authority to sentence him below the guidelines range under <em>Booker </em>at resentencing. He asserts that Amendment 706 does not fully rectify the disparity between crack and cocaine sentences, and thus the court should have exercised its discretion under an advisory guidelines scheme to sentence him below the new guidelines range. He further argues that the sentence imposed was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>We review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). However, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, this court reviews <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We also review <em>\u201cde novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Section 3582(c) permits a district court to modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed when the term is based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). In modifying the sentence, the district court \u201cmay reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Only those amendments listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) may be applied retroactively through a \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court must apply the following two-step analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-7\">Hirst, the court must substitute the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range and determine what sentence it would have imposed. In undertaking this first step, only the amended guideline range is changed. All other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact. Second, in light of the conclusion reached in the first step, the court must consider the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and determine whether or not to reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-10\"><em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">When applying the two-step process, the court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781; <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. l(B)(i)) (stating that, in determining whether the reduction is warranted and the extent of the reduction, consistent with the limits described in \u00a7 1B1.10(b), the court \u201cshall consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d). However, a re-sentencing under \u00a7 3582(c) is not a full <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Thus, the court cannot consider whether to apply a new downward departure, although it would be permitted to determine whether to reapply an earlier departure. <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760-761.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">Here, the government does not dispute that the district court had authority to grant Clarke\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on the ground that Amendment 706 reduced his offense level and, therefore, lowered the sentencing range upon which his original sentence was based.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The only issue is whether the court could have imposed a sentence below the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>The crux of Clarke\u2019s argument is that the court retained authority under <em>Booker </em>to impose sentence below the guidelines range when it resentenced him under \u00a7 3582(c). Although the issue of whether <em>Booker </em>applies to resentencing under \u00a7 3582 is an open question before this court, we need not resolve that issue here because even if the court misunderstood its authority to impose sentence, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">As the court stated in its judgment, it considered the guidelines range, Clarke\u2019s arguments in mitigation of his sentence, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and concluded that the 84-month sentence was reasonable. This explanation from the district court indicates that it would not have imposed a lesser sentence even if it were permitted to do so under <em>Booker. </em>Accordingly, we affirm because any error in the court\u2019s belief that it lacked authority to apply a downward variance was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Moreover, we conclude that the sentence imposed was reasonable. Clarke requested \u2014 and received \u2014 a sentence at the low end of the new guidelines range. The court considered Clarke\u2019s arguments and determined that a sentence within this guidelines range would be appropriate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Clarke\u2019s claims that he had rehabilitated himself and was responsible for minor children do not show the sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-7\">. <em>United States v.
