The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of conviction in part and reversed it in part. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>85 Conn. App. 708, 719, 858 A.2d 845 (2004).We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court as to the following issue: \u201cDoes a \u2018deadly weapon\u2019 as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (6)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> require that a shot be discharged by gunpowder?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>272 Conn. 906, 863 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>A.2d 699 (2004). We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following facts and procedural history. \u201cOn December 9, 2000, the victim, an employee of Norwalk Taxi, was dispatched to 12 North Taylor Avenue in Norwalk. Upon arrival, Leland Brown approached the victim\u2019s taxicab from the front of the vehicle and got in through the back door on the driver\u2019s side. The victim turned his head to ask Brown where he wanted to go and Brown put the barrel portion of a gun to the victim\u2019s neck. Brown demanded that the victim give him all of his money and, in response, the victim gave him more than $800 in cash. Brown then exited the taxicab, and the victim informed his dispatcher of the incident. The dispatcher notified the police and, shortly thereafter, the police arrived at the scene of the robbery. The victim told the police that the robber was an African-American male who wore dark jeans, a jacket patterned in camouflage or animal print and a wool hat. The victim also told the police that one of the bills stolen had an order for Chinese food written on it in brown marker.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u201cAfter Brown exited the taxicab, he and the defendant, who waited nearby, ran back to the defendant\u2019s apartment at 16 Ferris Avenue. While running, the men were spotted by Tirso Gomez, a United States Postal Service employee who was working in the area. A short time later, Gomez was questioned by the police. Gomez informed the police that he saw the defendant and another man running toward the defendant\u2019s apartment from the direction of the robbery, which was approximately one-half block away. Gomez was familiar with the defendant, provided the police the defendant\u2019s name and address, and told them that the defendant was wearing a yellow jacket or sweater and that one of the men was wearing a cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u201cActing on that information, the police surrounded 16 Ferris Avenue and began calling the telephone in the defendant\u2019s apartment. Eventually, Brown exited the building, wearing a camouflage jacket and a hat, and was arrested and taken into custody. The police searched Brown and found $339 on his person, including a bill that \u2018had some kind of writing on it.\u2019 Outside the defendant\u2019s apartment, the victim identified Brown as the man who robbed him earlier that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u201cEventually, the police forcibly entered the defendant\u2019s apartment. Once inside, the police found a silver Crosman air pistol hidden in a clothes hamper between the defendant\u2019s bedroom and his mother\u2019s bedroom, an information manual for the air pistol, and the defendant, wearing a yellow and gray sweater, hiding underneath his couch. The defendant was arrested and, after he was in custody, told the police that the rest of the money taken during the robbery was hidden in his videocassette recorder. The police returned to the defendant\u2019s apartment and recovered an additional $555 from inside the videocassette recorder in his bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u201cThe defendant was tried under the accessory theory of liability and was convicted of robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2) and criminal use of a firearm or electronic defense weapon in violation of [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-216. The court sentenced the defendant to twenty years incarceration, suspended after ten years, on the robbery conviction, five years incarceration to run concurrent to his twenty year sentence on his conviction of criminal use of a firearm or electronic defense weapon, and five years probation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>supra, 85 Conn. App. 710-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the certified issue. Evidence presented at trial established that the air pistol found in the defendant\u2019s apartment used carbon dioxide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>cylinders as a propellant and was designed to shoot .177 caliber pellets. Although the pistol was unloaded when it was found, it was tested by a police detective and was operational. The state also submitted as a full exhibit the pistol\u2019s operating manual, which stated that the pistol was \u201cNOT A TOY. . . . MISUSE OR CARELESS USE MAY CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH. MAY BE DANGEROUS UP TO 400 YARDS . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state argued to the court that, as a matter of common sense, the gun, particularly when used at close range, could be a deadly weapon and could cause serious physical injury. The defendant argued that the pellet pistol did not use gunpowder and could not cause death or serious physical injury and, therefore, did not fit within the statutory definition of a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The Appellate Court, sua sponte, reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction of criminal use of a firearm and directed the trial court to vacate that conviction and to resentence the defendant accordingly. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>supra, 85 Conn. App. 719.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court affirmed the judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>On appeal to this court, the defendant challenges his conviction under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2) of robbery in the first degree, which required proof that he was armed with a deadly weapon, on the ground that the air gun used by the defendant was not a deadly weapon. He argues that deadly weapons that discharge shots, as defined in \u00a7 53a-3 (6), are necessarily firearms, which discharge shots by gunpowder, and, therefore, the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the air pistol, which does not use gunpowder, was a deadly weapon. See id., 718. In response, the state claims: (1) the Appellate Court properly concluded that the air pistol was a weapon from which a shot may be discharged within the meaning of \u00a7 53a~3 (6); and (2) in the alternative, even if we find that the trial court improperly concluded that deadly weapons must discharge shots by use of gunpowder, the state presented sufficient evidence for the trial court to find the defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of robbeiy in the third degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-136. We agree with the state\u2019s first claim, and thus need not reach its second.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Whether \u00a7 53a-3 (6) requires that the shot be discharged by gunpowder is a question of statutory interpretation. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>271 Conn. 785, 791, 860 A.2d 249 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z. \u201cIn the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the language; and technical words and phrases, and such as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood accordingly.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">With these principles in mind, we begin by examining the language of \u00a7 53a-3 (6). Section 53a-3 (6) defines a \u201c \u2018[d]eadly weapon\u2019 \u201d in relevant part as \u201cany weapon, whether loaded or unloaded, from which a shot may be discharged .... The definition of \u2018deadly weapon\u2019 in this subdivision shall be deemed not to apply to section 29-38 or 53-206 . . . .\u201d Thus, the legislature has defined deadly weapon to mean any <em>weapon </em>from which a <em>shot </em>may be <em>discharged. </em>The defendant does not claim that the air gun was not a weapon or that it did not fire shots. Instead, he claims that the \u201cdischarge\u201d of the weapon, as used in \u00a7 53a-3 (6), must take place through the use of gunpowder. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">First, the plain language of \u00a7 53a-3 (6) does not require that the shot be discharged by gunpowder. Rather, the statute refers to <em>\u201cany </em>weapon, whether loaded or unloaded . . . from which a shot may be discharged . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Had the legislature intended to include in its definition only those weapons that discharged by use of gunpowder, it could have done so expressly through the language of the statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 776, 695 A.2d 525 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Second, although this court previously has not considered the question before us, the Appellate Court has considered it indirectly and has suggested that an air pistol is a deadly weapon. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Osman, </em>21 Conn. App. 299, 300-301, 305, 573 A.2d 743 (1990), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 218 Conn. 432, 589 A.2d 1227 (1991), the defendant was charged with robbery in the first degree involving the use of a dangerous instrument under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> after he allegedly robbed a convenience store and allegedly threatened to shoot a store clerk with an unloaded .177 Crosman air pistol. The Appellate Court, in determining whether the unloaded air pistol could be considered a dangerous instrument as defined by \u00a7 53a-3 (7),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> discussed the distinction between deadly weapons and dangerous instruments. The court noted that \u201c[o]ur modem penal code preserves, to a great extent, the distinction between those weapons that are deadly per se and those that are not. . . . The term deadly weapon is confined to those items <em>designed for </em>violence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 306; see also Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 53a-3 (West 2001), comments, p. 239 (\u201c\u2018[djeadly weapon\u2019 is confined to those items designed for violence\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>eluded that, because the defendant allegedly threatened to shoot, but did not threaten to bludgeon the clerk with the unloaded pistol, the pistol was not a dangerous instrument under the circumstances in which it was alleged to have been used. <em>State </em>v. <em>Osman, </em>supra, 307. In dictum, however, the court noted that the state could have charged the defendant under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2) because the pellet pistol was a deadly weapon, i.e., a weapon designed for violence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 307 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Many other courts that have confronted the question directly also have concluded that an air or pellet gun is both designed for violence and capable of causing death or serious bodily injury. In <em>McCaskill </em>v. <em>State, </em>648 So. 2d 1175, 1178 (Ala. Crim. App. 1994), the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama concluded that a BB gun could constitute a deadly weapon where the term was defined as \u201c[a] firearm or anything manifestly designed, made or adapted for the purposes of inflicting death or serious physical injury, and such term includes, but is not limited to, a pistol, rifle or shotgun; or any billy, black-jack, bludgeon or metal knuckles.\u201d Id. Likewise, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cordova, </em>198 Ariz. 242, 243, 8 P.3d 1156 (1999), the Arizona Court of Appeals concluded that a pellet gun was a deadly weapon for purposes of an aggravated assault conviction when \u201c \u2018deadly weapon\u2019 \u201d was defined as \u201c \u2018anything designed for lethal use,\u2019 including a \u2018firearm.\u2019 [Ariz. Rev. Stat.] \u00a7 13-105 (13) [2001].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>In <em>People </em>v. <em>Lochtefeld, </em>77 Cal. App. 4th 533, 535, 540, 91 Cal. Rptr. 2d 778 (2000), the California Court of Appeals held that a pellet gun is not a firearm because it does not use an explosive to project a bullet. The court concluded, however, that because the pellet pistol was \u201ca gun . . . capable of inflicting great bodily injury\u201d; id., 541; it was a deadly weapon within the meaning of a provision of the Penal Code prohibiting the use of a \u201cdeadly weapon or instrument, other than a firearm, or by any means likely to produce great bodily injury upon the person of a peace officer . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 535. The court noted that a deadly weapon is statutorily defined as \u201cany object, instrument, or weapon which is used in such a manner as to be capable of producing and likely to produce, death or great bodily injury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 538-39. A criminalist, who had examined and test fired the defendant\u2019s gun, testified that it was capable of firing projectiles at speeds of over 380 feet per second, faster than the speed necessary to penetrate human skin, muscles, and eyeballs. Id., 536-37. The court concluded that \u201cthe determinative question is not the distinction between \u2018firearms\u2019 and \u2018pellet guns,\u2019 but between those guns capable of inflicting great bodily injury, and those that are not.\u201d Id., 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Likewise, in <em>Merriweather </em>v. <em>State, </em>778 N.E.2d 449, 453, 458 (Ind. App. 2002), the Indiana Court of Appeals concluded that two BB guns<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that the defendant\u2019s accomplices had used to threaten victims during the robbery of a restaurant were deadly weapons. The legislature had defined \u201cdeadly weapon ... as a loaded or unloaded firearm ... or other material that in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>manner it is used, or could ordinarily be used, or is intended to be used, is readily capable of causing serious bodily injury. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u201cThus, based on the statute, there are two categories of deadly weapons: (1) firearms; and (2) weapons capable of causing serious bodily injury. . . . The question of whether a weapon is a deadly weapon is determined from a description of the weapon, the manner of its use, and the circumstances of the case. . . . The fact finder may look to whether the weapon had the actual ability to inflict serious injury under the fact situation and whether the defendant had the apparent ability to injure the victim seriously through use of the object during the crime.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 457. Testimony at trial had established that the BB guns could \u201cpropel a projectile up to [200] feet per second\u201d and that \u201ca projectile traveling [200] to [250] feet per second can pierce human skin and enter the body.\u201d Id., 458. The court determined that \u201c[t]his evidence shows that the BB guns were actually able to inflict serious bodily injury.\u201d Id. On the basis of this finding, the court concluded that a BB gun is a deadly weapon. Id., 458-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">In <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>State, </em>577 S.W.2d 493, 495 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979), a defendant accused of aggravated robbery argued that the .22 caliber air pistol with which he threatened the victim was not a deadly weapon, which was defined as \u201c \u2018a firearm or anything manifestly designed, made, or adapted for the purpose of inflicting death or serious bodily injury; or . . . anything that in the manner of its use or intended use is capable of causing death or serious bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 1.07 (a) (11) (Vernon 1974), now codified at Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 1.07 (a) (17) (Vernon 2003). The court concluded that the pistol was a deadly weapon because it had been used to threaten the complainant and \u201cwas capable of inflicting death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>or serious bodily injury and was designed for that purpose.\u201d <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 496; see also <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>State, </em>698 So. 2d 555, 560 (Fla. App. 1997) (jury reasonably could find that BB gun was deadly weapon, defined as \u201c \u2018any instrument that, when used in the ordinary manner contemplated by its design and construction, will or is likely to cause death or great bodily harm,\u2019 \u201d or dangerous weapon, defined as \u201c \u2018milder\u2019 then \u2018deadly weapon,\u2019 but \u2018otherwise of the same meaning,\u2019 \u201d when defendant implied that weapon was loaded and operable and when likelihood of injury analyzed from perspective of victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In comparison, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Coauette, </em>601 N.W.2d 443, 445, 447-48 (Minn. App. 1999), the Minnesota Court of Appeals held, inter alia, that a \u201c \u201868 caliber pump-action [carbon dioxide] powered\u2019 \u201d paintball gun was neither a firearm under a drive-by shooting statute nor a dangerous weapon under the assault statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court first noted that, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Seifert, </em>256 N.W.2d 87, 88 (Minn. 1977), the Minnesota Supreme Court had held that a carbon dioxide BB pistol qualified as a firearm because the term should be \u201cdefined broadly to include guns using newer types of projectile propellants and should not be restricted in meaning to guns using gunpowder.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coauette, </em>supra, 446. In <em>Coauette, </em>the court considered \u201cnot just . . . the propellant . . . but also . . . the purpose of the projectile the gun is designed to discharge.\u201d Id. \u201cIn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>contrast to <em>Seifert </em>... in which the air guns were designed to shoot BB pellets that would pierce and harm the objects struck \u2014 whether bird, rodent, or human . . . the [paintball] gun here was designed for use in a game and ... its projectiles are liquid-paint capsules designed to burst on impact, rather than to pierce. ... [A] paintball has nothing like the destructive capacity of a bullet or BB.\u201d Id., 446-47. The court thus reasoned that a paintball gun also was not a dangerous weapon, which was defined as \u201cany device or instrumentality that, in the manner it is used or intended to be used, is calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 447. The court concluded that paintballs are \u201cintended and designed to break on contact and simply . . . splash a dose of nontoxic liquid paint\u201d and are not \u201c \u2018calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm.\u2019 \u201d Id. In reaching its conclusion that BB guns are firearms and dangerous weapons, but that paintball guns are not, the court in <em>Coauette </em>considered the intent of the legislature to include only those weapons that are <em>designed </em>to cause severe injury or death. Id., 446-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">With these authorities in mind, we conclude that the legislature did not intend to restrict the definition of deadly weapon in \u00a7 53a-3 (6) to weapons that discharge ammunition by the use of gunpowder. We recognize that the persuasive value of these cases is limited by differences between our statute and the statutes of other states. Specifically, we recognize that \u00a7 53a-3 (6) does not expressly define deadly weapons as instruments that are <em>designed </em>or <em>intended </em>to cause death or serious bodily injury, as the statutes in many other states do. See, e.g., <em>McCaskill </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 648 So. 2d 1178; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lochtefeld, </em>supra, 77 Cal. App. 4th 538; <em>Merriweather v. State, </em>supra, 778 N.E.2d 457. As the Appellate Court recognized in <em>State v. Osman, </em>supra, 21 Conn. App. 306, however, \u00a7 53a-3 (6) was intended to encompass \u201citems <em>designed for violence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>added.) See also Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, supra, \u00a7 53a-3. Moreover, all of the items listed in the statute are capable of causing death or serious bodily injury. We therefore conclude that, if a weapon from which a shot may be discharged is designed for violence<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and is capable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>inflicting death or serious bodily harm, it is a deadly weapon within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-3 (6), regardless of whether the shot is discharged by gunpowder.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We further conclude that the trial court in the present case reasonably could have concluded that the air pistol used by the defendant was designed for violence and was capable of causing death or serious bodily injury. Accordingly, we conclude that the air pistol was a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The defendant claims, however, that the legislature\u2019s use of \u201cidentical language\u201d in defining deadly weapon; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (6); and firearm; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (19);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> necessarily implies that the definitions are coextensive. Section 53a-3 (19) defines a firearm as a \u201cweapon, whether loaded or unloaded from which a shot may be discharged . . . .\u201d The defendant argues that, because the same words are used in the two statutes, they must \u201c \u2018be given the same meaning in each instance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>266 Conn. 108, 123, 830 A.2d 1121 (2003). The defendant further argues that, because all of the weapons listed as firearms in \u00a7 53a-3 (19), namely \u201cany sawed-off shotgun, machine gun, rifle, shotgun, pistol, [or] revolver,\u201d use gunpowder as their method of discharge, under the principle of ejusdem generis, a weapon must use gunpowder as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>method of discharge to be considered a firearm. Thus, he argues, deadly weapons from which a shot can be discharged must be firearms. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>259 Conn. 799, 809, 792 A.2d 86 (2002), in support of his argument that all firearms must use gunpowder. In <em>Brown, </em>the defendant was convicted of, inter alia, robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4), and received an enhanced penalty pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Id., 801. He appealed from the judgment to the Appellate Court, which affirmed his conviction. Id., 805. We granted his petition for certification to appeal limited to the question of whether the trial court improperly had failed to define the term firearm when instructing the jury on the sentence enhancement provision of \u00a7 53-202k. Id. The defendant argued on appeal that the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the statutory definition of firearm rendered the instruction constitutionally defective. Id., 808. We disagreed. We recognized that \u201cit is generally preferable for a jury to be instructed on the statutory definition of a word where one exists . . . .\u201d Id. We also recognized, however, that \u201c[s]pecific words in a statute need not be defined if they are being used and understood in their ordinary meaning.\u201d Id. We then noted that \u00a7 53a-3 (19) provides that, \u201c[f]irearm means any sawed-off shotgun, machine gun, rifle, shotgun, pistol, revolver or other weapon, whether loaded or unloaded from which a shot may be discharged .... This definition requires that a firearm be (1) a weapon, with a list of examples, and (2) capable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>discharging a shot. The commonly understood meaning of firearm, found in Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed.), is a weapon from which a shot is discharged by gunpowder .... <em>This commonly understood meaning of the word comprises the same two elements as the statutory definition </em>\u2014 a <em>firearm is a weapon capable of discharging a shot. </em>Therefore, the dictionary definition that we presume was applied by the jury and the definition found in \u00a7 53a-3 (19) are essentially the same.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 809. Accordingly, we concluded that there was no constitutional violation. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Thus, in <em>Brown, </em>we merely held that the jury, in the absence of an instruction from the trial court, could be presumed to have applied the dictionary definition of firearm, which included the two elements expressly required by statute, namely, that the weapon <em>discharge </em>a <em>shot. </em>There was no claim in that case that the gun used by the defendant was not a firearm because it did not discharge a shot by use of gunpowder. Any misunderstanding by the jury that a discharge by use of gunpowder was a requirement under the statute would, therefore, have been harmless. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument that we held in <em>Brown </em>that all firearms must be discharged by gunpowder. We further note that, in <em>Brown, </em>we referred to the dictionary definition of firearm only because the trial court had failed to provide the statutory definition of the term in its jury instructions, and only for the purpose of resolving whether the dictionary, or commonly used, definition was sufficiently dissimilar to the statutory definition as to affect the jury\u2019s deliberations. Id., 808-809. Our reference to the dictionary definition of the term under these circumstances does not indicate that, as a rule, this court considers the common meanings of terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>where a statutory definition exists and was relied on by the fact finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Even if it is assumed, however, that, because all of the weapons listed in \u00a7 53a-3 (19) are discharged by gunpowder, the principle of ejusdem generis would suggest that all firearms must be discharged by gunpowder, that would not mean that all deadly weapons that discharge shots must use gunpowder. In short, it does not logically follow from the fact that all firearms are deadly weapons that all deadly weapons that discharge shots must be firearms. As we have indicated, if the legislature had wanted to limit \u00a7 53a-3 (6) in this way, it could have done so expressly.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The defendant also relies on the genealogy and legislative history of the relevant statutes in support of his interpretation. He points out that the official commentary to \u00a7 53a-3, which was enacted in 1969 as part of the Penal Code; see Public Acts 1969, No. 828, \u00a7 3; states that \u201cany <em>gun </em>\u2018from which a shot may be discharged,\u2019 whether loaded at the time or not, would be a \u2018deadly weapon.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, supra, \u00a7 53a-3. In addition, the official commentary to \u00a7 53a-134 states that \u201c[s]imple robbery is raised to robbery in the first degree on the basis of . . . being armed with a deadly weapon (i.e. a pistol). . . .\u201d Id., \u00a7 53a-134. The statutory definition of firearm, which was enacted in 1975; Public Acts 1975, No. 75-380, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 75-380); includes pistols. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (19). Finally, the defendant points out that, when the legislature enacted the portion of P.A. 75-380 that is now codified at \u00a7 53a-3 (19), the legislative debate clearly indicated that the legislature understood firearms to be deadly weapons. See, e.g., 18 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1975 Sess., p. 2293, remarks of Senator David M. Barry (\u201cthe only deadly weapon we\u2019re involved with in this [b]ill is a firearm\u201d). The defendant argues that this history estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>lishes that guns and pistols must be firearms in order to be deadly weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We conclude, however, that this history establishes, at most, that all firearms are deadly weapons. As we have already indicated, it does not follow from the fact that all firearms are deadly weapons that all deadly weapons that discharge shots must be firearms. The legislative history of P.A. 75-380, now codified in part at \u00a7 53a-3 (19), indicates that the legislature believed that, although firearms were deadly weapons, they were more dangerous than other deadly weapons. See 18 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1975 Sess., p. 4858, remarks of Representative Paul C. DeMennato (\u201c[w]e have to make it perfectly clear to the crime element in our society that uses a firearm, which is potentially [50 percent] more lethal than any other weapon he can use, that when he goes out with that firearm in his hand, he\u2019s in trouble\u201d). Thus, although both deadly weapons and firearms are designed for violence and are capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury, firearms are limited to the most dangerous weapons and deadly weapons include a broader class.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The defendant further claims that the state and the trial court were both confused about the nature of the charges before the court rendered its verdict. At trial, the state conceded that, to be considered a firearm, a weapon must use gunpowder to discharge.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We also recognize that the state called the pellet pistol variously a \u201cfirearm,\u201d \u201cgun,\u201d \u201cpistol\u201d and \u201cweapon,\u201d and that only after closing arguments and before the court rendered its verdict did it become wholly clear that the defendant would be charged with robbery in the first degree while armed with a deadly weapon under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2), and not under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4), which would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>required the state to prove that the defendant had committed the robbery with the aid of a firearm.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant does not argue, however, that he was prejudiced by the confusion at trial and, therefore, that the state should be estopped from changing its tack on appeal to claim that the pellet gun may be a deadly weapon even though it is not a firearm. He merely argues that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the fact that the state at trial called the pellet gun a firearm during trial means that a deadly weapon that discharges a shot must be a firearm. For the foregoing reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In this opinion NORCOTT and ZARELLA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in section 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ...

He believes that there is no need for the trial court to conduct a case-by-case inquiry into whether a particular item is \u201c \u2018designed for violence\u2019 \u201d because the legislature merely intended for that phrase to describe, not to limit, the term \u201cdeadly weapon.\u201d In other words, Justice Borden believes that all weapons from which a shot may be discharged are \u201c \u2018designed for violence,\u2019 \u201d provided, \u201c[o]f course, [that] the gun must be a true gun, not a toy; and what is discharged must be a \u2018shot,\u2019 not, say, a paintball.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">We do not believe that our interpretation differs significantly from Justice Borden\u2019s. We hold only that, if there is some question, as there was in the present case, as to whether the item that the defendant is charged with using was a weapon or, instead, was a toy or some other relatively harmless instrument capable of discharging a shot, that question must be answered by determining whether the item was designed for violence and capable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>inflicting serious bodily injury or death. To the extent that Justice Borden believes that the answer to that question always will be self-evident, we disagree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b142-10\"> The court stated that \u201c[tjhe defendant in the present case could have been charged with first degree robbery under either General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2) or \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4).

We further recognize that many guns that are capable of causing death or serious bodily injury were not designed for violence against persons. Nevertheless, such guns are designed for violence in the sense that they are intended to cause damage or injury to their intended target.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In her dissent, Justice Katz agrees that a fact finder reasonably could conclude that the air pistol at issue in the present case was capable of causing serious ipjury or death to a person. She believes, however, that the legislature intended that the weapon must have been designed for the type of violence that could kill or seriously injure humans and that the trial court reasonably could not have concluded that the gun was designed for that purpose. We see no evidence, however, that the legislature intended to exclude from the definition of \u201cdeadly weapon\" weapons that are capable of killing or seriously injuring a human but are designed only to penetrate targets or Mil small animals. Rather, common sense leads to the conclusion that if a \u201cweapon . . . from which a shot may be discharged\u201d; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (6); is capable of killing a human, the legislature intended to penalize the use of that weapon during the commission of a crime. Moreover, we have difficulty understanding how a weapon could be simultaneously (1) designed for violence and capable of killing or seriously injuring a human and (2) not designed for the type of violence that could kill or seriously injure a human.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">To the extent that Justice Katz suggests the addition of yet another requirement to the statutory definition, namely, that a gun is a deadly weapon only if it was designed to inflict the type of violence that could Mil or seriously injure a person when it was used as it was intended to be used, we also disagree. The fact that a pellet gun was intended to be used to penetrate a target at a range of 100 feet and cannot MU or injure a human unless aimed at a vulnerable part of the body at close range does not meaningfully distinguish it from a <em>gun </em>that was intended to be used to penetrate a target at a range of 1000 feet and can kill a human at a range of up to 100 feet. It would have been small comfort to the victim in the present case to know that, although he could have been seriously injured or Mlled if the defendant had followed through on his implied threat to shoot him in the neck at point blank range, he would have been in minimal danger if the defendant had been fifty feet away.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">With respect to Justice Katz\u2019 argument that our interpretation would mean that a nail gun or a slingshot is a deadly weapon, we agree with Justice Borden that it is likely that the legislature intended for the phrase \u201cweapon . . . from which a shot may be discharged\u201d to include only items that ordinary persons would characterize as guns. Furthermore, if a nail gun or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>a slingshot can kill or seriously injure a person, we fail to see how Justice Katz can escape this result by imposing a requirement that the item be designed for the type of violence that can cause death or serious injury to a person.

I agree with the result reached by the majority opinion affirming the conviction of the defendant, Raymond Hardy, of robbery in the first degree, and with much of the reasoning of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>opinion. I write separately, however, to provide some additional analysis that supports the result reached by the majority and that responds somewhat to the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">I first note that the determinative issue presented in this certified appeal is whether \u201ca \u2018deadly weapon\u2019 as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (6)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> require[s] that a shot be discharged by gunpowder?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>272 Conn. 906, 863 A.2d 699 (2004). The defendant\u2019s sole argument in this regard is that the term \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d is synonymous with the term \u201cfirearm,\u201d and that, under our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>259 Conn. 799, 809, 792 A.2d 86 (2002), a firearm is a gun that discharges a shot by gunpowder. The defendant does not claim that the air pistol involved in this case is not a weapon. Rather, he argues only that, in order for the air pistol to be a deadly weapon, it must discharge a shot by gunpowder, not compressed air. I fully agree with the majority\u2019s reasoning in rejecting that argument. That reasoning is sufficient to answer the certified question in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">I part company, however, with both the majority and the dissent in their heavy emphasis on the reference in the commentary to the Penal Code (commentary) to a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d as requiring an inquiry into whether a particular weapon is \u201cdesigned for violence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Comments, Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 53a-3 (West 2001) comments, p. 239. That language does not appear in the statute. As commentary, it should be used only to illuminate the meaning of the statutory language. Its usefulness as an interpretive tool, however, should not be transformed into language that itself must be interpreted as if it were a statutory element of the crime. In other words, it does not provide an additional set of words that themselves must be subject to our interpretive function. Rather, the commentary, albeit not as lucid in hindsight as it could have been, tells us that the drafters of the Penal Code and the legislature that adopted it considered all weapons from which a shot may be discharged <em>to be designed for violence </em>and that, therefore, if one were armed with such a weapon while committing a robbery, that would constitute robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is what was meant by the commentary\u2019s reference that the term \u201c \u2018[djeadly weapon\u2019 is confined to those items designed for violence.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">This does not mean, however, that none of the commentary is useful in deciding this case. The commentary states: \u201cThe 1971 General Assembly eliminated the prior requirement, in the definition of \u2018deadly weapon\u2019 that a gun be loaded; thus, any gun \u2018from which a shot may be discharged,\u2019 whether loaded at the time or not, would be a \u2018deadly weapon.\u2019 \u201d Id. This commentary indicates that, when the drafters and the legislature used the word \u201cweapon\u201d in the definition of \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d they intended it to mean a \u201cgun,\u201d of whatever type, from which a shot may be discharged. That intent is fully consistent with the structure of the robbery sections of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the Penal Code, which elevates robbery to first degree if the perpetrator is armed with a \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d namely, a gun from which a shot may be discharged, by whatever technology. This interpretation also answers the contention raised by the dissent that a broad definition of \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d could include a sling shot. Under my definition, a sling shot would not be a \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d not because the shot is discharged by other than gunpowder, but because it is not a \u201cweapon\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Moreover, to answer another question raised by the dissent, in my view a BB gun <em>would </em>be a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">To sum up, in my view, a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-3 (6) means any gun from which a shot may be discharged, irrespective of whether the discharging power is gunpowder. It is not necessary to go though a case-by-case analysis of whether the type of gun is one \u201cdesigned for violence.\u201d Of course, the gun must be a true gun, not a toy; and what is discharged must be a \u201cshot,\u201d not, for example, a paintball. There may be future cases in which we will have to grapple with the questions of whether the device involved is a gun, and whether what is discharged is a shot. This case, however, does not present those questions. There is no question that the defendant\u2019s air pistol was a gun, and that the projectile discharged from it was a shot. The defendant does not contend otherwise. I therefore join the majority in affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court upholding the defendant\u2019s conviction of robbery in the first degree.

I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the state need not demonstrate that a weapon utilizes gunpowder to discharge a shot in order to establish that it is a deadly weapon as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (6). The majority concludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>that a weapon from which a shot may be discharged is a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 53a-3 (6) if it is designed for violence and is capable of inflicting death or serious bodily harm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In accordance with the majority\u2019s conclusion then, the state, in order to prove robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2), had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the air gun found in the apartment of the defendant, Raymond Hardy, satisfied that definition. Although I agree with the majority\u2019s determination that to constitute a deadly weapon, an instrument must be (1) designed for violence and (2) capable of causing death or serious physical injuiy, I would conclude that an instrument is designed for violence only when the violence intended is the type of violence capable of causing death or serious physical injury to a person. Because the state did not prove that the Crosman model 1008 repeater C02 pellet pistol at issue in this case was designed for such violence, I disagree with the majority\u2019s determination that the trial court reasonably could have concluded that this air gun was a deadly weapon. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has explicitly held that the due process clause requires that every fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>necessary to constitute the crime of which an accused stands charged must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before a conviction. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.

It is well established that, \u201c[e]ach essential element of the crime charged must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and although it is within the province of the [trier] to draw reasonable, logical inferences from the facts proven, [it] may not resort to speculation and conjecture. . . . Where it cannot be said that a rational trier of fact could find guilt proven beyond a reasonable doubt, then, a conviction cannot constitutionally stand, as it is violative of due process under the fourteenth amendment. . . . [T]he burden rested upon the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused, i.e., to prove each material element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 387-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In reaching its determination that the trial court reasonably found the defendant guilty of robbery in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2), the majority relies on the commentary to \u00a7 53a-3 (6); see Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 53a-3 (West 2001); as well as case law to define deadly weapon and thereafter to conclude that the state established that, because the air gun in the present case was both designed for violence and capable of causing death or serious physical injury, it therefore was a deadly weapon. In adopting this definition, the majority recognizes that not all items capable of discharging a shot are designed for violence. It also recognizes that there are many guns capable of causing death or serious physical injury that were not designed for violence against persons but concludes that such guns nevertheless satisfy \u00a7 53a-3 (6) because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>they were intended to cause damage or injury to their intended target. See footnote 12 of the majority opinion. Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, however, a nail gun designed to penetrate wood or a slingshot designed to strike a paper target or small animals could be considered to be designed for violence. To me, it challenges common sense to assume that the legislature had in mind violence to boards, paper targets, or even small animals \u2014 in other words, anything other than human beings \u2014 when it adopted the Penal Code, which solely addresses crimes against persons. See, e.g, <em>Carmel Hollow Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>269 Conn. 120, 133, 848 A.2d 451 (2004) (\u201c[i]t is well established that, \u2018[i]n construing a statute, common sense must be used and courts must assume that a reasonable and rational result was intended\u2019 \u201d). Therefore, although I agree with the majority\u2019s determination that to constitute a deadly weapon, an instrument must be capable of causing death or serious physical injury, I would conclude that an instrument is designed for violence only when the violence intended is the type of violence capable of causing death or serious physical injury to a person.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Recognizing that the focus of our disagreement is a narrow one, I begin with the meaning of the phrase \u201cdesigned for.\u201d Although we previously have not considered the meaning of the phrase, courts have defined it essentially as the main purpose for which the item was created. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Schaffer, </em>202 Ariz. 592, 594 n.4, 48 P.3d 1202 (App. 2002) (prosthesis deemed not to be deadly weapon where \u201c \u2018deadly weapon\u2019 \u201d is defined to include \u201c \u2018anything designed for lethal use\u2019 Ariz.

It also relies on an operating manual for the air gun that was submitted by the state, which contained the following warning: \u201cNOT A TOY. ADULT SUPERVISION REQUIRED. MISUSE OR CARELESS USE MAY CAUSE SERIOUS PHYSICAL INJURY OR DEATH. MAY BE DANGEROUS UP TO 400 YARDS (366 METERS).\u201d Notably, however, three of the manual\u2019s four specific warnings as to such injuries exclusively concerned injury to the <em>user.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Even more significant, the only use mentioned in the manual is target shooting. Indeed, the manual explains: \u201cYour air<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>gun is designed for target shooting and is suited for both indoor and outdoor use.\u201d As the <em>only </em>evidence regarding intended use was the statements in the manual regarding target shooting, nothing in this record establishes that the air gun found in the apartment qualifies as a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d under \u00a7 53a-3 (6) in that it is designed for violence to humans.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The majority also notes that the state argued to the trial court that, \u201cas a matter of common sense, the gun, particularly when used at close range, could be a deadly weapon and could cause serious physical injury.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To the extent, however, that the trial court may have relied on this argument, it clearly was an improper application of common knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Although it is certainly true that \u201c[i]t is the right and the duty of the [trier of fact] to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the evidence . . . [i]n considering the evidence introduced in a case, [triers of fact] are not required to leave common sense at the courtroom door . . . nor are they expected to lay aside matters of common knowledge or their own observations and experience of the affairs of life . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>46 Conn.

It is also true, however, that \u201ccommon knowledge encompasses only those things so patently obvious and so well known to the community generally, that there can be no question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>or dispute concerning their existence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Padua, </em>273 Conn. 138, 196, 869 A.2d 192 (2005) <em>(Katz, J., </em>dissenting and concurring). \u201c[C]ommon knowledge is not tantamount to a common belief that may be nothing more than a perception grounded in folklore, not reality.\u201d Id., 194 <em>(Katz, J., </em>dissenting and concurring); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>273 Conn. 204, 211-14, 869 A.2d 171 (2005) (expert testimony regarding harmful effect to child when cocaine ingested not required because harmful physiological effects of cocaine are within knowledge and experience of typical juror, state law reflected determination that cocaine was dangerous drug, published court opinions highlighted threat to health when cocaine was hidden in mouth or swallowed, and potentially harmful effects of ingesting crack cocaine are subject of published news reports); <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>260 Conn. 813, 822, 801 A.2d 718 (2002) (expert testimony on effects of smoking marijuana is not required when average juror would have been exposed, through observation, experience, acculturation and popular education, to sufficient facts to form reasoned conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Because the field of common knowledge is limited to obvious facts, it can be considered common knowledge that an air gun is designed for violence only when the question actually has been examined and the results are largely undisputed as well as widely distributed. The majority\u2019s conclusion that such common knowledge exists seems to rest on the premise that it is an obvious fact that the air gun at issue here, specifically, a Crosman model 1008 repeater C02 pellet pistol, and indeed all air guns, are designed for violence. Such a conclusion is unwarranted. Unlike the effects of marijuana smoking addressed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 822, it cannot be said that the average fact finder in Connecticut has been exposed, through personal observation and experience, acculturation or popular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>education, to the Crosman model 1008 repeater C02 pellet pistol, or any air gun, enough to be familiar with \u201cobvious facts\u201d sufficient to allow a determination that such instruments are designed for violence. Certainly it cannot be said that ownership of air guns is so widespread in this state at this point in time that most or even many people have a familiarity with air guns through personal experience or the experience of friends and family.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Turning to reference materials readily available to the public, I note that one encyclopedia describes an air gun as: \u201c[A] small-caliber weapon, either a handgun or a shoulder weapon, from which pellets, bullets, or darts are discharged by the expanding force of compressed air or gas. Some air guns are little more than toys, others have considerable penetrating power.\u201d 1 Encyclopedia Americana, International Edition (Grolier, Inc., 1998) p. 383.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This article further explains that \u201c[n]o form of air gun yet made has had enough power to propel a bullet to any considerable distance; thus, air guns have no military significance,\u201d and that \u201c[t]op-grade air guns are accurate at short ranges and are particularly suitable for target practice, for exterminating such small pests as mice and rats, and for training in safe handling of firearms.\u201d Id. Similarly, another encyclopedia describes air guns as follows: \u201cMost modem air guns are inexpensive BB guns (named for the size of the shot fired). The best of these develop about [one-half] the muzzle velocity of light firearms, are accurate enough for marksmanship training at ranges up to 100 feet . . . and can kill small game.\u201d 1 The New Encyclopaedia Britannica (15th Ed. 1998) p. 175. Thus, popular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>reference books do not add to the common knowledge that air guns are designed for violence to humans, but, rather, indicate that there are many types of air guns with varying capabilities, designed for various uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Indeed, one buyer\u2019s guide, listing more than <em>400 </em>types of air guns, demonstrates the expansive variety of guns, with varying power and accuracy, that are encompassed in this category. See J. Walter, The Airgun Book (3d Ed. 1984). There is also a variety of shots available for use in the various air guns: \u201cThe target shooter, for example, selects stable, flat-head \u2018wadcutter\u2019 pellets to cut neat, easily gauged holes in his targets, while many fieldsmen prefer English-style round-heads, which perform better at long range \u2014 or the . . . pointed-head \u2018hunting\u2019 pellets which promise better penetration.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., p. 52. A brief history offered by the author indicates that air guns were designed for a range of activities, including organized target shooting at pubs and air gun competitions for youngsters. Id., p. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 211-14, we also looked to published opinions as highlighting information said to be common knowledge. The Appellate Court has addressed whether an unloaded air gun was a dangerous instrument so as to establish robbery in the first degree and concluded that, unless it was used to threaten bludgeoning, it was not. <em>State </em>v. <em>Osman, </em>21 Conn. App. 299, 573 A.2d 743 (1990), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 218 Conn. 432, 589 A.2d 1227 (1991). In dicta, however, the Appellate Court asserted: \u201cThe pellet pistol used in the robbery is a weapon designed for violence. The weapon fits the definition of the term \u2018deadly weapon\u2019 at \u00a7 53a-3 (6). This term appears in \u00a7 53a-134 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>(a) (2). ... If the defendant had been charged under [this section], the state would not have had to prove that the pistol was loaded at the time of the robbery. The only issue would have been whether the weapon was operable.\u201d Id., 307 n.3. I question the precedential value of the assertion that the pellet gun was designed for violence and, in light of the fact that it was completely unsupported by evidence or even analysis, I find that it sheds no more light on the matter than the conclusory findings of the trial court in the present case. See footnote 5 of this opinion; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Padua, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 194-95 <em>(Katz, J., </em>dissenting and concurring) (discussing difference between perception grounded in folklore and common knowledge).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The majority also cites cases from other jurisdictions concerning air guns, but these do little to support the conclusion that it is common knowledge that air guns are designed for violence to humans.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In cases cited by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the majority wherein the definition of deadly weapon applied by the courts actually did include a requirement that the item was designed, made or adapted to cause death or serious injury and the factor was determinative, those cases are not persuasive in that one court never discussed the application of this standard, and the others provided only a cursory analysis of the issue. <em>See McCaskill v. State, </em>648 So. 2d 1175, 1178 (Ala. Crim. App. 1994) (concluding that BB gun could be deadly weapon, defined by statute, to include anything \u201c \u2018manifestly designed, made or adapted for the purposes of inflicting death or serious physical injury,\u2019 \u201d because it can cause serious injury to eye); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cordova, </em>198 Ariz. 242, 243, 8 P.3d 1156 (App. 1999) (because pellet gun uses carbon dioxide cartridges to propel pellets and jury had opportunity to view pellet gun during its deliberations, evidence sufficient to establish air gun was deadly weapon when \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d defined to include anything designed for lethal use, including \u201cfirearm,\u201d which was defined by Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 13-105 [17] as \u201cany loaded or unloaded handgun, pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun or other weapon which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of expanding gases\u201d); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>State, </em>577 S.W.2d 493, 495-96 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979) (because air gun designed to fire .22 caliber projectile was capable of causing death of human being if fired at close range and gun was pointed at close range during robbery, it was found to be deadly weapon capable of causing serious injury and designed for that purpose); see also <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>State, </em>698 So. 2d 555, 560-62 (Fla. App. 1997) (unclear whether air gun was found to be deadly weapon or dangerous instrument when conviction was affirmed after court assessed likelihood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>of injury from reasonable victim\u2019s point of view and air gun used to threaten).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In other cases addressing air guns used in crimes, however, fact finders have concluded that the air guns at issue were not designed for violence. See, e.g., <em>Holder </em>v. <em>State, </em>837 S.W.2d 802, 808 (Tex. App. 1992) (although air pistol could shoot BB with muzzle velocity of 180 feet per second and thus was capable of penetrating human eye, expert witness testified that spring-piston BB or pellet pistol was not manifestly designed, made, or adapted for purpose of inflicting death or serious bodily injury and state therefore had to prove air pistol was loaded); <em>Mosley </em>v. <em>State, </em>545 S.W.2d 144, 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 1976) (when state\u2019s expert testified that BB gun projectile could not penetrate skin, but that there was good probability it could cause loss of sight if victim were shot in eye and witness testified that air pistol used constantly misfired and, when it did fire, projectile had very low velocity and rarely went over five feet, unreasonable to conclude that weapon was \u201c \u2018designed, made, or adapted for the purpose of inflicting death or serious bodily injury\u2019 \u201d). Indeed, the latter two Texas cases are more persuasive because the fact finders in those cases were presented with expert testimony as to the specific air gun\u2019s capabilities. Moreover, in light of the differing conclusions drawn by fact finders regarding whether various types of air guns were designed for violence, I do not believe that, even if we were to search outside of Connecticut, it can be said to be common knowledge that all air guns generally, or the air gun in the present matter specifically, are designed for violence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>I do not deny the possibility that evidence could be submitted at trial that conceivably could convince a fact finder that the Crosman model 1008 repeater C02 pellet pistol discharges the flat ended pellet used at a velocity so high that it supports the conclusion that the gun was designed for violence to humans.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, it may be that the velocity of 430 feet per second reported in the manual.submitted as evidence is of sufficient force that it would support a conclusion by a fact finder that an item capable of such power is designed mainly for the type of violence capable of causing death or serious physical injury to a human.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>1 strongly disagree, however, that it reasonably can be said to constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>common knowledge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, I respectfully dissent with respect to the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court in the present case reasonably could have concluded that the Crosman model 1008 repeater C02 pellet pistol was a deadly weapon, specifically, that it was designed for violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The state, however, requests, in the alternative, that we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the lesser charge of robbery in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-136.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under the facts of this case, I agree that the state has established the elements of third degree robbery and I would instruct the trial court to render a judgment of conviction under that statute.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\"> Although the Penal Code does not provide a definition for \u201cserious bodily harm,\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (4) defines \u201c \u2018[sjerious physical injury\u2019 \u201d as a \u201cphysical injury which creates a substantial risk of death, or which causes serious disfigurement, serious impairment of health or serious loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ . . . .\u201d In the absence of an alternative definition for \u201cserious bodily harm,\u201d or any indication in the majority\u2019s analysis that the definitions would differ, I apply the statutory definition for serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The legislature does not define violence; nor does the majority. One dictionary includes the following definitions for violence: \u201c[EJxertion of physical force so as to injure or abuse (as in effecting an entrance to a house),\u201d \u201cinjury by or as if by distortion, infringement, or profanation\u201d and \u201cintense, turbulent, or furious and often destructive action or force.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. <em>1993). As </em>I hope to demonstrate in this dissent, a simple application of this definition, divorced from the context of the Penal Code, would lead to absurd and unworkable results.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-6\"> Under the majority\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cdesigned for violence,\u201d proof that a slingshot was carried, without shot in a zipped backpack, and was never used or even referenced during a robbery, would elevate a robbery in the third degree pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-136 to robbery in the first degree, with five years of the resulting sentence to be without suspension or reduction. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (b). This is so because, if an instrument is deemed a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d under \u00a7 53a-3 (6), it need not be used to injure, it need not be displayed or even used to threaten during the course of the robbery, it may be loaded or unloaded, and the state need only show that it is operational. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-3 (6) and 53a-134 (a). Further, the penalty for robbery in the first degree, a class B felony, carries the additional requirement that the defendant \u201cshall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of which five years of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced by the court.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (b).

THEN PUSH IT TO SAFE OFF.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Although these specific warnings suggest that the general warning was nothing more than a standard products liability waiver, I do not dispute that the air pistol at issue was capable, under limited circumstances, of causing serious ipjury or possibly death. See footnote 8 of this opinion (referencing product liability cases arising from use of air guns).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b162-8\"> The trial transcript also contained the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">\u201cThe Court: . . . [The] manual for the [Crosman] pellet gun, if I\u2019m not mistaken. I haven\u2019t \u2014 they fire at a rate of speed and have a key \u2014 they can kill, for example, small animals. We know that for a fact. Don\u2019t we? Don\u2019t we know that pellet guns can kill small animals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: I think we do make a common sense finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I can tell you from my own experience such things occur, you know.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\"> The Encyclopedia Americana, supra, p. 383, explains that there are two general types of air guns in popular use: one type is powered by air or carbon dioxide gas under pressure within the guns, and the second type is powered by air pressure created by the release of a powerful spring and plunger. These guns are comparable in power and accuracy. 1 The New Encyclopaedia Britannica (15th Ed. 1998) p. 175.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\"> Although certainly not common knowledge, this information would suggest that because the Crosman model 1008 repeater C02 pellet pistol found in the defendant\u2019s apartment utilized the flat head pellets, which are described as the type that are intended for short range target shooting, the gun was not designed for violence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> Other published cases indicate that air guns are given to and used by children. See <em>Haesche </em>v. <em>Kissner, </em>229 Conn. 213, 217, 640 A.2d 89 (1994) (product liability case arising out of eye injury occurring while fifteen and sixteen year olds used Crosman model 66 Powermaster .177 caliber pellet/ BB air rifle in activity called \u201cwar games\u201d that involved hunting for and shooting at each other while wearing several layers of clothing for protection); <em>Vilcinskas </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>144 Conn. 170, 171, 127 A.2d 814 (1956) (product liability case arising out of accident occurring when air rifle sold to ten year old accidentally discharged and caused injury). Although these cases may not reflect positively on the safety of air guns, they do indicate a general usage that belies the argument that these guns are designed mainly to do the type of violence capable of causing death or serious physical injury to a human.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\"> The definitions of deadly weapon applied in two of the cases did not include a requirement that a deadly weapon be designed or intended for violence \u2014 and indeed, the analysis applied was much closer to the analysis of circumstances that we would apply under \u00a7 53a-3 (7) defining dangerous instrument. Notably, the most relevant point to this discussion that may be taken from <em>People </em>v. <em>Lochtefeld, </em>77 Cal. App. 4th 533, 538-40, 91 Cal. Rptr. 2d 778 (2000), and <em>Merriweather </em>v. <em>State, </em>778 N.E.2d 449, 457 (Ind. App. 2002), goes not to whether air guns are designed for violence, but, instead, to whether knowledge regarding air guns is so common as to obviate the need for evidence. In both of these cases cited in the majority opinion, expert testimony was submitted regarding the capabilities of the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>guns at issue and the type of capabilities that would be required to cause death or serious injury to a human, thereby acknowledging implicitly that such information is not a matter of common knowledge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\"> Moreover, I note that if we look within Connecticut, as we did in <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 212-14, to state law to determine the existence of a legislative determination, evidencing common knowledge, we do not find a similar confirmation. It is not unlawful to own or to sell air guns and, indeed, the legislature expressly has recognized the use of such instruments by children in sporting events or by persons in sporting competitions. See General Statutes \u00a7 53-206 (b) (5) (although \u201cBB. gun[s]\u201d included in list of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>dangerous weapons that may not be carried on one\u2019s person, providing explicit exclusions for \u201cthe carrying of a BB. gun by any person taking part in a supervised event or competition of the Boy Scouts of America or the Girl Scouts of America or in any other authorized event or competition while taking part in such event or competition or while transporting such weapon to or from such event or competition\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\"> In this regard, I note General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217e (3), which prohibits negligent hunting, includes in the definition of \u201c \u2018[l]oaded hunting implement\u2019 \u201d high velocity air guns that are charged with a projectile in the chamber or in a magazine that is attached to the air gun. Clearly, there are some air guns that are used in hunting and some even may be used in hunting game large enough to support the conclusion that they are designed for the type of violence capable of causing death or serious physical injury to a human.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\"> I note that, even if I were to accept the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u201cdesigned for violence\u201d to include objects designed to cause violence to small animals, common knowledge still cannot serve to establish whether the Crosman model 1008 repeater C02 pellet pistol is an air gun with the accuracy and velocity required for hunting small prey. One expert has explained that \u201c[t]arget rifles may need to better 0.8 [accuracy unit] to be reasonable for value for money, or 0.5 [accuracy unit] to win competitions if the firer is good enough; good sporting guns probably need to surpass 1 unit; low-price plinking rifles 2.5; cheap pistols, 5 [accuracy unit] (though 5 units would mean that groups at 10m would be 50mm in diameter!).\u201d J. Walter, supra, p. 61. The author explains that a gun with one accuracy unit achieves a one meter diameter group at 1000 meters, a 2.5 centimeter group at 25 meters or a centimeter group at a 10 meter distance. Id. \u201cPlinking\u201d is defined as \u201cto shoot, at especially in a casual manner.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993). Where the air gun in this case falls within this range cannot reasonably be said to be common knowledge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b170-9\"> \u201cIt is afundamental tenet of our law to resolve doubts in the enforcement of a penal code against the imposition of a harsher punishment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 316, 630 A.2d 593 (1993). Lenity certainly requires that, to the extent the definition of a deadly weapon does not clearly include the air gun in the present case, it should not be presumed, without proof, to be included.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b170-10\"><em> </em>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-136 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the third degree when he commits robbery as defined in section 53a-133.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AUc\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133 provides: \u201cA person commits robbery when, in the course of committing a larceny, he uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person for the purpose of: (1) Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking; or (2) compelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
