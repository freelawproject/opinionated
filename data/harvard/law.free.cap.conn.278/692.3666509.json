The defendant cross appeals, contending that the trial court improperly denied its motion to set aside the jury\u2019s findings that the defendant: (1) discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of physical disability; and (2) executed a settlement agreement with the plaintiff as a pretext for unlawful discrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. The plaintiff began his employment for the city of Bridgeport (city) in 1985 as an attendant at the Beardsley Park Zoo, where he worked for approximately two years. Thereafter, the plaintiff transferred to the city\u2019s department of public works, which later became the defendant. The defendant and its predecessor employed the plaintiff as a street sweeper and sewer well cleaner,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in which capacity he suffered injuries to his knee, back and ankle. The plaintiff received workers\u2019 compensation for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>In December, 1993, the plaintiff became involved in a labor dispute with the defendant, which ultimately resulted in the termination of his employment. The plaintiff, pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement then in effect between the defendant and the plaintiffs labor union, appealed from his termination to the state board of mediation and arbitration, which, in November, 1994, reduced the termination to a fifteen day suspension and ordered that the plaintiff be reinstated. The defendant failed, however, to return the plaintiff to work and he filed complaints with the state board of labor relations (labor board) and the commission on human rights and opportunities (commission), alleging that he had not been returned to work because of the defendant\u2019s discrimination against him on the basis of his race and physical disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">On January 29, 1997, the plaintiff and the defendant met, along with an agent of the labor board, to resolve the plaintiffs complaints. At that time, the parties entered into a settlement agreement (agreement), pursuant to which the plaintiff agreed to withdraw his pending claims of discrimination and the defendant agreed to rehire the plaintiff as a sewage plant attendant. The agreement also provided that the parties would negotiate the amount of back pay that was owed to the plaintiff and, in the event that they could not agree, that the issue would be resolved by the commission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff repeatedly professed during negotia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>tions that, despite his injuries, he was capable of performing the significant physical labor required of a sewage plant attendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The plaintiff worked for the defendant as a sewage plant attendant until March 19, 1997, at which time the defendant suspended his employment, citing the plaintiffs \u201cphysical limitations in connection with certain job [functions] . . . .\u201d The defendant informed the plaintiff of his suspension in a letter entitled \u201c[r]elease [f]rom [d]uties [without [p]ay,\u201d citing its concern for his physical welfare and claiming that it wished to have a physician assess his medical condition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant made no effort, however, to evaluate the plaintiffs physical condition since that time, and the plaintiff has been employed as a furniture mover since his 1997 suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>The defendant contracted with Professional Services Group, Inc. (Professional); see footnote 1 of this opinion; to privatize its operations on March 27, 1997. At that time, the defendant laid off nearly all of its employees, who were then immediately hired by Professional. Unlike other employees of the defendant, however, the plaintiff did not learn of the privatization until approximately two years after it had occurred because notice was mailed to the plaintiff at the defendant\u2019s offices, where he was not working because of his suspension, rather than to his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">After receiving the statutorily required release from the commission; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-100 and 46a-101; the plaintiff brought the present action for damages, claiming that the defendant\u2019s discharge and suspension of the plaintiff: (1) constituted discrimination on the basis of race and physical disability in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1); (2) constituted discrimination on the basis of physical disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.; (3) were committed in retaliation for his filing a complaint with the commission in violation of \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (4); and (4) violated the privatization agreement between the city and Professional.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">At trial, the court precluded the plaintiff from presenting evidence of discrimination predating the agreement, including evidence regarding the 1993 termination. The trial court reasoned that, in the event that the agreement was enforceable and not, as the plaintiff contended, a pretext for unlawful discrimination designed to procure withdrawal of his complaint with the commission, the agreement should be enforced according to its terms.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff has not challenged that ruling on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>At the close of the plaintiffs case-in-chief, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for nonsuit on the plaintiffs federal discrimination claim pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-210,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the plaintiff has not challenged that ruling. The plaintiffs remaining state law claims were presented to the jury, which, according to the submitted interrogatories, found that the defendant neither discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of race, nor retaliated against him for filing a complaint with the commission. The jury did find, however, that the defendant had discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of physical disability in violation of \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1). The jury further found that the defendant had entered into the agreement as a pretext for discriminating against the plaintiff. The jury awarded the plaintiff economic damages of $2100 from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Despite the jury\u2019s finding that the agreement was a pretext for unlawful discrimination, the trial court declined to allow the jury to award damages for back pay. Instead, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff \u201cis entitled to receive what he would have otherwise received and been entitled to in the absence of what the jury is finding to have been an unlawful employment activity. He is entitled to have his complaint filed before the labor board and he\u2019s entitled to have the labor board address his issue and have the labor board award him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>the back pay to the extent to which he\u2019s entitled to it pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement of 1997.\u201d The plaintiff moved to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, claiming that the trial court improperly: (1) prevented the jury from awarding the plaintiff back pay; (2) excluded evidence regarding the plaintiffs 1994 termination; (3) excluded certain evidence from the plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation agreement; (4) precluded the plaintiff from discussing his \u201c \u2018bumping rights\u2019 \u201d at final argument; (5) allowed the defendant to introduce evidence regarding formation of the agreement; and (6) granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the plaintiffs third party beneficiary claim. The court denied his motions. The defendant also moved to set aside the verdict, claiming that the plaintiff adduced insufficient evidence to prove that: (1) he was discriminated against in violation of the act; and (2) the agreement was a pretext for unlawful discrimination. The trial court denied the motion and rendered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">This appeal and cross appeal followed. On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the trial court improperly precluded the jury from awarding damages arising from the agreement, and also that it improperly prevented him from introducing evidence regarding the value of his lost \u201c \u2018bumping rights,\u2019 \u201d that is, his right to remain at work in place of less senior employees in the event of a layoff. The defendant cross appeals, claiming that the trial court improperly declined to set aside the jury\u2019s findings that it had discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of physical disability and in executing the agreement. Additional facts are set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">CROSS APPEAL: THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">We first address the defendant\u2019s contentions, on cross appeal, that the trial court improperly denied its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>motion to set aside the jury\u2019s findings that it had discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of physical disability and that the agreement was a pretext for unlawful discrimination. We begin with the cross appeal because, if the defendant prevails, the plaintiffs appeal will be rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">\u201cThe standard of review governing our review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to set aside the verdict is well settled. The trial court possesses inherent power to set aside a jury verdict which, in the court\u2019s opinion, is against the law or the evidence. . . . [The trial court] should not set aside a verdict where it is apparent that there was some evidence upon which the jury might reasonably reach their conclusion, and should not refuse to set it aside where the manifest injustice of the verdict is so plain and palpable as clearly to denote that some mistake was made by the jury in the application of legal principles .... Ultimately, [t]he decision to set aside a verdict entails the exercise of a broad legal discretion . . . that, in the absence of clear abuse, we shall not disturb.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Edmands </em>v. <em>CUNO, Inc., </em>277 Conn. 425, 452-53, 892 A.2d 938 (2006).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Evidence Relating to the Plaintiffs Prima Facie Case</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">We begin with the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the jury\u2019s findings that the plaintiff was physically disabled and that the defendant discriminated against him on the basis of his disabilities. Specifically, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>contends that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-51 (15), the term \u201c \u2018[p]hysically disabled\u2019 refers to any individual who has any chronic physical handicap, infirmity or impairment, whether congenital or resulting from bodily injury, organic processes or changes or from illness, including, but not limited to, epilepsy, deafness or hearing impairment or reliance on a wheelchair or other remedial appliance or device,\u201d and the evidence proffered by the plaintiff was insufficient to satisfy this statutory definition. The defendant further contends that, even if the plaintiff were, in fact, disabled, the record contains insufficient evidence for the jury to have concluded that the defendant discriminated against him on that basis. We disagree with both of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The record contains ample support for the jury\u2019s findings that the plaintiff was physically disabled and that the defendant discriminated against him on the basis of physical disability. The plaintiff testified that, in either 1986 or 1987, he sustained an injury to his right knee in the course of his employment. The plaintiff further testified that, as a result of that injury, he underwent surgery, received workers\u2019 compensation benefits and was given a disability rating for his knee. The plaintiff also testified that he later suffered a \u201cstrained . . . lower lumbar spine.\u201d As a result of his injuries and accompanying surgery, the plaintiff experienced continuing discomfort. The defendant offered no evidence to refute the plaintiff\u2019s testimony regarding these injuries. Such evidence certainly satisfies the broad statutory definition of physical disability contained in \u00a7 46a-51 (15), which includes a \u201cchronic . . . infirmity . . . resulting from bodily injury . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Similarly, the record also supports the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant took adverse employment action against the plaintiff on the basis of his disabilities. Specifically, the plaintiff introduced evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>defendant had suspended his employment because of his physical disabilities, pending examination by a physician so that his duties could be reassessed, but that the defendant did not ever seek to have a physician examine him. The plaintiff further testified that his discharge was not precipitated by any type of warning or other indication that he was not adequately performing his job functions. Additionally, unlike other employees of the defendant, the plaintiff was not informed of the decision to privatize the defendant\u2019s functions and his corresponding right to seek employment with Professional because the defendant sent such notice to his work address, despite the fact that he had been explicitly instructed not to return there until after his disabilities had been evaluated by a medical professional. By the time the plaintiff received the letter, some two years later, it was too late for him to obtain employment with Professional.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Although the defendant contends that the plaintiff could not have been disabled because he was employed as a furniture mover during the pendency of the present lawsuit, \u201c[i]t is not the function of this court to sit as the seventh juror when we review the sufficiency of the evidence . . . rather, we must determine, in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, whether the totality of the evidence, including reasonable inferences therefrom, supports the jury\u2019s verdict .... In making this determination, [t]he evidence must be given the <em>most favorable </em>construction in support of the verdict of which it is reasonably capable. ... In other words, [i]f the jury could reasonably have reached its conclusion, the verdict must stand, even if this court disagrees with it.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ormsby </em>v. <em>Frankel, </em>255 Conn. 670, 692, 768 A.2d 441 (2001). Clearly, in the present case, there was evidence from which the jury could infer that the plaintiff was disabled and that, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>the basis of that disability, he suffered adverse employment action. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Whether the Agreement Was Evidence of Pretext</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The defendant also contends that there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the agreement was a pretext for unlawful discrimination against the plaintiff. The term \u201cpretext\u201d is most often used in the context of evaluating claims of discrimination based on adverse employment action under the burden shifting analysis enumerated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and adopted by this court in <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 40, 53-54, 578 A.2d 1054 (1990). \u201cUnder this analysis, the employee must first make a prima facie case of discrimination. The employer may then rebut the prima facie case by stating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory justification for the employment decision in question. The employee then must demonstrate that the reason proffered by the employer is merely a pretext and that the decision actually was motivated by illegal discriminatory bias.\u201d <em>Craine </em>v. <em>Trinity College, </em>259 Conn. 625, 637, 791 A.2d 518 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">\u201cIn order to establish a prima facie case, the complainant must prove that: (1) he [was] in the protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>adverse action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>General Electric Co., </em>275 Conn. 395, 400, 880 A.2d 151 (2005). We note, additionally, that \u201c[t]he factfinder\u2019s disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination. Thus, rejection of the defendant\u2019s proffered reasons will permit the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination, and . . . upon such rejection, [n]o additional proof of discrimination is required . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The plaintiff failed, both in this court and in the trial court, to enumerate specifically the analytical framework for his assertion that the agreement was pretextual. On the basis of the trial court\u2019s framing of the issue, which precluded evidence of discrimination predating the agreement, the only adverse employment action at issue herein is the indefinite suspension in March, 1997.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The plaintiff has not challenged the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>court\u2019s decision to so limit the presentation of evidence. Accordingly, under the trial court\u2019s framework, along with the parties\u2019 evidence and pleadings, the plaintiff sought to prove that: (1) he was a member of a protected class, namely, the physically disabled; (2) he was qualified for employment at his desired position; (3) he suffered adverse employment action, namely, his indefinite suspension in 1997; and (4) the defendant had no intention of performing under the agreement and its enumerated reason for suspending the plaintiff, namely, his alleged inability to perform the functions of his job, was a pretext for unlawful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">We turn now to the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly declined to set aside the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s stated reason for suspending the plaintiff was pretextual. Construing the evidence in a light most favorable to sustaining the verdict; <em>Ormsby </em>v. <em>Frankel, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 692; we conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The plaintiff offered considerable testimony supporting his contention that the defendant had no intention of reinstating him. As stated previously, the plaintiff testified that in, December, 1993, he was terminated by the defendant, but that, pursuant to an arbitration award dated November 10, 1994, he was ordered reinstated. Despite the arbitrator\u2019s award, however, the defendant failed to return the plaintiff to work, requiring him to file a complaint with the commission. It was only after the plaintiff filed that complaint that the defendant \u201csettled\u201d its dispute with the plaintiff and returned him to work.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Firrthermore, the plaintiff testified that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>although he was willing and able to perform all duties associated with his position following his reinstatement pursuant to the agreement, the defendant nevertheless suspended him less than two months after his reinstatement. Additionally, as stated previously, although the defendant purportedly suspended the plaintiff out of concern for his physical welfare, it at no time attempted to have a physician examine him.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">On appeal, the defendant contends that, because the jury found that the defendant did not retaliate against the plaintiff for filing his complaint with the commission, it could not have found that the agreement was pretextual. This argument, which presumes that the plaintiffs discrimination and retaliation claims are identical, misapprehends the applicable law. As the First Circuit Court of Appeals has aptly stated: \u201cThe majority of cases are not cut from this seamless cloth. Even when retaliation is derivative of a particular act of harassment, it normally does not stem from the same animus. Most often, retaliation is a distinct and independent act of discrimination, motivated by a discrete intention to punish a person who has rocked the boat by complaining about an unlawful employment practice.\u201d <em>Noviello </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>398 F.3d 76, 87 (1st Cir. 2005). In the present case, the jury reasonably could have found that, although the defendant did not rehire and discharge the plaintiff out of animus for his filing a complaint with the commission, the agreement was merely a mechanism by which to procure dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint, thus allowing the defendant to fire him on the basis of his disability for a new, trumped-up reason. Accordingly, because \u201cthere was some evidence upon which the jury might reasonably reach their conclusion\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Edmands </em>v. <em>CUNO, Inc., </em>supra, 277 Conn. 452-53; the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the jury\u2019s finding regarding the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S RULING ON DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">We next address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the labor board, rather than the jury, should determine the amount of damages, including back pay, for the defendant\u2019s discriminatory conduct occurring prior to the date of the agreement. The plaintiff argues that the trial court\u2019s actions in referring the matter to the labor board for a determination of damages deprived him of his right to have the jury calculate damages on his discrimination claim. The plaintiff relies specifically on General Statutes \u00a7 31-51bb, which provides that persons employed pursuant to collective bargaining agreements shall not be denied the right to pursue statutory or constitutional claims where such claims exist.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The plaintiffs reliance on \u00a7 31-51bb, which is not part of the act at issue herein, is misplaced. This court previously has stated that \u201cthe language of \u00a7 31-51bb and the legislative history indicate that [it was] intended to . . . eliminate the requirement that a plaintiff who is subject to a collective bargaining agreement exhaust all grievance and arbitration procedures before pursuing any statutory remedies in the trial court.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Genovese </em>v. <em>Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 475, 481, 628 A.2d 946 (1993). In other words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>\u201c[\u00a7] 31-51bb was enacted by the legislature to ensure that employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement receive the same opportunity to litigate their statutory claims as those employees who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d Id., 484. Accordingly, \u00a7 31-51bb does not create an independent right to a jury determination of damages when, as in the present case, it is unclear that <em>any </em>litigant possesses such a right under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Resolution of the plaintiffs claim, therefore, hinges on the meaning of the remedy provision of the act, namely, General Statutes \u00a7 46a-104,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and requires a two step analysis, specifically whether: (1) the plaintiff <em>was entitled </em>to a jury determination of damages on his cause of action under the act; and (2) the trial court\u2019s remedy violated that right. Thus, we are left with a threshold question of whether the plaintiff, or indeed, any employee, whether subject to a collective bargaining agreement or not, has a right to a jury trial for state employment discrimination claims under the act. We note that this issue is unsettled,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and, in the proper context, might be ripe for this court\u2019s review. In the present case, however, the plaintiff has ignored the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>issue, focusing the entirety of his analysis on the issue of whether the trial court\u2019s actions violated his <em>presumed </em>right to a jury determination of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">It is axiomatic that, \u201c[w]e are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. ... We consistently have held that [ajnalysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly. . . . [Assignments of error which are merely mentioned but not briefed beyond a statement of the claim will be deemed abandoned and will not be reviewed by this court. . . . Where the parties cite no law and provide no analysis of their claims, we do not review such claims.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>270 Conn. 815, 823-24 n.8, 856 A.2d 358 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In the present case, the plaintiff devotes eleven pages of his brief to arguing that the trial court abridged his right to a jury determination of damages for discrimination. His brief is devoid, however, of any analysis of whether that right even exists, a question that is far from settled. See footnote 16 of this opinion. Indeed, the plaintiff only alludes to the issue\u2019s existence on one occasion, stating: \u201cThe court infringed on the [plaintiffs right to have the jury decide damages on its finding that the defendant discriminated against the [p]laintiff. (Right to jury trial on claims filed pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60. See <em>Stedman </em>v. <em>Konover Construction Corp., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at New Britain, Docket No. CV-93-0457003S (December 6, 1994).]).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">This failure to brief a crucial underlying premise precludes further review of this claim, which we deem abandoned. See <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 115-16, 653 A.2d 782 (1995) (\u201c[The plaintiffs] argument . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>presupposes the application of [the statute at issue] to employment cases. If [the statute at issue] does not apply to employment cases, then we are not even presented with [a constitutional question]. . . . Nevertheless, [the plaintiff] has not bothered to brief this underlying premise. Where an issue is merely mentioned, but not briefed beyond a bare assertion of the claim, it is deemed to have been waived. ... In this case, [the plaintiffs] argument derives from a premise, the validity of which has not been tested. Without the benefit of adequate briefing, we will not decide whether [the statute at issue] has the sweep that [the plaintiff] ascribes to it.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]). Our conclusion in <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>is particularly instructive in the present case, wherein the issue of whether a plaintiff is entitled to a jury determination of damages is hardly settled in the plaintiffs favor. Rather than address this issue without the benefit of adequate briefing and argument, we leave its resolution for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S RULING REGARDING \u201cBUMPING RIGHTS\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improperly precluded him from arguing the value of his \u2018 \u2018bumping rights\u201d to the jury. The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. At the close of the evidence, the plaintiff stated that he planned to request that the jury award him damages for loss of his \u201cbumping rights.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiff indicated that he planned to draw the jury\u2019s attention to a provision of the collective bargaining agreement between the plaintiff and the city. The defendant objected to the plaintiffs mention of bumping rights in closing argument, arguing that he had made no mention of bumping rights in his complaint, and only scant evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>dence of their existence had been presented at trial. The defendant, therefore, argued that any valuation of the plaintiffs \u201cbumping rights\u201d would be speculative. The trial court agreed, and precluded the plaintiff from mentioning them.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">We begin our analysis with the appropriate standard of review. \u201cIn general, the scope of final argument lies within the sound discretion of the court . . . subject to appropriate constitutional limitations. ... It is within the discretion of the trial court to limit the scope of final argument to prevent comment on facts that are not properly in evidence, to prevent the jury from considering matters in the realm of speculation and to prevent the jury from being influenced by improper matter that might prejudice its deliberations.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arline, </em>223 Conn. 52, 59, 612 A.2d 755 (1992). \u201cWhen reviewing claims under an abuse of discretion standard, the unquestioned rule is that great weight is due to the action of the trial court and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness .... In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>PSE Consulting, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frank Mercede &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>267 Conn. 279, 328-29, 838 A.2d 135 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In the present case, \u201cbumping rights\u201d were mentioned only three times at trial. The plaintiff, in response to a question from his counsel regarding his knowledge of the layoff of the defendant\u2019s employees and their hiring by Professional, stated: \u201cSomewhere around in there I was supposed to \u2014 I had \u2014 I could have exercised bump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>ing rights or I was supposed to apply for work with [Professional] or to that affect.\u201d The plaintiff did not elaborate at that time. Later, during cross-examination, the plaintiff explained that, following his suspension from work in March, 1997, he did not exercise \u201cbumping rights\u201d because he had not been formally terminated, but merely suspended pending evaluation by a physician. Finally, counsel for the defendant inquired of Katherine Foley, an agent with the labor board, whether the plaintiff had attempted to exercise bumping rights, to which she replied that the plaintiff had indicated that he was informed that he did not possess any such rights, and the plaintiff cross-examined Foley briefly on the matter. Furthermore, the specific term \u201cbumping rights\u201d was not defined by any of the previously mentioned witnesses, although it was explained in an exhibit admitted at trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As the trial court noted, however, there was <em>no testimony whatsoever </em>regarding whether the plaintiff would have been eligible to bump any employee or group of employees. In the absence of testimony that employees of less seniority than the plaintiff were retained following the layoff, there was no basis to determine the value or existence of any \u201cbumping rights.\u201d Clearly, therefore, the trial court in the present case did not abuse its discretion in concluding that any damages based upon lost \u201cbumping rights\u201d would be speculative, and in precluding the plaintiffs counsel from mentioning them in his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-9\"> Also named as a defendant was Professional Services Group, Inc. (Professional), a company hired by the city of Bridgeport to privatize the water pollution control authority\u2019s operations. Professional did not, however, appear in either the trial court or this court, and a default judgment for failure to appear was entered against, it on count four of the plaintiffs complaint,, which alleged breach of the contract between Professional and the city of Bridgeport, under which the plaintiff was a third party beneficiary. The trial court left the issue of the plaintiffs damages to the jury, and the jury awarded the plaintiff $50,000 damages against Professional. The judgment against Professional has not been challenged on appeal. Although the record is silent regarding the reason for Professional\u2019s absence, it is clear that, although Professional agreed to run the water pollution control authority\u2019s operations for twenty-two years, it no longer continues to do so. Hereafter, all references in this opinion to the defendant are to the water pollution control authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b715-10\"> Specifically, the plaintiff contends that he suffered discrimination in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60, which provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) It shall be a discriminatory practice in violation of this section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">\u201c(1) For an employer, by the employer or the employer\u2019s agent, except in the case of a bona fide occupational qualification or need, to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from employment any individual or to discriminate against such individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment because of the individual\u2019s race, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>color, religious creed, age, sex, marital status, national origin, ancestry, present or past history of mental disability, mental retardation, learning disability or physical disability, including, but not limited to, blindness . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">\u201c(4) For any person, employer, labor organization or employment agency to discharge, expel or otherwise discriminate against any person because such person has opposed any discriminatory employment practice or because such person has filed a complaint or testified or assisted in any proceeding under section 46a-82, 46a-83 or 46a-84 . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\"> The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeals to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\"> The plaintiffs official employment designation with the defendant was \u201cLaborer II,\u201d which the plaintiff described as \u201cshoveling dirt . . . pulling the weeds from around the building . . . digging streets, [and] digging sewers . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b717-6\"> The handwritten agreement provides in its entirety: \u201cIn settlement of [the plaintiffs pending claims] the parties agree as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">\u201c[The plaintiff] will begin work on February 3, 1997 as [s]ewage [p]lant [attendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">\u201cThe [defendant] and union will resolve the back pay issue due to [the plaintiff].
