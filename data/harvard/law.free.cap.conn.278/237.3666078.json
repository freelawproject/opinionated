The defendants, Steven P. Cordovano and Sarah M. Cordovano, appeal from the judgment of the trial court declaring such a contract to be enforceable and declining to invalidate a mechanic\u2019s hen placed on their property by the plaintiff, D\u2019Angelo Development and Construction Company. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The following facts are undisputed. In the summer of 2000, the defendants offered to purchase a parcel of land located at 134 Highland Avenue in Norwalk from Leonard D\u2019Angelo, Jr., the plaintiffs president and sole employee. D\u2019Angelo had planned to build a home on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>speculation at 134 Highland Avenue but agreed to sell the land to the defendants on the condition that they retain the plaintiff to build a home for them on that parcel. On October 30, 2000, the parties closed on the sale of 134 Highland Avenue and signed an agreement calling for the plaintiff to build a home for the defendants at that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The plaintiff had been licensed by the state as a home improvement contractor since 1994. See Home Improvement Act, General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq. Before October 30, 2000, D\u2019Angelo was unaware of the New Home Construction Contractors Act and its registration requirement for new home construction contractors. See General Statutes \u00a7 20-417d (d) (\u201c[n]o person shall ... (5) engage in the business of a new home construction contractor or hold himself or herself out as a new home construction contractor without having a current certificate of registration\u201d). Upon learning of the act on October 30, 2000,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>the plaintiff sought a certificate of registration as a new home construction contractor. The plaintiff obtained the certificate on November 2, 2000, three days after signing the contract with the defendants. The plaintiff began construction of the new home at 134 Highland Avenue only after having received the certificate of registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In July, 2002, following completion of construction and the defendants\u2019 failure to pay the total amount due under the agreement, the plaintiff filed a mechanic\u2019s lien against the property in the amount of $86,699.26.\u00ae The plaintiff then commenced an action against the defendants, asserting claims of breach of contract and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>quantum meruit, and seeking foreclosure of the mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The defendants moved to substitute a bond for the lien. They then filed an application with the court to declare the lien invalid. In support of their application, the defendants argued that the plaintiff had failed to comply with the registration,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> disclosure<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and contract language<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provisions of the act, and that its noncompliance rendered the contract between the parties unen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>forceable and the lien invalid.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Following a hearing, the trial court rendered judgment denying the defendants\u2019 application. The trial court concluded that \u201ca violation of the [act] does not relieve a party from a contractual obligation\u201d and that \u201cthe lien at issue [was] not invalid as a matter of law.\u201d The defendants appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">On appeal, the defendants renew their claim that the plaintiffs failure to comply with the act renders the contract unenforceable and the lien invalid. The defendants premise their claim on <em>Wilson Building &amp; Design Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Vanderkerckhove, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Middlesex, Docket No. CV-01-0096157 S (January 25, 2002) <em>(Wilson </em>Building), in which the court held that a new home construction contract entered into by the parties was unenforceable due to the contractor\u2019s noncompliance with the act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>contends, conversely, that the statutory text and legislative intent behind the act preclude a finding that such contracts are unenforceable. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We begin by noting that, \u201cthe general rule, upheld by the great weight of authority, [is] that no court will lend its assistance in any way toward carrying out the terms of a contract, the inherent purpose of which is to violate the law. In case any action is brought in which it is necessary to prove the illegal contract in order to maintain the action, courts will not enforce it, nor will they enforce any alleged right directly springing from such contract . . . .\u201d <em>Vaszauskas </em>v. <em>Vaszauskas, </em>115 Conn. 418, 423, 161 A. 856 (1932); accord <em>Robertson v. Stonington, </em>253 Conn. 255, 260, 750 A.2d 460 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In the present case, there is no evidence in the record to support the conclusion that the purpose of the contract was illegal. Moreover, the defendants make no allegation to that effect. Rather, it is undisputed that the plaintiff was unaware of the statutory requirements relating to new home construction contractors and, upon learning of the act on October 30, 2000, the day that the agreement was signed, it immediately sought and obtained the required certificate of registration. Furthermore, the plaintiff did not commence construction until after it had received the certificate of registration. We thus conclude that the purpose of the contract was not to violate the law but to effectuate an otherwise legal transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>We next examine the defendants\u2019 claim that the failure of the plaintiff to comply with the act renders the contract unenforceable. Because this claim raises a question of statutory interpretation, our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Parrot </em>v. <em>Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>273 Conn. 12, 18, 866 A.2d 1273 (2005). When interpreting a statute, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Perodeau </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>259 Conn. 729, 735, 792 A.2d 752 (2002). \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">We first consult the text of the act. The New Home Construction Contractors Act, which took effect on October 1, 1999, regulates the activities of new home construction contractors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The act requires a contractor to obtain a certificate of registration from the commissioner of consumer protection (commissioner) before he or she may \u201cengage in the business of new home construction or hold himself or herself out as a new home construction contractor . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-417b (a). The act also specifies the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>under which the commissioner may revoke, suspend or refuse to issue or renew a certificate of registration. See General Statutes \u00a7 20-417c. Other provisions of the act affirmatively regulate the conduct of new home construction contractors,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> prohibit new home construction contractors from engaging in certain activities<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and set forth various requirements as to the format and content of new home construction contracts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The act further provides three distinct penalties for a violation of its provisions. First, the act empowers the commissioner to impose a civil penalty on, among others, \u201cany person who engages in or practices the work for which a certificate of registration is required by [the act] . . . without having first obtained such a certificate of registration\u201d or any person who \u201cviolates any of the provisions of [the act] . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-417f. Second, the act provides that \u201cany person who violates any provision of subsection (d) of section 20-417d shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\u201d Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 20-417e. Finally, the act provides that a violation of any of its provisions \u201cshall be deemed an unfair or deceptive trade practice under subsection (a) of section 42-110b\u201d;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 20-417g; thereby exposing the violator to a private lawsuit under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Significantly, the act contains no provision addressing the <em>enforceability </em>of contracts that fail to comply with the statutory requirements. Furthermore, there is nothing in the act to suggest that its enumeration of penalties excludes all other remedies. We therefore conclude that the text of the act is ambiguous with regard to the enforceability of noncompliant contracts and turn for additional guidance to other closely related statutes regulating the home construction industry. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z (meaning of statutory provision is determined by examining text of statute itself and its relationship to other statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The Home Improvement Act was enacted in 1979; see Public Acts 1979, No. 79-606; twenty year's prior to the New Home Construction Contractors Act, to provide consumers with protection from unscrupulous home improvement contractors.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Wright Bros. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>Builders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>247 Conn. 218, 231, 720 A.2d 235 (1998) (underlying purpose of Home Improvement Act is to provide \u201cpublic with a form of consumer protection against unscrupulous home improvement contractors\u201d). Unlike the New Home Construction Contractors Act, however, the Home Improvement Act contains a provision explicitly invalidating and declaring unenforceable contracts entered into by an unregistered contractor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a) (8). It is a well established rule of statutory interpretation that, when a statute concerning one subject contains a particular provision, \u201cthe omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject . . . is significant to show that a different intention existed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>236 Conn. 710, 717, 674 A.2d 845 (1996). In the present case, the omission of any provision regarding the enforceability of noncompliant contracts from the New Home Construction Contractors Act suggests that the legislature did not intend for noncompliant new home construction contracts to be deemed invalid or unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We nevertheless conclude that the statutory scheme remains unclear. We therefore turn to an examination of the legislative genealogy of the New Home Construction Contractors Act. The act originated in 1999 as a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>posed amendment to the Home Improvement Act for the purpose of extending then existing consumer protections against unscrupulous home improvement contractors to the victims of unscrupulous new home construction contractors. See 42 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1999 Sess., p. 3309, remarks of Representative Art Feltman (likening purpose of act to that of Home Improvement Act). Because one of the penalties under the Home Improvement Act is the unenforceability of a contract entered into by an unregistered contractor, an amendment to extend the applicability of the Home Improvement Act to new home construction contractors would have subjected new home construction contractors to the same penalty. Indeed, multiple speakers at a February 4, 1999 public hearing on the bill described its purpose as \u201cbring[ing] new home contractors under the same set of regulations ... as home improvement contractors . . . .\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, General Law, Pt. 1, 1999 Sess., p. 12, remarks of Representative Arthur J. O\u2019Neill; see also id., p. 14, remarks of Attorney General Richard Blumenthal (\u201c[t]he . . . bill . . . relates to extending all of the protections that we currently provide to people who are victims of home improvement contractor fraud when they are victims of the same kind of fraud . . . involving new home construction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">During the legislative session, however, the bill was revised substantially so as to create a new chapter of the General Statutes that would be applicable only to new home construction contractors and that would leave undisturbed the provisions of the preexisting Home Improvement Act. The resulting bill, which was adopted by the House and Senate with only minor technical amendments and which subsequently was codified at General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 20-417a through 20-417j, did not include a provision invalidating or declaring unenforceable noncompliant contracts. In fact, it did not include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>any provision regarding the enforceability of non-compliant contracts. Instead, the legislature chose to adopt the comprehensive scheme of penalties previously described, which subjects violators to civil penalties, criminal liability and exposure to a private lawsuit under CUTPA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We therefore conclude from this review of the language and legislative history of the act, and the contrasting penalty provisions of the Home Improvement Act, that the legislature did not intend to render noncomplying contracts unenforceable under the New Home Construction Contractors Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We recognize that, in certain cases, this court has deemed contracts unenforceable due to a party\u2019s noncompliance with the relevant statutory requirements, notwithstanding the presence of a statutory penalty or series of penalties. See, e.g., <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>248 Conn. 769, 790-91, 731 A.2d 280 (1999); <em>Westville &amp; Hamden Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Pasqual, </em>109 Conn. 110, 115-17, 145 A. 758 (1929) (Westville). But see <em>Sagal </em>v. <em>Fylar, </em>89 Conn. 293, 297, 93 A. 1027 (1915) (statute\u2019s penalization of noncompliance by fine or imprisonment without mention of any additional penalty \u201chas frequently been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>regarded as a significant indication of a purpose that the penalty expressed should be exclusive\u201d). In none of these cases, however, has the scheme of penalties been nearly as comprehensive as that provided under the New Home Construction Contractors Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In <em>Solomon, </em>the plaintiffs, Alan M. Solomon and Mary Ellen Torneo, issued a secondary mortgage without first obtaining a license as required by the Secondary Mortgage Act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 771, 774. The named defendant, William C. Gilmore, opposed the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to foreclose the mortgage, arguing that the plaintiffs\u2019 noncompliance with the Secondary Mortgage Act rendered the resulting secondary mortgage unenforceable. See id., 771-73. The Secondary Mortgage Act calls for only administrative penalties for noncompliance with its provisions, empowering the banking commissioner to seek injunctive relief, monetary penalties, or a court order mandating restitution, or, alternatively, to issue a temporary cease and desist order. General Statutes \u00a7 36a-517 (allowing banking commissioner to proceed under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-50 and 36a-52, latter of which authorizes banking commissioner to issue temporary cease and desist order); see <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>supra, 780-81. Accordingly, we determined that enforcing a mortgage when the lender had failed to comply with the licensing requirement of the Secondary Mortgage Act would \u201cthwart the remedial object of the statute . . . .\u2019\u2019(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>supra, 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Likewise, in <em>Westville, </em>the plaintiff, Westville and Hamden Loan Company, which was licensed as a small loan company under the Small Loans Act, loaned the defendant borrowers a sum exceeding the statutory cap on such loans. <em>Westville &amp; Hamden Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Pasqual, </em>supra, 109 Conn. 113-14. The Small Loan Act penalized violations of its provisions by a fine of up to $500, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Id., 116. The plaintiff claimed that these penalties were intended to be exclusive and that the promissory note was enforceable, notwithstanding its violation of the statutory cap. See id., 115. We determined, however, that \u201c [i]f th[e] note were held to be enforceable the door would be opened wide for evasions of the legislative limitation of loans by licensees under [the Small Loans] Act\u201d; id., 116-17; and therefore determined that the note was unenforceable. Id., 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">By contrast, the present case does not involve a situation in which enforcing a noncompliant contract would thwart the purpose of the statute or invite violations thereof. The New Home Construction Contractors Act\u2019s existing penalties cumulatively are adequate to deter noncompliance with the act\u2019s provisions. See <em>Sagal </em>v. <em>Fylar, </em>supra, 89 Conn. 298. Moreover, as we previously described, the act exposes a person who violates its provisions to a private lawsuit under CUTPA. General Statutes \u00a7 20-417g. Whereas the imposition of civil or criminal penalties on a person who violates the act will not inure to the benefit of the aggrieved consumer, any consequent liability under CUTPA directly benefits the consumer and is correlated to the consumer\u2019s loss. See General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a) (permitting recovery of \u201cactual damages,\u201d as well as punitive damages, and provision of equitable relief). The act\u2019s existing scheme of multiple, cumulative and qualitatively different penalties well serves the underlying public policy of the act to protect consumers against unscrupulous new home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>construction contractors. Our conclusion that the existing statutory scheme of penalties effectuates the act\u2019s underlying public policy thus provides independent support for our conclusion that holding noncompliant contracts unenforceable under the act is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The defendants contend that, in interpreting the New Home Construction Contractors Act, this court should follow <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>215 Conn. 316, 323, 576 A.2d 455 (1990), in which we determined that a contract was unenforceable for failure of the plaintiff contractor, Barrett Builders, to comply with the written contract requirement of the Home Improvement Act. In that case, the contract omitted certain essential details regarding materials and construction as well as a completion date for performance. Id., 318. Thereafter, the defendant consumer, Rhoda Miller, refused to pay the second and third installments on the total contract price. See id., 319. The plaintiff argued that, even if the contract was unenforceable under the Home Improvement Act it should have been permitted to bring a cause of action against the defendant under a quasi contract theory because, inter alia, the statutory scheme did not prohibit recovery under such a theory. Id., 321-22. We disagreed, reasoning that the nonenforceability provision was mandatory and that to permit recovery in the manner urged by the plaintiff \u201cwould defeat and nullify the statute.\u201d Id., 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">We conclude that <em>Barrett Builders </em>is not controlling because it is legally inapposite to the present case. First, the contract in <em>Barrett Builders </em>was governed by the Home Improvement Act. The contract in the present case, however, is governed by the New Home Construction Contractors Act. As we already have explained, the Home Improvement Act contains a provision explicitly invalidating and declaring unenforceable noncompliant contracts whereas the New Home Construction Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>tractors Act does not. Second, the issue in <em>Barrett Builders </em>was the availability of quasi contractual relief in lieu of the enforcement of a concededly unenforceable contract. See id., 321-23. The issue in the present case, however, is the very unenforceability of a contract. In light of these distinctions, we conclude that the conclusion and reasoning of <em>Barrett Builders </em>are inapposite to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-11\"> Throughout this opinion, we refer to the New Home Construction Contractors Act by its full name or as the \u201cact.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\"> D\u2019Angelo learned of the act when he sought a building permit from the city of Norwalk on October 30, 2000.

Head, Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CV-01-0454381 (February 26, 2004) (finding that contractor\u2019s noncompliance with act renders construction contract unenforceable and operates as defense against contractor\u2019s attempt to foreclose mechanic\u2019s lien); <em>Hopko </em>v. <em>St. Peter, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Middlesex, Docket No. CV-02-0100039-S (November 17,2003) (concluding that contract between contractor and consumers was unenforceable because contractor had not complied with act).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Another line of Superior Court decisions, however, has found such contracts to be enforceable.

The defendants\u2019 argument, however, suffers from a fallacy of composition. The mere fact that the defendants have no recourse under the narrow rubric of the fund does not mean that they have no recourse under the broader rubric of the act as a whole. In fact, as we explain in this opinion, the act\u2019s penal and remedial scheme provides sufficient recourse to aggrieved consumers to effectuate the act\u2019s underlying public policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b269-6\"> When the plaintiffs issued the mortgage in <em>Solomon, </em>the Secondary Mortgage Act provided in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall engage in the secondary mortgage loan business in this state as a lender or a broker unless such person has obtained a license under this chapter.
