The defendant, Enrique Martinez, appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of attempted murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 53a-54a (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 \u00a7 53a48(a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 53a-54a (a), assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>92 (a) (2) (C).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict, and we reverse the judgment of conviction on the attempted murder, assault and kidnapping charges, and remand the case for a new trial on those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In July, 2003, the Bridgeport police arrested the victim, Omar Betancourt, an admitted crack dealer, on numerous narcotics charges. At that time, the victim already had assault, narcotics and trespassing charges pending against him, and he became concerned about his increased exposure to a lengthy term of incarceration as a result of the new charges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He, therefore, attempted to reduce his exposure by offering to the police the name of the defendant, a fellow merchant of narcotics from whom the victim had purchased ecstasy pills in the preceding year. In exchange for the police releasing him pursuant to a promise to appear with respect to the new narcotics charges, the victim then contacted the defendant and arranged to purchase unspecified drugs from him at the intersection of Sanford Place and Washington Avenue in Bridgeport. Thereafter, the police and the victim went to that location; when the police saw the defendant\u2019s car, a black Honda Accord, they stopped it for various traffic violations, and then arrested the defendant on various narcotics charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Several days later, on the afternoon of July 15, 2003, the victim went to the probation office in Bridgeport to report for an appointment with his probation officer. At the probation office, he met the defendant, who also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>had an appointment there. The two men spoke, and left together in the defendant\u2019s car to go \u201croll up a cigar\u201d with marijuana, presumably intending to smoke it. After purchasing a cigar, they picked up the defendant\u2019s cousin, Valerie Bermudez, and went to a house located at Caroline Avenue and Bamum Avenue in Bridgeport.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Once they arrived at the house, the defendant accused the victim of setting him up with the police, and \u201csmack[ed] [him] around\u201d with the handle of a knife. The defendant then took the victim to a bedroom that was occupied by two pit bulls. Shortly thereafter, the victim escaped from the bedroom by jumping out a second story window, fracturing his wrist in the process. As the victim attempted to flee the area by commandeering a car on Bamum Avenue, the defendant blocked that car with his own vehicle, and took him back to the house where the defendant and two other men tied him up in the basement with ropes and shackles. Subsequently, Bermudez and another man, Alex Gonzalez, untied the victim and, holding him at gunpoint with a chrome .45 caliber semiautomatic pistol, brought him upstairs, where the defendant told him that he would bring him home.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The defendant and Gonzalez, however, brought the victim to a house on Iranistan Avenue where they put him in the garage until approximately 5 a.m., the following morning, at which point the defendant said that he would take the victim home. After they drove toward the victim\u2019s home on Chestnut Street, the defendant, the victim and Gonzalez walked into a nearby backyard where another man, who had tattoos on both forearms and had his face covered by a towel, suddenly appeared, pointed a gun at the victim, and fired. The gun, however, jammed, and all three assailants began to struggle with the victim. As the victim worked free and began to run away, he looked back and saw the defendant with a gun, which was the same chrome gun previously used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>by Gonzalez. The defendant then shot the victim in the leg, and joined the other two assailants in beating him while he was on the ground.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> One of the three men then shot the victim in the abdomen.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The three assailants then fled the scene. The defendant\u2019s flight from the scene was witnessed by several neighborhood residents, including the victim\u2019s sister, who knew the defendant through his drug related activities. The police subsequently apprehended the defendant later that day following a chase that ended when the defendant drove his car into a tree.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The state charged the defendant with one count of attempted murder in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-54 (a), one count of conspiracy to commit murder in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-54a (a), one count of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), one count of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (C), one count of carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a), and one count of criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217 (a) (1). In the second part of the information, the state also charged the defendant with one count of commission of an offense while released on bond in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40b.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thereafter, the case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>tried to the jury, which returned a verdict of guilty on all counts except for the firearms charges, and found that the defendant had committed those offenses while out on bond in violation of \u00a7 53a-40b.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court then sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of seventy-eight years imprisonment, and rendered judgment accordingly. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that he was denied his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> because the trial court did not instruct the jury that it was required to agree unanimously on whether the factual basis for a guilty verdict on the attempted murder, assault and kidnapping charges was as a coconspirator under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> as opposed to a princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>pal or an accessory, and further \u201ccompounded the harm\u201d by expressly instructing the jury that it need not be unanimous as to the theory underlying the defendant\u2019s guilt. The defendant claims that a separate unanimity instruction was required because <em>Pinkerton </em>liability is conceptually distinct from accessorial liability, which, under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 (a),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is statutorily equivalent to principal liability, because the former calls for proof of an agreement, while the latter requires proof of a specific mental state and an act.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In response, the state contends that the trial court properly instructed the jury because not requiring unanimity as to whether <em>Pinkerton </em>liability has been established is a logical extension of this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Correa, </em>241 Conn. 322, 348, 696 A.2d 944 (1997), in which we rejected a defendant\u2019s claim that the state constitution requires a jury verdict to be unanimous as to whether it is predicated on a theoiy of either principal or accessorial liability. The state also contends that our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 45-46, 630 A.2d 990 (1993), \u201cstrongly suggests that principal, accessorial, and <em>Pinkerton </em>liability are not conceptually distinct from one another, but are, in fact, different ways to commit the same crime,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he line distinguishing accessoiy liability and <em>Pinkerton </em>liability is almost nonexistent . . . .\u201d We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">We begin with a review of the jury instructions at issue in the present case. After explaining the various bases for criminal liability, specifically principal, accessory or coconspirator liability under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, the trial court stated: \u201cPrincipal, accessory, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>coconspiratorial liability are merely different means of committing a single crime. <em>Therefore, you need not be unanimous in your verdict as to a theory of liability. </em>You must, however, be unanimous in your verdict that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt or not guilty of the crime charged.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court then instructed the jury in a like manner in the context of the specific offenses charged, stating, for example, in the context of the attempted murder charge: \u201cIf you find that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime of attempt to commit murder, either as a principal or as an accessory or as a coconspirator, you should find . . . the defendant guilty of attempt to commit murder. As I have said, a person is guilty of a crime either because he is a principal offender or he is an accessory or he is a coconspirator. An accessory or coconspirator is guilty just as if he were the principal offender. <em>It is not necessary, however, that you unanimously agree whether the defendant committed the crime of attempt to commit murder either as the principal or as an accessory or as a coconspirator.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\u201cIn other words, you need not in your deliberations decide who fired the shot which injured [the victim]. Rather, the issue before you is whether the defendant is guilty of the crime of attempt to commit murder as charged either as [a] principal or as an accessory or as [a] coconspirator in accordance with these instructions. <em>You need not be unanimous as to any one theory of liability. You must, however, be unanimous as to whether the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt or not guilty of the crime charged. </em>If you unanimously find that the elements constituting the crime of attempt to commit murder, either as [a] principal or as an accessory or as a coconspirator, have been proven by the state beyond a reasonable doubt you should find the defendant guilty of the crime of attempt to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>murder.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The defendant properly preserved this instructional claim for appellate review by taking an exception at trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>261 Conn. 156, 171, 801 A.2d 788 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>In reviewing claims of instructional error, we seek to determine \u201cwhether it was . . . reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions . . . [and] the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding [it] to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied ... is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice wall result. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . we will not view the instructions as improper.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sorabella, </em>277 Conn. 155, 195, 891 A.2d 897 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Moreover, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>219 Conn. 605, 619-20, 595 A.2d 306 (1991), we articulated the \u201cmultipartite test\u201d for determining whether a specific unanimity charge is required \u201cto be given in [a] case in which criminal liability may be premised on the violation of one of several alternative subsections of a statute. . . . We first review the instruction that was given to determine whether the trial court has sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict. If such an instruction has not been given, that ends the matter. Even if the instructions at trial can be read to have sanctioned such a nonunanimous verdict, however, we will remand for a new trial only if (1) there is a conceptual distinction between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>alternative acts with which the defendant has been charged, and (2) the state has presented evidence to support each alternative act with which the defendant has been charged.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See also, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>238 Conn. 784, 793-94, 680 A.2d 1306 (1996) (applying <em>Fam</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number><em>iglietti </em>and concluding that specific unanimity instruction not required with respect to alternate theories of accessory liability under \u00a7 53a-8 [a] because they are not \u201cconceptually distinct,\u201d but rather are \u201cslightly different characterizations that can be given the defendant\u2019s particular conduct, all of which make a defendant an accessory to a crime\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>226 Conn. 618, 647-49, 629 A.2d 1067 (1993) (applying <em>Famiglietti </em>to conclude unanimity instruction not required because threat of force and use of force are not conceptually distinct with respect to compelled sexual intercourse for purposes of sexual assault in first degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70); <em>State </em>v. <em>Benite, </em>6 Conn. App. 667, 675, 507 A.2d 478 (1986) (\u201c[t]he determination of whether actions are conceptually distinct must be made with reference to the purpose behind the proposed charge: to ensure that the jurors are in unanimous agreement as to what conduct the defendant committed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The trial court\u2019s instructions in the present case satisfy the threshold requirement under <em>Famiglietti, </em>namely, that the trial court included in its instructions language \u201cexpressly sanctioning\u201d a nonunanimous ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>dict. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 419, 832 A.2d 14 (2003). Accordingly, we now seek to determine whether there is a \u201cconceptual distinction between the alternative acts with which the defendant has been charged . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 619-20. This analysis requires a review of the distinctions between the accessorial and coconspiratorial bases for vicarious criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We turn, therefore, to <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>263 Conn. 478, 491-93, 820 A.2d 1024 (2003), wherein we comprehensively discussed \u201cour case law applying the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine. This court first explicitly adopted the <em>Pinkerton </em>principle of vicarious liability for purposes of our state criminal law in <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>[supra, 227 Conn. 32]. Under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, which, as of the date of our decision in <em>Walton, </em>was \u2018a recognized part of federal criminal conspiracy jurisprudence\u2019; id., 43; \u2018a conspirator may be held liable for criminal offenses committed by a coconspirator that are within the scope of the conspiracy, are in furtherance of it, and are reasonably foreseeable as a necessary or natural consequence of the conspiracy.\u2019 Id., citing <em>Pinkerton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[328 U.S. 640, 647-48, 66 S. Ct. 1180, 90 L. Ed. 1489 (1946)]. The rationale for the principle is that, when \u2018the conspirator [has] played a necessary part in setting in motion a discrete course of criminal conduct, he should be held responsible, within appropriate limits, for the crimes committed as a natural and probable result of that course of conduct.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">\u201cWe concluded in <em>Walton </em>that the <em>Pinkerton </em>principle was applicable in state criminal cases, reasoning, \u2018first, that <em>Pinkerton </em>liability is not inconsistent with our penal code and, therefore, that we were not prohibited from recognizing that theory of criminal liability as a matter of state common law. See General Statutes \u00a7 53[a]-4. Without foreclosing the use of the <em>Pinkerton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>doctrine in other circumstances, we then concluded that application of the doctrine was appropriate in <em>Walton, </em>in which [1] the defendant was a leader of the conspiracy, [2] the offense for which vicarious liability was sought to be imposed was an object of the conspiracy and [3] the offense was proved by one or more of the overt acts alleged in support of the conspiracy charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, [227 Conn.] 44-46, 50-51.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>[237 Conn. 518, 526-27, 679 A.2d 902 (1996)].</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 518, we were required to \u2018decide whether to extend the principle of vicarious liability that we adopted in <em>Walton </em>to a case in which not all of [the three <em>Walton] </em>conditions have been met, a question that we expressly reserved in <em>Walton.\u2019 </em>Id., 527. In <em>Diaz, </em>the defendant had been convicted of, inter alia, murder under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine and conspiracy to commit murder. Id., 519-20. The evidence showed that the defendant, along with several other individuals, had fired multiple gunshots into a motor vehicle occupied by the victim and three others. Id., 522-23 and n.7. The victim was struck and killed by a single bullet. Id., 523. The defendant claimed on appeal that the court\u2019s instruction under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine had been improper because, among other reasons, it was broader than the limited version of the doctrine recognized in <em>Walton. </em>Id., 525-26. This court acknowledged that the state had not proved that the defendant was the leader of the conspiracy to ambush the vehicle and its occupants and, thus, had not established the first condition for <em>Pinkerton </em>liability set forth in <em>Walton. </em>Id., 529. We noted, however, that \u2018the evidence reasonably established that the defendant was a fully engaged member of the conspiracy who had actively participated in the shooting and that he, along with his coconspirators, intended to kill one or more of the vehicle\u2019s passengers.\u2019 Id. We concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u2018where . . . the defendant was a full partner in the illicit venture and the coconspirator conduct for which the state has sought to hold him responsible was integral to the achievement of the conspiracy\u2019s objectives, the defendant cannot reasonably complain that it is unfair to hold him vicariously liable, under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, for such criminal conduct.\u2019 Id. We further concluded that <em>'Pinkerton </em>liability may be imposed even if none of the three <em>Walton </em>conditions is present.\u2019 . . . Id., 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">\u201cWe also acknowledged, however, that \u2018there may be occasions when it would be unreasonable to hold a defendant criminally liable for offenses committed by his coconspirators even though the state has demonstrated technical compliance with the <em>Pinkerton </em>rule. . . . For example, a factual scenario may be envisioned in which the nexus between the defendant\u2019s role in the conspiracy and the illegal conduct of a coconspirator is so attenuated or remote, notwithstanding the fact that the latter\u2019s actions were a natural consequence of the unlawful agreement, that it would be unjust to hold the defendant responsible for the criminal conduct of his coconspirator. In such a case, a <em>Pinkerton </em>charge would not be appropriate.\u2019 . . . Id., 530.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">In <em>Coltherst, </em>we further extended the application of <em>Pinkerton </em>to a situation wherein the defendant himself did not have the level of intent required by the substantive offense for which he was charged, specifically, intentional murder. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 499-500. The defendant in that case had participated in a carjacking wherein he and a coconspirator kidnapped and robbed the victim. Id., 485. After the carjackers had pulled over to the side of the road and discharged the victim, one of the defendant\u2019s coconspirators shot the victim at point blank range while the defendant remained in the car. Id. We concluded that, \u201cthe <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine constitutionally may be, and, as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>of state policy, should be, applied in cases in which the defendant did not have the level of intent required by the substantive offense with which he was charged. The rationale for the doctrine is to deter collective criminal agreement and to protect the public from its inherent dangers by holding conspirators responsible for the natural and probable \u2014 not just the intended\u2014 results of their conspiracy. . . . This court previously has recognized that [combination in crime makes more likely the commission of crimes unrelated to the original purpose for which the group was formed. In sum, the danger which a conspiracy generates is not confined to the substantive offense which is the immediate aim of the enterprise. ... In other words, one natural and probable result of a criminal conspiracy is the commission of originally unintended crimes. When the defendant has played a necessary part in setting in motion a discrete course of criminal conduct ... he cannot reasonably complain that it is unfair to hold him vicariously liable, under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, for the natural and probable results of that conduct that, although he did not intend, he should have foreseen. The defendant in this case makes no claim that the nexus between his involvement in the conspiracy and [the coconspirator\u2019s] murder of the victim was so attenuated or remote . . . that it would be unjust to hold the defendant responsible for the criminal conduct of his coconspirator.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 498-99. We further concluded that <em>Pinker</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number><em>ton </em>liability could be the predicate for convictions of both intentional murder and capital felony. Id., 501-502.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In contrast, accessorial liability, although also vicarious in nature, differs from <em>Pinkerton </em>liability with respect to the mental state required. Unlike coconspirator liability under <em>Pinkerton, </em>which is predicated on an agreement to participate in the conspiracy, and requires the substantive offense to be a reasonably foreseeable product of that conspiracy; see, e.g., id., 491; accessorial liability pursuant to \u00a7 53a-8 requires the defendant to have the specific mental state required for the commission of the substantive crime. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 (a) (\u201c[a] person, <em>acting with the mental state required, for commission of an offense, </em>who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender\u201d [emphasis added]); see also, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>271 Conn. 338, 435, 857 A.2d 808 (2004) (Rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim that accessorial liability under \u00a7 53a-8 may not be used to prove aggravating factors necessary for the imposition of the death penalty because \u201c[b]y its express terms, the statute provides that a person may be prosecuted and punished as the principal without actually committing the offense himself. . . . [T]he defendant\u2019s proffered interpretation would vitiate one of the clearly stated, overarching purposes of the statute, i.e., the punishment of a person as if he were the principal, when, with the requisite mental state, he solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids the person who physically committed the crime.\u201d), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 845, 126 S. Ct. 94, 163 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2005). The overlapping mental state requirement is why, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 348, we rejected the claim that, \u201cthe defendant has a right under the Connecticut constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>tion that the jury unanimously agrees on his liability as a principal or an accessory in his commission of a capital felony.\u201d In so concluding, we noted that \u201c[s]uch a rule would lead to absurd results where, as here, the jury disagreed only about the defendant\u2019s exact role in the murders and there was ample evidence that he had intended the two victims to be killed. Our decision is, at its core, necessary and \u2018indispensable in a system that requires a unanimous jury verdict to convict.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Schad </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>501 U.S. 624, 651, 111 S. Ct. 2491, 115 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Our recent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>276 Conn. 452, 886 A.2d 777 (2005), is particularly instructive regarding the conceptual differences between <em>Pinkerton </em>and accessorial liability. In <em>Patterson, </em>we concluded that General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> which provides for a mandatory sentence enhancement as a consequence for the use or threatened use of a firearm in connection with the commission of a class A, B or C felony, does not permit the enhancement of a defendant\u2019s sentence solely on the basis that \u201cone of the defendant\u2019s coconspirators had used a firearm during the commission of the offense . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Id., 474; see also id., 478 (\u201c[w]e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>disagree with the state, however, that, for purposes of \u00a7 53-202k, the possession of a firearm by one coconspirator is attributable to other coconspirators\u201d). In so concluding, we rejected the state\u2019s rebanee on <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>255 Conn. 782, 792-93, 772 A.2d 559 (2001), in which we concluded that \u201can unarmed accomplice to a class A, B or C felony may be found to have violated \u00a7 53-202k on the basis of his or her accomplice\u2019s use of a firearm.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 479. We rejected the state\u2019s argument that we should apply the doctrine of <em>Pinkerton </em>liability to extend the holding of <em>Davis </em>to unarmed coconspirators. Id., 479-80. We concluded that \u201c[t]he state\u2019s claim fails because the rationale underlying our determination in <em>Davis </em>regarding vicarious accomplice liability for purposes of \u00a7 53-202k does not support the state\u2019s contention regarding vicarious coconspirator liability under \u00a7 53-202k.\u201d Id., 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We also rejected the state\u2019s reliance on \u201cour observation in <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>[supra, 263 Conn. 494], that <em>'Pinkerton </em>rests on the same principles as those governing accessory babibty, which allow conduct to be imputed to a defendant ... . .\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 482. We first concluded that, strictly construed in the defendant\u2019s favor, and based on the timing of the statute\u2019s enactment as juxtaposed with developing criminal case law, the legislature could not have contemplated that <em>Pinkerton </em>liability would apply to \u00a7 53-202k.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Id., 483. More significantly with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>to the present case, we also stated that, \u201calthough it is true that the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine and accessory liability both are predicated on the concept of vicarious liability, there is a significant difference between the two principles. For example, accessorial liability is not a distinct crime, but only an alternative means by which a substantive crime may be committed .... Consequently, to establish a person\u2019s culpability as an accessory to a particular offense, the state must prove that the accessory, like the principal, had committed each and every element of the offense. ... By contrast, under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, a conspirator may be found guilty of a crime that he or she did not commit if the state can establish that a coconspirator did commit the crime and that the crime was within the scope of the conspiracy, in furtherance of the conspiracy, and a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conspiracy. ... In view of the important difference between accessory liability and <em>Pinkerton </em>liability, we reject the state\u2019s contention that we should treat them similarly for the purpose of determining whether the legislature intended to incorporate the latter into \u00a7 53-202k.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. We, therefore, vacated the sentence enhancement applied to the defendant in <em>Patterson. </em>Id., 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Our recent decision in <em>Patterson </em>makes abundantly clear that accessory liability and coconspiratorial liability, although both relate to vicarious liability principles generally, are conceptually distinct ways to commit a crime.

This argument is, at first glance, appealing both on the factual record of this case and in the context of our more general harmless error jurisprudence. It is, however, inconsistent with the approach that we follow in the limited context of <em>State v.

This well established formulation does not, therefore, contemplate a harmless error analysis if both prongs are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Indeed, the second prong of <em>Famiglietti </em>is reflective of prior decisions finding harmless error with respect to improper unanimity instructions if the evidence on the record supported a finding that the defendant had committed only one of the alternative acts charged, because that would eliminate the potential for jury confusion or disagreement as to what the defendant actually did. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Mancinone, </em>15 Conn. App. 251, 277, 278-79, 545 A.2d 1131 (1988), cert. denied, 209 Conn. 818, 551 A.2d 757, cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1017, 109 S. Ct. 1132, 103 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1989), a risk of injury case based on allegations that the defendant had given teenage girls alcohol and marijuana, and had engaged in sexual conduct with them, \u201cany error committed by the court in neglecting to give a specific unanimity instruction was rendered harmless by the jury\u2019s verdict\" that acquitted the defendant on all other charged sexual assault counts, which meant that \u201cwe can only conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict on the two counts of risk of injury must have been based, not on the evidence of sexual activity, but on the evidence of providing the victims with alcohol and marijuana. Under these circumstances, therefore, the risk of lack of jury unanimity . . . did not materialize.\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>10 Conn. App. 503, 513-14, 524 A.2d 648 (concluding that two types of conduct leading to liability under burglary statute, namely, \u201cunlawfully remaining\u201d or \u201cunlawfully entering,\u201d are \u201cconceptually different,\u201d but that failure to give specific unanimity instruction was harmless error because there was \u201cno evidence introduced by either the state or the defendant, that the defendant had lawfully entered the [victim\u2019s] home, yet unlawfully remained\u201d), cert. denied, 204 Conn. 808, 528 A.2d 1155 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Thus, without actually saying so, the state appears to be asking us to overrule this aspect of <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 619-20, in favor of a variant of the rule followed in Colorado, which is that, \u201cthe jury could return a general verdict of guilty on a single count alleged to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>occurred under alternative theories without depriving the defendant of the right to a unanimous verdict. However, each theory presented had to be supported by sufficient evidence. If there were insufficient evidence of any alternative theory, the general verdict had to be set aside.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>60 P.3d 728, 733 (Colo. App. 2003). The harmless error analysis applied in <em>Hall </em>is, however, inapposite here because, unlike Connecticut; see footnote 18 of this opinion; Colorado follows the majority rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>173 N.Y. 122, 127, 65 N.E. 989 (1903), under which jury unanimity is required only with respect to the \u201cultimate issue\u201d of guilt or innocence. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 731 (\u201c[t]he jury was only required to reach a unanimous verdict on the charge of first degree murder, not as to the alternative theories offered in support of the charge\u201d). In the absence of an explicit request, accompanied by adequate briefing demonstrating a compelling reason to do so, stare decisis demands that we leave the <em>Famiglietti </em>rule undisturbed. See, e.g., <em>Waterbury v. Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 538, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002) (\u201c[t]he doctrine of stare decisis counsels that a court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b640-13\"> We note that the defendant does not raise a separate claim on appeal with respect to the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s instruction on the conspiracy to commit murder charge. Accordingly, we need not disturb that aspect of the judgment of conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
