App. 681, 858 A.2d 827 (2004). The sole issue in this appeal is whether the Appellate Court properly rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s instruction misled the jury by allowing it to find the defendant guilty of conduct that is not a cognizable crime. Id., 701. We answer that question in the negative, and, accordingly, we reverse the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The record reveals the following procedural history. The state charged the defendant in a three count, long form information. The first count of the information charged the defendant with burglary in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2) on August 5, 2000, at approximately 3 a.m. at 163-4 Mark Lane in Waterbury. Specifically, the state alleged that the defendant had entered \u201cunlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein and in the course of committing the offense, he intentionally inflicted or attempted to inflict bodily injury on [Stephen] Alseph . . . .\u201d The second count of the information charged the defendant with attempt to commit assault in the first degree in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-59 (a) (4),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> specifically alleging that on the same date the defendant had entered 163-4 Mark Lane at approximately 3 a.m. \u201cwith intent to cause serious physical injury to another person and while aided by two other persons actually present, intentionally did an act which under the circumstances as he believed them to be, constituted a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in an assault in the first degree . . . [by attempting] to cause serious physical injury to [Stephen] Alseph while aided by two other persons actually present . . . The third count charged the defendant with attempt to commit assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-59 (a) (1); see footnote 2 of this opinion; alleging that on the same date and at the same location the defendant had entered the premises at approximately 3 a.m. \u201cwith intent to cause serious physical injury to another person by means of a dangerous instrument [and] did an act which under the circumstances as he believed them to be, constituted a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in an assault in the first degree ... [by attempting] to cause serious physical injury by means of a dangerous instrument to [Stephen] Alseph.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the two counts of attempt to commit assault in the first degree, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>but returned a verdict of guilty on the first degree burglary count. The trial court declared a mistrial on the two attempted assault counts and rendered judgment of conviction on the burglary count in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court claiming, inter alia, that the trial court\u2019s instructions improperly had allowed the jury to find the defendant guilty if it found that he had entered Stephen Alseph\u2019s apartment with the intent to commit an attempted assault. <em>State </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>supra, 85 Conn. App. 698. The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction. Id., 706. Thereafter, we granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction on the charge of burglary in the first degree did not mislead the jury?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>272 Conn. 910, 863 A.2d 703 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The Appellate Court opinion recites the following evidence presented to the jury. \u201cOn the night of August 4, 2000, the defendant went to the Malibu Club (club) in Waterbury, as did Stephen Alseph. Sometime later, [Stephen] Alseph\u2019s wife, Keisha Alseph, arrived at the club with her friends, Chantel Paris and Tierra Mourning. At closing time, approximately 2 a.m. on August 5, 2000, Stephen Alseph had an argument with Paris and Mourning in the parking lot of the club. Keisha Alseph left the club in the company of Paris and Mourning. Stephen Alseph left the club alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\u201cKeisha Alseph and her friends arrived at the parking lot adjacent to the apartment at 163-4 Mark Lane about the same time Stephen Alseph did. Another argument ensued, and Paris struck Stephen Alseph on the head with a beer bottle, causing a small cut. Paris and Mourning got into their vehicle and left. The Alsephs entered their apartment and prepared for bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\u201cApproximately thirty minutes later, they heard a loud bang at the front door. Three men entered the bedroom and assaulted Stephen Alseph. One of the men struck him on the head with a lamp, causing him to fall onto the bed, bleeding. Keisha Alseph attempted to protect her husband as the three men continued to beat him. After making reference to \u2018some girl,\u2019 the three men left the apartment. Stephen Alseph grabbed a knife and chased them. The men saw him, and one of them said, \u2018He\u2019s coming back for more.\u2019 When they saw the knife, the men got into an automobile and sped away. Stephen Alseph chased the vehicle on foot for a distance, and he saw Paris and Mourning driving away from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u201cStephen Alseph returned to his apartment where his wife was waiting. The police arrived about five minutes later. The police found Stephen Alseph bleeding from the arms, face and head. Keisha Alseph had cuts on her stomach and arms. Stephen Alseph was taken to St. Mary\u2019s Hospital where he received sutures for his head wound. Keisha Alseph informed the police that the defendant was one of the three assailants. She recognized him because he had worked with one of her cousins at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant. She also implicated Paris and Mourning.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">\u201cA short while later, the police received a telephone call from Victoria Vasquez, the defendant\u2019s former girlfriend. Vasquez informed the police that at approximately 2:45 a.m., she began receiving telephone calls from the defendant. She said that he had called and immediately hung up. Vasquez stopped answering the telephone, and the defendant left messages on her answering machine to \u2018stop playing games\u2019 because he was \u2018in trouble and needed her help.\u2019 The defendant arrived at Vasquez\u2019 home about fifteen minutes later. Vasquez refused to let the defendant inside because she was afraid of him and had a protective order against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>him. The defendant left. Vasquez informed the police that she thought that the defendant had returned to an address on Wall Street [in Waterbury] from which his telephone calls had originated.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u201cThe police went to 72 Wall Street and found the defendant and his cousin, Devon Hicks, hiding under a bed in the first floor apartment. The defendant identified himself as Thomas Flowers. The police separately transported Keisha Alseph and Stephen Alseph to the Wall Street apartment to identify the two men who had been found hiding there. Keisha Alseph and Stephen Alseph identified the defendant and Hicks as two of the men who had assaulted them that night. They did not waver in their identification of the defendant, whom they also identified at trial. The defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u201cA few days after his arrest, the defendant met with Vasquez at a commuter parking lot in Cheshire with assistance from Hicks. The defendant wanted to know why Vasquez had called the police. The defendant and Vasquez met again on February 13, 2001, the day before Vasquez was to report to the office of the state\u2019s attorney pursuant to a subpoena issued in the case against Hicks. The defendant asked Vasquez to lie for him, to tell the police that he was on foot that night and that he was with her at the time of the burglary. Vasquez initially agreed to the defendant\u2019s request because she was trying to work things out with him for the sake of their child. Five months later, however, Vasquez told the prosecutor that the defendant had come to her house in a light colored automobile and that he had not been with her earlier [on the evening of the burglary], The defendant subsequently telephoned Vasquez and threatened her not to testify against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u201cThe defendant testified at trial to establish his alibi that he was not present during the break-in. He testified that he had been at the club on the night in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>and had witnessed a disturbance in the parking lot. According to the defendant, someone had sprayed Mace, which got into his eyes. He and Hicks then went to the home of his friend, Stephen Gyadu, located at 72 Wall Street, to wash his face. He telephoned Vasquez to ask her for a ride because Hicks had fallen asleep. Because Vasquez would not talk to him, he walked to her house. He walked back to [72] Wall Street and lay down on the floor next to Hicks\u2019 bed. The defendant denied assaulting Stephen Alseph and also denied giving the police a false name.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>supra, 85 Conn. App. 685-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">After the jury found the defendant guilty of burglary in the first degree; see footnote 1 of this opinion; the defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that, pursuant to the trial court\u2019s instructions, in order to find the defendant guilty of burglary in the first degree, the jury would have to have found that, when he unlawfully entered the building, the defendant had intended to commit the inchoate crime of attempted assault.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant claimed that, by charging that the state had to prove that the defendant unlawfully had entered the building with the intent to commit an attempted assault, the court, in effect, charged the jury that to convict the defendant it had to prove that he unlawfully had entered the premises intending only to attempt an assault, but not to complete it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>supra, 85 Conn. App. 700-701. Thus, the defendant contended that the trial court\u2019s instruction would have permitted the jury to convict the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>dant even if he had no intent to commit the underlying crime of assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Although the defendant had not raised that claim before the trial court, the Appellate Court concluded that the unpreserved claim could be reviewed under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but that it must be rejected. <em>State </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>supra, 85 Conn. App. 705. That court reasoned that it was not reasonably possible that the juiy had been misled by the instruction under the facts of the case. Id., 705-706. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">On appeal to this court, the defendant contends that the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment was improper because the trial court instructed the jury on a theory of liability that is not cognizable. He contends that, because the trial court improperly had instructed the jury<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>could find the defendant guilty based on conduct that did not constitute a crime, his judgment of conviction should be reversed. Echoing the dissent from the Appellate Court opinion; see id., 706-708 <em>(Flynn, J., </em>dissenting); the defendant contends that, because of the trial court\u2019s improper instructions, which twice told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>the jury that the crime the defendant had intended to commit when he entered the Alsephs\u2019 apartment illegally was attempted assault, it was reasonably possible that the jury had been misled to conclude that it could find the defendant guilty on the basis of a legal impossibility, namely, intent to commit an attempted (i.e., incomplete) assault. We agree that the jury charge impermissibly expanded the legal standard under which the defendant could have been convicted of burglary in the first degree, and, accordingly, we reverse the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">We begin with our well settled standards by which we review the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury. \u201cIt is . . . constitutionally axiomatic that the jury be instructed on the essential elements of a crime charged. . . . The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment [to the United States constitution] protects an accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. . . . Consequently, the failure to instruct a jury on an element of a crime deprives a defendant of the right to have the jury told what crimes he is actually being tried for and what the essential elements of those crimes are.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>235 Conn. 477, 483-84, 668 A.2d 682 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">If an improper jury instruction is of constitutional magnitude, \u201cthe burden is on the state to prove harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spillane, </em>255 Conn. 746, 757, 770 A.2d 898 (2001). \u201cAn alleged defect in a jury charge which raises a constitutional question is reversible error if it is reasonably possible that, considering the charge as a whole, the jury was misled. ... In performing harmless error analysis, we keep in mind that [i]n determining whether it was indeed reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Finally, \u201ca jury instruction that improperly omits an essential element from the charge constitutes harmless error if a reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was <em>uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence, </em>such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>254 Conn. 694, 738, 759 A.2d 995 (2000), quoting <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 17, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Before addressing what is at issue in this case, it is useful to identify what is not at issue. First, the state does not dispute that it would be improper to allow the jury to find the defendant guilty of burglary if it found that he had entered the apartment not intending to complete a crime therein, but rather intending just to attempt to commit a crime. In other words, the state does not contest that a theory of liability requiring a finding that the defendant intended an unintentional result from his conduct is not cognizable. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Beccia, </em>199 Conn. 1, 4, 505 A.2d 683 (1986) (conspiracy to commit arson in third degree not cognizable because arson requires reckless mental state); <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda, </em>189 Conn. 303, 307, 455 A.2d 1326 (1983) (attempted manslaughter not cognizable because not possible to have specific intent to commit unintentional killing), on appeal after remand, 196 Conn. 507, 493 A.2d 890 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>(1985);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosswell, </em>223 Conn. 243, 263, 612 A.2d 1174 (1992) (\u201cpersons cannot attempt or conspire to commit an offense that requires an unintended result\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Second, the state does not challenge the defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court did in fact provide such an improper instruction. Third, the state does not challenge that the first two prongs of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239, were satisfied, thus permitting review of this unpreserved claim. See footnote 4 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Rather, the state\u2019s response to the defendant\u2019s claimed impropriety is that, despite any impropriety in the trial court\u2019s instructions, it is not likely that they had an effect on the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>272 Conn. 432, 447, 862 A.2d 817 (2005) (recognizing that reviewing court considers effect of charge on jury rather than component parts). Essentially, the state contends that it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the instruction because of the trial court\u2019s subsequent correct statement of the law. According to the state, although \u201cthe court did instruct the jury that the state had to prove that the defendant entered the [Alsephs\u2019] apartment with the intent to commit the crime of attempted assault, the court\u2019s last statement to the jury on this issue was that any crime, felony or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>misdemeanor, other than the crime of burglary was sufficient to satisfy the intent requirement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> . . . This final, proper instruction, which conformed with the offense as charged in the long-form information, cleared up any confusion caused by the court\u2019s earlier charge.\u201d See footnote 5 of this opinion (setting forth relevant portion of jury instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Additionally, the state points to its closing arguments to the jury, which focused on Keisha Alseph\u2019s beliefs that her Mends, Paris and Mourning, had set up the burglary and the assault of her husband and that, when the defendant and the other two assailants entered the Alsephs\u2019 apartment, they had a commonality of purpose and were intending to inflict serious physical injury on Stephen Alseph. Finally, the state contends that the jury was not misled by the trial court\u2019s improper instructions because both an attempt to commit an assault and a completed assault require that the actor intended to bring about the elements of the completed assault. Therefore, according to the state, either way, the jury knew it had to find that the defendant had intended to assault Stephen Alseph.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">We disagree with the state that it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled. Intentional conduct is defined as conduct \u201cwith respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense when [a person\u2019s] conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11). Thus, to be guilty of attempt, a defendant\u2019s conscious objective must be to cause the result that would constitute the substantive crime. A person cannot, however, attempt to commit a crime that requires that an unintended result occur. In other words, a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>son cannot be charged with entering a building intending the specific result of failing to commit a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In this case, when the trial court instructed the jury on the element of intent in connection with the charge of burglary, it told the jury that it had to decide whether \u201cthe unlawful entry was [effected or occurred with the defendant\u2019s intent to commit a crime in the building. Here the crime being attempted [was] assault in the first degree.\u201d This statement was soon thereafter reinforced when the court reminded the jury that to find the defendant guilty it had to find \u201cthat the unlawful entry was [effected or occurred with the defendant\u2019s intent to commit a crime in that building, and I said that the specific crime is attempted assault . . . .\u201d The court never corrected those statements. The only other guidance the court provided to the jury was that, when he entered the Alsephs\u2019 apartment, the defendant had to have an intent to commit a crime, a felony or a misdemeanor, other than the crime of burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In essence, by charging that the state had to prove that the defendant unlawfully entered the building with the intent to commit an attempted assault, the court charged the juiy that the state had to prove that the defendant \u201cunlawfully entered the premises intending only to attempt an assault but not to complete it. Thus, the defendant would have had no intent actually to commit the underlying crime of assault and, therefore, he did not enter the building with the intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>supra, 85 Conn. App. 707 <em>(Flynn, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">\u201cWe repeatedly have stated that [t]he jury [is] presumed to follow the court\u2019s directions in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ancona, </em>270 Conn. 568, 616, 854 A.2d 718 (2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1055, 125 S. Ct. 921, 160 L. Ed. 2d 780 (2005); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Fields, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>265 Conn. 184, 207, 827 A.2d 690 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>221 Conn. 315, 331, 603 A.2d 1138 (1992). With no other direction from the trial court correcting its improper instruction, the presumption that the jury followed the court\u2019s instruction and, accordingly, found the defendant guilty of first degree burglary based on attempted assault is essentially irrebuttable, the state\u2019s three contentions to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">First, citing to <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 289-90, 664 A.2d 743 (1995), the state contends that, despite the aforementioned presumption, closing arguments of counsel can supplant the trial court\u2019s essential role of providing proper jury instructions. Significantly, in that case, although we did consider arguments of counsel to determine whether an <em>inadequacy </em>in the trial court\u2019s instructions played a critical role, the trial court\u2019s impropriety did not address a fundamental misstatement of the law on an essential element of the offense. Specifically, in <em>Prioleau, </em>we agreed with the defendant that the trial court\u2019s instruction on self-defense inadequately had informed the jury of its need to evaluate the defendant\u2019s subjective belief as to the amount of force necessary to repel the murder victim\u2019s alleged attack. Id., 285. We concluded, however, that, \u201cfrom the facts, the issues and the instructions as a whole, there is no reasonable possibility that this infirmity misled the jury to [reach] an improper verdict.\u201d Id. We noted that the state neither presented evidence, nor argued to the jury, that the defendant was guilty of murder because he had used an excessive degree of force in protecting himself. Id., 289-90. Accordingly, the critical issue for the jury to decide was whether the defendant reasonably believed, when he shot the victim, that the victim was about to use deadly force or inflict great bodily harm upon him. Id., 290. The defendant had acknowledged the propriety of the trial court\u2019s instruction on that feature of self-defense. We therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>concluded that, \u201cnotwithstanding the trial court\u2019s <em>inadequate </em>instruction regarding the defendant\u2019s belief in the necessity to use deadly physical force, because the court clearly directed the jury to evaluate the defendant\u2019s belief in the danger he claims to have faced from the defendant\u2019s subjective perspective, we conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the juiy was misled to [reach] an improper verdict. ... In sum, we conclude that in this case, where the parties, the court and, most importantly, the jury, clearly understood the critical issue to be whether the defendant, at the time he shot and killed the victim, reasonably believed that the victim was about to use deadly force, and where the court properly instructed the jury on this crucial issue, the court\u2019s imperfect instruction regarding the defendant\u2019s belief in the acceptable degree of force was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 291. It is clear that the state\u2019s argument was not dispositive in <em>Prioleau </em>and that, to the extent that we relied on it, we did so in the context of an inadequate instruction. In our view, there is a critical distinction between those circumstances and the state\u2019s attempt here to use its arguments to the jury to rectify the trial court\u2019s misstatement of the law. \u201cIt is well established that an instruction containing a misstatement of the law is more likely to be prejudicial than an instruction that contains an omission or an incomplete statement of the law. <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Kibbe, </em>431 U.S. 145, 155, 97 S. Ct. 1730, 52 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>[186 Conn. 555, 563, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>198 Conn. 190, 198, 502 A.2d 858 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Second, the state contends that, even if the jury were otherwise predisposed to follow the trial court\u2019s earlier improper instructions, the trial court\u2019s final statement to the jury on the subject \u2014 that the object crime of the burglary charged by the state was either a felony or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>a misdemeanor \u2014 somehow cured its earlier recurring defective instructions. Although a correct statement, it did nothing to alter the prior twice repeated directive that the \u201cspecific crime\u201d at issue was attempted assault. Thus, this statement cannot be viewed as a cure to the court\u2019s defective instruction. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 450 (concluding that, even if we were to assume that instruction initially misled jury, trial court\u2019s \u201clengthy and accurate final instructions on the state\u2019s burden of proof\u2019 cured that defect); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>254 Conn. 540, 560, 757 A.2d 482 (2000) (possible improper instruction cured by court\u2019s repeated proper instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Finally, the state contends that, because both an attempted assault and a completed assault require an intent to bring about the completed assault, the court\u2019s improper charge that, when he entered the Alsephs\u2019 apartment unlawfully the defendant intended to commit an attempted assault, was harmless. We disagree. The instruction, that an intent to bring about the completed assault is a necessary element of attempted assault, was indeed provided to the jury in the context of the two attempted assault charges. Had the trial court charged the jury in connection with the burglary charge that, when the defendant illegally entered the building, he intended to commit an assault, but failed to instruct on the intent element required for an assault, reliance on the elements provided in the attempted assault instructions might have cured the omission. As we know, however, the trial court did not omit an intent instruction but, rather, added an improper attempt intent, which was not cured by its other instructions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case to that court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, PALMER and VERTE-FEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of burglary in the first degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein and ...

The court first reasoned that the intent required for attempt liability is the intent required for the commission of the substantive crime, and, as such, the criminal result must be the conscious objective of the actor\u2019s conduct. Id., 307. The court further acknowledged that the crime of manslaughter in the first degree, in violation of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1), required the intent to cause serious ipjury, rather than the death of the victim. Id., 307-309. Accordingly, the court recognized that a person, in committing manslaughter in violation of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1), does not intend that death occur.

The majority concludes that the jury likely was misled by the trial court\u2019s instruction that, to find the defendant, Cornelius Flowers, guilty of burglary in the first degree, the jury must determine, inter alia, that the defendant had entered the victim\u2019s apartment unlawfully with the intent to commit an attempted assault therein.

Because the trial court\u2019s instruction permitted the jury to find the defendant guilty of burglary in the first degree only if it found that the defendant had entered the victim\u2019s home unlawfully with intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, I would affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">To illuminate the flaws in the majority\u2019s reasoning, I first turn to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of burglary in the first degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a building with <em>intent to commit a crime therein </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is well established that, \u201c[t]o constitute burglary . . . the accused must have entered, remained, or broken and entered with the requisite specific criminal intent, and the gravamen of the offense is the intent with which a breaking and entry has been effected.\u201d 12A C.J.S. 218-19, Burglary \u00a7 44 (2004). Thus, the crime of burglary \u201cis complete once there has been an unlawful entering or remaining in a building with the intent to commit a crime in that building,\u201d regardless of whether the accused ever acts on his or her initial criminal intent. <em>State </em>v. Little, 194 Conn. 665, 675, 485 A.2d 913 (1984); see also 12A C.J.S. 224, supra, \u00a7 48 (\u201c[t]o constitute burglary it is not necessary that the intended crime shall be committed or attempted to be committed, as the offense is complete as soon as the premises are broken and entered . . . with the necessary intent, and the success or failure of the venture is immaterial\u201d). For example, when \u201cthe claim is that the crime intended to be committed by the burglar was larceny, the fact that there [was] no actual larceny does not bar a conviction for burglary. . . . The larceny, if committed, is a separate and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>tinct offense.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Little, </em>supra, 675-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">With this background in mind, I now address whether burglary with intent to commit attempted assault in the first degree is a cognizable crime. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides in relevant part that a person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if he or she acts with \u201cthe kind of mental state required for commission of the crime . . . .\u201d This court previously has observed that \u201c[i]t is plain from a reading of ... \u00a7 53a-49 (a) that the intent required for attempt liability is the [same] intent required for the commission of the substantive crime. The criminal result must be the conscious object of the actor\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda, </em>189 Conn. 303, 307, 455 A.2d 1326 (1983). Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and (4), the mental state required for commission of assault in the first degree is \u201cintent to cause serious physical injury to another person . . . .\u201d Moreover, the crime of assault in the first degree is complete once the defendant \u201ccauses such injury to such person or to a third person . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and (4). Thus, a defendant who attempts to commit assault in the first degree intends to cause serious physical injury to another person and, consequently, necessarily intends to commit the completed crime of assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The majority concludes, however, that a defendant who intends to commit attempted assault may intend \u201conly to attempt an assault but not to complete it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) This conclusion finds no support in either law or logic. If a defendant does not intend to complete the crime of assault in the first degree, that is, if he does not intend to cause serious physical injury to another person, then he does not have the mental state necessary to attempt to commit assault in the first degree. See generally 22 C.J.S. 144, Criminal Law \u00a7 115 (b) (1989) (\u201c\u2018[a]ttempt\u2019 with respect to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>crime has been held <em>more comprehensive than \u2018intent\u2019, </em>in that intent is a quality of mind and implies a purpose only, while an attempt implies an effort to carry that purpose to execution\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Moreover, the mental state necessary to attempt to commit assault in the first degree and the result of the completed crime are in perfect congruence. Thus, the present case easily is distinguishable from <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 303, and its progeny. In <em>Almeda, </em>the defendant, John A. Almeda, Jr., was convicted of attempt to commit manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1) and \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2). General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) provides in relevant part that a person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when \u201c(1) [w]ith intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person . . . .\u201d We determined that \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1) is \u201canalogous to the concept of involuntary manslaughter\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda, </em>supra, 308; because \u201c[n]o intent to cause death is required.\u201d Id., 309. Consequently, we concluded that the crime of attempt to commit involuntary manslaughter is not a cognizable crime because it \u201crequires a logical impossibility, namely, that the actor in his attempt intend that an unintended death result.\u201d Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosswell, </em>223 Conn. 243, 263, 612 A.2d 1174 (1992) (\u201cpersons cannot attempt or conspire to commit an offense that requires an unintended result\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Beccia, </em>199 Conn. 1, 5, 505 A.2d 683 (1986) (conspiracy to commit arson in third degree not cognizable crime because arson requires reckless mental state); 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law (2d Ed. 2003) \u00a7 11.3 (b), pp. 215-16 (Defendant logically cannot attempt to commit completed crime that \u201cconsists of recklessly or negligently causing a certain result, for if there were an intent to cause such a result then the attempt would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>not be to commit that crime but rather the greater crime of intentionally causing such result. For example, so long as the crime of attempt is deemed to require an intent-type of mental state, there can be no such thing as an attempt to commit criminal-negligence involuntary manslaughter. The consequence involved in that crime is the death of the victim and an act done with intent to achieve this, if an attempt at all, is attempted murder.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). Unlike <em>Almeda, </em>the present case does not present a logical impossibility because the result of the completed crime of assault in the first degree, namely, serious physical injury to another person, necessarily is intended when one possesses an \u201cintent to cause serious physical injury to another person . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">I emphasize that it is immaterial, for purposes of this appeal, whether the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant ever had acted on his intent to cause serious physical injury to another person. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) (requiring \u201can act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in [the] commission of the crime\u201d). This is because, as I previously explained, the gravamen of the crime of burglary is the criminal intent with which the breaking and entering has been effected. See 12A C.J.S. 218-19, supra, \u00a7 44. It is not necessary that the defendant ever commit or attempt to commit the intended crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Little, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 675-76. Accordingly, it is sufficient that the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant had entered the victim\u2019s apartment unlawfully with intent to cause serious physical injury to another person therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Finally, I address the defendant\u2019s claim that, because the crime of burglary is an inchoate crime in that it requires only an intent to commit a separate crime upon unlawful entry, the crime intended cannot be another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>inchoate crime such as attempt to commit assault in the first degree. Specifically, the defendant claims that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s instruction that the defendant could burglarize a dwelling with the intention of committing an attempted crime therein amounts to an attempted attempt, which does not exist at law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) This claim has no merit because it suffers from the same logical flaw as the majority opinion, namely, reliance on the theory that one who intends to attempt to commit the crime of assault in the first degree does not intend to complete it. As I previously explained, there is no substantive distinction between intent to commit attempted assault in the first degree and intent to commit assault in the first degree. Accordingly, I would reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I would conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s improper instruction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>342 N.C. 742, 752, 467 S.E.2d 636 (trial court\u2019s improper instruction that burglary can be committed with intent to commit attempted larceny not plain error because, inter alia, \u201cthe crucial element in burglary is the intent to commit a larceny, which is the identical intent necessary to commit an attempted larceny\u201d), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 875, 117 S. Ct. 196, 136 L. Ed. 2d 133 (1996). Viewing the trial court\u2019s instruction as a whole, I would conclude that it was adequate to explain to the jury that the defendant could not be found guilty of burglary in the first degree unless it determined that the defendant had entered the victim\u2019s apartment unlawfully with intent to cause serious physical injury to another person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument; or . . .
