It appeared, also, in evidence, that. <em>Marshall refused to release </em>the Judgments to <em>Horner ; </em>determining to hold them as a security for his future good behaviour; though he repeatedly expressed an intention not to demand the money, and that his children never should receive it; and, sometime after the J udgments were obtained, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>Horner </em>and <em>Marshall </em>were publicly reconciled, and shook hand3 as a token of renewing their former friendship.</summary>\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b478-12\">Decided, March 7th, 1817.</p><p id=\"b478-13\">1.

Horner presented a Bill to the Chancellor for the Richmond District, praying an Injunction to stay proceedings on the two Judgments obtained against him, for defamation, by <em>Charles Marshall </em>and by <em>Charles Marshall </em>and <em>wife, </em>which, after the death of the said Marshall, had been revived by actions of debt, instituted by his widow and administratrix.</p><p id=\"b478-10\">Chancellor Taylor <em>refused, </em>but the President of the Court of Appeals (Judges Roane, Brooke, and Cabell concurring, Judge Coalter being absent,) <em>granted </em>the Injunction.</p><p id=\"b479-3\">Chancellor Taylor dismissed the Bill with costs, from which Decree the complainant appealed.</p><p id=\"b479-4\">The &lt;use was submitted here without argument; and, on the 7th of March, 1817, the Court reversed the Decree with costs, and, proceeding to make such [decree, as the Chancellor should have rendered, directed the Injunction to be re-instated and made perpetual; but, on the circumstances of the case, that the Appellant pay the costs in the Court of Chancery.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
