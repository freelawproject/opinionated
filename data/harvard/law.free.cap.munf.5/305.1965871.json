They were also informed that the widow had some of the property in her possession, and confederated with the said <em>Stainback </em>to defraud the creditors by secreting and converting the decedent\u2019s estate to their own use.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b318-4\">The prayer of the Bill was for a discovery of the assets in general, and of the Slaves in particular; that the defendants <em>Stainback </em>and <em>Shelton </em>be decreed to deliver up the Slaves and other assets of the decedent, for payment of the claims of the plaintiffs; and account for the hire and profits; and that the plaintiffs might have such other and farther relief, as the nature of their case required.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b318-5\">From the answers of the defendants, the depositions and exhibits in the cause, it appeared that the Slaves had been lent by the defendant <em>Stainback </em>to the said <em>Daniel </em>Shelton, without any Deed in writing duly recorded, declaratory of such loan, and had remained in possession of the latter until his death, being more than five years, without any substantial or <em>bona fide </em>interruption of such possession; though it was proved that <em>Stainback </em>had frequently, <em>in private, </em>or when none but relations were present, demanded the negroes, received them from his daughter the wife of <em>Shelton, </em>or from <em>Shelton </em>himself, and <em>immediately re-delivered them, </em>to be held on the same terms as before. It appeared, moreover, from the answer of James Hester, that the property which came to his hands had been sold for a sum insufficient to satisfy the claims of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b317-15\">Decided January 17th, 1817.</p><p id=\"b317-16\">1. A demand of slaves by the lender, who thereupon receives, and immediately redelivers their, to the Loanee, to be held on the same terms, as before such demand, receipt, and re delivery being in <em>private </em>is not sufficient to bar the rights of creditors, under the \\ct to prevent Frauds and Perjuries.</p><p id=\"b317-17\">2 A Loan of Slaves, though not declared by Deed in writing duly recorded, and therefore void as lo Creditors, the Loanee having continued in possession five years without such demand, as would \"bar their right, is nevertheless effectual between the parties and their representatives\u00bb if, therefore, the Loanee die in possession of such \u00a1Slaves, they are not to be considered assets belonging to his estate, nor can be recovered as such $ being liable to his Creditors so far as their claims remain unsatisfied by the assets in the hands of his Executor or Administrator, but no farther\u00bb</p><p id=\"b317-8\">3. In such case, if the \\ssets be deficient, a Court of Equity will give the Creditors relief, on a Bill in their behalf against the lender and the Executor or Administrator of the Loanee; making the Assets liable in the first place, so tar as they extend; after which, it <em>will </em>allow the lender a limited lime to make good the deficiency, and, in default thereof direct a sale of the slaves\u00bb</p><p id=\"b318-6\">Chancellor Taylor was of opinion, \u201c that the plaintiffs M had not made a proper case for a Court of Equity, since there was, by their own shewing, a legal representative of \u00ab their debtor <em>Daniel Shelton, </em>who might be pursued at law, K and whose duty it was to pursue the assets of the said <em>Da- </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>' <em>niel Shellon, </em>and to recover the same for the benefit of his 5i creditors, to be apportioned among them without regard to \u201c the dignity of debts, if there should not be a sufficiency to \u201c pay the whole; but, if there were more than sufficient, to \u201c distribute the balance as the law requires; which in no wise \u201c devolved on the Creditors.\u201d He therefore dismissed the Bill with Costs; without prejudice to any suit, which the plaintiffs might be advised to institute at law.</p><p id=\"b319-6\">From this Decree the plaintiffs appealed to this Court, where, the cause being submitted without argument, the following opinion was pronounced on the 17th of January 1817.</p><p id=\"b319-7\">\u201c It appearing that the Slaves, in the Bill and proceedings \u201c mentioned, were loaned by the defendant <em>Stainback </em>to the in- \u201c testate <em>Daniel Shelton </em>or to his wife, and that the same re- \u201c mained in the possession of the Intestate until his death, \u201c and more than five years without such loan being declared \u201c by Deed in writing, recorded according to law, or such de\u00bb \u201c mand thereof by the lender, as is contemplated by the Act \u201c of Assembly in such cases in order to bar the rights of ere- \u201c ditors; the Court is of opinion, that the said loan, though \u201c void as to creditors, was nevertheless effectual between the \u201c parties and their representatives; and that, therefore, the S! slaves aforesaid were not <em>assets </em>in the hands of the defend- \u201c ani <em>Hester, </em>to whom the estate of the said Intestate was \u201c committed by the County Court, nor could they be recover- \u201c ed by him as such, being only liable to creditors <em>so far, as their </em>\u201c <em>Debts remain unsatisfied by the assets in his hands\u25a0 </em>The De- \u201c cree of the Chancery Court is therefore reversed with Costs; <em>\u201c </em>and the cause is remanded to that Court, with directions to \u201c have an account taken of the administration of the defend\u201cant <em>Hester; </em>of the Debts due from the Intestate <em>Daniel </em>u <em>Shelton, </em>and to Decree a payment of those Debts out of the &lt;s assets in the hands of that defendant, so far as the same \u201c shall extend; and the balance to be paid by the defendant st <em>Stainback </em>within a time to be limited by that Court; and, in \u201c default thereof, that the Slaves in the Bill and proceedings \u201c mentioned, or so many of them as may be necessary for that purpose, be sold for the purpose of paying said balancee\u00ae</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
