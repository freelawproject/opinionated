The Superior Court having reversed the Judgment, <em>Miller </em>appealed to this Court, where, after argument, it was decided that the Judgment of <em>the </em>Superior Court was erroneous, because that Court had no cognizance of the case, the <em>Supersedeas </em>having been improvidently issued; since the Bond was not signed by <em>Blannerhassett, </em>or any responsible person for him.</summary>\n\n<opinion><p id=\"AqM\">1.
