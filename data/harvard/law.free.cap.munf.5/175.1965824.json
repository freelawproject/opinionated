A <em>JL fa </em>against the <em>estate of a </em>testator, cannot lawfully be levied on slaves which, being specifically bequeathed, are in the possession of the <em>legatees, </em>as their property, either by actual <em>delivery </em>from the Executor, or by his permission. See <em>Burnley v. </em>Lambert, 1 <em>Wash. </em>308\u2014 313, <em>accordant.</em></p><p id=\"b187-13\">2. In such case a Court of Equity may award an Injunction to prevent the sale of the property. See <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>&amp;c. 3 <em>Munf. </em>99 ; and <em>Wilson Sf Trent v. Butler </em>and <em>others.
