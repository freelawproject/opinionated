The agents of the schooner Sam and Priscilla, by direction of - the owner, applied to the Linen Thread Company to,furnish a seine, and received on February 16, 1918, a letter confirming a telephone conversation in relation to its purchase which-' contained the following statement: \u201cWe will coal tar and \u2022rig complete in the usual manner with corks, leads, rings and purse line.\u201d The seine was delivered to the schooner in the. latter part of April, 1918, and a .bill for the same rendered to the agents of the schooner for about $3,000, which was paid, except a few items, including $117.45, the price of a two-inch purse line of 300 fathoms and weighing 251 pounds. The -whole amount'of the claim for which the vessel was libeled was $250.38. 'The owner of the schooner at the time of the purchase of the seine was Alden A. Mills, the libelant in- No. 1853. <em>i </em>He was cited in by the claimant of the schooner at the time the libel was brought to appear and defend \u2018against it. He did so, and filed an answer, admitting his ownership of the\u2019schooner -in the year 1918,' that said schooner was engaged in mackerel fishing. during that season, and that he bid contract with the libelant to furnish a seine and accessories to enable .the schooner to engage in the mackerel seining fisheries,' but that the seine furnished and its accessories were defective in construction, and that the purse line broke during the haul of a catch of mackerel allowing the whole catch to escape, to the great damage, of the respondent. He also filed a cross-libel in which it is alleged that the seine .furnished by the Linen Thread Company and its accessories,, including a tw'o-ineh purse line, was bo negligently constructed that the first time \u2022 it. was . used it parted, and by. reason of such parting a catch of mackerel was lost, compelling the abandonment 'of the trip, and causing the loss of proceeds of the sanie. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The Linen Thread Company filed, its answer to the cross-libel, admitting that the \u25a0schooner was regularly engaged in fisheries from the ports of. Boston and Gloucester during the year'1918,'and engaged for a part of that time in seining for mackerel; that the Linen Thread Company was \u00e9ngaged during the same period in the -business of selling netting and accessories used in the business catehing-fish; that .\u00e1 seine with its accessories, including a.two-inch purse line, was delivered to the schooner on the order of the agents bf the schooner; and that it sold and delivered the kind of articles nailed for in the order, and that the \u201cseine was \u25a0reasonably fit for the purpose for which it considered it intended to be \u2019used.\u201d- The libels were heard together, and may be considered in one opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Upon the libel of the Linen Thread Company the District Judge has disallowed the amount claimed to be due for the purse line, $117.45, and has allowed the other items in its claim. v</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Upon the cross-libel of the owner of the schooner against the Linen Thread Compa-' ny, the court, after it'had referred the libel \u25a0to an assessor to state damages, decreed that Mills should recover $1,200 and costs against the Linen Thread Company, which has appealed from both decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">There are 24 assignments of error. The \u25a0first contention of the appellant is that the District Court erred in not ruling that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the cross-libel; that it alleges the commitment of a tort, which, because the seine'was delivered upon the wharf in Gloucester, was not a maritime tort,, and that, if it were one, the court was without jurisdiction, because it was not proved that the purse line was negligently constructed; that the court erred in holding that the libelant in the cross-libel could recover on the ground of breach of an implied warranty, because no facts were alleged which would sustain such a decree.</p>\n<p id=\"AV\"> The pleadings in admiralty are simple, and it is not necessary that they conform to the requirements of common-law pleadings, provided the nature of a claim is properly .stated,, so that it may be fully understood by the court and justice administered. We think the allegation in the cross-lib'el was sufficient to state a claim for damages because bf a breach of an implied warranty to furnish a seine which, with its .accessories, was reasonably fit for the p.ufi'pose for which the respondent knew it was to be used. ' In its answer the respondent admits that the schooner was regularly engaged in fisheries during the year' 1918, and a part of, that time in seining for mackerel, and that the seine .with its accessories, which included the two-inch purse line, was delivered to the schooner, to .pe used by it \u201cin pursuing said fisheries.\u201d While, therefore, the libel does not contain ,an .allegation that the-Linen Thread Company knew the purpose for which the seine-and its- accessories, including the purse line, was to be used, it admits in its answer that it had such knowledge. The contract to furnish the seine and accessories, including .the purse fine, was a maritime, one, and within the jurisdiction' of the court of admiralty. See Hiram R. Dix<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>on (D. C.) 33 F. 297. As the contract was a maritime one, the court could sustain a cross-libel for its breach. The Electron, 48 F. 689, 21 C. C. A. 12; The Highland Light (D. C.) 88 F. 296; The Venezuela (D. C.) 173 F. 834; Reichert Towing Line, Inc., v. Long Island Machine &amp; Marine Construction Co. (D. C.) 287 F. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Regardless of the statute of Massachusetts, there is under the common law an implied warranty that articles supplied by a manufacturer or dealer shall be reasonably fit for the purpose for which he know they were intended, provided the purchaser relies upon his skill and knowledge. The Massachusetts statute is but declaratory of this. The testimony taken by the master fully proved that the purse line was defective and unfit for the use for which it was intended. While the Linen Thread Company did not manufacture <em>the </em>parse line, yet, as it was one of the accessories of the seine furnished by it, it was its duty to ascertain that it was suitable for the purpose for which it was to bo used. The seine, after its delivery, was used for about six weeks in pollock and herring fishing, and then its use was attempted by the schooner for maekerel fishing. The undisputed testimony was that, when an attempt was made to close the net upon the first catch of mackerel, and the catch had been inclosed within the net, so-that it was being raised from the water, the purse line broke and the whole catch was lost; that it was spliced, and several attempts made to use it again, but with the same result as at the first attempt, and the schooner gave up its fishing trip and returned to port.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">It is. contended that the libelant in the cross-libel had no property in the catch of mackerel, as he had not reduced the fish to possession. The evidence, however, discloses that the .schooner had practically done so, and that, if the purse line had not parted, it would have landed the whole catch.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">It is also claimed that damages could not he awarded because too uncertain. The captain of the schooner estimated the weight of the maekerel within the net to be at least 20,000 pounds. The rule that damages, if uncertain, cannot be recovered, applies to their nature, and not to their extent. If the damage is certain, the fact that its extent is uncertain does not prevent a recovery. The market price of mackerel during the month of May, 1918, was proven, and we think there was sufficient evidence to sustain the report of the master that the weight of. the mackerel lost because of the defective purse line was about 20,000 pounds. The court below, in confirming the report of the master, stated that, as the schooner was on \u201cone-half lay,\u201d the owner was entitled to but one-half the damages found by the master, and that, although there would have been a possibility of a technical defect in parties and procedure, if the question had been raised earlier, as the ease had been fully heard, both ou liability and on damages, without reference to it, and the proper result reached, the decree should deal with the merits of the controversy. We have reached the same conclusion, and it is ordered that the entry be in both cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Deeree of the District Court affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
