On April 18,1918, the milk was delivered to the Quartermaster\u2019s Depot at Baltimore, pursuant to government\u2019s written order, dated March 19, 1918, which provided, \u201cDeliver * * 18 in storeroom at New Canton Warehouse,\u201d and further stated the milk was \u201cfor stock, to be inspected at the depot.\u201d The price was promptly paid by the government. Thereafter, to wit, in December, 1918, the milk was inspected, and, for present purposes, we assume was, as averred in the pleadings, when \u201cshipped, sour, coagulated, and unfit for human consumption.\u201d On February 8, 1919, notice thereof was given Dewart, and a demand made for the replacement with proper goods or repayment of the money, in the following terms: \u201cIt is now found that 1,663 cases, or 79,824 cans, * * * is coagulated, sour, and unfit for human consumption. * * * You may either replace these goods with milk that is good and up to specifications, or send your cheek for the money value of the milk unfit for use, viz. $7,773.32.\u201d On February 11, 1919, Dewart refused to repay or replace the goods, averring \u201cthat this milk carried the six months\u2019 guaranty, the same as all other milk that we ship to the War Department, Italian government, and British government, which we have been exporting, and as this milk is now eleven months old, you can readily see that our guaranty has lapsed by five months.\u201d Thereupon the United States brought this suit to reeover back the money paid, and defendant filed an affidavit of defense which averred the expiration of the six months guarantee thus claimed. On hearing on these pleadings, the court below sustained the defendant\u2019s contention and entered judgement in its favor. Thereupon the United States sued out this writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-19\">In its opinion the court held, first, the contract was to be performed in Pennsylvania and the contract was controlled by the Pennsylvania Sales Act of 1915 (P. L. 543, \u00a7 49; Pa. St. 1920, \u00a7 19697), quoted in the margin;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> second, as a matter of law, it held the inspection was not made and notice given within a reasonable time. Assuming, for present purposes, the contract was to be performed in Pennsylvania, instead of Maryland, and would ordinarily be governed by its Sales Act, it will be seen that this act applied \u201cin the absence of express or implied agreement of the parties.\u201d As we view it, the court below failed to recognize the fact that by their contract the United States and Dewart had provided for inspection in their own way and time, and that the ease was not one of \u201cthe absence of express or implied agreement of the parties,\u201d where alone the Sales Act intervenes and fixes for the parties provisions they had not made for themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>To us it is clear that the contract, taken as a whole, left the time of inspection, within certain time limits, to be fixed by the government. Section 19 provides: \u201cDeliveries must be equal to * ' * * prescribed standards, and each purchasing officer shall make the determination in each case.\u201d Section 250 provides that condensed milk shall \u201cconform to the standards adopted by the United States Department of Agriculture.\u201d Section 24 provides for inspection of goods and also samples in these words (the italics ours): \u201cSupplies, including packages offered for acceptance, shall he subject to <em>such inspection as deemed necessary </em>by the purchasing officer, and <em>whenever in his opinion </em>the same are not of the kind or quality stipulated for they shall be rejected.\u201d Under the head of reclamation the contract provided for replacements \u2019 for defective goods -as follows:' \u201cProvided, the damaged condition resulted through fault of the seller, reclamation will he made for losses on <em>* </em>* * earned milk for one year from date of purchase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">In view of these provisions, the inspection being one to be made by the purchasing officer, the rejection being made by him whenever, in his opinion, the articles are not as stipulated, and the government being given, in the ease of canned milk, one year from the date of purchase, wherein it could call on the seller to replace the goods, it seems to us that the government was within its contract, rights when, within such year, to wit, in December, 1918, it inspected the goods, found __ them unfit for human use, and also, within the year, to wit, in February, 1919, notified the seller to either replace the articles or refund the money mistakenly paid. When the defendant refused to replace goods or \u2019 refund \u00a1money, because its guaranty was confined to six months, the answer is the eoritraet did not so provide, and, when the court held the Pennsylvania statute determined the rights of the parties as to inspection and rejection, the answer is that the contract of the parties, which in canned milk gave the government a,year\u2019s leeway for rejection and demand for replacement, determined the rights and liabilities of the parties. So. holding, we are of opinion the court was in error in writing into the contract the Penn-' sylvania Sales Act, and holding as a matter of law that the government\u2019s right to inspect, reject, and reclaim \u201ccanned milk for one year from date of purchase\u201d was unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Its judgment must therefore be reversed, and the case remanded for procedure in due course.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-20\"> <em>\u201cIn the absence .of empress or implied agreement </em>of the parties, acceptance of the goods by the buyer shall not discharge the seller from liability in damages or <em>other legal remedy for breach </em>of <em>any promise or warranty in the contract to sell or the sale. </em>But if, after acceptance of the goods, the buyer fail to give notice to the seller of the breach of any promise or warranty, within a reasonable time after the buyer knows or ought to know of such breach, the seller shall not be liable therefor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
