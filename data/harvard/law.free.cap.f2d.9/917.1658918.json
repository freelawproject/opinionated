G. ROSE.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b941-5\">(Circuit Court of Appeals, <em>Second </em>Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b941-6\">December <em>7, </em>1925.)</decisiondate>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b941-7\">No. 118.</docketnumber>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b941-15\">Macklin, Brown &amp; Van Wyck, of New York City (Horace L. Cheyney, of New York City, of counsel), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b941-16\">Kirlin, Woolsey, Campbell, Hickox &amp; Keating, of New York City (Robert S. Erskine and Henry P. Elliott, both of New York City, of counsel), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b941-17\">Before HOUGH, HAND, and MACK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b941-18\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"AIh\">The court below found that there was a collision as alleged, and we are not disposed to disturb that finding. We also accept the finding below that there was negligence on the part of the bargemaster, and are of opinion that his negligence was greater than claimant\u2019s. We also agree that, had prompt steps been taken to either beach or siphon the Farrell, there would have been no serious result.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-19\"> We cannot <em>agree </em>that the negligence of claimant\u2019s tug was or could be \u201cmerged\u201d in the subsequent and greater negligence of libelant\u2019s bargemaster. There is no such thing as a <em>merger </em>of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-20\">We hold it shown that the Rose\u2019s negligence caused a slight collision, the result of which (according to the only testimony of record) could have been repaired for not over $202, and that, but for the subsequent negligence of the bargee, there would have been no such loss as is asserted in'the libel, viz. upwards of $8,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-21\">Thus we have two sets of damages, one proximately caused by fault imputable to libelant, the other by fault imputable to claimant. But there is difficulty in stating exactly <em>the </em>amounts of these different damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-22\">There has been an inclination to take the easiest way out of such difficulties, and divide damages, or give half damages, as might be appropriate. The Silvia (D. C.) 2 F.(2d) 305. But there is no hard and fast rule. We have recognized that even \u201cnovel\u201d damage divisions may, if equitable, be looked upon with favor. The Little Silver, 84 F. 508, at page 512, 28 C. C. A. 476. In this case we think it is possible, on the proofs as they stand, to say that libelant\u2019s prima facie damage is not over $202. That damage has been shown a good deal more clearly than was a considerably larger loss recognized in The Transfer No. 8 (D. C.) 88 F. 551, a decision of Brown, District Judge, of which we approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-23\">The decree is set aside, with costs, if earned as below indicated, and the cause remanded to the lower court, with directions at the option of libelant to pursue one of the following courses:</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>(1) Enter a decree for $202, with interest and the costs of both courts; or</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">(2) Refer the cause to a commissioner, with directions that, if libelant fails to prove collision damage exclusive of demurrage in excess of $202, he shall recover no more than the amount of damage so proven, without interest, and without costs, in either court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
