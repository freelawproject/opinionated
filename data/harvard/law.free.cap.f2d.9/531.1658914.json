The first charged a conspiracy to conceal assets from the trustee in bankruptcy of Beaux Arts Dresses, Inc.; the second charged the corporation with concealing assets, and the defendants Todd and Mondshein with aiding and abetting in such concealment; and the third count charged the use of the mails in execution of a scheme to defraud by obtaining credit with the aid of a false financial statement. The first count was dismissed by the court. The Beaux Ails Dresses, Inc., and Erank Mondshein were eonvieted on the seeond and third counts, and James E, Todd,was convicted on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>the second count and acquitted on the third. The defendant Todd alone presses his writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The Beaux Arts Dresses, Inc., was a domestic corporation organized in December, 1920. There were four stockholders. Mondshein and Todd were copartners when the corporation took over their business, and were engaged in manufacturing dresses. Todd was president and Mondshein was treasurer from the inception of the corporation until its bankruptcy. In September, 1922, Todd and Mondshein became the sole stockholders; the\u2019 other two having sold their stock and resigned as officers and directors of the company. Prior to- this, there was a discussion with reference to winding up the business, dissolving the corporation, paying the creditors in full, and dividing what was left among the stockholders. In August, 1922, the corporation entered into an agreement with a discount company by the terms of which it assigned its accounts receivable to that company for advances of money. This agreement was signed by Todd and Mondshein. Various accounts were assigned up to December 1,1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In October, 1922, the corporation issued a financial statement to the trade and to commercial agencies. These were sent through the mail from October, 1922, to January, 1923, and up to ten days before the date of failure, which occurred January 26, 1923. The financial statement was false. It stated that the corporation had cash in bank, when in fact it had overdrawn its account. It stated its receivables at $49,877.78, none of which it claimed were assigned. The fact was that the accounts receivable amounted to $79,083.28, of which $72,843.06 were assigned to th^s discount company. The statement did not mention its liability to the discount company of $52,409.04. It showed a surplus,-when in fact there was a deficit of $17,730.15. Within seven weeks .before the failure, it purchased merchandise amounting to $47,000 a large part of which purchases were made in the three weeks before the failure. Of this amount, $14,-653.62 worth were not recorded in the books of the corporation. The charge book of the corporation, beginning November,-1922, and ending January 26, 1923, contained entries of charges totaling approximately $27,000 to concerns in different parts of the country, when in fact none of these concerns were in existence. The plant of the-corporation, consisting of machinery, and fixtures was transferred to one Vogel under some agreement with the' defendants below, which they claimed they had with him. The machinery and fixtures were removed from the premises occupied by them in Januaxy, 1923, and resulted in no manufacturing being done on the premises during the last three weeks prior to the failure. During December, 1922, and January, 1923, about $2,500 worth of merchandise was sent out to contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">The business of the defendants below was manufacturing and selling dresses, and_ during the last three weeks before the failure they sold approximately $10,000 worth to various concerns whose addresses were not given, and who, it appeared on the trial, did not exist. A new set of books of account was opened December, 1922, and on the date of failure a number of important books of account were missing. The purchases during the seven weeks prior td the bankruptcy amounted to about $71,401.63, and deductions from sales of garments to $28,608.48; raw material amounted to $10,-075.73, and goods sent to contractors to $2,-473.96 \u2014 making a total of $41,158.17. This left unaccounted 'for by the defendants below about $30,243.46. At bankruptcy it had liabilities of $67,435.25 and assets of $1,-064.14. _ '</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\"> Todd, one of the defendants below, argued that this judgment should be reversed because error was committed in failing to dismiss the indictment because of a misjoinder of offenses charged. This defendant below was acquitted by direction of the court on the first count and by the jury\u2019s verdict on the third count. He stands convicted on the second count only. The question of misjoinder of offenses was raised at the opening of the trial, and the motion was renewed at the end of the government\u2019s case, and again when the defendants below rested.' In each instance the motion was denied. The question of law thus presented was sufficiently raised. The rule governing the joinder of several charges in one indictment is stated in section 1024 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. \u00a7 1690), which provides that, when there axe several charges against any person for the same act or transaction, or for two or more acts or transactions connected together, or for two or more acts or transactions of the same class of crimes or offenses which may be properly joined, instead of having several indictments the whole may be joined in one indictment on separate counts, and if two or more indictments are found in* such cases the court may order them to be consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">There are two classes of crimes that can be thus joined: (1) Where the same act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>constitutes two or more crimes; and (2) where the crimes are so connected' in respect of time, place, and occasion that it would he difficult, if not impossible, to separate the proofs of one charge from the proofs of the other. McElroy v. United States, 164 U. S. 76, 17 S. Ct. 31, 41 L. Ed. 355; Pointer v. United States, 151 U. S. 396, 14 S. Ct. 410, 38 L. Ed. 208. This court said in De Luca v. United States, 299 F. 741: \u201cIt is a general rule that the counts for several felonies of the same general nature, requiring the same general punishment, may he joined in the same indictment, subject to the power of the court to quash the indictment or to compel an election; but such joinder cannot be sustained, where the parties are not the same, or where the offenses are in no wise parts of the same transaction, and must necessarily depend upon evidence of a different statement of facts as to each or some of them. * * * But there must be such connection in respect of the time, place, and occasion that it would he difficult, if not impossible, to separate the proofs of one charge from the proofs of the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ASGh\">The proof to support the charge of concealing assets and conspiring so to do was of necessity different from the proof in support of the charge of using the mails in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. To prove a concealment of assets or a conspiracy so to do would require proof of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, adjudication in bankruptcy, appointment of the trustee, and the concealment of assets which should have been delivered to the trustee or an agreement and understanding between the defendants below to do these things or have them done, and the doing of an overt act. To prove fraud in the use of the mails would require proof of a scheme to defraud being devised and the defendants below using the mails in execution thereof. In the latter crime, the conspiracy may be proven, and yet no proof of fraud having been actually committed. In concealing\u2019 assets, fraud is an element necessary to establish guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">What we said in the De Luca Case; supra, is controlling here. There we held an indictment fatal which charged a conspiracy to defraud the United States of duties on opium, and also in another count charged the offense of unlawfully selling opium. The charge of using the mails here involves the sending of a false financial statement. The mailing of such statement could not he in furtherance of a conspiracy to conceal assets from the trustee; or of the substantive offense of actually concealing assets. The third count of the indictment was improperly joined with the first and second, and under McElroy v. United States, 164 U. S. 80, 17 S. Ct. 31, 41 L. Ed. 355, and De Luca v. United States, 299 P. 741, there was a misjoinder. In the De Luca Case there were two plaintiffs in error, one of whom was convicted of two crimes after the.indictments had been consolidated. One o\u2019f the plaintiffs in error was acquitted of one charge and found guilty of the second. In that ease, as to the latter, the question was not presented as to whether the acquittal on one charge cured the error of consolidating both indictments. However, in that case we felt that prejudicial error was committed in the consolidation of the indictments, and reversed the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">This defendant below was acquitted on the third count of the indictment and we think that cured the defect of misjoinder. As announced in Reg. v. Ferguson (1885) 1 Dearsly\u2019s C. C. 427, where the prisoner is convicted for felony on only one of two counts, it is the same thing as if he had been convicted upon an indictment charging him With one crime in but a single count. Acquittal on one misjoined count cures the misjoinder. This rule has found support in the state courts. Commonwealth v. Packard, 5 Gray (71 Mass.) 101; State v. Merrill, 44 N. H. 624; Commonwealth v. Adams, 127 Mass. 15; Myers v. State, 92 Ind. 390; Arascada v. Sixth Jud. Dist. of Nevada, 44 Nev. 37, 189 P. 621; State v. Miller, 24 Conn. 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">It may be argued that the evidence of sending a false financial statement through the mails was prejudicial, and of itself should have required a reversal. Evidence of a false financial statement and its issuance was competent on the question of intention to conceal assets. The intention with which assets which were subsequently concealed were secured is important, in the charge on which the defendant below has been convicted. Levinson v. United States, 5 F.(2d) 567, 569. Evidence of actions and conversations of the bankrupt with, its aiders and abettors prior to the filing of the petition is admissible and probative, when they tend to establish an intention to conceal. Green v. United States, 240 F. 949, 153 C. C. A. 635. Since the defendant below has been acquitted of sending the false statement through the mails in furtherance of a scheme to defraud, we must assume such finding by the jurors represents a disbelief bv them of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Since the duplicity of the indictment has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>been cured by tbe verdict of guilty as to one offense only, we have examined tbe other errors assigned. It is argued that tbe evidence was insufficient to connect tbe defendant below with tbe commission of tbe offense of tbe second count. It appears that Todd and Mondsbein were partners in name, \u2022and later became officers of tbe bankrupt corporation,' which succeeded tbe partnership. Todd became its president. There was no doubt that Mondsbein was secreting assets. A decrease of value \u2014 more than one-half in two months, after purchase of new merchandise \u2014 under tbe circumstances disclosed in this record is not to be believed. False sales were entered in the books. The machinery was removed. Books were destroyed. A false financial statement was prepared and issued. It was not erroneously issued, but tbe evidence indicates that -it was prepared with deliberation. Todd and Mondsbein (who does not present bis ease to us on bis writ, but apparently has abandoned it) were the sole owners of tbe business.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Tbe principal duty of tbe defendant below was selling, but be sometimes bought and received goods. Todd, as well as Mondshein, gave orders for purchases, and when tbe goods were delivered be occasionally receipted for them. Tbe evidence is clear that, when piece goods were -sold shortly before tbe failure, Todd bad full knowledge of tbe sales. There is evidence that on tbe day before tbe failure Todd and Mondsbein were in their place of business, and there were then between $1,500 and $2,000 worth of piece goods. These pieces were not found when tbe receivers took possession tbe following day. Todd took the witness stand in his own behalf and made a complete denial. Tbe intimate business relations of tbe officers of this corporation, and tbe active part that Todd took in tbe management of tbe affairs of tbe corporation, required tbe submission of the evidence to tbe jury as to whether or not, with knowledge, be aided and abetted in tbe concealment of tbe assets-of this bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">We think tbe question was one for tbe jury, and under the circumstances it was the- duty of tbe trial judge to submit the issues of fact to tbe jury. Men of ordinary intelligence may differ as'to tbe reasonable inferences to be drawn from bis testimony, but in such circumstances- it is a question for the jury. Glass v. United States, 281 F. 65, 145 C. C. A. 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Error is assigned in admitting, as against the defendant below Todd, testimony tending to prove that tbe book entries of the corporation made shortly before tbe bankruptcy were fictitious. Since we are satisfied that tbe question of guilt was supported by sufficient evidence to warrant its submission to the jury, we think tbe entries in tbe boobs offered in evidence were properly received against both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
