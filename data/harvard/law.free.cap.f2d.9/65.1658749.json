Such a claim'for compensation may be asserted by counterclaim; the answer in this case clearly sets forth such a counterclaim. Therefore, without passing upon the question \u00e1s to whether the amount retained was or was not expressly authorized and assented to by all the members of the board of directors, including the principal plaintiff herein, it is clear that the evidence abundantly sustains the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The decree, dismissing the bill for want of equity, is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
