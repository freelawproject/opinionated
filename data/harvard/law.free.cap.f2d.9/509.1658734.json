As, in our view, the decree should be affirmed upon the merits, we prefer to place our decision upon that basis and to pass over the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-19\">Appellants are the beneficiaries or the legal representatives oC the beneficiaries in a deed of trust alleged to have been duly executed and delivered by the bankrupt. This deed of trust, covering real estate and an interest in an oil and gas lease in Oklahoma, was dated May 20, 1920, and never recorded. Their rights are based upon this instrument. The objectors to the allowance of any rights under such instrument are a grantee of a portion of the real estate, holders of liens based on judgments secured and filed of record subsequent to the date of the deed of trust and holders of mortgages, on the same property, executed subsequent to such date. The various objections set forth many reasons why the objectors urged that this deed of trust should be held invalid or as ineffective against their claims. We think it necessary to discuss but one of such grounds (contained in all of the objections) which is determinative of the rights presented here. This ground is that the objectors \u201cdeny the execution and delivery of the purported mortgage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-21\">The referee found that \u201cthe genuineness of this alleged mortgage is extremely doubtful.\u201d The court found that the mortgage was executed but not delivered. Upon an oral application to modify the findings, the court found that the mortgage had been executed and that \u201cthe court is unable to determine from the evidence whether the mortgage referred to was delivered by J. S. Mullen, the bankrupt herein, to R. L. Hunt.\u201d In connection with other findings, at this second bearing, the court said: \u201cThe court does not mean by this finding to imply that he believes that the mortgage was delivered or was within the control of R. L. Hunt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-22\">For other reasons, the court concluded \u201cthat the claims of security asserted by the petitioners should be disallowed for all purposes.\u201d The substance of all of those findings upon this matter is that the delivery of this instrument is left undetermined with an expressed doubt (by the referee) and a careful reservation (by the court) as to the fact of delivery thereof. This point has been strenuously urged in this court. Unbound by any finding thereon below, we approach the examination of the1 evidence relating thereto. We have examined the entire evidence painstakingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-23\">This instrument is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-24\">\u201cState of Oklahoma, Carter County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-25\">\u201cBe it remembered, that on this the 20th day of May, 1920, I, J.

St. $10$10$3.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-22\">Mullen was adjudicated a bankrupt November 20, 1922. Hunt died March 23, 1923. Mullen was a large operator in lands and oil. His financial dealings were, to say the least, reckless in the extreme. He approximated his debts at $2,000,000 with about one-half that amqunt of property which was heavily incumbered, many pieces of property having successive mortgages (both recorded and unrecorded) upon them. He drew unstintingly upon his friends\u2019 credit through indorsement of his numerous notes. He had( an intense animosity toward some of these objectors and ardently desired to see his property used to pay others in preference to them. A month or so before the date of this instrument, he intended to make a mortgage covering much of his property, which would affect such a preference but was restrained by the threat of some of these objectors to throw him into bankruptey-if lie should so do. He claims to have executed this mortgage at the date thereof and <em>to </em>have delivered it to R. L. Hunt. He says he drew and tpyewrote this mortgage himself. He does not remember whether he was in Ardmore, Okl., or in Texas when he made such delivery. Remembers no conversation or understanding with Hunt as to having it recorded. Outside of Hunt and the notary, who took his -acknowledgment, he \u201cthinks\u201d he told Mr. Gardenhire, Mr. Butler, Mr. Gray, Mr. Moorman, Mr.\\ Chaffe, Mr. Sturgis and Mr. Hobby about it. Moorman, Sturgis, Chaffe and Gardenhire were called as witnesses. Moorman testifies Mullen told him about the instrument in the summer of 1920. Chaffe claims that Hunt told him, early in 1920, that he had such an instrument. Sturgis and Gardenhire deny any knowledge thereof until about the time of the hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>The alleged information of Moorman and Cliaffe is purely hearsay and of no probative value. Butler, Gray and Hobby were not called as witnesses nor was their absence accounted for. The notary was not called nor accounted for although he would have been the most natural and the most effective witness to the fact and time of the execution of the instrument. Both Moorman and Chaffe had been employed in enterprises in which Mullen was heavily interested. Mullen did not tell his wife who seems to have been interested in or used by him in some of his transactions. After the date of this instrument, Mullen dealt with and incumbered this property freely on the basis that there was .no sueh instrument. Thereafter, he dealt with some of the beneficiaries thereunder as though no such instrument existed. His private records contained items of many other incumbrances (recorded and unrecorded) on this and other property, but were silent as to this instrument. The beneficiaries thereunder filed claims in the bankruptcy proceeding, making no mention of sueh security. It was only after these many and devious transactions by Mullen, months after the adjudication in bankruptcy and several months after the death of R. L. Hunt that this paper came to light.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">This paper purports to protect Hunt individually and also two banks in which Hunt was or had been an official. Hunt was a graduate of a law school, had practiced law, was a banker and had had the necessity of record of such an instrument drawn to his attention in at least one suit in which he had participated before the date of this instrument. He must have known the danger in holding it from record. Yet, Mullen testifies that Hunt told him he had lost this paper. No demand was made by Hunt for another sueh instrument. It is, also, to be noted that this instrument is not listed in the bankrupt\u2019s schedule of debts and he permitted these beneficiaries to file their claims as general claims and to vote for trustee as general claimants although it was then to their interest to reveal this security which he so much wished them to have and all possible reason for concealment thereof had passed. R. L. Hunt was then alive. The above showing is strong enough to bring into serious question the finding of the court that the instrument was ever executed at the time of its date, but we find it unnecessary to determine that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The evidence as to delivery is even more astonishing. The only evidence thereof is from Mullen and Moorman. Mullen is clearly not worthy of belief and is keenly interested in sustaining the instrument. The evidence by Moorman relates to finding the paper. There.is a hint, but only that, in the evidence that Moorman is questionable, but we pass that by. His story of discovery of the instrument is not to be believed. Why he should have been so interested in finding such a paper is not very satisfactorily explained. He says he did so at the request of Sibly, who was vice president of the Security National Bank (one of the beneficiaries under the mortgage), but Sibly is not produced as a witness. ITo says he went to see Dick Hunt, brother of R. L. Hunt, a,nd had him look among the papers of R. L. Hunt \u201cat Mexia, Ranger and around.\u201d This search was without success \u201cand finally he and I went together and found the mortgage in the office of D. G. Hunt, father of R. L. Hunt.\u201d Dick Hunt is not produced as a witness, although his testimony would have been of evident vital value and although his whereabouts are shown to have been known. The story of Moorman is that he and Dick Hunt went to Hunt\u2019s father\u2019s office and that he found the paper in \u201cfifteen or twenty minutes * * * in a drawer or pigeon hole of a desk.\u201d Although the father, D. G. Hunt, had told them the paper was not there, neither of them over told him that they had found it.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">After completing a law course, R.*L. Hunt came into the office of his father where he remained about a year. He left the office in 1918, going into the banking business. The lather was a witness. His testimony has the ring of truth in it. He swears there were no papers in his office belonging' to his son after his son went to Ranger (in 1918) to go into the bank there. Moorman testified that he found this paper \u201cthirty or sixty days\u201d before he testified, on July 14, 1923. R. L. Hunt had died March 23, 1923. The father had made two searches of all of the papers in the office looking for certain tax receipts. One of these searches was about the 18th or 20th of January, 1923, and the other after the death of his son. The thorough character of these searches is revealed by extracts from his testimony. As to the first search he says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">\u201cAfter receipt of this notice I took a day off and I examined carefully and painstakingly every paper, envelope and instrument in my office trying to find the receipt for those taxes. I even went through my monthly bank statements for those years and I took the checks but and read them one by one. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>I tried to find if I hadn\u2019t paid that tax. I didn\u2019t find it nor did I find that instrument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">As to the second search, he says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">\u201cI went through every receptacle in the office and every envelope in the office, that could have contained such a paper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">This instrument was stamped with three revenue stamps, two for $10 each and one for $3. It would naturally have attracted the attention of a lawyer searching among his own papers. The father says it \u201cwould have attracted my attention, of course.\u201d He never saw the paper. Also, although he saw his son (R. L. Hunt) almost daily for more than a year before his death, he never heard of such an instrument until after the death of his son. With, all of this evidence in the record, even if unaffected by the suspicious absence from the trial of the notary and of Dick Hunt, this court finds it too great a stretch upon its credulity to believe that this instrument was found in that office. We must conclude that it was not there. We find no credible testimony, in this record of any delivery of this instrument to R. L. Hunt and determine that issue of fact in favor of the objectors. The legal result of this determination is that the court was right in concluding that this \u201cclaim of security asserted by the petitioners should be disallowed for all purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">On the merits, the decree should be and is affirmed.0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
