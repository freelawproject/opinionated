C. A.) 3 F.(2d) 551. The hearing before the departmental officers was entirely proper, and there was abundant evidence to support tbe findings of tbe Board of Special Inquiry. The hearing having been fair, and the law not having been misapplied, the courts have no power to set aside a board\u2019s findings of fact. La Reddola\u2019s Case (C. C. A.) 299 F. 592; Haft\u2019s Case (C. C. A.) 300 F. 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-18\">It has been suggested that Brugnoli\u2019s Case (C. C. A.) 300 F. 918, is inconsistent. What was there said must be measured by the facts of the ease. We held <em>\u201cthere </em>must be some previous history upon which to predicate the conclusion that the alien\u201d was subject to deportation for a psychopathic inferiority. Here there was a rather extended previous history distinctly tending, as it seems to us, to support the finding of the Board. But the legal point is that hero we have the evidence which we thought was lacking in Brugnoli\u2019s Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-19\">We see no reason justifying the release granted below. Order reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
