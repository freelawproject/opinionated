The prayers of the petitioner were that it be decreed that the noteholders\u2019 committee had failed in their fiduciary duty, and that, by reason of such failure, they had dissipated the entire assets of the Oil Corporation that were of sufficient value to pay its debts; that said committee be ordered to pay over to the Oil Corporation a sum of money equal in value to the assets wasted, and that the receivers of the Oil Corporation be ordered to pay the petitioner the amount of his debt and expenses of litigation; or, in the alternative, in case no other creditors appeared and joined in the petition, that the note-holders\u2019 committee be ordered to pay Wilt-see directly. The petition did not ask that the decree of February 17, 1923, approving the plan of reorganization, be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">October 3, 1925, Judge Anderson filed an opinion (8 F.[2d] 392) in which he found, among other things, that the noteholders\u2019 committee obtained the decree of February 17,1923, approving and authorizing the plan of reorganization, through fraudulent representations, and were guilty of fraud in carrying out the plan, and on October 7, 1925, he entered the decree from which the present petitioners desire to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">In the decree of October 7, 1925, after finding that the decree of February 17, 1923, approving the plan of reorganization, was obtained by fraud, the court made the following orders, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">\u201c(1) Said decree of this court, made on February 17, 1923, approving the plan of reorganization submitted by said committee, is hereby rescinded and vacated, so far as such decree may affect the rights of Wiltsee and/or of any other creditors of said receivership estate who may hereafter join in these proceedings and be held entitled to rescind the settlement of their debt claims made by them with said committee under said plan of reorganization, but saving all rights which may have accrued to bona fide purchasers and holders of the general or second mortgage bonds, issued as a part of said plan of reorganization; saving, also, all other rights whieh may have accrued under said reorganization to any other parties acting in good faith and without notice of any invalidity in the proceedings of said committee with relation to said reorganization.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">And, after instructing the receiver to send to all former creditors of the New England Oil Corporation, whose claims have been approved and allowed, an order of notice (prescribing what it should contain), the court further ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">\u201c(8) The expenses incurred by the receiver in printing the opinion, decree, and order of notice, and mailing the same, shall, as soon as may be, be presented by him to the New England Oil-Refining Company, whieh shall forthwith pay the same in accordance with the order and/or stipulation of September 24, 1923, referred to on page \u2014 of the opinion of October 3, 1925. The court will entertain an appropriate application of the receiver for compensation for services to be rendered by him, and for orders for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>like payment from the Refining Corhpany. The question of the committee\u2019s ultimate liability for all such expenditures is, as set forth in said opinion, reserved. But it will be the duty of the receiver to bring this matter to the court\u2019s attention seasonably before final decree in this court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">It is the orders or decrees embraced in clauses (1) and (8) above stated that the present petitioners claim are final orders or decrees from which they are entitled to appeal. The \u201corder and/or stipulation of September 24, 1923,\u201d above referred to as being s\u00e9t out in the opinion of October 3, 1925, is explained on page 94'of the record in this ease, as follows^</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201cThe receiver has now no \u25a0 assets in his possession. A decree was entered on September 24, 1923, making the Refining Company a party to the proceedings,/ and directing the receiver to transfer -to the Refining Company the remaining assets in his hands, under a stipulation and/or order that the Refining Company should assume payment hy it of any further compensation to, or expense incurred by, the receiver and approved by the court. This order and/or stipulation became, therefore, potentially, an asset of .the receivership estate, to the extent of liability of the Refining Company under order of court to reimburse the receiver for any expense incurred or compensation awarded for further services. The expense of printing and service, and of the receiver\u2019s services in relation thereto, will, on approval by the court, be ordered to be paid primarily by the Refining Company, reserving the question of the committee\u2019s ultimate liability therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">It is apparent therefore that that portion of the decree of October 7, 1925, embodied in clause (8), was hot a final decree, first, because it was not capable of immediate execution, as it did not state the sum which the New England Oil-Refining Company was to pay to the receiver. It had not been ascertained. Secondly, it was not a final decree, for it expressly provided that the question of \u201cultimate liability\u201d for these expenses was reserved for future determination. It was at most a provisional order and interlocutory in its nature.,</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The question remains whether the provisions of clause (1) in the decree of October 7, 1925, embody a final decree from which these petitioners may appeal. In that clause of the decree the court rescinded and vacated the decree of February 17, 1923, approving the plan of reorganization submitted by the committee \u201cso <em>far as </em>such decree may affect the rights of Wiltsee and/or of any other creditors of said receivership estate who may hereafter join in these proceedings and be held entitled to rescind the settlement of the debt claims.\u201d As the petition of Wiltsee, filed nunc pro tune as of May 8,1924, did not ask that the decree of February 17, 1923, be vacated, and as it does not appear that any motion was made in behalf of Wiltsee asking for such an order, it is evident that the order contained in clause (1) of the decree was entered by the court of its own motion and must be so considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">As a subsidiary question to the main question, counsel for the petitioners have questioned the power of 'the court to vacate the decree of February 17, 1923, in whole or in part, on motion of Wiltsee or on its own motion, after the term at which it was entered had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">There is authority for the proposition that, where a decree in an equity proceeding has been procured through false representation or misrepresentation to the court, and would not have been entered except therefor, the court in which the decree was entered has power, even after the term, to vacate it on motion. See Winslow v. Staab, 242 F. 426, 431, 155 C. C. A. 202; United States ex rel. Fisher v. Williams, 67 F. 384. In the first of these eases it was pointed out that a court of equity, which could protect against a judgment obtained at law by fraud, accident, or mistake, was not powerless to relieve from a decree so obtained, and that the only question was whether the parties seeking the relief should be required to file a bill to set the deer\u00e9e aside, or whether the court had on motion power to .set it aside without filing of a bill, all the parties in interest being before it, and it was held that it had power to do so on motion. With this we are inclined to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">It is further contended by the present petitioners that, if a decree in an equity proceeding obtained by a false representation to the court may, after the term, be vacated on motion in that court as well as on an original bill, the parties being before it,, a decree vacating a prior decree, based upon a bill or motion asking for such relief, is a final decree, as it ends the proceeding instituted by the bill or motion. Hendryx v. Perkins, 114 F. 801, 808, 52 C. C. A. 435. That was a decision in the Court of Appeals for this circuit. In that case, after pointing out that the decree appealed from was entered on an original bill to impeach a prior decree for fraud, the court at page 808 said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>\u201cEven if the bill in- the proceeding appealed from had not been strictly original, and were only a bill of review, the decree, nevertheless, is, as we have shown, of such a character as to make it final. It leaves nothing further to be done in this cause. It reinstates the original suit on the pleadings as they appeared at the time of the hearing on bill and answer, and all other proceedings must be in that case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The action of Judge Anderson in entering of his own motion the order contained in clause (1) of the decree of October 7, 1925, vacating the prior decree presents a like situation to that before the court in Ilendryx v. Perkins. He initiated the proceeding and ended it by his decree. It was a final decree, and may be availed of by these petitioners as a basis of appeal, provided it impaired their rights under the decree vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">So far as the New England Oil-Refining Company is concerned, it seems clear that clause (1) of the decree, read in connection with Wiltsee\u2019s petition and the opinion of the court of October 3, 1925, did not diminish the rights of that company under the decree of February 17, 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Have the individual petitioners, the noteholders\u2019 committee, rights in the decree of February 17,1923, which were diminished or taken away by the decree of October 7, 1925? If they have not, the application for mandamus should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">It is evident that the proceeding brought by Wiltsee is in the interest of the estate of the New England Oil Corporation, and was brought by permission of the court to cover into that estate a sum of money sufficient to compensate it for damages it sustained at the hands of the noteholders\u2019 committee, out of which parties ultimately interested in the estate, and who have not participated or acquiesced in the fraud, may be compensated. It does not seek to have the assets of the estate that were turned over to the New England Oil-Refining Company under the reorganization plan returned, but seeks damages occasioned by the note holders\u2019 committee to the receivership estate through its fraud and mismanagement. So far as we can see on this record, clause (1) of the decree of October 7, 1925, in no way affects the obligation of the noteholders\u2019 committee to reimburse the receivership estate for their fraud. It simply affects the rights of creditors of the New England Oil Corporation to participate in the fund after it is covered into the receivership.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">We are, therefore of the opinion that, although the decree of October 7,1925, may be final in so far as it affects the receivership estate and the rights of creditors in the fund that may be covered into it, it is not appeal-able as respects the noteholders\u2019 committee, for that committee has no interest affected by that branch of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">The order is:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b371-13\">On Petition for Rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b371-14\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"A9q\">Since our opinion in this ease was handed down on November 16, 1925, the noteholders\u2019 committee have petitioned for a rehearing, claiming that we misapprehended the situation in concluding that the committee had no interest in the decree of February 17, 1923, that was affected by clause (1) of the decree of October 7, 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">,It is contended that, if clause (1) of the decree of October 7 is final, it concludes the committee from having the question of fraud found against them hereafter reviewed, unless they may now appeal from it. This is not so. Although the District Court has found that the committee through their fraud damaged the receivership estate of the Oil Corporation it has not determined the amount of damages. When that question is determined and fixed by a decree, it will then be open to the committee to appeal therefrom and have the question of fraud reviewed in this court, and if it should be held that there was no fraud, they clearly would not be harmed by clause (1) of the decree of October 7, so far as it vacated the decree of February 17, for they could not be required to pay anything to the receivership estate. If they have been guilty of fraud that has damaged the receivership estate, they are responsible thereto for all the damage they have occasioned it, without regard to whether the decree of February \u00cd7 is or is not vacated. The modification of that decree could have been made as well after it had been ascertained and decreed in the District Court what the receivership estate was damaged by their fraud as1 at the time it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">After the damage sustained is covered into the estate, it will go .to creditors of the estate who have not consented to the fraud, and any balance will belong to the stockholders of the Oil Corporation, on their obtaining a like modification of the decree of February 17 as respects them. The modification of the decree of February 17 is material only as releasing the creditors and stockholders of the Oil Corporation from being bound to take or keep the stock of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Oil-Refining Company in tire settlement of their claims with the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
