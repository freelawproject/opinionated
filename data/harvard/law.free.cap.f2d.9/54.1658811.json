The contention of the petitioner is that this instrument was a lease of the machine. The contention of the trustee is .that it was a conditional sale and, because it was pot filed for record, in accordance with the laws of Colorado, at the time the bankruptcy petition wa,s filed, he is entitled to retain and dispose of the machine as a part of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-24\">The statutes of, Colorado (Session Laws 1917, c. 43, \u00a7 17) provide that no conveyance \u201cof personal property intended by the parties to have the effect of a mortgage or lien upon such property\u201d \u2018 shall be valid against third persons unless possession be retained by the mortgagee or seller or the instrument be filed for record. Under the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St. \u00a7\u00a7 9585-9656) the trustee occupies the position of a creditor acquiring a lien when the bankruptcy petition was filed (section 47a as amended; Bailey v. Baker Ice Machine Co., 239 U. S. 268, 275, 36 S. Ct. 50, 60 L. Ed. 275; Collier on Bankruptcy [13th Ed.] p. 1053 et seq.), and \u201cthird person,\u201d under the Colorado statute; includes an assignee for the benefit of creditors in accordance with a state statute which was, \u201cin effect, a bankruptcy act\u201d (Clark v. Bright, 30 Colo. 199, 202, 69 P. 506). Therefore, if the instrument here involved is not a lease but is one having the effect of a mortgage or a lien, within the meaning of the state statute, it is void as against the trustee, because neither possession was retained nor retaken by the mortgagee nor was the instrument filed for record at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed and such possession came to the trustee. If the contract here is a conditional sale, then it had, under the Colorado decisions (which govern in this character of question, Bryant v. Swofford, 214 U. S. 279, 290, 291, 29 S. Ct. 614, 53 L. Ed. 997) the effect of a mortgage or lien within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>meaning of the above state statute (Turnbull v. Cole, 70 Colo. 364, 201 P. 887, 25 A. L. R. 1149; Coors v. Reagan, 44 Colo. 126, 132, 96 P. 966; Andrews v. Colo. Savings Bank, 20 Colo. 313, 36 P. 902, 46 Am. St. Rep. 291; George v. Tufts, 5 Colo. 162; also see Weber v. Diebold S. <em>&amp; </em>L. Co., 2 Colo. App. 68, 29 P. 747). Therefore, the sole question presented by this petition to revise is whether this instrument was a lease or was a contract of conditional sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The instrument is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">\u201cMachine Lease (Signed in Duplicate). \u201cGeneral Adding Machine Exchange Division of Burroughs Adding Machine Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">\u201cCity Denver, County Denver, Colo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">\u201cDate Dec. 16, 1922.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACU\">\u201cC.

It is designated \u201ca machine lease\u201d and the words \u201clease,\u201d \u201clessor,\u201d \u201clessee,\u201d \u201crentals,\u201d and \u201crent\u201d are frequently employed therein. While the use of these terms has an undoubted weight in determining the character of the instrument, it is not controlling. The governing consideration is the legal effect of the instrument as gathered from all of its provisions (Corbett v. Riddle, 209 F. 811, 126 C. C. A. 535, 4th Circuit; Andrews v. Colo. Savings Bank, 20 Colo. 313, 36 P. 902, 46 Am. St. Rep. 291). The substance of this instrument is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">It was executed December 16, 1922, and became effective by acceptance of the petitioner December 30, 1922. It provided for the possession and use in the bankrupt of the machine for a period ending November 1, 1923. $75 was paid upon execution of the agreement and $424.97 was to be paid during the above term in monthly installments of $47.22 each on the first day of the month beginning March 1, \u00cd923. Upon default of any such payments there was a right of repossession. The bankrupt was to pay taxes and keep the machine insured for the benefit of petitioner. One provision of the instrument is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">\u201cIt is hereby further agreed\" that said lessee shall have the right of option to purchase said leased adding machines upon the termination of this, or at any time prior thereto, by paying to said lessor the sum of $47.22 in addition to the full amount of rentals hereinbefore agreed to be paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN5\">This quotation reveals that the machine was valued- at the total of the initial payment ($75), the entire \u201crental\u201d ($424.97) and an additional payment of $47.22, or $547.19 in all. The right to purchase at any time during the \u201clease\u201d by paying this total sum is expressly given and the initial payment plus the monthly \u201crentals\u201d covers the entire cost price of the machine except the final payment of $47.22, which is the same in amount as a single monthly payment. The practical effect of these provisions is that the \u201clessee\u201d on payment of seventy-five dollars secures the right to purchase the machine either on a monthly payment basis, or at any time before November 2, 1923, by payment of the balance of an entire stated purchase price. There is no absolute sale because he is not obligated by the contract to pay the entire sum but he does start out with a substantial advance payment and obligates himself to continue such monthly payments until the purchase price is practically all paid within a period of slightly more than ten months. The final payment, which is nominally the purchase price, is so small in comparison with the entire purchase price as, to leave no real choice to the \u201clessee.\u201d The obvious purpose was to dispose of the machine under such conditions that when the \u201clessefe\u2019! had paid the \u201crental\u201d he could not afford to fail the relatively small,final payment to obtain it. This would have been the obvious and natural, if not the inevitable, result. Evidently it was what the parties desired and intended to accomplish.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Another significant provision is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">\u201cThe lessee agrees that until the full payment of the said rent as aforesaid, the lessee will not injure, sell, dispose of, mortgage, relet, or in any wise incumber the said adding machines or remove same from Denver.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">To \u201csell, dispose of, mortgage, \u2022 * * or in any wise incumber\u201d are acts of ownership not of tenancy. They are inconsistent with and opposed to a leasing of this character of property. The statement concerning them would, in a legal sense, be pure surplusage except for the significant limitation of this inhibition contained in'the words \u201cuntil the full payment of the said rent\u201d\u2014 not until the full payment of the purchase price. The natural and proper inference and construction of this language is that when the full rental had been paid, the \u201clessee\u201d could incumber or sell the machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">This matter was presented to the referee and court on no evidence except the above instrument, therefore, it may be that there is an explanation for the rather unusual amounts ($424.97 and $47.22) expressed as the total \u201crental\u201d and the final purchase price. The exactness of each' suggests strongly that in reaching them so'me other total figure (a purchase price) was in mind or that interest on deferred payments may have been involved. The total sale price of $547.19 suggests a possible slight departure from a natural figure of $550. The speculative character of these last observations does not dispel the entirely natural scrutiny of such amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">The whole instrument shows a careful, studied attempt to give it the form and appearance of a lease;, but the obvious purpose and the natural effect thereof is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>consummate a conditional sale. We think the referee and the trial court properly defined the transaction to be such and correctly applied the law to such character of transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Therefore, the petition to revise should be and is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
