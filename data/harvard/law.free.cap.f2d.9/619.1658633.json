The District Court held that the description in the contract was too indefinite to warrant reclamation, and that the stipulation as to identity did not cure the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">A conditional sale in Tennessee, in so far as it stipulates for retention of title in the seller, is invalid, unless evidenced by a written contract or memorandum executed at the time of sale. Shannon\u2019s Code, \u00a7 3670al. The statute applicable to such sales was partially construed in Kenner <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. Peters, which involved the sale of \u201cone six-cylinder Chalmers car.\u201d The court of first instance in that case denied reclamation, because \u201cno such retention of title was shown for lack of description of the'automobile,-and because the clause in the notes which it is insisted constitutes said required written agreement was left blank as regards the thing to which title was intended to be retained.\u201d This ruling was reversed by the intermediate court, but the Supreme Court of the state, in 141 Tenn. 55, 206 S. W. 188, reinstated the judgment of the chancellor. It is not clear from the opinion as to what was in the mind of the court, or whether it intended to base its decision solely on the ground that the instrument was not a good conditional sales contract, because it \u201cwas left blank, as regards the thing to which title was intended to be retained.\u201d However, an indication is found in Russell v. Motor Co., 147 Tenn. 57, 245 S. W. 529, the only other case in which the statute has been before that court and in which the article sold was \u201cOne Briscoe automobile motor No.-,\u201d where reference was made to the former case, and it was pointed out that the description of the car in the ease under consideration \u201cseems scarcely sufficient under the holding in Kenner &amp; Co. v. Peters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_8C\">By construction of the state court the statute is analogous to the statute of frauds in respect to the description required. A sufficient description of land under the statute of frauds is one \u201cwhich on its face appears to refer to some definite tract, and which by the aid of parol proof can with reasonable certainty be applied to designate such tract.\u201d But \u201cthe descriptive terms employed, together with the parol proof, must be such as to point out and comprehend some special parcel of land to the exclusion of any other parcel of land.\u201d Case v. Brier Hill Collieries, 145 Tenn. 1,235 S. W. 57. A description applicable to two or more things would be deficient, and similarly so, though aided by admissible extrinsic evidence, if not such as would permit one to designate and fasten upon the thing described to the exclusion of all others. In the stipulation of facts it was agreed that there were many machines and stands identical in appearance with the one involved in this ease. Any one of them would necessarily come within the description in this contract, which was obviously too indefinite to meet the requirement that the entire contract be in writing. This lack of certainty, which readily could have been obviated by inserting the serial number in the sales contract, could not be supplied by extrinsic evidence or stipulation of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
