We do not see how in strictness it could be made otherwise, for technically no one could absolutely know that in some part of the United States there was \u2019 not another, during the time in question, applying to his seeds .the name \u201cHenderson.\u201d It cannot be presumed that the statute was such that it was impossible to give it effect through requiring proof which in strictest txuith the registrant could not make. The second objection is that the statement as to exclusive use was in the al-temative, i. e., that the use' was by applicant or his <em>predecessors from </em>whom title was deiived, without statement as to who the successors were; facts which, if appearing, might show that during part of the time in question the use was not exclusive, but was used contemporaneously by more than one of the registrant\u2019s predecessors in title. The obvious reply would seem to be that,the proof in this respect is made in the words of the statute, and, if the form employed ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>mits of such construction, the statute also would admit of it, and would authorize registration under such circumstances. In other words, the required statutory exclusiveness would be exclusiveness respecting all of those, whether one or more, who used it within the statutory time, and whose title had passed to the registrant. The third contention is that, in stating the requirement of the time of use, the registrant gave 40 years as the time it was used in its business, whereas the corporate registrant had not so long existed, but part of the time the use was by the two preceding successive partnerships. We do not think a registration otherwise good should be defeated by so strained a construction of the statute; and, respecting all of the objections, it may be said that no evidence was offered to show existence of any\" of the supposed possibilities which it is contended the proof for registration did not negative, and no attempt was ever made to cancel the registration. Besides, section 16 of the act (Comp. St. \u00a7 9501) provides that registration under the act shall be prima facie evidence of ownership. We are satisfied that the prima facie force of this registration has not been overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">The trade-mark registration being effective, was it transgressed by appellant\u2019s use of it? We think it clear that under the circumstances the employment of the name \u201cHenderson\u2019s Seed Store\u201d was in no sense necessary to insure to appellant the full opportunity to make use of his name in connection with his seed business. On principle as well as authority it is plain that he may not malte such unnecessary use of it as will interfere with the trade rights which another had theretofore lawfully secured. Without entering into prolonged discussion of the cases, we refer to Waterman Co. v. Modern Pen Co., 235 U. S. 88, 35 S. Ct. 91, 59 L. Ed. 142, and Thaddeus Davids Co. v. Davids Mfg. Co., 233 U. S. 461, 34 S. Ct. 648, 58 L. Ed. 1046, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 322, in the Supreme Court, and Chickering, etc., v. Chickering <em>&amp; </em>Sons, 215 F. 490, 131 C. C. A. 538, in this court, as indicating what our conclusion must be on the broad proposition of appellant\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">It is stressed in appellant\u2019s brief that appellant\u2019s good faith appears from the circumstances whereunder ho adopted the name \u201cHenderson\u2019s Seed Store\u201d; that it was taken without any reference to appellee, but came about naturally through having succeeded to \u201cWinterson\u2019s Seed Store,\u201d requiring only the change of the two first syllables of the Winterson name to make it \u201cHendersons\u201d; also that in Chicago it was quite the custom to designate such establishment by the owner\u2019s surname only prefixed to the words \u201cseed store.\u201d Such things may explain how it came about, and may tend to acquit appellant of moral turpitude in its use of the trade-marked name, but this in no manner minimizes the effect upon appellee\u2019s trade rights, nor its remedy for their invasion. Thaddeus Davids Co. v. Davids, supra. The use in appellant\u2019s business of the term \u201cHenderson\u2019s Seed Store,\u201d and applying it in any way to his products, infringes appellee\u2019s trade-mark, and should not be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">' As to use of the name of \u201cA. Henderson <em>&amp; </em>Co.,\u201d it might well be that, if associated only with the wholesale business, such business would not be in competition with appellee\u2019s strictly retail mail order business. But when in 1919 appellant entered the very same business in connection with which appellee\u2019s registration was procured, and operated in territory wherein appellee long had many customers, and carried on its wholesale and retail business in the same place which it called \u201cHenderson\u2019s Seed Store,\u201d a different situation at once arose. The buying public would not discriminate between \u201cA. Henderson <em>&amp; </em>Co.\u201d and \u201cHenderson\u2019s Seed Store\u201d'as to which was wholesale and which was retail. They were there together, apparently the same thing, and we must treat the name \u201cA. Henderson &amp; Co.\u201d as though it were being used for the same purpose, as was \u201cHenderson\u2019s Seed Store.\u201d Appellant\u2019s business is not a partnership, and no reason appears wherefore it is necessary to the proper use of his own name to add words or symbols which indicate a partnership which does not exist, but which, when added, make his trade-name more nearly like that of appellee. We are of opinion that the use of the initial \u201cA.\u201d preceding \u201cHenderson\u201d in connection with any part of appellant\u2019s seed business does not here, any more than in the Davids Case, avoid the conclusion of \u201ccolor-able imitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">While at best some confusion is incident to similarity of names, the requirement of the decree that, appellant\u2019s full given name or its suggested abbreviation precede his surname will tend better to safeguard appellee\u2019s rights, and at the same time impose no undue hardship or inconvenience to appellant. Nor is the decree objectionable in providing that the term \u201cHenderson\u201d shall not be employed by appellant in any name he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>may adopt for his seed 'packages. Appellee\u2019s lawful registry gives it the sole right to the employment of \u201cHenderson\u201d as a name for its seed product, and, where lawful right to label a product with the registered name has been secured, the same word should not be employed in any name-for another\u2019s like product where in reason this can be avoided. We likewise approve of the decree in so far as it makes provision-for the use of appellant\u2019s name in a partnership into which he may enter, or corporation which may succeed unto his business, save only that it would unduly restrict appellant to prevent use by a partnership of the ordinary words \u201c&amp; Company\u201d or \u201c&amp; Co.\u201d in connection with appellant\u2019s name, as the decree' authorizes him to use it. While appellee should be protected in its trade-mark rights, no undue restriction should be placed upon appellant in the business use of his own name. His partnership, if formed, may have the same reason for employing after his name the usual and ordinary indication of a partnership without setting forth the names of the other partners, as many another has done, and in this he should not be hindered. The protection of his interests does not, however, require that he be permitted to employ the ordinary partnership words after his name so long as he has no partner. What is said of a partnership name is likewise true as to corporate name. The use of the term \u201cCompany\u201d -or \u201cCo.\u201d to indicate a corporation is so usual and common that appellant should not be deprived of the right to this use in such a corporate relation, if he employs his own name as in the decree provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The decree is directed to be modified so as to permit the use of the term \u201c&amp; Co.\u201d or \u201c&amp; Company\u201d in an actual partnership, or \u201cCo.\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d in a corporation which may succeed unto his business, and with such modification the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
