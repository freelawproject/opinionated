The evidence was procured under a search made April 24, 1924, by officers who had in their possession two warrants, one of which was issued April 23 d and the other April 24th. A copy of neither was given to defendant, though the arresting officer testified that he offered defendant \u201ca search warrant, and he said he didn\u2019t care for it.\u201d Upon each of the warrants a return was made, showing that it was executed and the search made thereunder. Both were introduced in evidence by the defendant on his motion to suppress the evidence. The second warrant was defective, but the first complied with the requirements of the applicable statutes, and in view of the return thereon it will be presumed that the officers were acting under it when the search was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-25\">The affidavit for the warrant stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the property described was being used for \u201cthe unlawful possession and sale of liquor, to wit, whisky, spirits, etc., containing one-half of 1 per cent, or more of alcohol by volume for beverage purposes.\u201d -This was an allegation of fact, unlike the affidavit in Staker v. U. S. (C. C. A.) 5 F.(2d) 312, which alleged \u201cthat the affiant had reasonable ground to believe and did believe that intoxicating liquors were being sold, manufactured, disposed of, or illegally possessed in the house of the defendant.\u201d A majority of the court think the affidavit was sufficient to justify the issuance of the warrant, which, being valid, rendered the evidence procured thereunder admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The fine assessed under count 2, however should not have been imposed, because the' conviction on that count was included in the offense charged in count 3, upon which sentence was imposed. Reynolds v. U. S. (6 C. C. A.) 280 F. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The judgment is affirmed as to the first, third, and fourth counts, but the fine imposed under- count 2 will be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b86-6\">DONAHUE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AY8\">I concur in the judgment of affirmance, but for reasons other than 'those stated in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">It appears from the evidence that, when the defendant opened the door of his apartment in response to the officer\u2019s knock, Officer Plappert said to him, \u201cI believe you have got a still here.\u201d To this the defendant replied, \u201cYes; that is it upstairs in the attic.\u201d \"Whether this was said before or after the officer told defendant that he had a search warrant, and the defendant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t care for it,\u201d is unimportant, for the reason that the defendant further stated to the officers, in substance, that he had sold about 200 gallons Of whisky at $3.50 a gallon; that the customers came there after the liquor; that he had purchased the still from some unknown person for $70, and then offered to bribe the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">There is no contradiction in this record of the testimony of the officers in reference to the defendant\u2019s statements made at the time of search and seizure, and so far as it appears \u2022 from this record, these admissions of guilt by the defendant were purely voluntary, and conclusive proof of defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">For this reason the evidence of the officers in reference to the still and whisky found in the defend\u00e1nt\u2019s possession could not have been prejudicial, regardless of the validity or invalidity of one or both of the. search warrants. The still and whisky found by the officers in defendant\u2019s possession were not offered in evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
