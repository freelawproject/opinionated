Some of these alleged errors were not urged at the argument, and those of them which were urged, and which we think of sufficient importance to merit consideration, we shall pass upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-20\">The last of the errors assigned, and one which was urged at the argument, we shall consider first. It is said that the trial judge throughout the trial exercised his discretionary powers in a manner that was arbitrary and prejudicial to the defendants, \u201cby putting suggestive and leading questions to the government\u2019s witnesses, by restating and enlarging the import of testimony given by witnesses for the government and by commenting unfavorably and without justification upon questions put and testimony elicited by defendant\u2019s counsel.\u201d Nevertheless, in the brief submitted to this court, counsel say: \u201cWe, of course, admit that not only did the learned trial judge intend to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>scrupulously impartial, but also that the record shows that such was his intention.\u201d Counsel, however, think that the record discloses \u201csuch a degree of bias in the judge\u2019s comments upon the evidence and in his treatment of counsel as was certain to prejudice the jury,, and to prevent the impartial consideration by the jurors of the questions of credibility upon whieh the case necessarily turned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">We have read the charge to the jury with care. It was in all respects absolutely fair. The judge might have expressed his own opinion as to the guilt of the defendants, if he had instructed them that they were not bound by any opinion he entertained on that subject, but he scrupulously refrained from indicating in <em>the </em>slightest manner what his own opinion was, or whether he had any opinion on the subject. Only one exception was taken to the charge. It was to a refusal to charge in the manner requested, and the refusal was because the subject had been already fully covered by the charge; and we find no reference to the matter in the assignments of error. If error had been assigned, we should not hesitate to disregard it. We have examined the record with care, and we find nothing in it to indicate the bias and the prejudice to the defendants, or to their counsel, whieh warrants the conclusion that the defendants by the conduct of the judge were deprived of the fair and impartial trial to whieh they were entitled under the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The evidence discloses that the seven defendants, before referred to, left Italy on October 12, 1922, and they landed in Cuba. From there they went to Key West, in Florida, without passports to enter the United States. At Key West they were arrested and gave bonds for their appearance in New York for examination. They proceeded to New York City, where they met relatives and friends. Among those they met was one Di Salvo. He is engaged in the real estate business in New York City. He had known two of the seven aliens in Italy, and they came here from the same town he did. On their arrival in New York, they went to Di Salvo\u2019s place of business, and explained to him their troubles in Cuba and Key West, and asked his help to save them, if possible, from being deported to Italy. Di Salvo interested Philip Giordano, one of the appellant defendants. He explained to him the situation in which these Italians found themselves. Giordano was 35 years old, and had been in this country 19 years. He is the publisher of an Italian daily newspaper, a graduate of an Italian University holding a degree in chemistry, and was regarded as having some political influence, at one time being president of the Italian National Republican League; and his testimony shows that he was known to the officials in. the Department of Labor at Washington. Witnesses testified at the trial that his reputation for honesty and truthfulness was very good. Among those so testifying was a judge of the Court of Special Sessions of the city of New York, as well as a justice of the Supreme Court of the state of New York. Di Salvo testifies that Philip Giordano told him he would try and h.elp these aliens out of their difficulties, and told him that he was to be in Washington on a certain day and asked him to meet him there. Di Salvo met him as agreed upon, and Giordano took him to the Department of Labor and showed him the files of the department, and that the aliens had been ordered deported, and that nothing could be done. Di Salvo testifies that a week later he again met Giordano in New York and told him that the aliens were willing to go to Mexico, if they could save themselves from being deported; that Giordano told him he would try to send them to Canada, but, if they wanted to go there, it would cost them for all seven $2,000. Di Salvo says he explained the situation to the aliens, and they stated that they were willing to go to Canada, if that would save them from being deported. The money was raised, and Mastrogiacomo, a brother of ,one of the seven indicted aliens, accompanied by Di Salvo, took the money to Philip Giordano\u2019s residence and left it there for him with his father \u2014 Giordano being at the time absent. Later Di Salvo stated he met Giordano himself, who told him that the $2,000 was not enough, and that it would be necessary to have more money. And it appears that each of the seven paid the additional money, and that it was paid to Giordano\u2019s father. Philip Giordano, according to Di Salvo, explained that the aliens could go to Montreal, Canada, and come back to the United States in a few days. The seven aliens thereafter, by direction of Philip Giordano, went to the Italian consul, and obtained their passports for Canada. They were accompanied to Canada by Alfred Giordano, one of the appellants, and a younger brother of Philip Giordano, and who two days later came back with them to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">The testimony was that Alfred Giordano told the immigration inspector at Canada that his name was C. Morasco, that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>a lawyer, and that he was taking the seven Italians into Canada to purchase jointly a farm, and that they intended to remain there and engage in farming. He also represented that the aliens had been in the United States several years, having entered in 1910 and 1911. The Canadian inspector ^passed them into Canada, hut directed them to report to him at the end of two days regarding their progress in purchasing a farm. Two days later the Canadian inspector and the United States inspector found Alfred Giordano and the seven Italians on a train returning to the United States. Alfred Giordano informed the United States inspector that he was a lawyer from New York City by the name of C. Morasco, and represented the aliens, and they were returning from Montreal where they had gone to purchase a shoe business, and that they had been in the United States from eight to ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Di Salvo testified that, after he returned to New York from Washington, he had an interview with Philip Giordano, and was told by him that he would try to send the aliens to Canada. The following is an excerpt from his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-6\">\u201cQ. Now, tell the jury what happened next. A. Then, if they want to go to Canada, they can go at their own expense, but it would cost them $2,000 for all seven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-7\">\u201cQ. This is a conversation had with Philip Giordano and you? A. Mr. Philip Giordano and Antonio Mastrogiaeomo. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-8\">\u201cQ. What was done next? A. Then those people, they go together, the aliens; they go and get that $2,000 ready. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-9\">\u201cQ. You had a conversation with Philip Giordano after that? A. He told me that the $2,000 was not enough, and it would cost them $500 each.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-10\">\u201cQ. Philip Giordano told you? A. Philip Giordano told me; I went then and reported all that to these aliens, and they agreed to pay the $500 each.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-11\">\u201cQ. Did you ask Philip Giordano whether or not he received $2,000 when you spoke to him? \u00ae * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-12\">\u201cQ. Did you ask Mr. Giordano? A. He told me the $2,000 was not enough, and they had to pay the balance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-13\">\u201cQ. Listen to my question. Did you ask him if he received $2,000 that you gave Vincent Giordano? A. I didn\u2019t ask him anything, but he told me that the $2,000 he had was not enough.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">Angelo Mielle testified to a visit he paid to Philip Giordano at the latter\u2019s house in the interest of these Italians. The following is an excerpt from his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-16\">\u201cWhat did he [Philip Giordano] say? A. Pirst he said, \u2018What do you fellows come up here for? What are you fellows here for?\u2019 \u2018We are here to decide what we are going to do with these men.\u2019 I said, \u2018I got to advance $500 of my money, and I am afraid of this man running away and I got to pay.\u2019 He said, \u2018I am ready for it as soon as you pay my money.\u2019 Then I said, \u2018At first you got $2,000, I understand Di Salvo gave you $2,000; that was enough money.\u2019 Then he said, \u2018No; that ain\u2019t enough money, because I had to pay more money to Washington. I was just come from Washington last night, and I got to pay more money. They need more money. They got to go to Canada and come back.\u2019 I said, \u2018That is too much money.\u2019 I said to Antonio Mastrogiaeomo, \u2018That is too much money for this man.\u2019 I said, \u2018Might as well let that go and we will hold our bonds to the government, and let the government decide what they are going to do, send them back to Italy or remain here.\u2019 So Antonio Mastrogiaeomo said, \u2018No, what for?\u2019 He said, \u2018We had better pay a little more money than it is to do what they are going to do.\u2019 So we went up to Joe Di Salvo and report the same night with all six immigrants. I say' \u2014 first, I said, \u2018No; don\u2019t do it, that cost too much money.\u2019 So all together then they said, \u2018We are willing for all the money and we want to stay ourselves.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-17\">\u201cQ. Why did they want to pay all the money? A. To save themselves to remain in the United States. So in the same evening we make arrangement what time we will bring the amount up to Mr. Giordano\u2019s house. Mr. Giordano said, \u2018Come around, say half past 8 or 9 o\u2019clock.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-18\">\u201cQ. At his house? A. At his house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-19\">\u201cQ. The following day, the next day? A. The next day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-20\">\u201cQ. Did you go around the next day? A. Yes, sure; the same morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-21\">\u201cQ. Did you give the money \u2014 was the money given in your presence? A. There was the money given in my presence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-22\">He went on to state that the next morning he and Antonio Mastrogiaeomo and the seven Italians met Philip Giordano at his house, and that the latter said the plan was to take the men to Canada and then bring them back. Mielle asked him: \u201cHow are you going to get there and back?\u201d He said: \u201cThis is our business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-23\">The immigration inspector for the Canadian government testified that on March 11, 1923, he found these seven aliens on a Delaware &amp; Hudson train on their way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>to Montreal, and with them was Alfred Giordano, one of the defendants. This is an extract from his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-4\">\u201cQ. Just tell us now what was said\u2014 what your examination consisted of. A During the examination of that train, 1 found seven aliens and another gentleman, who gave his name as C. Moraseo, a lawyer of New York City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-5\">\u201cQ. You see that man now? A. Yes; in the second chair there (indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">\u201cQ. The second man, the same man you identified before? A. The same gentleman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">\u201cQ. Alfred Giordano? A. He gave his name as Moraseo, and told me he was bringing these seven aliens to Canada to purchase a farm, joint farm, a large farm, and that they would remain there and engage in farming. I escorted the seven aliens and the gentleman who gave his name as Moraseo to our immigration office in Montreal, where I made a manifest of each of the seven Italians. I told them that they could remain there for two days, except Mr. Moraseo, who represented himself to be a lawyer, and at the expiration of that time they would report to me as to what their progress in purchasing this farm was. Two days later, while returning from Montreal to the States, I was called into the Pullman car on the morning train and asked by Inspector Yale, of the United States Immigration Service, if I could identify these men.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abne\">He was very positive in his identification of the defendant Alfred Giordano as being with the men and representing himself as a lawyer. His testimony was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-8\">\u201cQ. You could not be mistaken as to your identity, could you? A. Not in the slightest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-9\">\u201cQ. Positive of it? A. Positive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-10\">\u201cQ. Did you see him several times while be was there? A. Yes; we went to breakfast together, and after that I escorted him\u2014 I showed him, and we went to the Plaza Hotel, Montreal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-11\">\u201cQ. So you are certain it is the man? A. I was with him for probably two or three hours that morning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">The immigration inspector for the United States discovered these men in a Pullman car returning to the United States two days after their entry into Canada. He also identified Alfred Giordano. They were on a Delaware &amp; Hudson train, coming out from Montreal. His testimony was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-13\">\u201cQ. Did you have a conversation with any of them? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-14\">\u201cQ. With whom? A. I was in charge as train inspector coming out from Montreal to House\u2019s Point. I went through the two coaches and then into the parlor car. Upon arrival in the parlor ear I met him \u2014 inspected him \u2014 this gentleman there (indicating), which he presented with a card by the name of C. Moraseo. He said he was an attorney from New York, representing seven Italians that were riding in the parlor car. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-16\">\u201cQ. What was said? A. He said that these Italians were returning from Montreal; that they went to Montreal on the morning of the 11th to purchase some business up there. He represented to me as the business \u2014 in the shoe business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-17\">\u201cQ. Yes. A. I asked him how long they had been in the country; he said all the way from eight to ten years, living at New York, Hoboken, and Jersey City. I asked them if they had their Italian passports, and went to each one, and they had Italian passports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-18\">\u201cQ. Did the passports corroborate the statement that they were in the country as a matter of fact for these various numbers of years? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-19\">\u201cQ. And you permitted them to come in? A. I permitted them to return to the United States, if they were legally admitted to the United States in the first place. Mr. Atkinson was on the same train. I went and got Mr. Atkinson (the Canadian inspector) to come into the parlor car with me to identify the same Italians he admitted on the morning of the 11th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-20\">\u201cQ. Did he identify them? A. He identified them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-21\">\u201cQ. Did he identify the man who accompanied them on the train as the man who accompanied them on the way in? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-22\">Guiseppe Di Guglielmo, who was one of those indicted with the Giordanos, and who pleaded guilty, testified at the trial. His story was that he and the six Italians who came over with him, after they reached New York, went to see Giordano. The following are excerpts from his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-23\">\u201cQ. What was said? A. He asked me if I have any papers with me, a passport or something, and I say, \u2018No.\u2019 He said, \u2018What are you going to do ?\u2019 He says we will have to pay for it, and he will get it for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-24\">\u201cQ. What else, if anything, was said? A. So he told him, \u2018If you will make me a passport, I will pay you money.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-25\">\u201cQ. What else was said? A. He asked me for money first, and I said as soon as you get me a passport I will give you the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>\u201cQ. Did you give Mm the money? A. No; I didn\u2019t give him no money. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-5\">\u201cQ. When did you see Mr. Giordano again? A. I have seen Mr. Giordano a few days later. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-6\">\u201cQ. Did you give Mastrogiaeomo any money? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-7\">\u201cQ. How much? A. $285.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-8\">\u201cQ. Dor what purpose did you give him money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-9\">\u201cMr. Abrusso: Objected to as incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and not binding on the defendant Giordano.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-10\">\u201cThe Court: The objection will be sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-11\">\u201cQ. Was anything said about money when you saw Giordano this first time? A. Sure, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-12\">\u201cQ. What was said? A. Giordano told us that he wants $2,000 for the seven people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-13\">\u201cQ. Which Giordano? (Witness indicates.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-14\">\u201cMr. Cotter: Indicating Philip Giordano.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-16\">\u201cQ. For seven people he was to get $2,-000? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-17\">\u201cQ. After that you gave $285 to Mastrogiaeomo? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-18\">\u201cQ. When did you see Giordano next? A. Three or four days later I seen him again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-19\">\u201cQ. Where? A. In his office. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-20\">\u201cQ. What was said on that occasion by any of those persons? A. He says that he wants another $215 for one of us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-21\">\u201cQ. For each one? A. For each one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-22\">\u201cQ. What did you do after you learned that? A. We gave them the money, to be sure about it, that we would stay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-23\">\u201cQ. What is that? A. We will be sure we will remain here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-24\">\u201cQ. In the United States? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-25\">\u201cQ. Did you give $215 extra? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-26\">\u201cQ. To whom? A. I paid $215 to a brother of the father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-27\">\u201cQ. The father of Giordano? A. Yes; the father of Giordano.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-28\">\u201cQ. Were any of these two men here, Philip or Alfred, present at the time? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-29\">\u201cQ. Which one or both? A. The second; Philip was the name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-30\">\u201cQ. Alfred? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-31\">\u201cThe Court: Which was it \u2014 the second one, or Philip?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-32\">\u201cMr. Abrusso: The second.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-33\">\u201cThe Court: Does he say the second?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-34\">\u201cThe Interpreter: Yes, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-35\">\u201cQ.

He wants $500 for one more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-45\">\u201cQ. Apiece? A. Apiece.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-46\">\u201cQ. Did you give the additional money? A. Yes; I paid afterwards another $215.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-47\">\u201cQ. That made $500 in all? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-48\">\u201cQ. And it was after that you went to Canada? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-49\">On his cross-examination he testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-50\">\u201cQ. Did you have your own money? A. Yes; my cousin gave me this money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-51\">\u201cQ. What cousin gave it to you? A. Joseph Cianculli.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-52\">\u201cQ. Did he loan it to you? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-53\">\u201cQ. How much did you have of this $500 of your own money? A. I did not have nothing; he gave me the money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-54\">Joseph Cianculli testified for the government. He stated that he was a first cousin of Guglielmo, whose testimony wo have just quoted, and that he gave his cousin $285. The following is an excerpt from his further testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-55\">\u201cQ. What did he say to you when you met him the next time ? A. He said ho gave $285 to go to Canada. After that M.r. Giordano \u2014 Mr. Di Salvo asked all -these men \u2014 \u25a0 Mr. Di Salvo say Mr. Giordano says some more money, and my cousin asked me for another $215 for giving Mr. Giordano.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-56\">\u201cQ. Did you give it to him? A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-57\">\u201cQ. In all you gave him $500? A. $500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-58\">\u201cQ. Guglielmo told you he gave $285 to Giordano; is that right? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-59\">\u201cQ. Are you sure of that? A. I gave it to him; he told me he gave it to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-60\">\u201cQ. He told you he wanted $285 to give to Giordano? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>\u201cQ. And you gave him $285? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-4\">\u201cQ. And Guglielmo came back and told you that he gave $285 to Giordano? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-5\">\u201cQ. Now you are sure of that, aren\u2019t you? A. I \"am sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-6\">\u201cQ. You are positive that Guglielmo told you that? A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-7\"> It is claimed that this testimony was erroneously admitted, and that Cianeulli should not have been permitted to state what Guglielmo told him he had done with the money. But the testimony shows that Guglielmo was a party to the conspiracy, and the record discloses that he had entered a plea of guilty to the indictment. Evidence of his acts and declarations in carrying or attempting to carry into effect the conspiracy was competent as against the defendants. Clune v. United States, 159 U. S. 590, 593, 16 S. Ct. 125, 40 L. Ed. 269. And as Guglielmo\u2019s acts and .declarations were admissible as .against the appellants, there can be no question as to the right of the court to admit in evidence the statements made to Cianeulli as to what Guglielmo did with the money which Cianeulli gave him to enable him to accomplish the objects of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">It appears Di Salvo was allowed to testify to a transaction which occurred after the aliens returned from Canada and the conspiracy was at an end. They returned in March, and the testimony objected \"to related to a matter which happened some time in the following April, when he met Philip Giordano. It appears that one Sanitario, of this party of Italians, declined to pay $500 put up by each of the others, and did not go with them to Canada. But after the aliens came back from Canada the testimony was he decided to pay $500 and go. Then he changed his mind again, and reported to the Commissioner of Immigration what Giordano had done. Di Salvo testified he thought it might have been in April that Philip Giordano sent for him, and that the following conversation occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-9\">\u201cQ. Will' you tell the jury what then he said? A. Then Mr. Giordano sent for me; it was right in his place, in his office; it was a hurry call. I went down there and found Antonio Sanitorio there with one of his brothers-in-law. Mr. Giordano gave him $500 before me, which he took then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-10\">\u201cQ. Philip Giordano?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-11\">\u201cMr. Abrusso: I move to strike all that out as not connected with this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-12\">\u201cThe Court: The objection will be overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-13\">\u201cMr. Abrusso: Exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-14\">\u201cQ. Go ahead. A. Well, he gave this Sanitario $500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-15\">\u201cQ. Philip Giordano gave $500 to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-16\">\u201cMr. Abrusso: He said Sve.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-17\">' \u201cThe Witness: Giordano gave to Sanitario $500 before me. I did not count the money, but it was all right; but it was $500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-18\">\u201cQ. What else was said? A. That was all; then we went home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-19\">\u201cQ. You say he told you about trouble; what did he tell you about trouble? A. This Sanitario had reported all that Giordano did to the Commissioner of Immigration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-20\">\u201cQ. What is that? A. That Giordano took $500 from him; that he had to send those fellows up to Canada; and then Sanitario he changed his mind after, and he reported all these troubles to the Commissioner of Immigration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-21\">As the conspiracy was terminated in March, this testimony as to the payment of $500 by Giordano in April was inadmissible. Assuming that Sanitario had paid $500 to Giordano, he paid it after the conspiracy charged in the indictment had terminated by the return of the aliens from Canada in March. The testimony, both as to what Giordano said that Sanitario said and as to the return of the money, is irrelevant, as not being connected with the conspiracy charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-22\">In United States v. Gooding, 12 Wheat. 460, 469, 6 L. Ed, 693, Mr. Justice Story, writing for the court in 1827, said: \u201cIn eases of conspiracy, * * * when once the conspiracy is established, the act of one conspirator, in the prosecution of the enterprise, is considered the act of all, and is evidence against all. Each is deemed to consent to, or command, what is done by any other, in furtherance of the common object.\u201d But it is equally well settled that, upon an indictment for conspiracy, the acts or declarations of one conspirator, made after a conspiracy has ended, are not admissible in evidence against the other conspirators. Logan v. United States, 144 U. S. 263, 309, 12 S. Ct. 617, 36 L. Ed. 429; Brown v. United States, 150 U. S. 93, 98, 14 S. Ct. 37, 37 L. Ed. 1010; Fain v. United States, 209 <em>F. </em>525, 126 C. C. A. 347; People v. McQuade, 110 N. Y. 284, 307, 18 N. E. 156, 1 L. R. A. 273. This court has had occasion to apply the rule last stated. See Erber v. United States, 234 F. 221, 228, 148 C. C. A. 123; Feder v. United States, 257 F. 694, 696, 168 C. C. A. 644, 5 A. L. R. 370; De Luca v. United States (C. C. A.) 299 F. 741, 745. See, too, Marshall v. United States, 197 F. 511, 117 C. C. A. 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>But in the eases in which we have reversed because of the admission of such evidence it has been for the reason that upon the record we were unable to say that the testimony was not prejudicial. In the ease now under consideration it appears to us perfectly clear that the inadmissible testimony was not prejudicial. It is quite true that it should not have been received, but that the verdict of the jury was in the least degree affected by it is to us inconceivable. Di Salvo\u2019s previous testimony as to the payment of $2,000 and the subsequent statement of Philip Giordano that the amount was not enough, and his demand for $500 more from each alien, that they were to go to Canada and in a few days return, confirmed in its essentials as it was by the testimony of other witnesses, made it impossible, if the jury believed Di Salvo at all, to reach any other verdict than the one they returned. Aeeocella testified to a conversation with Philip Giordano, in his presence, that he wanted $2,000, and to the payment of that amount, and to the trip to Canada. Di Guglielmo testified that Philip Giordano in Ms presence said he wanted \u201c$2,000 for the seven people,\u201d and subsequently that he wanted $215 more for each one. Mielle\u2019s testimony is that the money was paid in his presence in Philip Giordano\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">What difference could it possibly make that Di Salvo testified that Philip Giordano subsequently paid back $500 to Sanitario? Irrespective of that testimony, the evidence was abundant of the fact of the conspiracy and of the guilt of both defendant appellants. It could have worked no harm, and to reverse on that account simply tends to increase discontent with the administration of criminal justice in the United States. A judgment will not be reversed because of the erroneous admission of evidence, where the legal evidence abundantly establishes the ease, or where it is apparent that the verdict would or must have been the same had the evidence not been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The Supreme Court in Williamson v. United States, 207 U. S. 425, 431, 28 S. Ct. 163, 172 (52 L. Ed. 278) quotes approvingly from Holmes v. Goldsmith, 147 U. S. 150, 164, 13 S. Ct. 288, 292, 37 L. Ed. 118, the following passage: \u201cCourts of error are specially unwilling to reverse eases because unimportant and possibly irrelevant testimony may have crept in, unless there is reason to think that practical injustice has been thereby caused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">MANTON, Circuit Judge (dissenting). Judge ROGERS\u2019 carefully prepared opinion concedes the error of the admission of the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-11\">\u201cQ. When did you next meet Philip Giordano? A. The next time I met him was he had some trouble with Giovanni Sanitario.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-12\">\u201cThe Court: Has Giovanni Sanitario got anything to do with this ease?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-13\">\u201cMr. Cotter: He is not mentioned in the indictment, if your honor please, but he also was being considered..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-14\">\u201cThe Court: Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-15\">\u201cQ. What conversation did you have with Philip Giordano at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-16\">\u201cMr. Abrusso: May we fix the time at this time \u2014 about April 5th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-17\">\u201cThe Court: Fix the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-18\">\u201cThe Witness: I said about a month after \u2014 six weeks after.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-19\">\u201cMr. Abrusso: Some time in April.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-20\">\u201cThe Witness: Some time in April might be; I don\u2019t remember the date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-21\">\u201cQ. Will you tell the jury what then he said? A. Then Mr. Giordano sent for me; it was right in his place, in his office; it was a hurry call. I went there and found Antonio Sanitorio (sic?) there with one of his brothers-in-law. Mr. Giordano gave him $500 before me, which he took then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-22\">\u201cQ. Philip Giordano?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-23\">\u201cMr. Abrusso: I move to strike all that out as not connected with this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-24\">\u201cThe Court: The objection will be overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-25\">\u201cMr. Abrusso: Exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-26\">This transaction took place after the conspiracy was carried out by the return from Canada of the seven aliens mentioned in the indictment. To allow it to appear that Giordano was engaged in a similar unlawful act, and in this instance giving back $500 to Sanitario, who was not in any way connected with the charge of the indictment, was creating an atmosphere prejudicial to the plaintiffs in error. After the arrest of the Italian aliens, and some weeks after the consummation of the conspiracy, the plaintiffs in error are made to appear that they repaid Sanitario $500, which he is assumed to have given them. It is an elementary rule that a defendant may not be convicted of a crime charged in an indictment by showing that he had committed other crimes. Evidence of like character has repeatedly been held to be prejudicial and to require a reversal. Erber v. U. S., 234 F. 221, 148 C. C. A. 123; Wolf v. U. S. (C. C. A.) 290 F. 738; Marshall v. U. S., 197 F. 511, 117 C. C. A. 65. To prove that plaintiffs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>error had a similar transaction with Sanitario, and were now caught paying him back his money, is anything but a harmless piece of testimony. It put them in the position of accepting money in a similar transaction in return for alleged political \u201cfixing,\u201d and, now that discovery was at hand, they were admitting guilt by paying back Sanitario. This is not the kind of error that we may call harmless or unprejudicial. Scheinberg v. United States, 213 F. 757, 130 C. C. A. 271, Ann. Cas. 1914D, 1258; MacDonald v. United States (C. C.
