Shortly before collision, there were in the river .at the same time and .within signaling dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>tance of each other the following vessels: The libelant\u2019s tug O\u2019Brien, light, and bound from Gansevoort street, Manhattan, to the Wallabout. Of her it is most positively asserted by her navigator that she left the pier, and went out to the <em>middle of the river, </em>and then straightened out on her course downstream. Also the claimant\u2019s tug Diamond S., which had come in from the East River bound for Seventeenth street, Hobo-ken, a spot considerably lower down the river than Gansevoort street. Her navigator declared that his course was upstream and about 600 feet from the Manhattan pier line. <em>Next </em>the tug Madison, with a car float on her port side, bound from the Hoboken float bridge to Pier 41, Leroy street, Manhattan, a point more than a dozen blocks below Gansevoort street and nearly opposite the Hoboken float bridge. Lastly the \"West Shore ferryboat Weehawken, bound up the river to her New Jersey slip, about opposite Forty-Ninth street, Manhattan.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">There is no doubt that, after certain exchanges of signals between these vessels, or some of them, a collision ensued between O\u2019Brien and Diamond S., at a place off a point on the Manhattan shore somewhere between Piers 36 and 38. It does not seem to us important to fix this place more exactly, but it is most important that <em>both sides agree </em>that contact occurred not over 600 feet from the Manhattan pier line. In other words, in order to get into collision, the O\u2019Brien had, according to her own story, come in from the middle of the river, and by both stories the Diamond S. was hit in the path which her own witnesses declare had been her course on entering the North River. Finally it is agreed that Diamond S. hit O\u2019Brien on the starboard side, about 10 feet abaft the stem, and so injured the O\u2019Brien that she sank. The angle of collision does not accurately appear, but was quite wide.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The O\u2019Brien, starting from Gansevoort street, could and did look downstream on the other vessels. She blew two whistles to Madison, received an assenting answer, \u201cstarboarded a little, * * * just a couple of spokes,\u201d and passed the bows of the Madison and her float. At this time, says O\u2019Brien\u2019s navigator, he saw Diamond S. and Weehawken coming up the river, with the ferryboat astern of the tug.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Down to this point there is no serious conflict between the stories of the two tugs, but O\u2019Brien\u2019s mate (who was in charge) next asserts that the Weehawken was nearer the New York shore than the Diamond S.; that the tug was \u201cheaded to New Jersey,\u201d and was on O\u2019Brien\u2019s starboard side. In this position of vessels, and when O\u2019Brien was off Pier 39, the Weehawken blew him (O\u2019Brien) two whistles, to which he replied with two and starboarded his wheel a little more; whereupon Diamond S. \u201cstraightened up and headed right for New York,\u201d and ran into collision with O\u2019Brien at the place above set forth. According to this story, Diamond S. gave no signal, except a \u201ctoot,\u201d just before contact. Why this \u201ctoot\u201d no one explains. The violent change of course on Diamond\u2019s part was made when the vessels were about 30 feet apart, whereupon O\u2019Brien reversed at full speed before contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">This story is not attractive. O\u2019Brien\u2019s speed does not appear, but she started from over 500 yards out in the river, and got within less than 600 feet of the Manhattan shore, in order to get into collision, and did it without descending the river more than about 500 feet. This is more than unlikely; also the maneuver ascribed to Diamond S. is a strain on credulity. To swing across the ebb tide certainly 6 and perhaps 8 points, while moving no more than 30 feet, is a stiff story, and we do not believe it.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">We accept in the main the evidence from claimant\u2019s tug, viz. that the O\u2019Brien was coming in from the middle of the river, and when the tugs saw each other they were substantially head and head, as O\u2019Brien\u2019s mate testified before the local inspectors. The \u201ctoot\u201d was a signal of one blast, demanding a port to port passage. We think the court below was misled by the evidence as to whistles blown by the Weehawken. It was an unnatural thing for the O\u2019Brien to blow two whistles to the Weehawken, when the latter vessel was astern of the Diamond S.; but by his own statement he did it. The Weehawken blew two whistles to the Diamond S. for leave to overtake and pass, and claimant\u2019s tug assented by whistle. The testimony about these whistles certainly misled the court below, who thought that a starboard to starboard passage was agreed on. This is not the evidence; no one from O\u2019Brien asserted that that tug ever blew two whistles to Diamond S.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">We believe that it was true, as stated by both navigators before the inspectors, that the meeting was substantially head and head, the natural passing was port to port, and O\u2019Brien sheered across the bow of the other tug. Even were we not persuaded of this, it is clear that O\u2019Brien has not sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>her case by a fair preponderance of credible testimony; wherefore her libel ought to have been dismissed.
