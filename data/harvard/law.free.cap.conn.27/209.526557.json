The agreement was after-wards by mutual consent extended for one year. No land was sold before the expiration of the six years, and at the expiration of that period it could not have been sold for enough to pay the capital of A with interest. A did not insist that B should purchase the lands according to the terms of the agreement, and B did <em>not </em>demand of A that the lands should be sold in order to ascertain whether there would be a surplus of profits. Three years after-wards B, without any authority except that contained in the agreement, which remained in his hands uncanceled, commenced selling the lands, and for several years continued to sell them, transmitting to A the proceeds thereof. B however did deduct and retain from the proceeds certain charges which were in fact for personal services within the meaning of the contract though he did not so regard them. Upon these facts it was held\u2014that the contract was not broken by B ; that it had not ceased to be operative by its own limitation or otherwise ; that the sales were to be regarded as made under the contract; and that B was entitled to one-half of the surplus profit\u201d according to the terms of the contract, his charges for personal services being disallowed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-5\">Assumpsit upon a note for one thousand dollars, dated October 27th, 1854.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-6\">The material facts, as found by an auditor to whom the case was referred, were as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-7\">On the 16th day of August, 1836, the plaintiff and defendant entered into a written agreement of the following tenor. \u201cWhereas Henry L.

Hartford, August 16th, 1836. Henry L. Ellsworth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAv\">The title to the parcels of land mentioned in the agreement became vested in Watkinson. The agreement was by mutual consent extended for one year. None of the land was sold by Ellsworth before the expiration of six years from the date of the writing, and at the end of the six years the land could not have been sold for enough to pay Watkinson\u2019s advancement with six per cent, interest. At the end of the six years Watkinson did not insist on Ellsworth\u2019s purchasing the land according to the provision in the agreement, nor did Ellsworth demand of Watkinson that the land should be sold, to ascertain whether there would be a surplus of profits or to obtain such profits as are specified in the agreement. On the 13th of October, 1845, Ellsworth, without any authority except that contained in the agreement, which remained in his hands uncanceled, commenced the sale of the land, and from time to time for a number of years transmitted to Watkinson accounts of the sales and of his receipts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>charges, and transmitted also the moneys in his hands accruing from the sales.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\">The auditor found that, by virtue of the agreement above set forth, Watkinson, after the expiration of the six years, held the title to the lands for the benefit of Ellsworth as well as of himself until the lands should be disposed of by sale or otherwise, and that when the lands were disposed of, as it was admitted that they were, by the mutual consent of both parties, Ellsworth, by force of the agreement, became entitled to the surplus, if any, specified in the agreement, and that Ells-worth never relinquished his right to the surplus, and that Watkinson never by any act or declaration revived any right in Ellsworth to such surplus, if such right had, as the plaintiff claimed, expired or been lost. The only evidence upon which the auditor found that Ellsworth had an interest in the surplus was the contract itself, with the fact that it was suffered to remain uncanceled in Ellsworth\u2019s hands, the fact that it contained his only authority to sell, the fact that the lands were new lands in Indiana and Illinois, and the fact that Ellsworth did sell, and transmit amounts of the sales to Watkinson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">The net avails of the sales with interest to February 1st, 1855, amounted to $17,995.13, of which sum Watkinson received from Ellsworth $14,778.53, and Ellsworth retained the balance, $3,216.60. Watkinson\u2019s advancements with interest to the same date amounted to $9,148.79; so that the surplus of profit over and above advancements and interest was $8,846.34. If therefore this surplus was to be equally divided between the parties, according to the terms of the agreement, Watkinson had received $1,206.57 more than he was entitled to receive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-7\">The note in suit was given by Ellsworth to Watkinson, but the only consideration for it was the supposed indebtedness of Ellsworth to Watkinson under the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-8\">Ellsworth rendered a large number of accounts of sales to Watkinson in which he charged commissions on sales, on collections and on payment of taxes. These commissions, amounting to $1,281.71, were deducted by him from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>receipts ou sales, and the balance only was transmitted to Watkinson. Ellsworth also made charges for drawing deeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-5\">The plaintiff claimed before the auditor that the defendant, by making these charges and transmitting only the balance to the plaintiff, violated the contract and released the plaintiff from all liability under it. The defendant claimed that he did not intend or regard these charges as charges for personal services. The auditor found that the defendant did not, when he made the charges, suppose that he was making charges for personal services, and that he did not, by making such charges and transmitting such amounts, deprive himself of the right to claim a surplus under the contract; but the auditor found that the charges were in fact for personal services as specified in the contract, and therefore disallowed them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-6\">The plaintiff objected to the admission of the agreement in evidence and to proof of any sales under it\u2014claiming that the agreement had expired by its own limitation, and that the defendant had, by neglecting to claim the benefit of it at the proper time, lost all claim to any surplus profits, but the auditor overruled the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-7\">The plaintiff remonstrated against the acceptance of the auditor\u2019s report, but the court accepted it and rendered judgment for the defendant, whereupon the plaintiff brought the record before this court by motion in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-8\"><em>W. </em>D. <em>Shipman </em>and <em>L.

The plaintiff furnished the capital, and the defendant made the investment, taking the title in the plaintiff\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The property remained unsold until October 1845. The sale of it was then commenced by the defendant, and after-wards prosecuted until it was all disposed of. And from time to time the defendant paid over to the plaintiff portions of the proceeds of his sales, until October 1854, when, it being supposed that one thousand dollars at least was due to the plaintiff, the note in suit was given on that account, but no settlement of the account was ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Before the auditor, the defendant, admitting that he had received for the property more than he had paid over to the plaintiff, claimed thathe had a right to retain forhisown usethe whole balance in his hands at the time the note was given, and so the note was given by mistake and without consideration ; and in support of this defence he offered the written instrument appended to the auditor\u2019s report with evidence of his sales under it. The plaintiff objected to the evidence, the auditor admitted it, and the superior court approved the ruling of the auditor. The admission of that evidence is the principal error complained of in the motion, and the only one to which our attention has been particularly directed on the argument of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">.The question arises upon the construction of the contract. The defendant claiming that that contract secured to him one half of the net profits of the whole adventure ; and the plaintiff contending that <em>\u201c </em>it had ceased to be operative by its own limitation before the debt for which the action was brought had accrued in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The original agreement under which the investment was made is recited in the preamble to the written contract. It provided that the plaintiff should furnish the capital, pay one half of the expenses of purchasing or locating the land, hold the title, reimburse himself for all his advancements with interest thereon at six per cent., and convey to the defendant half of the profits after deducting his capital and interest, at the end of five or ten years, \u201c as most agreeable to himself;\u201d and that the defendant should make the investment in the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>tiff\u2019s name and pay the other half of the expenses of the purchase or location.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">It is conceded that the defendant performed his part of that agreement in a satisfactory manner. Under that agreement then the defendant acquired an interest of some kind in the property and its proceeds which a court of equity would recognize and protect. This the plaintiff\u2019s counsel admit, but they insist that, by the terms of the contract, the defendant\u2019s interest was limited to such profits only as should accrue within the period in the contract specified; which period they claim was five years, (afterwards enlarged to six ;) and that within that period no profits whatever had accrued, because, (as it is found by the auditor) none of the land had then been sold, and all of it \u201c could not have been sold for enough to pay the advancements of the plaintiff, with six per cent, interest thereon.\u201d Now it is to be observed, that by the original agreement no specific period is fixed for the continuance of the connection or the division of the profits. . That was to be determined by the plaintiff \u201cas most agreeable to himself.\u201d The whole legal title was in him, and he could dispose of it at pleasure. He might sell at once and reimburse himself, or he might hold the property unsold for five or ten years, \u201c as most agreeable to himself.\u201d And it nowhere appears that he ever declared or made his election to terminate the connection, until after all the land was sold, nor even then.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">On the 16th of August, the parties ascertained the amount of money which bad been invested, and agreed upon the time from which the plaintiff\u2019s interest should be computed, and then they assumed toward each other, in relation.to this property, the new and additional obligations contained in the instrument of that date. But no where in that instrument do we find any provision for the closing up of the concern at the end of five years, or any other definite period, except by the conveyance of all the property to the defendant upon the terms stated in his proposition. In that instrument, indeed, the plaintiff covenants that he will not sell any of the land (without the defendant\u2019s approbation and concur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>rence) within five years; that is, he submits to the specified restriction upon his absolute power over the property for the period mentioned, and with the expiration of that period his absolute power revived. And that is the whole extent and operation of the covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">I can discover no such limitation as the plaintiff claims, either in the original agreement as recited in the preamble to the written contract, or in any of the provisions of that instrument. Indeed, the construction contended for by the plaintiff seems to me alike uncalled for by the language, and inconsistent with some of the essential provisions, of the instrument itself. Thus, the plaintiff covenants \u201c to hold the land for the purposes above mentioned,\u201d (that is, for the purposes specified in the recited contract under which it was acquired,) \u201c for the term of five years,\u201d unless he and the defendant shall agree upon an earlier sale, and that \u201c whenever his advancements and interest shall be reimbursed by public sale or otherwise,\u201d he will pay over half of the surplus profits to the defendant. Now the plaintiff\u2019s capital was to be reimbursed by sale:\u2014that was the mode agreed upon, and the mode in which the question whether profits had accrued or not was to be determined. But the great object of this new contract seems to have been to provide for the holding of the land unsold for five years at least, in order that time might be allowed for it to rise in value, so that the time referred to in connection with the fact of reimbursement by the word \u201c whenever,\u201d must be after the five years mentioned should have elapsed. As if the plaintiff in terms had said, \u201c I am to be reimbursed by the sale of land; a sale shall not be made (unless we both agree to it,) within five years at least; but whenever I am reimbursed, and therefore, whenever the sale necessary to produce such reimbursement shall be made, I will pay over to the defendant one-half of the surplus profits of the investment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In view of the fact that the question whether profits had accrued or not could be determined only by a sale of the land, or so much of it as to reimburse the plaintiff\u2019s capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>and interest, it seems unreasonable to suppose that the parties intended to make the defendant\u2019s right to profits dependent upon a sale within a period during which the plaintiff, at the defendant\u2019s instance, covenanted to withhold the property from the market altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Again, the condition annexed to the defendant\u2019s proposition to take the land at the end of five years,\u2014provided the plaintiff should \u201c.prefer it,\u201d (that is, prefer his whole advancements and compound interest thereon at ten per cent, at once) \u201c to the chance of profits which might accrue to him the said Eobert after closing the sales of said land,\u201d\u2014upon the plaintiff\u2019s construction would be altogether out of place. It carries the implication, that the non-acceptance of the proposition involves the alternative of a future sale, and that alternative alone. But upon the plaintiff\u2019s theory,\u2014that in the event supposed the land was to become the absolute property of the plaintiff, discharged from the defendant\u2019s-original claims upon it and its proceeds,\u2014the natural, and indeed the only alternative which such non-acceptance would involve, would be, not a sale only, or \u201c the closing of the sales,\u201d but whatever disposition an absolute owner, under any circumstances, might choose to make of his own estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">If, therefore, the parties had intended that the defendant\u2019s interest in the property should become extinct unless within five years some profits should have been realized, the idea that then the plaintiff must either convey all the unsold property to the defendant upon the terms proposed in the instrument or sell it in some other manner and \u201c close the sales \u201d of it, or that he should look to that issue as the sole foundation for his preference, I think would never have occurred to them. But upon the defendant\u2019s construction, the condition and the implication which it carries are both pertinent and natural.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Considerable stress has been placed upon the expression\u2014 provided the said Eobert or his heirs \u201d \u201c shall prefer it to the chance of profits which might accrue to him the said Eobert\u201d\u2014as indicating that all the profits accruing from sales after the expiration of the five years would be his. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>our judgment the plaintiff derives little aid from this expression. The sentence is incumbered with a reference to the plaintiff\u2019s heirs, which gave occasion for the employment of the word \u201c the,\u201d where but for such reference \u201c his \u201d would naturally have been used, and relieved the sentence from much if not all of its obscurity. It would then have read\u2014 \u201c provided the said Robert shall request it and prefer it to his chance of profits which might accrue to him,\u201d &amp;c. And the inquiry would have been what his ehance was or would be, \u2014for the whole of the.profits, or for half? And we think it is doing no violence to the language used, and is more in accordance with the general scope and tenor of the instrument) to make the construction of this sentence, as it stands, depend upon an answer to the same inquiry :\u2014what was the chance for profits which might accrue to him the said Robert, &amp;c. ?\u2014the answer to the inquiry in both cases being,\u2014that chance to which he was entitled by the contract,\u2014a chance for those profits and those only, whether the whole surplus or only half of it, to which the contract gave him right. Those only could accrue to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">It was admitted in the argument, that the property being by the plaintiff\u2019s covenant locked up from market for five entire years, might have been sold for the benefit of both parties within a reasonable time thereafter, if any profits could have been produced thereby. And it does not appear that all the property was not in fact sold within such reasonable time. What is reasonable time \u201d is a question always dependent upon circumstances. And in this case it is to be recollected that abundant security for the return of his whole advancements and compound interest thereon at ten per cent, had been tendered to the plaintiff, and that the property in question was of a kind which could not be forced upon the market but at the hazard of a ruinous sacrifice. And it is to be recollected also, that after the close of the period in question, the plaintiff\u2019s power of sale, as well as his power to revoke the authority of the defendant, was unlimited. But he did nothing. For more than three years no sale was made, and the revocation of the defendant\u2019s power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>was never attempted. The instrument evidencing his appointment remained in his hands uncanceled and unrevoked ; and, until the property was all disposed of, the defendant, authorised by that instrument alone, continued to execute all the powers which <em>it </em>purported to confer, not only without rebuke but with the plaintiff\u2019s approbation.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">There is certainly great force in the plaintiff\u2019s argument from the defendant\u2019s charges of commissions on his sales and collections and for drawing deeds, that the defendant\u2019s \u201c practical construction \u201d was then the same as the plaintiff contends for now. And we are by no means sure, that if the question of fact in this part of the case had been submitted to us, upon this evidence alone, we should have come to the same conclusion as the auditor. But the auditor, as we presume upon adequate evidence, has found that \u201c the defendant did not, when he made those charges, suppose that he was making charges for personal services.\u201d And, sitting here, we have no authority upon a question of fact to reverse or disregard the finding of the auditor. And we think, that in holding that the mistake of the defendant in regard to the meaning of the term \u201c personal services \u201d in the contract, upon the meaning of which expression depended his right to make the charges alluded to, was not such a violation of the contract as worked a forfeiture of his right to profits under it, the auditor was clearly right.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The authorities cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel have not been overlooked, but their bearing upon the questions under discussion in the ease at bar is not in our judgment so obvious or important as to require any particular discussion of them in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The judgment of the superior court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">In this opinion Hinman, J., concurred ; Storrs, C. J., dissented ; Ellsworth, J., being disqualified by relationship to the defendant, did not sit, Judge Sanford taking his place.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
