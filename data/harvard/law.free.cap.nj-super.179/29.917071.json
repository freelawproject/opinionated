The challenge is forthright. It seeks the adoption of a modification \u201cso as to afford protection to a worker during a portal to portal trip from home to his place of employment and his return home trip.\u201d This effort must fail. Despite the infinite number of exceptions carved from it and its \u201crather limited applicability,\u201d <em>Briggs v. American Biltrite, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>185, 190 (1977), the rule that accidents occurring during routine travel between the employee\u2019s home and his place of employment ordinarily do not arise out of and in the course of the employment \u2014 the so-called \u201cgoing-and-coming\u201d rule \u2014 is said by our court of last resort to persist. <em>Watson v. Nassau Inn, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>155 (1977).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, the express \u201cportal to portal\u201d suggestion was rejected in <em>Watson. Id. </em>at 160. Regardless of the virtues of a contrary rule, obviously recognized by at least a minority of our Supreme Court, we may not contravene this clear holding of our court of last resort. <em>In re Education Ass\u2019n of Passaic, Inc., </em>117 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 261 (App.Div.1971), certif. den. 60 <em>N.J. </em>198 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">However, appellant has more than one arrow in her quiver. In a multifaceted presentation she insists that the circumstances of her deceased husband\u2019s employment were such as to preclude the finding of the judge of compensation here that this accident \u201cdid not arise out of and during the course of the employment.\u201d We are in agreement with this and accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The nature of the accident presents no problems. The decedent, a corporate attorney for New Jersey Bell Telephone Company, was driving home from work when he was involved in a three-car collision on McCarter Highway in Newark. He died as a result of injuries sustained in the accident. He was driving his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>own car and he was not reimbursed for traveling expenses. There is no suggestion that the locale of the accident represented any deviation from the most logical direct route between home and office, nor is there any hint of purpose other than one of returning home from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">It is undisputed that decedent\u2019s brief case, supplied to him by his employer and in the car at the time of the accident, held handwritten notes pertaining to a matter on which decedent was currently working for his employer, in addition to such things as bulletins and pamphlets containing general information relating to the Bell Telephone System.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In his oral opinion dismissing the claim petition, the judge of compensation said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">The petitioner strongly urges the fact that her husband was carrying the briefcase with some company documents in it, apparently, to be reviewed by her husband at home, as sufficient to bring this case within one of the exceptions. She relies primarily on <em>Paige </em>v. <em>The City of Rahway, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>177 (1977) and <em>Sabat </em>v. <em>Fedders Corporation, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>444 (1978) to support her contention of compensability. She contends that her husband\u2019s work at home and \u201con call\u201d status of the employees in both of the above cases are substantially similar. With that I cannot agree. Mr. McKeever was not on call at anytime by New Jersey Bell Telephone Company. He brought material home with him to read, which he was not required to do at home, nor was he under any compulsion to report his activities, so that he could be found on a moment\u2019s notice. Doing work at home and being on call are not at all similar. The respondent well sets forth the test regarding work being done at home in <em>Sabat v. Fedders Corporation, </em>supra, footnote three, which states,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">\u201cWe note that Sabat\u2019s employment situation differs dramatically from that of employees who take work home out of a sense of self-imposed moral obligation or self-perceived necessity arising out of an inability to keep up with their work load during their normal workday. The benefits of such activities are predominantly personal with only incidental enhancement of the efficient functioning of the employer enterprise. In such case the work connection is, without more, too attenuated to justify the imposition of the cost of off-duty injury on the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">Furthermore, the mere fact that the decedent was carrying home material furnished by his employer is an insufficient basis upon which to award compensability. In <em>Morris v. Hermann Forwarding Company, </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>195 (1955), the Court stated the plaintiff further contended that Morris was \u201cin the course of his employment\u201d because he was carrying home work materials furnished to him by his employer. The mere fact that a claimant while going to work or home carries with him \u201csome of the paraphernalia of his employment\u201d does not in itself convert the trip from personal to employment activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Therefore, the two contentions of the petitioner, one that he was carrying materials of his employer in his car and, two, that he was to do work at home that evening to benefit his employer, must be rejected. I have no alternative but to dismiss Claim Petition No. 77-28265, with prejudice, on the basis that the accident did not arise out of and during the course of the employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Appellant argues that this represented an inappropriately limited view of the testimony. She urges that it ignored the compelling work requirements of the attorney not only to complete a specific job assignment but also to continue professional competence by reading and the preparation of legal data for which there were simply not enough hours in the ordinary working day. She insists that the uncontroverted testimony demonstrates that the employment requirements could not be met without at-home work. We concur in this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">We accept the proposition that the mere carrying home of \u201csome of the paraphernalia of his employment\u201d does not in and of itself render a commuting accident compensable, <em>Morris v. Hermann Forwarding Co., </em>18 N.J. 195, 200 (1955), although we observe that that decision was 4-3 and has not escaped doubtful reference in a statement questioning the basis for the going and coming rule. <em>Ricciardi v. Damar Products Co., </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>54, 61 (1965). We are also aware, from the dictum in <em>Sabat v. Fedders Corp., </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>444, 451 n. 3 (1978), that \u201ca sense of self-imposed moral obligation or self-perceived necessity arising out of an inability to cope with their workload during their normal workday\u201d will not justify work at home as sufficiently essential to render the commuting an activity arising out of and in the course of the employment. The circumstances of decedent\u2019s employment in the matter before us make any further consideration of those principles unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">We are firmly persuaded that the testimony in this case is susceptible of no other finding than that it was essential for the decedent to work at home in order to live up to his employer\u2019s expectations; that the employer, through such agents as the decedent\u2019s immediate supervisors, encouraged such activity, and that the decedent undertook this obligation con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>stantly with his employer\u2019s knowledge. Edward Evans, general attorney for the company, head of the general corporate section at New Jersey Bell Telephone Company and decedent\u2019s direct superior, testified that taking materials home was permitted by the company and that he knew decedent was doing this. He was then asked whether the practice was \u201cactually encouraged.\u201d He responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">I don\u2019t recall any specific policy or practice that encouraged it. As I indicated to you before, you really had to read as much as you could <em>if you wanted to do your job professionally. </em>So, you took it on to take matters home and read them if you couldn\u2019t get them done during the course of the day. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">His testimony clearly demonstrated that reading respecting \u201cthe legal developments and company things that were changing within the company\u201d was necessary. He denied that it was necessary to take these home but only on the basis \u201cthat he could have stayed after hours and read them at work.\u201d It is beyond cavil that there simply was not enough time in the day during which the decedent had to be \u201cat work\u201d for him to do all of that which was required of him by his employer and the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Indeed, Mr. Evans testified to his requiring \u2014 he said, \u201cI wanted them to read it\u201d; he was decedent\u2019s superior \u2014 reading of material even though \u201cthe attorneys in my section don\u2019t have responsibility for it and don\u2019t actively participate in these matters on a daily basis.\u201d It is clear that the decedent was required not only to perform the work assigned to him, but to keep abreast of company topics despite the fact that required reading \u201cdid not have any direct bearing on [decedent\u2019s] day-to-day work activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The evidence is equally clear that the decedent lived up to his employer\u2019s expectations in this regard. His hours at home were not at the expense of his hours at his other place of employment: Evans testified that not all of the attorneys under his supervision worked 50 hours a week at the place of employment, but decedent did. His brief case went home with him every night. Because of these extra-office requirements he had a desk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>in his bedroom and a small library. At the time of his death he was committed to a deadline on an antitrust matter and among the materials on that desk was a book entitled <em>Antitrust Problems and Trade Practices.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The evidence permits no conclusion except that this was no mere carrying of \u201csome paraphernalia\u201d or \u201cself-imposed moral obligation or self-perceived necessity.\u201d Our reading of the record convinces us this was a matter of continued professional survival at the New Jersey Bell Telephone Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Nor can it be said here, as was a principal concern in the <em>Sabat </em>footnote, <em>supra, </em>that the benefits of decedent\u2019s homework were \u201cpredominantly personal with only an incidental enhancement of the efficient functioning of the employer enterprise.\u201d The services rendered the employer by decedent in this matter were essential to the efficient functioning of the employer enterprise. That the employee received some personal benefit, either by way of increased professional knowledge or opportunity for advancement, in no way attenuates the work connection or minimizes the employer benefit. Even were it to be thought that the activity in this matter was designed primarily to serve the employee\u2019s interest \u2014 which it most assuredly is not \u2014 that fact alone would not exclude compensability under our concept of the controlling significance of some substantial benefit to an employer. <em>Watson v. Nassau Inn, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 160; <em>Strzelecki v. Johns-Manville, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>314 (1974). See the attention paid to the importance of mutual benefit in <em>Sabat v. Fedders Corp., supra, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 450; <em>Paige v. Rahway, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 181, and <em>Briggs v. American Biltrite, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 190 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">We are satisfied the accidental death was compensable. We hold that when the employment expectations carry over to \u201coff-duty\u201d hours and away-from-work effort becomes essentially obligatory, the going-and-coming rule does not preclude compensability. <em>Sabat v. Fedders Corp. </em>and <em>Paige v. Rahway, </em>both <em>supra. </em>We fully recognize that the rule we thus enunciate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>appears to be at odds with the reshaping in <em>Briggs v. American Biltrite, supra, </em>of the going-and-coming rule to limit it to \u201cthose routine daily trips to or from an employee\u2019s fixed place of business at specified hours at the beginning or end of the day\u201d (at 190). The concern is more apparent than real, for the very next sentence in that opinion excepts from that declaration \u201cspecial circumstances which suggest a connection with employment.\u201d All we have done is define one such set of special circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Our doing that is no more than reassurance of our obedience to the Supreme Court mandate that we not be hesitant \u201cto make exceptions to the [going-and-coming] rule when the facts of a particular case have justly deserved a finding of compensability.\u201d <em>Watson v. Nassau Inn, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 160. This is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment in favor of appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\"> The cases are collected and considered at length in <em>Watson.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
