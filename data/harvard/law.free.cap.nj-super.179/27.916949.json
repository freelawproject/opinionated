A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">Defendant was convicted of a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:138-1, carnal abuse, and was sentenced to an indeterminate term at the reformatory complex, not to exceed seven years. On this appeal defendant contends: (1) <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:138-1 is unconstitutional because it creates an impermissible gender classification, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal Constitution; (2) the trial judge erred in permitting the testimony of two police officers, Challice and Cornetta, and (3) his sentence was manifestly excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">Defendant was 25 years of age at the time of the offense; his victim was an 11-year-old girl. The statute provides for punishment by sentence up to 30 years for \u201cany person who\u201d unlawful<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>ly and carnally abuses a woman-child under the age of 12 years with or without consent. Defendant contends that the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause because the penal sanction is not similarly extended to females who offend against young males. The point was extensively considered at the trial level in Judge Joelson\u2019s written opinion in which he ruled against defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. The carnal abuse statute, though gender differentiating, serves a valid legislative purpose through a reasonable classification. We affirm, 162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>302, the judgment of conviction on this point for the reasons stated in Judge Joelson\u2019s opinion below and for the reasons expressed in the plurality opinion of Justice Rehnquist and the concurring opinion of Justice Blackmun in <em>Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma </em>County, -- U.S. ---, 101 S.Ct. 1200, 67 L.Ed.2d 437 (1981), recently upholding a similar California statute challenged under the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Defendant\u2019s remaining two contentions are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
