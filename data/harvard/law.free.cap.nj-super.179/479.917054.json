J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">This appeal concerns the rejection for cause by a municipal agency of the lowest bid on a public contract. The trial judge determined that the action of the agency was justified and lawful. In the action by the lowest bidder, he entered judgment in favor of the agency and the second lowest bidder. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">On September 30, 1980 defendant Jersey City Housing Authority (JCHA) opened bids for a public contract which called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>for certain waterproofing and caulking of one of JCHA\u2019s buildings, a repair project identified as window waterproofing bidding. Plaintiff Suburban Restoration Co., Inc. (Suburban) submitted the low bid of $22,999. Codefendant Watertrol, Inc. was the second lowest bidder with a bid of $27,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">On that same day the JCHA Director of Engineering advised plaintiff by telephone that a \u201cresponsibility hearing\u201d would be held on October 1, 1980 as to \u201cplaintiff\u2019s responsibility to perform the contract.\u201d At this hearing JCHA rejected plaintiff\u2019s bid and awarded the contract to Watertrol. The rejection was based upon the manner of performance by Suburban on a prior JCHA contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Plaintiff filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs, seeking to set aside the actions of JCHA in awarding the contract to Watertrol and asking for an order restraining JCHA from entering into a contract with Watertrol. After argument on an order to show cause, the trial judge rescinded the action of JCHA on the ground that plaintiff was not given a \u201cfair opportunity to participate meaningfully in [the responsibility] hearing\u201d and had not been \u201calerted to the specifics of the complaint against them [szc] with respect to the prior work.\u201d JCHA, given the option of holding another responsibility hearing or awarding the contract to plaintiff, opted to hold a second responsibility hearing. Following a hearing at which Suburban was represented by counsel and presented evidence, JCHA expressly and formally found facts in a writing. On the basis of these, it concluded that Suburban had performed a prior identical contract improperly, not in compliance with specifications and in a manner lacking the moral integrity required of a bidder for public contracts. By resolution it again disqualified plaintiff and awarded the contract to Watertrol.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Plaintiff returned to the Superior Court where, following argument on the agency\u2019s record, the judgment here appealed was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>It does not appear controverted that the contract here being considered involved \u201cidentical work on the identical building\u201d as the contract previously awarded Suburban and that each required the contractor to \u201cremove all old caulking on the window wall sections and recaulk it\u201d with a specified material. With respect to the prior contract, the president of Suburban categorically advised the JCHA at the second responsibility hearing, after several unresponsive answers to an inquiry as to whether his workers removed all the old caulking, \u201cWe remove <em>a11 </em>caulking.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) There was ample evidence in the hearing from which a factfinder could conclude this statement was simply not true. Indeed, JCHA found it untrue and Judge Gaulkin in the Superior Court determined that such a finding \u201ccannot be said to have been arbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d Our independent review of the record produces hearty concurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">So the question simply becomes, as Judge Gaulkin realized, whether intentional deviation from contract specifications, unmistakably implied in what the trial judge correctly identified as \u201ca somewhat muted statement of the Authority\u2019s finding,\u201d is sufficient to premise a determination of the absence of moral integrity and to justify a disqualification. He thought so and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Fundamental to an appreciation of a significant purpose of the Local Public Contracts Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:11-1, is the understanding that the important consideration of protection due the public and its dollar mandates contracts be let not to the lowest bidder, but to the lowest responsible bidder. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:11-6.1. Responsibility in the sense intended by the Legislature has been succinctly and informatively defined as that characteristic the absence of which \u201cwould cause fair-minded and reasonable men to believe it was not in the best interest of the municipality to award the contract to the lowest bidder.\u201d <em>Arthur Venneri Co. v. Paterson Housing Auth., </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>392, 402 (1959). Such a determination \u201cmay also involve the moral integrity of the bidder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>As was the trial judge, we are satisfied that a prior intentional noncompliance with the mandatory terms and conditions, or any of them, of a public contract justifies a conclusion that to give that contractor a second opportunity to do this is not in the public interest. Further we are satisfied that if an indictment for conspiracy to bribe a state police officer, <em>Trap Rock Industries v. Kohl, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>471, 482 (1971), <em>cert. </em>den. 405 <em>U.S. </em>1065, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1500, 31 L.Ed.2d 796 (1972), and an unanswered allegation of participation in a fraudulent billing scheme involving another public contract, <em>Consolidated Enterprises, Inc. v. Newark Housing Auth., </em>159 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 82 (App.Div.1978), certif. den. 77 <em>N.J. </em>482 (1978), can be the basis for a finding of a lack of moral integrity, then deliberate noncompliance with identical contract specifications on a prior occasion can easily support the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Plaintiff relies heavily on <em>Stamato &amp; Co. v. Vernon Tp., </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>151 (App.Div.1974), claiming that the present matter \u201cis controlled\u201d by it. In <em>Stamato </em>\u201c[a]t best, .. . [the] dispute [was] as to whether there had been defective performance in ... work done as an \u2018extra\u2019 after plaintiff had completed a contract awarded it as the lowest bidder for the repavement of portions of four other township roads.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157. In our judgment, this defective performance is a far cry from intentionally failing to complete at all a certain contract obligation. <em>Stamato </em>is clearly distinguishable. The fact that this failure was obscured, if not wholly hidden, by other contract work which was performed, may not exacerbate the wrongfulness of the intention \u2014 culpability of this nature is seldom a relative thing \u2014 but it does emphasize the necessity for care and foresight in caring for \u201cthe best interest of the municipality.\u201d <em>Arthur Venneri Co. v. Paterson Housing Auth., supra, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">We recognize that such a determination as the one here made must not be arbitrary, but must be \u201cbased upon facts tending to support the determination.\u201d <em>Stamato, supra, </em>at 156. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>We now become the third tribunal to be satisfied that this standard has not been here offended. We do not accept plaintiff\u2019s suggestion that the determination of intentional noncompliance here constitutes an assertion of fraud, although with appropriate findings it might well. But a finding of fraud is not necessary: the supportable determination of a lack of moral integrity in the contractor is enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Finally, plaintiff insists that \u201cJCHA has available remedies in law to pursue any defective performance of the 1976 contract.\u201d This may be, and the agency may be well advised (if not obligated by law) to pursue such a course. Nevertheless, this fact does not serve in anywise to diminish the serious consideration which had to be given to whether it was in the best interest of the municipality to award <em>this contract </em>to this bidder. It is quite evident that the Legislature did not intend to require a municipality to undertake a potential for successive law suits simply on the basis that a past transgressor submitted the lowest bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
