Did the widow of Christian Musselman take one-third of his estate absolutely under his will, or only a life estate with a power to dispose ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-13\">2. If a life estate with a power to dispose, is her will an execution of the power ?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-14\"><em>D. </em>G. <em>JSshelman </em>and <em>D. W. Patterson, </em>for the heirs, &amp;c.,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfdT\">argued that the widow\u2019s interest, under the will, was a life estate in his whole estate, with a power to dispose of one-third by will: citing Kent\u2019s Com. 319, 535, 536; 2 Story\u2019s Eq. \u00a7\u00a7 1398, 1399 ; Brindly <em>v. </em>Westcott, 13 Ves. 445, 451; Archibald <em>v. </em>Wright, 9 Simmons 161; Hirstham\u2019s Appeal, 11 S. &amp; R. 18; 3 Leonard 71; 1 P.

In her will, there is no reference to the power or the property, and the account of her executor shows that she had an estate on which the will could operate. None of the signs of an intention to execute a power, collected in Wetherill <em>v. </em>Wetherill, 6 Harris 271, and Pennock\u2019s Appeal, 1 Id. 259, appear in it; whereas the rule is that the intention must be certain; 2 Story\u2019s Eq. 1062; 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 335 ; 6 B. &amp; C. 733-734. She occupied, possessed, and enjoyed her husband\u2019s estate duxfing her life. In her will, she uses language which includes only her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Cwn estate. She could not, therefore, have intended to execute 'the power.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Azz0\">June 5th 1861,</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b473-6\"><em>H. B. </em>Swaar, for appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyJ\">cited and relied on Allison <em>v. </em>Kurtz, 2 Watts 185; Pepper\u2019s Will, 1 Pars. 442; Morris <em>v. </em>Phaler, 1 Watts 389; and Robinson <em>v. </em>Dusgale, 2 Vern. 181.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"A77\">by Lowrie, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvJ\">We do not forget the general rule of interpretation of wills, that requires us to be liberal in favour of the heirs at law, and strict against devisees: but its application is excluded here, because, in general, provisions in favour of widows are to be liberally interpreted, because in this case the testator expressly declares what he intends for his heirs, and because he evidently intends to give his widow a liberal and generous control of his estate during her life and at her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">He gives her all his real and personal estate as her own, \u201cso long as she lives, for her maintenance,\u201d and allows her to \u201csell it or not, as she shall think best <em>for her,\u201d </em>and it is only two-thirds of what may be left at her death, that he distributes among his heirs : and even this is subject to a legacy to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">As to the other third, he says his widow \u201c can do and leave to whom she pleases.\u201d This expression is open to grammatical criticism: but no amount of it can remove the prompt and spontaneous interpretation, that he intends her to have this much as her own property, to be disposed of as she pleases. It must therefore go according to her will, and so the court decreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">Decree affirmed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
