Suits were brought on the said draft by-the said McTague &amp; Brother against, Haldeman, Cottrell, and the said firm of Franklin Platt &amp; Co., and judgments having#been obtained on the said suits, the said Franklin Platt paid out of his own funds, on the 10th day of May, A. d. 1856, the sum of $3268.22, being the amount of the judgment against said firm, with interest and costs of suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-18\">At the time of execution of the said bond and warrant, the said Cooper, Cottrell and Righter were not aware that it was an accommodation acceptance, and were first informed of its nature and character on or about the 1st day of April, A. D. 1856, before any distribution made by them of the money in their hands. Judgments were entered in different counties on the bonds above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>referred to, and executions and attachments thereon issued, under which the real and personal estate of the said Peter Haldeman was sold, and large amounts of money paid to the plaintiffs therein, the present defendants. They did not, however, realize sufficient money out of the said property to pay in full all their liabilities for said Haldeman, exclusive of the $3000 draft in question: the <em>pro rata </em>proportion of the said draft in their receipts would he, if in the hands of the present plaintiff it is entitled thereto, $3350; but if the plaintiff could not be allowed to prove by parol on the trial that the draft was an accommodation draft, then any admissions relative to that point are considered as not made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-6\">If, on this state of facts, the court are of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, then judgment for the plaintiff for the said sum of $3350, with interest from September 25th 1860; otherwise judgment for the defendants. Either party to be at liberty to take a writ of error within sixty days after the rendition of such judgment without bail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-7\">The court below gave judgment for plaintiff on the case stated, which was assigned here for error by the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-8\"><em>Thaddeus </em>Stevens, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkB\">Haldeman was largely indebted beyond what plaintiffs were bail for. Rut he intended to give a preference to plaintiffs. Instead of an assignment in trust, he gave a judgment with the sole object of indemnifying them. It is so expressly stated in the condition of the bond. When that object was accomplished, the bond became void by its express terms. Beyond that moment no other persons could claim to keep the judgment alive. It was not given or received with any intention to secure Platt &amp; Co. They were left like his other creditors. This is plain, not only from the terms of the bond, but from the fact that at the time the parties supposed Platt &amp; Co. to be the <em>real </em>debtors as they certainly were the legal principals. Nor is this an assignment in trust so as to entitle Platt to a dividend: Guy <em>v. </em>McIlree, 2 Casey 92. Nor can Platt, who has purchased this claim, and exonerated Cottrell by cancelling his endorsement, be subrogated to plaintiff\u2019s right, and thus claim through the judgment. -</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-9\">The right to substitution being wholly equitable, and not founded on privity or contract between the parties, cannot be allowed when the party to whose rights substitution is asked is not fully satisfied. He who has the legal security must be first paid before a third person can invoke the aid of such security for his benefit: Keyner <em>v. </em>Keyner, 6 Watts 221, 227.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-10\">Here a large sum of Cottrell\u2019s debt, secured by the judgment, remains unpaid. What right, then, has a third person to come in and claim to use <em>his </em>judgment, and thereby cause him a further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>loss of \u00a1\u00a73350 ? How can an acceptor be allowed by parol evidence to convert his acceptance into a mere suretyship, contrary to the legal purport of it, so as to affect third persons who were not privy to that fact ? Moran <em>v. </em>Groff <em>et al., </em>11 Casey 448, and the cases there cited. If this be correct, then, by the terms of the case stated, Platt &amp; Co. are to be treated as principals in the acceptance, and plaintiff below would have no case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-6\"><em>Thomas JE. JPranhlin </em>and <em>U. M. </em>North, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ati\">\u2014We do not contend that this is an assignment in trust, and therefore Guy <em>v. </em>Mcllree has no application. Nor do we claim to be subrogated to any right of the plaintiffs in the judgment, but we have a right to be substituted to the rights of McTague &amp; Brother, who are wholly satisfied against the estate of Peter Haldeman, which is just the principle decided in Kyner <em>v. </em>Kyner. We paid McTague &amp; Brother, when they sued and obtained judgment, and we did not release Cottrell for the simple reason that there was nothing to release \u2014 he was not liable to us as endorser. Platt is the holder and owner of one of the claims, specified on the back of the judgment given by Haldeman, and all of them are provided for in the express terms of the bond, which was given not alone to protect endorsers, but the holders of the claims, and to enable the plaintiffs to raise money to pay these claims. This is the condition of the bond. There can hardly be a misconstruction of language so plainly written.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-7\">The plaintiffs in the judgment are trustees for the creditors named on the bond, and the ingenious effort to embarrass and confuse, only results from the fact that Cottrell is endorser, a surety, and also one of the trustees; but the two positions are distinct and independent of each other. Suppose some one holding a note endorsed by Cottrell had failed to have it properly protested, would the fact that Cottrell ceased to be liable prevent the holder from resorting to the judgment ? And if all had done so, could Cottrell have released the judgment and destroyed the security for the debts ? Certainly not; else what would become of the principle that the holder of a bond or note is entitled to all the securities given for its payment ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-8\">The plaintiffs are trustees \u2014 they had a duty to perform for the creditors as well as themselves, and no particular set of words is necessary to raise a trust: 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 304, 305. As trustees they could not prefer their own debts, but must apply the trust funds in discharge of all the debts equally without distinction: Hill on Trustees 343. Platt occupies the place of McTague &amp; Brother towards the <em>trustees, </em>not to Cottrell, <em>endorser </em>: see Eastman <em>v. </em>Foster, 8 Metcalf 19; Moore <em>v. </em>Moberly, 7 B. Monroe (Ky.) 299; cited U. S. Dig. 1848, p. 339, tit. \u201c Surety,\u201d pl. 23.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-9\">There are numerous cases in which endorsements and accept<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>anees are varied by parol proof, and Moran <em>v. </em>Graff only decides that an acceptance cannot be impeached in the hands of the payee or innocent holder, just what was decided in the suit of McTague &amp; Brother against Platt &amp; Co. Patterson <em>v. </em>Todd, 6 Harris 433, contains the true principle; that a note real on its face may be shown by parol to be merely accommodation when no party to the paper is affected. See also the very elaborate opinion of Justice Read in Bower <em>v. </em>Hastings, 12 Casey 291.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A9ZK\">July 24th 1861,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"ARo\">by Lowrie, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADH\">The bond of indemnity was to secure Cottrell from liability on his endorsement of Platt\u2019s acceptance, held by McTague, and also to secure Cooper, Cottrell, and Righter on many other endorsements. Now when Platt paid his acceptance, Cottrell was released from his endorsement, and the bond became legally satisfied to that extent. But it appears now that Platt was an accommodation acceptor of the obligor, though that was not known to the obligees till long after the acceptance fell due. Does this fact allow Platt to come in by equity upon the fund raised by the indemnity bond ? Yes, as against the principal debtor; for he had set apart this fund for that debt among others. But is it so as against Cottrell ?</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">In the case of Eastman <em>v. </em>Foster, 8 Met. 28, it is decided No, in a like case. The bond of indemnity was to secure Cottrell from many liabilities, and from this one he was legally discharged, and Platt was bound to have him discharged, and equity does not allow him to annul that discharge by coming in on the fund while any of the other liabilities of Cooper, Cottrell, and Righter remain unpaid. What would, after these are paid, go back to the debtor, the equitable surety may claim, and nothing more. To hold otherwise would make these endorsers less secure, so far as this draft is concerned, by having taken collateral security, than they would have been without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">And we may come to the same result in another way. Surely a man may contract for his own individual indemnity, without being required to share it with all other sureties to his own partial disappointment. Especially may he do so when he is liable only on the contingency that the other sureties fail of their duty. Platt, by the very form of the principal contract, was bound to keep Cottrell safe, and therefore he cannot claim to be equal surety with Cottrell, and require him to contribute to the payment of the acceptance. If Cottrell had paid the draft, he would have been the creditor, and, on suing Platt as acceptor, there would have been no defence; but Platt, after paying his acceptance, might have said: \u201c Here I am a mere surety, and you hold collaterals for this and other debts, and I demand the benefit of any surplus there may be.\u201d Such was his right under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>these contracts. Instead of this, the court below treated Cottrell and Platt as equal sureties, which was contrary to the nature of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Judgment reversed, and judgment for the defendant below on the case stated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
