Critchfield brought ejectment against Humbert, and recovered possession on the 9th of September 1859. Pending this ejectment, Humbert (who had built a saw-mill on the premises) cut down and sawed into lumber about four hundred pine trees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-15\">After the recovery in ejectment, this action was brought for the mesne profits of the land generally, and for plaintiff\u2019s share of the trees sawed into lumber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-16\">This claim was resisted by the defendant in the court below, on the ground that the proper remedy was account render. The parties were, however, directed to proceed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-17\">When the testimony was closed on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff proposed to rebut it, but the court directed a verdict for the defendant, which was accordingly rendered. A motion was then made for a new trial, which was refused without argument. Judgment having been entered on the verdict, the plaintiff sued out this writ, averring here that the court below erred in directing a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-18\"><em>JEuffus </em>and <em>Kimmel, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aum9\">in support of the doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>trine that a tenant in common, who has recovered in ejectment, may maintain an action for mesne profits against his co-tenant, cited and relied on 3 Wills. 118 ; 1 W. Bl. 1077 ; Hare <em>v. </em>Fury, 3 Yeates 13 ; and argued that, if plaintiff was restricted to the time from which he became co-tenant, there was evidence that about two hundred trees were cut down after that by Humbert, who had notice, by his deed, that he was only owner of one-sixth of the property.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AKU\">June 2d 1861,</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b428-6\"><em>Forward </em>and <em>Gaither, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGAq\">That an action of trespass <em>vi et armis </em>can be maintained by one tenant in common against his co-tenant, who has gone into possession of the estate, and taken all the rents and profits himself without objection on part of his co-tenant, was joerhaps never before seriously asserted. An action <em>quare clausum fregib </em>may be maintained under certain circumstances, but not under those proven in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-7\">The gist of this action is the injury to the possession, and as the defendant certainly had a right to the possession there was no trespass, and could be none, unless he had forcibly ejected or kept off his co-tenants from coming also upon the property, which is neither proven nor alleged in this case. It is simply an attempt to recover for rents and profits, taken without force by defendant, or resistance by plaintiffs, and will not lie: Chitty\u2019s Pleading, vol. 1, p. 179.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"A0T\">by Woodward, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR\">That a tenant in common may maintain trespass against a co-tenant for mesne profits, after a recovery in ejectment, is shown by the authorities referred to in Bennett <em>v. </em>Bullock, 11 Casey 364, to which may be added the case of Hare <em>v. </em>Fury, 3 Yeates 13. This action is of that sort. Critchfield, the plaintiff, purchased five undivided sixth parts of a tract of lumber land on the 12th February 1858. Humbert, the owner of the other sixth, was in possession, and had cut down a considerable quantity of timber trees, for the manufacture of lumber, at a saw-mill on the premises. Critchfield instituted ejectment against Humbert, and recovered a judgment on the 9th September 1859.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">He then brought this action for mesne profits, but the court directed a verdict for the defendant, on the ground, apparently, that the evidence failed to prove any cutting of timber trees subsequently to the date of Critehfield\u2019s purchase. If that was the court\u2019s reason (we are obliged to speak subjunctively, for no reason is assigned of record), it was a reason that affected the measure of damages rather than the right of action. Critchfield could not recover for trees severed from the freehold before he became an owner, but he would be entitled to damages for use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>and occupation by tbe defendant from the time that his, Critchfield\u2019s, title vested. Even if the damages were slight which he was entitled to recover, they would carry costs, and therefore he has a right to demand a reversal of the judgment, which put him out of court with nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u2022 If the ruling were founded on doubts of the plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain an action of trespass, the authorities referred to will dissipate them. It is believed that in two cases a tenant in common may have trespass against his co-tenant: 1st, for mesne profits; 2d, for a total destruction of the common property.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>is awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
