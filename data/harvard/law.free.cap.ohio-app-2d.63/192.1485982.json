The letter notifying her that her services were no longer required suggested that she had three options: voluntary retirement, resignation, or immediate dismissal. Dr. Brown filed a grievance pursuant to the grievance procedure then in effect at the Clinic. The executive director denied Dr. Brown\u2019s grievance. Dr. Brown took her grievance to the personnel committee. The personnel committee held a grievance hearing, with Dr. Brown and her counsel present, and denied the grievance. Dr. Brown requested that her grievance be heard by the executive committee. Dr. Brown\u2019s grievance was heard by the executive committee, with Dr. Brown and her attorney present. Witnesses were present and testimony was taken concerning Dr. Brown\u2019s performance. The grievance was denied and the termination upheld. Thereafter, Dr. Brown filed the motion to show cause which is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The first assignment of error attacks the trial court\u2019s ruling permitting Attorney Patrick Johnson, counsel of record for the Clinic, to testify as a witness at the contempt hearing. Attorney Johnson was a member of the board of directors and of the personnel committee of the Clinic, as well as its legal counsel. In these varying capacities, he knew all of the background and facts concerning termination of Dr. Brown\u2019s employment. He had advised the board, the personnel committee and the executive committee concerning what action to take concerning Dr. Brown\u2019s employment and the grievance procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The unusual circumstances in this case, where Attorney Johnson was abundantly familiar with all the relevant facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>bearing on the factual issues in the contempt proceedings, justified the attorney assuming the role of witness. There is no rule of law to the contrary. Although it may be a violation of professional ethics for an attorney to testify as a witness on behalf of his client without withdrawing from the litigation (see Ohio Code of Professional Responsibility, EC 5-9, EC 5-10, DR 5-102), the attorney is not incompetent to testify because of the relationship, and his testimony is admissible if otherwise competent. <em>United Parts Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Lee Motor Products, Inc. </em>(C.A. 6, 1959), 266 F. 2d 20, 24; Annotation 118 A.L.R. 954; Annotation 9 A.L.R. Fed. 500; 56 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 515, Witnesses, Section 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Moreover, as it appears that Dr. Brown\u2019s motion for contempt was addressed to all those parties formerly enjoined, including the agents and attorneys of the Clinic, Attorney Johnson was representing himself at the contempt hearing, and under that circumstance had a right to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Therefore, the first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The second assignment of error attacks the substance of the trial court\u2019s order denying Dr. Brown\u2019s contempt motion, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">\u201cThe ruling of the trial court that the defendant had not acted in contempt of the court\u2019s previous order enjoining early retirement was, in error as it was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">This second assignment of error is also not well taken. The injunction of March 3, 1977, permanently enjoined the Clinic and its agents, attorneys and certain other persons from requiring Dr. Brown to retire prior to June 30, next following her arrival at the age of 70 years. However, the Clinic, by its actions on May 13, 1977, and thereafter, terminated the employment of Dr. Brown by dismissal. Dr. Brown was not compelled to retire and did not retire; she was discharged. Cf. <em>United States Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Nichols </em>(C.A. 6, 1956), 229 F. 2d 396, certiorari denied (1956), 351 U.S. 950; <em>Intl. Assn. of Machinists </em>v. <em>General Electric Co. </em>(1949), 72 Ohio Law Abs. 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">The record contains no evidence that Dr. Brown\u2019s employment had any protected status as to tenure, or that there was any agreement to employ Dr. Brown for any definite period of time. Dr. Brown\u2019s employment was an employment at will, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>which either parly could terminate at any time, for any reason or no reason. See <em>United States Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Nichols, supra; Harp </em>v. <em>Admr., Bureau of Unemployment Compensation </em>(1967), 12 Ohio Misc. 34, 36; <em>Fulworth Garment Co. </em>v. <em>I.L.G.W. Union </em>(1913), 15 N.P. (N.S.) 353, 358; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bateman </em>(1900), 7 N.P. 487, 494; <em>Mattison </em>v. <em>Lake Shore and Mich. So. Ry. Co. </em>(1895), 2 N.P. 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\">Therefore, we conclude that the Clinic was not in contempt of the order prohibiting retirement of Dr. Brown when it dismissed Dr. Brown from employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Lucas County is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b207-6\">Potter, P. J., and Connors, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\"> See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Toledo Mental Hygiene Clinic </em>(1977), 63 Ohio App. 2d 73.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
