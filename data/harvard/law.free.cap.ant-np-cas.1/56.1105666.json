Peake\u2019s law of Ev., <em>12. </em>There is a distinction, in this particular, between the evidence of the proceedings of a civil or municipal court of a foreign country <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>and those of a court acting under the law of nations; though proof of the seal of the former may be required, <em>(Henry </em>v. <em>Adey, </em>4 Esp. 229; 3 East. 221; <em>Delafield </em>v. <em>Hand, </em>3 Johns. 310; <em>Church </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>2 Cr. 229,) that of the latter is always considered as' evidence, without further proof. <em>Colden </em>and <em>Emmet, Arguendo Gardere </em>v. <em>Columbian Insurance Company, </em>7 Johns. 517. In the case of <em>Gardere </em>v. <em>Columbian Insurance Company, </em>the sentence of the vice-admiralty court, at Antigua, was proved by the production of a copy under the seal of the court, signed by the actuary, in the absence of the register, accompanied by proof of the seal and signature of the actuary; the proof, therefore, being so ample, the court declared it unnecessary to notice the distinction, raised by the counsel in the argument, between foreign municipal tribunals and courts of admiralty. The accuracy of the distinction, however, seems to be unquestionable. In <em>Yeaton </em>v. <em>Fry, </em>in the supreme court of the United States, (5 Cranch, 343,) this distinction is recognized. In that case an exception had been taken, in the court below, to the proof of the proceedings of the vice-admiralty of Jamaica, and the point came before the court on a writ of error. In the court below, the proceedings were proved by the production of a certified copy under the seal of the court, authenticated by the certificate of the judge as to the official character and authority of the deputy register, and by a notarial certificate as to the official character of the judge. C. J. Marshall, in pronouncing the opinion of the court in this case, observes: \u201c The sentence is sufficiently authenticated to be received in evidence. Being a court acting under the law of nations, its proceedings may be proved according to the mode observed in the present case; and were this doubtful, that doubt would be removed by the circumstance, that it is the form stipulated by the treaty of 1791, art. 19. In a prior case, <em>(Church </em>v. <em>Hubbart, </em>2 Cranch, 237,) the same doctrine is admitted, by the counsel on both sides, but the case was ultimately decided on other grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b75-6\">Van Ness, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARL\">Parol evidence of the contents of papers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>may be given, where they do not form the foundation of . the cause, but merely relate to some collateral fact. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\"><em>S.

That those facts were only inducement, and introduced as collateral matter, and not as matter in issue, and that the practice is not to require such strict technical proof of collateral facts, as if they were facts in issue. That it is every day\u2019s practice, to give parol proof in such cases of matters of fact, susceptible even of proof of the most solemn kind.
