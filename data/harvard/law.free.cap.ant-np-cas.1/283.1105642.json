But, contriving, &amp;e., to injure the plaintiffs, had returned upon the attachment that the debtor had no goods or chattels, &amp;e., within his <em>bailiwiclc.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-10\">Another count in the declaration averred that, after the issuing of the said attachment and the delivery of it to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>sheriff for execution, the said brig Mary, owned by the debtor, was within his <em>bailiwick, </em>and he might and ought to have seized her, but neglected so to do, and made return, &amp;o., as before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-5\">Plea, general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-6\">The plaintiffs proved that, in October, 1821, a creditor of Marcus Jacobs, caused an attachment to be issued under the absconding and absent debtor\u2019s act, against his property as an absent debtor. That upon this attachment the defendant seized the brig Mary of London. That a jury had been duly empannelled upon the said seizure, who found the ownership to be in the said Marcus Jacobs. That, upon receiving a bond of indemnity from the friends of said Jacobs, the defendant delivered up the said brig to them, and allowed her to leave the port of New York. That, after she had thus departed from the port, other creditors had caused like attachments to issue, and had delivered them, for execution, to the defendant. After the delivery of these attachments, the first attachment was regularly superseded according to the statute. Under the second series of attachments, the plaintiffs were duly appointed trustees. These attachments were returned by the defendant, <em>nulla bona.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-7\"><em>Ogden </em>and <em>Hoffman,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcZ\">for the defendant, contended that attachments under the absconding and absent debtor acts, until trustees are appointed, are for the benefit of the attaching creditors, and are under his control. <em>Fosgate </em>v. <em>Mahon, sh.'ff., &amp;c., </em>16 Johns. 162. And as there had been no actual seizure under the second attachments, and as the property, when he received such process, was not within his <em>bailiwick, </em>the return was not falsified.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Emmet,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOE\">contra, insisted that as the defendant was bound to hold the property, seized under the first attachment, until a <em>supersedeas </em>was duly issued, and as no <em>supersedeas </em>had issued, when the second attachments came to the defendant\u2019s hands, he was then, in intendment of law, still in possession of the property seized under the first attachment, and, therefore, his return was false.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b303-5\">Betts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Am0\">Under the pleadings in this case, the plaintiffs must either show an actual seizure of the brig Mary, under the second attachments, or that she was within the defendant\u2019s <em>bailiwick, </em>and might have been seized by him after more attachments came to his hands. A possession by intendment of law will not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Plaintiffs non-suited.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\"><em>D. B. Ogden </em>and Hoffman, for plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\"><em>Emmet </em>and <em>Selden, </em>for defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\"> Since the above adjudication, the remedy by attachment against absent and absconding debtors, has undergone great changes. Unlike the attachment against absent or absconding debtors, under the Revised Statutes, which was for the benefit of all the creditors, the attachment now is for the benefit of the individual creditor. <em>Vide, </em>Code, c. 4, tit. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
