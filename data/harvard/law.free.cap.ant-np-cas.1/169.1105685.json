I. Beekman. That, by virtue of the will of the defendant\u2019s testator, Franklin had sold the testator\u2019s real property, and had, from the proceeds, paid the testator\u2019s debts. That, after the payment of debts, a balance of 700!. remained in his hands, which he paid over to the defendant. It also appeared that Franklin had kept an account of his agency, regularly entered in a book, in his own hand-writing, which book was either lost or mislaid. Afer this proof relative to the book, the defendant offered, in evidence, a copy of the agency account, taken from the said book, and proved to be a true copy, in which account there was an item, in the following words, viz.: \u201c 13th April, 1793, received of I. I. Beekman, 991. 4s. <em>6d., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>for so much he had in his hands of Gr. I.

The payment of the 991 by the obligee to the executor of the obligor, subsequent to the date of the obligation declared on, is presumptive evidence of his having retained, in his own hand, money of the obligee\u2019s, to the amount of the single bill, and this therefore may be offered in evidence, under the notice of set-off, for so much money had and received.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Verdict for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\"><em>Sbsson, </em>for plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai\"><em>Bogardus, </em>for defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b188-10\"> Vide <em>Commings </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>ante, and the note <em>et quae.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
