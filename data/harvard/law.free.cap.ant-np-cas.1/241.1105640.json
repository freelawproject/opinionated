'</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\"> The material part of the covenant omitted in the defendant\u2019s plea, was in the nature of a condition precedent, the covenant was to be void, if not signed by all the creditors. The plea was certainly bad in this particular; but the only mode for the plaintiff to avail himself of it, was by craving oyer of the covenant, enrolling it, and demurring: for, the defendant, by only showing part of the indenture, deprives the plaintiff of the opportunity of assigning a breach in the other part omitted. <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Spier, </em>3 Lev. 50; Com. Pleader, 2 v. 3. <em>Non est </em>factum, in covenant, only puts the deed in issue. 1 Cbitty, 482. Thus, in the case of <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>(1 Starkie, 294,) which was an action of covenant, to which defendant pleaded <em>non est factum.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
