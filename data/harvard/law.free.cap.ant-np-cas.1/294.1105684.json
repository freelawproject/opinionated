That they were still partners for the purpose of settling the partnership concerns, and that, on Mumford\u2019s death, the plaintiff, as surviving partner, was entitled to all the choses in action and other evidences of debt belonging to the concern, which could only be collected in his name, and that he was consequently entitled to the exclusive custody and control of the books of account, as incidents to, the debts, or choses in action. 6 Cow. 441.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
