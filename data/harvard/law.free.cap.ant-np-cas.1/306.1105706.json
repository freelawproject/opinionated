J.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b324-9\">A plea, <em>puis darrien contin\u00faame </em>of a matter in abatement, is not a waiver of the preceding pleas to the merits.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-10\">Assumpsit on a promissory note indorsed by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-11\">Several special pleas, in bar, had been interposed on the record, by the defendants, and, after issue was joined on these pleas, the defendants holding certain promissory notes indorsed by the plaintiff, who resided at Philadelphia, pro-1 ceeded against him as an absent debtor. Upon issuing the warrant, the debtor gave his bond to supersede it, pursuant to the statute. This bond is conditioned to pay, to the attaching creditor, \u201c the amount justly due and owing to him.\u201d Upon this bond the defendants, within the time allowed by the statute, brought this suit. This being considered, by the defendants, as drawing all the matters of account, between them and the plaintiff, into the suit upon that bond, for adjustment, they pleaded the same <em>puis darrien continuance </em>in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>To this plea the plaintiff, however, demurred, and the court sustained the demurrer. And now, at the trial, the plaintiff insisted that the plea <em>puis </em>was a waiver of all the preceding pleas, and objected to their offering any proof under them.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b325-5\">Jones, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmWf\">The matter pleaded <em>\u201cpuis darrien continu</em>ance\u201d was not in bar of the action; if it had been, the plea would have been clearly a waiver of all.preceding pleas: it was matter in abatement only, and, therefore, did not waive the former pleas. <em>Raynor et al. </em>v. <em>Dyett, </em>2 Wend. 300.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\"><em>Meredith </em>and <em>Ha 11, </em>for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\"><em>Wallis </em>and <em>Anthon, </em>for defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\"> This rule seems well sustained, from the earliest times. Lord Chief Baron Gilbert, in bis excellent \u201c History and Practice of Civil Actions,\u201d thus states it upon authorities: 11 The pleas <em>(puis, </em>&amp;c.,) are two-fold, viz. in abatement, and in bar; if anything happens, pending the writ to abate it, this may be pleaded <em>puis darrien continuance, </em>though there is a plea in bar, for this can only w\u00e1ive all pleas in abatement that were in being at the time of bar pleaded, but not subsequent matter. But though it be pleaded in abatement, yet, after a bar is pleaded, it is peremptory, as well on demurrer as on trial, because, after bar pleaded, he has answered in chiefj and, therefore, can never have judgment to answer over. Gilbert\u2019s Practice, 105; Buller\u2019s N. P.310; 1 Chitty on Pleading, 637, When it is pleaded in abatement, and found against the defendant, the issues in bar, however, must still be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">In relation to matters of fact, occurring after the defendant has answered, and which, under the old practice, were brought before the court by plea <em>puis, </em>the Code of Procedure is silent. It is presumed the practice of the court of chancery must be here resorted to. Such matters must be, therefore, introduced by supplemental answer. 1 Barb. C. P. 166. It seems reasonable that the logic of the old cases must still, however, prevail, where-ever.the new matter is an abandonment of the first defence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
