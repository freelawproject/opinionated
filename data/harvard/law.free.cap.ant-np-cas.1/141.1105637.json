In the declaration the note was averred to have been indorsed in due season \u00abbefore it had become payable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-9\">Plea, general issue, with notice of set-off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The subject of the defendant\u2019s set-off was a promissory-note, drawn by John and William Thorne, in favor of Case-nave, and by him indorsed to the defendant Woodhull. The defendant\u2019s counsel contended that they had a right to set off this note against the plaintiff\u2019s claim, because the note declared on had been indorsed to him after it became due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">To prove this fact, they offered an account current, rendered by John and William Thorne, to the defendants, some time after the notes had become due, in which account the note, declared on, was debited to the defendants.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b160-6\">Spencer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANe\">The testimony is inadmissible. In legal intendment, the note must be supposed to have been indorsed on the day alleged in the declaration, and the allegations of the indorsers, after the indorsement, cannot affect the rights of the indorsee. You must prove the time of making the indorsement by other evidence. Defendant did so, and obtained a verdict.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\"><em>Golden </em>and <em>Badcliff, </em>for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\"><em>Hoffman </em>and <em>Wells, </em>for the defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\"> It is a general rule, that subsequent declarations of a party to a sale or transfer of property, which go to take away a vested right, are not admissible evidence. <em>Phoenix </em>v. <em>Assignees of Ingraham, </em>5 Johns. 412. But the admission of the indorsers could not be received in this case for another reason, they were good and competent witnesses to prove the time of indorsement. <em>Baker </em>et al. v. <em>Arnold, </em>1 Caines, 255. And where a person is a competent witness, evidence of his confessions are inadmissible. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Mahon, </em>11 Johns. 185.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
