ORS 427.235. The issue is whether the Circuit Court in Marion County has jurisdiction over the juveniles. We conclude that it does. Therefore, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The juveniles in these cases are wards of juvenile courts in counties other than Marion. After having been committed to the legal custody of Children\u2019s Services Division (CSD), both were placed at the Fairview Training Center in Marion County. CSD subsequently petitioned the Circuit Court in Marion County for involuntary commitment of the juveniles to the Mental Health Division. The Circuit Court first found that the juveniles were not in need of commitment. CSD then moved for reconsideration and for a change of venue. The Circuit Court granted reconsideration but denied a change of venue. CSD then moved to dismiss the petitions for lack of jurisdiction over the juveniles. The Circuit Court granted CSD\u2019s motion and dismissed the petitions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>juveniles appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"> Juvenile courts have exclusive original jurisdiction over certain matters. ORS 419.476(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Civil commitment is not one of those matters. The commitment proceedings initiated in these cases are civil in nature. The provisions of ORS 419.476(1) do not preclude a court of competent jurisdiction from entertaining a civil action involving a child. ORS 419.476(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The juveniles are residents of Marion County. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Therefore, the Circuit Court in Marion County had jurisdiction over them for this purpose. ORS 427.235(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-6\"> While granting CSD\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, the trial court expressed its belief that its ruling made no sense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: You know, I\u2019m going to rule in favor of you. This is going to save me a lot of work. But CSD and Fairview is (sic) going to have to truck all over the United States with each and every one of these kids along with all of their witnesses and pay all the gas bills, all the motel and other people can work here because they\u2019re traveling all over the state getting all these kids recommitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to support you. That\u2019s fine if that\u2019s what you people want. You want and from now on any kid that\u2019s under the jurisdiction of CSD will not have a mental health hearing in the Marion County courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">\u201cThe other thing I\u2019m ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">\u201cMS. GREEN: Your Honor, I would assume ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">\u201cMS. GREEN: That would not include children who are within the jurisdiction of this court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: That\u2019s correct. Only Marion County kids am I going to hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-14\">\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to write Leo Hegstrom a letter saying this is the most foolish and stupid thing I have ever heard of and what\u2019s the purpose of the Department of Human Resources but to try to organize these things and get you people to work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al0\">\u201cOkay, you won. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ_\">\u201cMR. GORHAM: Your Honor, I think technically if we can maybe make the same arguments for Jamie so that she hears this as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1X\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sure. I, exactly the same thing as to her, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6J\">\u201cMR. GORHAM: I know, but I think it\u2019s important that she understands that so if we can, if I can get her in and...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXV\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yeah, you know, I, obviously you\u2019re the attorney general representing the Department of Human Resources and this must be what Mr. Hegstrom wants and I\u2019ll deal with him on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AEf\"> ORS 419.476(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIt\">\u201cThe juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction in any case involving a person who is under 18 years of age and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY9\">\u201c(a) Who has committed an act which is a violation, or which if done by an adult would constitute a violation, of a law or ordinance of the United States or a state, county or city; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjE\">\u201c(b) Who is beyond the control of the person\u2019s parents, guardian or other person having custody of the person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acx\">\u201c(c) Whose behavior, condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the person or the welfare of others; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARu\">\u201c(d) Who is dependent for care and support on a public or private child-caring agency that needs the services of the court in planning for the best interest of the person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzD\">\u201c(e) Either the person\u2019s parents or any other person having custody of the person have abandoned the person, failed to provide the person with the support or education required by law, subjected the person to cruelty or depravity or to unexplained physical injury or failed to provide the person with the care, guidance and protection necessary for the physical, mental or emotional well-being of the person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A52\">\u201c(f) Who has run away from the home of the person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-J\">\u201c(g) Who has filed a petition for emancipation pursuant to ORS 109.550 to 109.565, 419.710 and this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b526-20\"> The state relies on <em>Phillips v. Barker, </em>244 Or 513, 419 P2d 15 (1984), for the proposition that, once the children became wards of the juvenile courts in other counties, those courts retained jurisdiction in all future cases involving the children, merely by virtue of their wardship. <em>Phillips </em>does not so hold. In that case, the custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>issue raised in the second county was the same issue in litigation in the county having wardship of the children. Moreover, the custody issue was one which the juvenile court was authorized to decide. <em>See former </em>ORS 419.507(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\"> ORS 427.235(1) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">\u201cAny two persons may notify the judge of the court having probate jurisdiction for the county or the circuit court, if it is not the probate court but its jurisdiction has been extended to include commitment of the mentally retarded under ORS 3.275, that a person within the county is a mentally retarded person in need of commitment for residential care, treatment and training.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
