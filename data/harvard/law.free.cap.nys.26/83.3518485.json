This action was brought to recover the purchase price of stoves, with attachments thereto, and labor performed in setting same in certain buildings in the city of New York. The plaintiff claims that the goods were delivered and the work rendered upon the credit of defendant, who agreed to pay for the same, provided it met with the approval of one Campbell. No question was raised on the trial as to the number of ranges, or their value, or that the work performed by plaintiff was not performed in a good and workmanlike manner. On the trial, after plaintiff had rested, defendant moved to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that the allegations of the said complaint are that Joseph Campbell approved of said contract, approved of all materials and labor furnished and performed by the plaintiff, and that on the contract plaintiff was to obtain the approval of Joseph Campbell, and for entire failure of proof to sustain these allegations; and on the further ground that the-approval of Joseph Campbell to said work never had been obtained, and plaintiff\u2019s proofs showed an absolute failure to obtain any such approval. The motion was denied, and exception taken. The defendant was not a guarantor, as is claimed in the elaborate brief submitted. The adding of the words, \u201cJoseph Campbell must approve,\u201d did not change the relation of the parties. Plaintiff\u2019s-witnesses testified that the credit was given to the defendant only. It was an original contract for labor and materials, made with the-defendant, and upon his contract. But, says the defendant, the plaintiff has failed to show \u201capproval by Campbell.\u201d Plaintiff did all that could be expected or was required by him. Two of plaintiff\u2019s employes testified that they called on defendant,' and requested' the address of Campbell, for the purpose of procuring his approval. Defendant failed, however, to furnish such address, or assist plaintiff either in getting such approval or a disapproval; nor is there-any evidence in the case that Campbell at any time disapproved of the goods sold or work furnished by plaintiff. Campbell was the defendant\u2019s agent, and if he unreasonably and in bad faith refused his approval the plaintiff is not to he held responsible, hut he may establish by other evidence his right to recover. The trial justice-therefore properly denied the motion to dismiss. The case was-properly submitted to the jury, and there are no exceptions that would warrant us in disturbing the verdict. Judgment affirmed,, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
