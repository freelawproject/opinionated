The premises were purchased by defendant Solly from plaintiff in June, 1891, but the deeds were not delivered until three months after the purchase money had been paid, and the building already erected thereon and rented. The sale was made with the understanding that the vendee was to use the premises for business purposes. The deeds were delivered, containing clauses prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors on the premises conveyed.

We think the court below correctly held that under that description a liquor business should be permitted. It follows that Solly could not be required to accept a deed restricting him from selling liquors. His failure to object at once was sufficiently explained. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
