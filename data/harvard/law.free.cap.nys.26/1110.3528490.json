A demurrer to the complaint was sustained, and plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AXl\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1130-17\">The opinion of McADAM, J., on sustaining the demurrer, is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1130-18\">Applying the maxim, \u201ccausa pr\u00f3xima non remota spectator,\u201d the plaintiff is without a cause of action against the defendant, unless the latter, as owner of a tenement, is liable to the plaintiff, as her tenant, because she slipped upon the ice on the walk or stoop of her house; and there is no such liability. The authorities are uniform that there is no duty on the part of an owner: to a tenant or the public to remove from the steps or walk the ice and snow which naturally accumulates thereon. Woods v. Cotton Co., 134 Mass. 357; Watkins v. Goodall, 138 Mass. 533; Purcell v. English, 86 Ind. 34; Shindelbeck v. Moon, 32 Ohio St. 264. And in our own state, see Fuchs v. Schmidt, 8 Daly, 317; Moore v. Gadsden, 93 N. Y. 12, 87 N. Y. 84; Wenzlick v. McCotter, Id. 122; City of Rochester v. Campbell, 123 N. Y. 405, 25 N. E. 937. If the plaintiff has any remedy, she must seek it from the municipality for neglect. The demurrer must therefore be sustained, and judgment directed in favor of the defendant, with costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Abad\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>Argued before FREEDMAN and GILDERSLEEVE, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1131-5\">J.

But, independently of that, the judgment .is right upon the merits, and should be affirmed upon the opinion rendered by the learned judge below. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
