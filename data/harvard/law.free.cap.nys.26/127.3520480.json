The cause was tried before a justice of this court at special term without a jury. The evidence sustained the allegations of the complaint, and entitled the plaintiff to the relief demanded therein. The trial judge found the facts in favor of the plaintiff, and judgment was entered upon such findings, from which the defendant has appealed to this court. The case of Storck v. Railroad Co., 131 N. Y. 514, 30 N. E. 497, is sufficiently like this to be a controlling authority in favor of the plaintiff, and the decision in that case justifies this judgment. That case also justifies the admission of proof of the situation and rental value of other property contiguous to that immediately involved, and near the defendant\u2019s structure. Upon the authority of that case and other similar cases in the court of appeals, the judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
