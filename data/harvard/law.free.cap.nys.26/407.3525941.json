The questions in the case were of fact. The evidence was conflicting, and under well-settled principles the findings of the court below, rendered on such conflicting evidence, cannot be disturbed. The judge, however, seems to have made a slight mistake in Ms calculation as to two items. In the twelfth finding, page 17, he holds that plaintiff expended in April, 1880, $35, in March, 1880, $25, and upon one other occasion $25. It will be seen that in his calculation at page 11 the last above item is omitted, and that the April, 1880, is put at $25, instead of $35, making in all an error of $35. The judgment should have been larger, therefore, by one-half of that amount and interest, in all amounting to $28.44. If defendant shall stipulate, within 10 days after the service of a copy of the order herein, that the judgment be increased $28.44 as of the date of the entry thereof, judgment shall be so modified, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs to either party. If defendant fails to so stipulate, judgment reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
