The installments were to be paid at different stages of the work. The answer of the defendant denied all of the material allegations of the complaint, and set up a counterclaim for damages by reason of the unskillful manner in which the work was done by plaintiffs. At the close of the testimony, the plaintiff moved for a direction, which was granted. The trial justice erred. There was a dispute as to whether the plaintiffs performed all the work required under the contract before they were entitled to the payment demanded, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>that question should have been submitted to the jury for their determination. For these reasons, the judgment must he reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
