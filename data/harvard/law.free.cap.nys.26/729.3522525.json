It was therefore not necessary to revive the action in the name of the personal representatives of the defendant, in order to enter the order of affirmance. See Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 763. The appellant\u2019s counsel concedes this to be correct, if the decision occurred before the defendant\u2019s death. All his authorities refer to cases where the party died before the decision was made. The fact of the time of defendant\u2019s death was found against him by the justice who heard the motion; for such we must assume he did, in arriving at his decision. Under the prayer, \u201cfor such other and further order or relief, or both, as to the court or justice may seem proper,\u201d the justice had a right and power, in the interest of justice and the exercise of his sound discretion, to direct that the order and judgment spoken of should be entered nunc pro tunc. See Bergen v. Wyckoff, 1 Civil Proc. R. 1-9, also in 84 N. Y. 659, 660; Long v. Stafford, 103 N. Y. 274, 281, 282, 8 N. E. 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The only other question to consider is, did the attorney have the; power to enter this order of. affirmance and judgment? I think, from an examination of the papers, he had. It appears uncontradicted that Curran was the attorney for the defendant from the commencement of the action, both at the trial, through which, under the rules and practice, a judgment for costs, in favor of the defendant, amounting to the sum of $19.12, was entered; that the plaintiff appealed to the general term of this court, which affirmed the judgment, and Curran, the attorney, thereupon taxed his costs, and entered judgment for the same, amounting to $89.45; that he (Curran) paid all the disbursements in the case on appeal, and also the disbursements included in the original judgment. He then had an attorney\u2019s lien on these costs, and must be deemed an equitable assignee of the same, and was entitled to enter the judgment, and was entitled to issue an execution for the collection of the same. See Lachenmeyer v. Lachenmeyer, 65 How. Pr. 422. This case has not been overruled. The cases cited by the appellant are not in point, and are all determinations of various points which do not arise in this case. In none of them is the point raised here presented. Neither cari I perceive any analogy to the case at bar. For these reasons, the order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
