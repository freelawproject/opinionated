At the time plaintiff made such statement, no complaint had been made against him by M., and he believed the statement to be true. <em>Reid, </em>that the fact that M. afterwards told defendant that he was about to discharge plaintiff for misconduct and inefficiency did not justify defendant in refusing to perform his contract to employ plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b898-19\">Appeal from trial term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b898-20\">Action by Otis L.

Defendants replied, requesting plaintiff to call to see them when he came to New York. About six weeks later, plaintiff called on defendants, and, in answer to their questions, stated that he was making the change simply to get a higher line of samples, and get with a larger house, where he thought he could make better sales and improve himself; that he could stay with Macullar, Parker &amp; Co. if he wished, but that he had decided to leave them because he thought he could improve himself; and that he was in good standing with Macullar, Parker &amp; Co. Afterwards, defendants offered to employ plaintiff, and .he accepted the offer. When he presented himself to go to work, defendants refused to carry out the contract, stating that they had heard of certain misconduct of plaintiff. This was in consequence of a communication from Macullar, Parker &amp; Co., stating, in answer to an inquiry, that plaintiff had been on a long spree in Cleveland, Ohio, and that they had decided to discharge him for that reason.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b899-6\">Argued before VAN WYCK, NEWBURGER, and MCCARTHY, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b899-7\">Logan, Clark &amp; Demond, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b899-8\">Horwitz &amp; Hershfield, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b899-9\">MCCARTHY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7EK\">The evidence clearly shows that there was a \u2022contract entered into between these parties. The defendants are bound by their obligation, and can only avoid it by discharging the plaintiff for good cause shown, or by declaring the contract invalid by reason of .false and fraudulent representations made at the time of the making of such contract, and which was the inducement in the making of the same. Fraud vitiates all contracts, no matter how solemn. The false representations must be made with intent to deceive, and known to the person making them. Mere expressions of opinion are not enough. .The plaintiff, when he answered the questions of one of the defendants, had no information to the contrary, and believed them to be true. No complaint had been made up to that time, and it seems the objections afterwards made by Mr. Wesson were suggested by the fact of plaintiff being about to enter the employ of a rival. There was no evidence presented showing a false and fraudulent representation known to the plaintiff, or made with the intent to deceive, and, this being the \u2022only cause claimed by the defendant for not carrying out his contract, the trial justice was correct in directing a verdict for the plaintiff, the amount of damages being assented to. We find no errors. Judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs. All \u25a0concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
