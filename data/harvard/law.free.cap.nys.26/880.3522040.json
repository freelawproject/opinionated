Code Civil Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 2916, 2917. The original summons and papers in the case of Tilly Seligman v. Risk were not returned to the court on the morning of the return day of the summons, but the defendant, who had been served with a copy of the summons and papers on the attachment, voluntarily appeared and answered; and, during the regular proceedings of the court, the justice, on motion of defendant\u2019s attorney, called the parties to the action, and, plaintiff failing to appear, vacated the attachment, and dismissed the action. This was done on the copy summons and other papers, and he had the power to do so. When the. attachment was vacated, and the action dismissed, the plaintiff therein had a right of action against the sureties on the undertaking on attachment The questions as to whether a levy had been made, and as to whether the property was sold by the marshal or under his directions, were disputed ones, and were therefore properly left to the jury, and on such questions their finding is conclusive. We find no material error in the case, and judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
