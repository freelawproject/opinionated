The person who made the arrest, and whom the defendant assaulted, was a constable, and the defendant\u2019s offense was committed in his presence. Under section 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a constable had authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>arrest him for such offense without a warrant. The judgment should therefore be affirmed. I see no occasion for an opinion. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-16\"> Pen.
