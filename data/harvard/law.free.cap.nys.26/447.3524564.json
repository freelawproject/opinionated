The answer of the defendants contains several denials, and therii states as follows: \u201cAllege that the said several supposed causes of action \u2018therein set forth did not, nor did any or either of them, accrue at any time within six years next before the commencement of this action, nor within six years and such additional time as is allowed to the plaintiff for the commencement of this action, by reason of the death or the failure to issue letters testamentary on the will of John Fassett, deceased.\u201d The will of John Fassett was admitted to probate May 31, 1891, and letters of administration with the will annexed were issued to Maria A. Fassett, January 20, 1892, and this action was commenced the 10th of February, 1892. It is found as a fact that the assets of the deceased were not sufficient to pay plaintiff\u2019s debts, and that she \u201cwill be unable with due diligence to collect her debt by proceedings in the proper surrogate\u2019s court, or by an action against the administrator with the will annexed, or legatees or next of kin of said deceased;\u201d and that the deceased left \u201cno real estate which descended to his heirs.\u201d It is found as a fact, viz.: \u201cThat prior to the death of John Fassett the interest was paid on said notes annually by said testator, or his son Milan as his agent, in his (testator\u2019s) behalf, and indorsed thereon, the last indorsement prior to his decease being dated June 2, 1884, and August 5, 1884, on said notes, respectively.\" The court awarded judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of the notes, \u201cand'declaring the same to be a lien upon and collectible out of the real property described in the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>plaint, with costs, such recovery to he apportioned in the manner prescribed by law between the defendants according to the value of their several devises.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b468-5\">Argued before HARDIN, P.

Patterson, 134 N. Y. 130, 31 N. E. 445, the history of the legislation leading up to the enactment of section 1843 of the Code is given, and at page 136, 134 N. Y., and page 447, 31 N. E., of the opinion, it is-said that it is quite apparent that section 1848 of the Code enlarges the rights of creditors by permitting recoveries \u201cwhen it appears that the creditors will be unable, with due diligence, tocoUect their debts by proceedings in the proper surrogate\u2019s court, and by action against the executor or administrator.\u201d The defense-of the statute of limitations interposed must fail if we follow Mortimer v. Chambers, 63 Hun, 342, 17 N. Y. Supp. 874, and the cases there cited. See, also, Hulbert v. Clark, 128 N. Y. 295, 28 N. E. 638; Code, \u00a7 388;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mead v.

I concur in affirmance.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-12\"> Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 388, provides as follows: \u201cAn action, the limitation-of which is not specially prescribed in this or the last title, must be commenced within ten years after the cause of action accrues.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b468-11\">MARTIN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AyNb\">(concurring.) Th\u00e9 evidence that the interest was-paid on the debt or notes which were the basis of this action, by the testator or for him, up to 1884, was not as full and complete as might be desired. That the interest was paid there is no-doubt, but that it was paid by or for the testator is not so clear. Still, I am disposed to think that it was sufficient to sustain the finding of the court upon that question. Hence, in considering' whether this action was barred by the statute of limitations, the statute must be regarded as having commenced to run in 1884. The trial judge held that the action was not barred, as it was-governed by section 388 of the Code, and could be brought within 10 years after the statute commenced to run. The cases of Wood v. Wood, 26 Barb. 356; Salisbury v. Morss, 7 Lans. 359, affirmed 55 N. Y. 675; and Mortimer v. Chambers, 63 Hun, 335, 17 N. Y. Supp. 874,\u2014sustain that conclusion. If, however, the ten-years limitation was not applicable, and the action was controlled by section 382, which provides that the actions herein mentioned shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\"be brought within six years, still the action was not barred. Section 400 provides that, where the commencement of an action has been stayed by statutory prohibition, the time of the continuance of the stay is not a part of the time limited for the commencement of an action. By referring to section 1844 it will be seen that this action could not have been brought until after three years had elapsed since the death of the decedent. Thus, the action was stayed by statutory prohibition for that period, and the three years during which it was thus stayed was not a part of the time limited for its commencement. Hence, the plaintiff in effect had nine years from the time of the last payment within which to bring this action. Mead v. Jenkins, 27 Hun, 570; Id., 29 Hun, 253; Mortimer v. Chambers, 63 Hun, 344, 17 N. Y. Supp. 874; Malloy v. Vanderbilt, 4 Abb. N. C. 127, 130. I think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
