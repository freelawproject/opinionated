The answer admitted the mailing of the contract, denied a wrongful discharge, and alleged that by reason of a clause in the contract the defendant was authorized to, and did, discharge, because the plaintiff was inattentive to business, careless in the performance of the duties by him undertaken, and guilty of a violation of the rules. The trial justice, at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">The only question in this case is whether the defendant had a right to discharge plaintiff. The contract between the parties did not give the defendant, at his mere pleasure, the right to discharge the plaintiff. It appears that plaintiff had been an experienced actor, of years\u2019 standing, and was engaged only after defendant\u2019s agent had witnessed his performance. The case was properly submitted to the jury, who found that the plaintiff had performed his duties fairly. It has been repeatedly held by this and other courts in this state that contracts similar to the one at bar did not give a party the right to discharge an employe summarily. See Brandt v. Godwin, (City Ct. N. Y.) 3 N. Y. Supp. 807; Id., (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 8 N. Y. Supp. 339, 9 N. Y. Supp. 743; Grinnell v. Kiralfy, 55 Hun, 422, 8 N. Y. Supp. 623. The judgment appealed from must therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
