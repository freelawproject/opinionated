The case before us does not faff within the reason of this rule. Appellant\u2019s plea in another action of the recovery of the judgment in question is not. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>used as a weapon, but as a shield. It is based upon the maxim that no man should be twice impleaded for the same cause of action. It is a plea in bar, and not in estoppel. As a plea in bar it is not inconsistent with the prosecution of the appeal. The motion to dismiss the appeal should be denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
