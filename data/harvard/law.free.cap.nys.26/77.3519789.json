It is contended on the part of the appellant that the judgment should have been absolutely set aside, without any conditions, for the reason that there was no personal service on the defendant. It appears that service of the summons herein was made on one Mortimer, a person who had been designated by defendant for that purpose. It is claimed, however, by defendant, that said Mortimer was not to use such designation, nor file the same with the county clerk, unless the defendant was traveling out of the United States. The designation, however, is general, and it authorizes Mortimer for one year from its date to receive service of summons or process in any action or proceeding in any court; and, the service having been made under such designation, the judgment was properly entered herein. It was therefore a judgment by default, and the justice at special term, in opening such default, had a right to impose the conditions he did. The order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
