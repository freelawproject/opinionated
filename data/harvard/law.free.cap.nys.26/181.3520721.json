It must be admitted that, when the plaintiff rested the case, it was a close question. But the trial judge wisely \u201cheard the other side,\u201d and the cross-examination brought out facts which establish plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. It thus appeared that the Italian whose blunder caused the injury was on that day employed at this work for the first time; that defendant made no inquiries about him,\u2014knew nothing of his fitness, having merely notified the \u201cpatron\u201d how many laborers were needed. And the foreman, upon whose direction, only, the stone should have been lowered, testified that he gave no such order. After this evidence, there is no serious question of defendant\u2019s liability. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
