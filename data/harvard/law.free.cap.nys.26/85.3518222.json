The commission to be paid was to be the difference between 50 cents, cost per cubic foot at the quarry, and any higher price the plaintiff should secure for. the defendant, it being understood that the purchaser should also agree to pay the freight. The cost of the freight, as shown, was <em>12\u00bd </em>cents per foot. The contract secured by the plaintiff for the defendant fixed the price at 70 cents per foot, which, after deducting the <em>62\u00bd </em>cents, left the commissions to which the plaintiff was entitled at <em>7\u00bd </em>cents per cubic foot. It is in evidence that the quantity to he used under contract was 9,042 feet, which, at <em>7\u00bd </em>cents, amounts to $678.37. After the making of the contract, the defendant, for the purpose of carrying out the same, sent a quantity of stone to Hickox, the purchaser, who declined to accept it on the ground it w;as not of the proper grade and quality, as called for in the contract, and thereupon refused to proceed any further. It appears by the evidence that the defendant was in fault, and did not, in the first shipment, send to the purchaser, Hickox, the grade or quality of stone called for. This did not affect the plaintiff. His duty had been performed when\u2019 he brought the minds of the parties together, and the contract was made. He had produced a purchaser who was ready, willing, and able to enter into a contract upon the defendant\u2019s terms. Wylie v. Bank, 61 N. Y. 415; Sibbald v. Iron Co., 83 N. Y. 378, 381, 382. The cases approving this are so numerous that it is unnecessary to cite them. We think the charge of the justice, under the evidence in the case, was fair and proper, and find no error. Judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
