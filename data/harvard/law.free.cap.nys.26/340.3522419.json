The execution was duly issued to the sheriff of Westchester county on June 21, 1886, and was levied on certain land of defendant Farrell. The land was, on October 4, 1886, sold under the execution, and was pm-chased by plaintiff for $30.03, and a certificate of sale was given to him by the sheriff. On November 5, 1886, an order was made for the examination of defendant Patrick Farrell in supplementary proceedings. The order contained the usual clause forbidding any transfer or a disposition of property belonging to the judgment debtor not exempt by law from execution until further order in the premises. On November 10, 1886, an order was made appointing a receiver of said Farrell\u2019s property, and also contained the restraining clause. On December 8, 1886, defendant Patrick Farrell and his wife executed to defendant Costello, in consideration of one dollar, a warranty deed of the premises which had been sold under execution. On December 14, 1886, said Costello obtained from the sheriff a certificate of redemption of the premises.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b361-6\">Argued before BARNARD, P.

As the case contains nothing to show the title of the receiver has ceased, we must treat it as in force. The title vested in the receiver, being qualified and limited, as stated above, did not exhaust the title of the judgment debtor. Subject to the right of the receiver to resort to the land to pay the judgment, the title remained in the judgment debtor, and the conveyance to Costello transferred to him the title, subject to the claim of the receiver. He was not a stranger to the title, and his redemption was valid, and nullified the sale, and the certificate issued thereunder. The sheriff correctly refused to execute a deed to Moore. The receiver is a necessary party to any action brought to apply the land to the payment of the judgment. So, should Costello seek to discharge the land from the lien of the judgment, the receiver would be a necessary party. The demurrer was properly sustained, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
