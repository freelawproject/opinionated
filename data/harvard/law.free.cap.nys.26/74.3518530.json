This court has held in Green v. Shute, 7 N. Y. Supp. 69, that the action of the trial justice in\" settling a case on appeal cannot be reviewed where there is a dispute as to the facts. In this case it appears that there were a number of conflicting affidavits as to the facts, and the trial justice determined it. The order must therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
