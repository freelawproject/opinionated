Thumb, administratrix of the said estate, etc., of the said Matilda Sunderlin, deceased, in the above-mentioned proceedings, alleges and respectfully shows unto this court that she has and owns a personal claim against the estate of Matilda Sunderlin, deceased, arising out of the following facts, to wit: That on or about the 20th day of January, 1891, the said Matilda Sunderlin entered into an agreement with the said Sarah O. Thumb whereby the said Matilda agreed to and with the said Sarah that the said Sarah should provide a home with herself for said Matilda, and supply and furnish her with board, lodging, and care during the period of the natural life of said Matilda, and in consideration thereof and therefor it was agreed and understood by said parties that Sarah 0. Thumb should have, own, and possess all the property the said Matilda died possessed' of and under her control; that, under and pursuant to said agreement, the said Matilda, from said time, lived and made her home with said Sarah 0. Thumb, and was by her provided with and furnished board, lodging, and care until her death, the said Matilda Sunderlin, which occurred on or about the 23d day of February, 1891; that said Sarah 0. Thumb fulfilled all the conditions of said agreement upon her part to be by her kept and performed, and prays that said property found in possession of said Matilda' Sunderlin at her death, and now in the hands of the administrators, duly appointed by the surrogate of this court, of the said goods, chattels, credits, and effects of the estate of said Matilda Sunderlin, deceased, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>payment of all the debts and the funeral expenses and costs of administration thereon, etc., be declared to be the property of said Sarah O.

Thumb. The surrogate has found that the deceased boarded with Sarah 0. Thumb for 30 years; that the value of board at the time in that locality was four dollars per week; and that she has never received any payment for the board and lodging so furnished. This, I think, should have been allowed. It is true that no specific claim for that amount was set forth in the written claim, which was devoted almost entirely to the statement of the alleged agreement by which she was to have all the property of the deceased that was left at the time of her death. Still, there is a request for such other relief as to the court may appear equitable in the premises. This was an accounting before the surrogate, and the person presenting this claim was one of the administrators of the estate. There was no order of reference, as is ordinarily the case where a claim against an estate is contested, where the referee would only be at liberty to determine upon the exact claim presented. It seems to me that the court here might have a little more latitude, under the claim made, than a referee appointed under the statute would. There has been no surprise. The time of the decedent\u2019s board and lodging is not controverted, and the value of the board and lodging per week was admitted on the hearing. The decree, I think, should therefore be modified, allowing and directing to be paid to Sarah O. Thumb the sum of $120 in payment for such board and lodging, and that the decree, as so modified, should be affirmed, with costs to the appellant to be paid out of the estate. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
