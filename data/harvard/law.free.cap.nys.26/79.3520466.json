The defendant denied any negligence on its part, and claimed that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by his own negligence. The case was submitted to the jury, and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $500. From the judgment entered thereon, and an order denying a motion for a new trial, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In his charge to the jury the learned trial justice said: \u201cYou have a right to believe or disbelieve the plaintiff entirely, unless he is corroborated. If he is corroborated, you have no right to disbelieve him,\u201d\u2014to which portion of the charge an exception was duly taken. The credibility of a witness is a question for the jury. Honegger v. Wettstein, 94 N. Y. 252; Bank v. Diefendorf, 123 N. Y. 200, 25 N. E. 402. And therefore the charge of the judge took from the jury the right to determine as to whether his conduct was such as to bring him within the rule that the jury were at liberty to accept or reject the testimony of an interested witness. Without examining any of the other questions submitted by appellant\u2019s counsel, we think the judgment, for the reason above stated, should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
