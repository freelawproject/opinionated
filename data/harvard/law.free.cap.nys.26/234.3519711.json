It appeared upon the trial that both the plaintiff and defendant were physicians, and that the plaintiff had been a student in the defendant\u2019s office at one time, and that the defendant had. loaned and advanced money to him; and, the plaintiff being in a distant state, the defendant had written the letters in endeavoring to collect what he claimed to be due him from the plaintiff. In the view that I have taken of the case, it is unnecessary to state the facts more fully. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a nonsuit on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to make a cause of action, \u201cfor the reason that the words charged in the complaint, the words contained in the letters, which are, in substance, that \u2018plaintiff is unreliable,\u2019 that \u2018he can\u2019t tell the truth,\u2019 and \u2018does not regard his financial obligations,\u2019 are not libelous per se; and, inasmuch as they are not used in reference to the plaintiff\u2019s business or profession, and no proof of special damages given, plaintiff has failed to make out a case as to those words.\u201d The court granted the motion, and in doing so stated: \u201cI do not think the words charged to have been written about the plaintiff are libelous per se. There is enough alleged in the complaint to make out a cause of action, but there is no proof to sustain it, namely, that he was injured in his business; therefore there is no damage shown, and I think the case is not made out.\u201d In this, I think, the court erred. Any written or printed matter published of and concerning a person that has a tendency to disgrace such person and bring him into ridicule and contempt is libelous per se. Morey v. Association, 123 N. Y. 207, 25 N. E. 161; Bergmann v. Jones, 94 N. Y. 51; Winchell v. Argus Co., 69 Hun, 354, 23 N. Y. Supp. 650. It seems to me that charging a man with being \u201cperfectly unreliable,\u201d that \u201che cannot tell the truth,\u201d and that \u201cany financial obligation does not seem to distress Mm in the least;\u201d that \u201che has been more than mean to me,\u201d is something that has a tendency to hold one up to scorn, and to bring one into ridicule and contempt, and diminish his respectability, and, as such, is libelous per se; and, being so, it was not necessary to either allege or prove special damages. Winchell v. Argus Co., 69 Hun, 354-360, 23 N. Y. Supp. 650. For that reason, and for the error of the court in holding that such language was not actionable per se, the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
