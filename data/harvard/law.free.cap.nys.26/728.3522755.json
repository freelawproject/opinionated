The decision of the general term was handed down and filed on November 16, 1891, and the defendant died the same day, about 10 A M. According to the papers used on this motion, no time is stated when the decision was filed. The order of affirmance was entered November 20, 1891. In the absence of positive proof as to exact time of filing the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>\u2022of general term, the presumption is it was filed during the lifetime -of the defendant. The order entered on November 20, 1891, was therefore proper, and in accordance with Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 763.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is supported by Long v. Stafford, 103 N. Y. 281, 8 N. E. 522. The case cited by appellant (Corbett v. Railroad Co., 114 N. Y. 579, 21 N. E. 1033) does not apply. In that case a nonsuit had been granted, and an appeal taken, and the general term reversed the order, and granted a new trial. Follett, C. J., in that case, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">\u201cNeither a verdict nor a report has been rendered in this action. The word \u2018decision,\u2019 as used in this section, refers to a decision made by a court upon \u2022a trial of issues without a jury. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 3343, suhd. 5. This action was not tried by the court without a jury, and the nonsuit is not a de.cisi\u00f3n, within the meaning of section 704. The order of the general term reversing the judgment entered on the nonsuit was not made upon the hearing or trial of the issues, and is not a decision, within the meaning of the -section last cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In the case at bar, it was an affirmance made upon the hearing and trial of the issues. Order is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-20\"> Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 763 provides that if either party to an action dies after \u25a0 a verdict, report, or decision, or an interlocutory judgment, but before final judgment is entered, the court must enter final judgment in the names of the original parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
