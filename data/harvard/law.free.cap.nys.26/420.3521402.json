There was a conflict of evidence, and it was for the jury to determine where the truth was. The exceptions taken during the progress of the trial are not sufficiently important to cause a reversal of the judgment. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs, there being no occasion for an opinion. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
