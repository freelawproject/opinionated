It is conceded that a policy of insurance was issued to the plaintiff\u2019s assignors; that fire destroyed the property which was covered by the policy; that the company received and retains the premiums paid by the insured. It is claimed by defendant, however, that, other insurance having been obtained without defendant\u2019s consent indorsed upon the policy, the policy is void, and that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. Whatever rights the defendant had under the provision of the policy which provided that the policy should be void \u201cif any additional insurance was procured on the property covered by the policy\u201d were waived by the defendants. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>appears that one of the plaintiff\u2019s assignors called on the manager of the defendant, and requested the said manager to indorse on the policy that other insurance had been procured, when said manager replied that it was not necessary. This, under the rule laid down in Pechner v. Insurance Co., 65 N. Y. 195, was clearly a waiver. An agent or manager who has the power to issue and cancel policies, and indorses consents, certainly has the power to-waive any condition in the policy. The proof clearly shows a compliance on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s assignors with the terms and, conditions of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The court had a perfect right to amend the complaint so as to increase the amount to 'that proven on the trial. The defendant did not object to the motion on the ground of surprise, and, as the amendment did not change the cause of action, the motion was a proper one. The judgment must therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
