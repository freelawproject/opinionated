In pursuance of the terms of the agreement, defendant executed two notes for the purchase price of plaintiff\u2019s interest,\u2014one for $5,300, payable in sixty days; and the other for $600, payable in one year. The latter is the note .in .suit. Plaintiff\u2019s' executory engagements and the transfer of his interest constitute an immediate and ample con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>sideraci\u00f3n for defendant\u2019s promise to pay. the price'of his purchase. But defendant argues that by a stipulation in the agreement \"the title to the copartnership interest sold was not to pass until payment of the $5,300 note. What of it? The consideration of the contract, then, would subsist in a reciprocity of promises,\u2014on the one part to transfer and on the other to pay,\u2014and such mutuality \u25a0of engagements is, upon elementary principles, sufficient to uphold an assumpsit. An action on the $5,300 note would lie before the \u2022transfer of the title, because such is the legal effect of the agreement, and the obvious intent of the parties. The plaintiff retained the title as security for the price, and, if he cannot get the price until the title passes, the security would be worse than nugatory, and the express object of the parties frustrated. It is the common case of a conditional sale, in which payment is a prerequisite to the passage of title. Foundry Co. v. Grant, 114 N. Y. 40, 21 N. E. 49; Manufacturing Co. v. Walker, 114 N. Y. 7, 20 N. E. 625. Indeed, for anything apparent in the record, the $5,300 note has been paid, and 'the title vested in the defendant. The defendant offered proof of -a conditional delivery of the note in suit, and he relies upon an exception to the exclusion of the evidence to reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Oral proof of a condition precedent to the validity of a written contract, if not contradictory of its terms, is certainly admissible, (Reynolds v. Robinson, 110 N. Y. 654, 18 N. E. 127;) because, like evidence of fraud and duress, it goes, not to the alteration, but to the defeat of the contract. Evidence of noncompliance, with an \u2022extrinsic oral stipulation upon which the validity of the paper as -an operative instrument is suspended, is simply proof that there was no contract, and so is consistent with the familiar principle. 'The trouble with the defendant is that under the pleadings the proof was not available to him. He admitted the note, and answered merely that it was without consideration. At the trial he offered evidence of another and different defense, and, upon objection to its irrelevancy, the court properly excluded it The fundamental rule in the production of evidence is that \u201cit must correspond with the allegations, and be confined to the point in issue.\u201d 1 Greenl.
