But, as no objection was taken to the admission of the evidence offered, a reversal for that reason will not be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-14\">The referee has found that the total cost to the defendants of the action and of this proceeding, including the expense of the motion to vacate the injunction, was $200; but it appears that the defendants were awarded by the judgment, and their attorney has received -from the plaintiffs, $115, which sum the referee should have deducted from the total amount which he found had been incurred by the defendants in the action. Howell v. Miller, 5 N. Y. Law Bul. 88. The order appealed from should be so modified as to direct that the plaintiffs pay to the defendants the sum of $85, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
