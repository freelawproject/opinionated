During this period, Brown &amp; Skinner were insurance brokers in the city of New York, who were employed by the plaintiffs to procure insurance on their property. July 14, 1892, the defendant, in consideration of $52.50, through Ackerman, Deyo &amp; Hilliard, insured the plaintiffs\u2019 wool, under policy No. 5,934,416, for one year, against loss by fire, in a sum not exceeding $5,000. Attached to the policy was a stipulation called an \u201cEighty per Gent. Coinsurance Clause,\u201d of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b712-12\">\u201cN. Y. Standard.

Afterwards, the plaintiffs improved the building wherein the property was stored, by reason of which they claimed that they were entitled to have the premium reduced; and on the 26th of August, 1892, their agents, Brown &amp; Skinner, delivered this and other policies issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>by Ackerman, Deyo &amp; Hilliard to them for the purpose of having the premium reduced. On the delivery of the policy, Ackerman, Deyo &amp; Hilliard delivered a binding slip, of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b713-5\">\u201cNew York, August, 1892.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b713-6\">\u201cWe, the undersigned insurance companies, do hereby insure Belt, Barber &amp; Co. for the amount set opposite our respective names, subject to the conditions of standard fire insurance policy of the state of New York, on stock of wool contained in 120 and 122 Wooster St, N.

About 10 days after the fire the policy was returned to Brown &amp; Skinner, who delivered it to the plaintiffs. When returned, it was indorsed as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b713-10\">\u201cAug. 22, \u201992, rate reduced to 63% for improvements under slip No. 1,485, return premium $18.78 therefor.

On the 26th of October the plaintiffs and the several insurance companies interested agreed that the damage occasioned by the fire was $87,000. On the 27th of October, 1892, the plaintiffs verified and served upon the defendant proofs of loss, by which they claimed $3,294.-88, which the defendant on the 7th of November, 1892, paid, less a reduction for interest, and surrendered the policy, giving the following receipt:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b713-16\">\u201c3,294.88.

Knowing this, the plaintiffs subsequently received the policy with the rate of premium reduced, a 100 per cent, coinsurance clause substituted, thereafter filed proofs of loss claiming on the basis of the 100 per cent, coinsurance clause, were paid the full amount of their claim, and surrendered the policy. This, we think, amounted to a ratification of the substitution of the 100 per cent, coinsurance clause for the 80 per cent, coinsurance clause, even if there were no previous authority to make the change, of which there is some evidence in the case. The presumption arising from the evidence is that the change was either authorized or ratified. There was indorsed on the policy this memorandum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">\u201c68 c.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">\u201cFull Coin. CL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN5z\">' \u201cBuild., 65.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">\u201cStock, 10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">\u201cCo. full clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">The evidence tended to show that this indorsement was made by the clerk of Brown &amp; Skinner before the policy was delivered to Ackerman, Deyo &amp; Hilliard for a change of rate. If it were so made by the plaintiffs\u2019 agents, it authorized the substitution of a full, or 100 per cent., coinsurance clause for the 80 per cent, coinsurance clause. There is no evidence in the case which would sustain a finding that the change was secretly or fraudulently made. What negotiations, if any, were had between the agents, which led to the reduction of the premium, do not appear. We think the evidence fails to establish a cause of action in favor of the plaintiffs, and that the judgment dismissing the complaint was right, and should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
