From an examination of the affidavits upon which this order was granted and the pleadings in the case, it does not clearly appear to me that the special term abused the discretion vested in it, and therefore I think that the order appealed from should be affirmed. Let an order be entered accordingly, with $10 costs and printing and other disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
