width=\"773\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">It appears from the record that the \u201cplate-like configuration\u201d visible on the brace of the trumpet in the illustration is, as actually used by appellant, a medallion bearing the profile representations of Georges LeBlanc, the founder of appellant corporation, and Leon, his son. It is also clear that appellant considers its trademark to be the provision of a <em>medallion </em>on the brace of the trumpet, although during prosecution it was stated that \u201c[i]t is not particularly important just what the medallion is, since it is the provision of a medallion brace which is the distinguishing feature.\u201d The present characterization of the asserted trademark, in language broad enough to read on a blank disc being used in place of the medallion was inserted in the application by appellant in an attempt to overcome the examiner\u2019s insistence that the drawing be amended in order that the details of the medallion be shown more clearly. Appellant now stresses that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOn\">Trademark rights are asserted in the plate-like enlargement itself, insofar as the present proceeding is concerned, irrespective of whether the indicia on the face of the enlargement are visible or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">Appellant has included in the record, in an effort to prove that its so-called \u201cmedallion - brace\u2019\u2019 * does function as a trademark, a number of letters from customers, prospective customers and dealers, typical of which is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-13\">Dear Charley\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-14\">The medallion on the brace on the trumpet gives immediate recognition to the viewer (no matter what the distance) that this instrument is a LeBlanc. No other instrument has any identifying mark of that nature and because of this the LeBlanc medallion makes it an easy matter to recognize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqbb\">My regards to Vito and everyone, /s/ Al Hirt</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-15\">In refusing to register appellant\u2019s mark, the examiner first took the position that appellant was attempting to register the \u201cmere location\u201d of a particular medallion on the brace of a trumpet and that a \u201clocation,\u201d per se, cannot function as a trademark.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Alternatively, he argued that if the trademark is considered to be a \u201cmedallion brace,\u201d as it is characterized by appellant, it would still not be registrable since a brace is a purely functional feature of a trumpet and regardless of the fact that its center is somewhat enlarged, appellant\u2019s trumpet brace is primarily functional. The solicitor has essentially repeated these two arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>The board affirmed the refusal to register, but for what appear to be entirely different reasons. Evidently rejecting the \u201cfunctionality\u201d argument,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but agreeing that appellant was asserting rights in a \u201clocation,\u201d the board went on to concede that, while a particular location on particular goods might be registrable, appellant had not satisfactorily established that it was the particular location rather than the 'medallion itself which was recognized by the public as appellant\u2019s trademark. The following excerpts from the board\u2019s opinion will bear out this interpretation of its holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-5\">In our opinion, what applicant seeks to register is the location of the background vehicle for applicant\u2019s actual mark, a medallion bearing a specific design, and that it is the latter means by which persons would actually identify applicant\u2019s goods and distinguish them from the goods of others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-7\">Applicant has submitted in evidence several letters by dealers in musical instruments to the effect that the placing of the medallion on the brace for the trumpet was a good means to identify the instruments as to origin, and a large number of letters from customers, prospective customers and dealers, who state in effect that they can recognize the Leblanc medallion on the brace of the trumpet even at a considerable distance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-8\">While it may well be that the aforementioned persons recognize the Leblanc medallion from a distance and know of its location on the trumpet (because they have no doubt previously and frequently viewed the instrument at close range), the letters are not persuasive that the location of a plate-like configuration identifies applicant\u2019s goods and distinguishes them from the goods of others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-10\">The examiner and the board based their respective positions on the holding of this court in In re Kotzin, 276 F.2d 411, 47 CCPA 852 (1960). In that case, the asserted trademark was the location, in a vertical position near the waistband of men\u2019s trousers, of a rectangular, cloth label. The position of the Patent Office had been, as was the examiner\u2019s here, that a \u201clocation\u201d can not function as a trademark. We rejected that position, using the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADg\">[Wjhile granting that a location per se cannot be a trademark, we do not see why a particular \u201ctag\u201d (which is what the application calls for), particularly located on particular goods, cannot indicate origin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-11\">Having held that the mark there sought to be registered was not inherently incapable of functioning as a trademark, the court went on to affirm the board\u2019s decision because the record did not establish that the mark was, in fact, a trademark. It was pointed out that the label served as the vehicle for some very prominent writing, including a word trademark for the goods there involved. Because of this fact, it was felt that the visual significance of the label, by itself, would far outweigh any trademark significance in its particular point of attachment, \u201csubmerging the latter to a point of insignificance.\u201d From this point, the court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-12\">If there were no visible writing on the tag so that its presence in the side seam near the waistband seemed to be</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_c\">arbitrary, we might feel otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-13\">The parallel of the instant case with the facts in <em>Kotzin is </em>striking. Recognizing this parallel, appellant has argued that it has demonstrated that its particular device (the medallion), located in this particular position (on the brace adjacent the tuning slide) on this particular instrument (trumpet), identifies the instrument as being a LeBlanc in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>strument and does so <em>\u201ceven though the indicia thereon cannot be seen.\u201d </em>(Emphasis appellant\u2019s). The board, on the other hand, held, as indicated earlier, that all it could be sure of from appellant\u2019s evidence was that people recognize the LeBlanc medallion as a trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">We find some sympathy for the board\u2019s reasoning since we also find that appellant\u2019s letters are strong evidence that the medallion bearing the images of Georges and Leon LeBlanc is, by itself, a trademark for appellant\u2019s goods. Nevertheless, we further find no reason to conclude from this that the letters are not also persuasive proof of the fact that customers and others in the trade <em>additionally </em>recognize the particular configuration, formed by locating the medallion in its particular position on the goods, as serving to identify those goods and distinguish them from those manufactured or sold by others. We think that the board erred in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">On this record, we are satisfied that the configuration adopted by appellant is unique. It appears that no other manufacturer includes any sort of discernible enlargement on the brace adjacent the trumpet\u2019s main tuning slide. The letters submitted also provide satisfactory proof that the instrument can be identified even though the details of the medallion are not visible (as when the trumpet is viewed on television or from a distance seated in an audience.) The peculiar nature of the goods here involved make this an important consideration. Considering the evidence in the record as a whole, we are satisfied that the configuration asserted by appellant does function to distinguish its goods from those of others and, therefore, should be registered on the Principal Register under section <em>2 </em>of the Lanham Act. The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1056-7\">WORLEY, C.

This explains the examiner\u2019s insistence, alluded to earlier, that the details of the medallion be made to appear in the drawing. The examiner reasoned that since \u201cthe idea of a medallion, just any medallion on the brace of a trumpet could not be protected under the Trademark Statute\u201d, appellant could register \u201ca definite design on a medallion on the brace of a trumpet\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1055-9\">. We agree with the board that this case holds no support for the \u201cfunctionality\u201d argument of the examiner and the solicitor. Appellant is obviously not claiming as its trademark a trumpet brace, per se.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
