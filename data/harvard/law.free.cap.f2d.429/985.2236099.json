According to appellant\u2019s specification, this process is \u201cwell-known,\u201d and its parameters \u201chave been explored in detail.\u201d For example, it is said to be known that by varying certain conditions, such as process temperature, pressure and flow rates, it is possible to \u201cselect a given starting conversion level which determines the amount of isopropanol initially produced by the process.\u201d However, it also appears to be known to the prior art that, when the process is operated for extended periods of time, the conversion level tends to diminish, and that this decrease is probably due to the deactivation of the resin by loss of sulfonic acid groups. The specification indicates that it would be beneficial to maintain conversion levels constant and mentions that one attempt to accomplish this, by chemically regenerating the activity of the catalyst, has not proved to be very practical. Appellant asserts that he has devised a method of carrying out the process whereby conversion rates are maintained at constant levels while at the same time the overall efficiency of the process is \u201cgreatly increased.\u201d This is accomplished, according to the disclosure :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-15\">* * * by the expediency of incrementally increasing the temperature of the reaction throughout the process, which increase is determined by the application of the following equation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-16\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"93\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAfkAAABdAQAAAACONyIFAAAEqUlEQVR4nKWYvY8VVRiHn5k7eAcDu6MNl0TZiaGw0ktsIMHskJC4Nob4D0hJpRhNXBNlz8qqt6Q1saDwj7Ag5qAFFCrSUBiLcQFzTYzMrps4kNl5Lebjzieee/ctdt6z73mf+Z3vMxfJ7SMxtOXSuyoiyhIAkEMJRiaH48K1BDbtvJCmZvnwQumNAApA8o5hfnqhdE8WMgAeT1fMAPKwlPB4WGlC7BkqsMLSncCsCTuuMgPs+6WrqgC7XbXHGi8qEkNHGwKudwMcYwlON0ATmuXb5Tzi3ypgYkVmAGvmulXAwpYDxGP9QIDUP6ACAs6aVJ8C+wok4HENkChO9ORo2COERI5SDlUaNBX0mlyAn3h53394ZU/Bbgga2Dl1XgHltIiHLAPWctQEpDHoG8leFGrg9vFxVH9nXtqBntWU/AZf8+7g259ZVxBm6zFRa7auArazx5k2xFqCl/SXEdb9LfBuZTUsdyuoKXDA0UDQAsSAlYDvkYAaZTM5dtRmDaCBECFuAbIJi4NSFqDW8gWd5COSAyZgR1h57YZJlkAMvg9EgH2TUjuAl60S/UwXoLaCxpWmzRQItLYaZjUl23l3u5AZIPWB092AQqpSQBgW5e0agAC624/L/mYISRhlvfYLeOAS4VcASfJBED9L1yDI7p7++/zHS6z6DnApAAXCVn6gZJ0Yfw6Hj//Bo7d0S/rJP/nwyqGNtbsAl0/NIkG1CQBTuvZF23WDc9YRN0K7gO+BDw6XisNURESisbV5f2Bwtt8SkXRVJNmQREREVNaE5TuA4flOCtiaZMB0BKSf3hLZyF9w9rXd1cY7M+zbg/euZenVVg5EVOu9Kw1Ax8DUALap8Ip5heMAtjOYvH71xDiUO6l7Rh5J2Kg9FLkjIlK0bVnkUU2dQdeLSHajEhEZ1v+tTE8m2cqdG42AKeDJKHdeXBAQX8ydUbAY4K7Kncb1wBjwfZkQ9gM2/X6AA+zbQPMeUVPQiFVtAvnO17gGVAFv9E9b8QD7tKJ1dFQBvu4FpD5gPaNpLdpaE/xeQBL0VaoBnrKwVOktPQXQb9l15NegHTEERABMFTCclecAZNWeK8vPdwMe9AJCAF4BcFQ+IToAuhfgQC3tWCfgq0kvAIA0LDzL71bg9ebeBrJbIramOqqGEwmAQamANzsBG/rpAIpdqbcT++2aLFuWJ97R950GobnB9Fm6Czs2XBtY9YChAtUon5tbwUBg+97ak3sRgPVdGbCkL6XX/LBS2DTdVHvNEBAcFBAeFAA72aP1M4MZQHwiBc6+/0/Q6PV5+kDSZBqFCylAcwJ4Ndb3m5F5hjFds5IfLzfW7FzD6Oy2I2aAfAEpNYPNqUADJDD2mgNpPpE0DhAFjcg8nZhU/s4LiMqm68beYAhYB2LnExW1PkoMAQnwFyyFsdpphMzuqT9IOLiZEg31yu8L3VRTAMs64vr+dj1iCFjh2IMxXwy8UaAXAoA7gnXCoer5Iep/zKP4cJXGCWwIcBV8A0DqLQRwdPFlm/gLAewQLgMwDRYCzG5VoVoIYO0V3s1GxFTBlfwpny0IWFXZ88mRBQHj69lz4i0IcKcAiLrYCPwH9z93AmgPwfwAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"506\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-18\">where</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-19\">C = conversion level in mole %</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-20\">V = liquid hourly space velocity of propylene</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-21\">3 P = pounds per in (gauge)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-23\">D = days</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-24\">T \u00ab temperature in \u201cF., and A T is the daily D</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-26\">temperature increase in \u00b0F., to maintain a selected conversion level.

Young discloses that the reaction temperature may be kept at about 250-425 \u00b0F., but teaches that the lower temperatures are preferred for producing alcohols rather than ethers. It is also stated that at temperatures above 450 \u00b0F. the catalyst has a relatively short active life. In Table II of the patent, an increase in conversion as temperature is increased is clearly indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">The Plummer and Ipatieff references are not directed to the liquid phase hydration of propylene at all. Plummer is directed to the vapor phase conversion of ordinary naphthas to high octane motor fuels using heavy metal oxides as catalysts. The patent does contain a disclosure that after the process has been operating a while and the catalyst becomes partially spent, an \u201cincrease in the severity of reaction conditions\u201d (e.g., by increasing reaction temperatures) is necessary in order to obtain the same degree of conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">Ipatieff, in a discussion of a third different process using a third different type of catalyst, mentions that the catalyst \u201csoon became poisoned and necessitated an increase in the operating temperature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-10\">THE REJECTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">In rejecting the claims under 35 U.S. C. \u00a7 103, the examiner was of the opinion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-12\">It would be obvious to one skilled in the art to apply the concept of increasing the temperature of a catalytic reaction to compensate for a decrease in catalytic activity, alluded to by Ipatieff and enlarged upon by Plummer, to other catalytic reactions such as the hydration of olefins shown by Young.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-13\">With regard to the use of the formula to determine the daily temperature increment required to maintain the conversion level constant, the examiner considered that this was also \u201cwithin the skill of a worker in the art.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-14\">As to the rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, the examiner conceded appellant\u2019s assertion that the scope of the description is as broad as the claims since both are couched in the same generic or descriptive terminology. He stated, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-15\">It is pointed out that one must look not only at the broad or descriptive terminology in a specification, but also to the concrete examples to determine the scope of the invention. It is clear from the examples that the formula appearing in claims 2 to 4 was derived under controlled conditions and it is not readily apparent that the formula is applicable outside those controlled conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-16\">The Board of Appeals accepted every one of the examiner\u2019s positions. In addition, it went to one of the \u201cbackground\u201d references cited by appellant in his specification and pointed out that there, too, it is taught that conversion levels tend to diminish during operation of the process with the particular sulfonated ion exchange resin employed by appellant and also that an increase in temperature increases conversion. It was, therefore, concluded that it would be.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-17\">* * * quite obvious to any chemical engineer that in order to maintain the same degree of conversion when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>latter decreases, the temperature may be raised sufficiently to compensate for such conversion drop, thus to anticipate appellant\u2019s claimed contribution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">The rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 was also sustained, the board, however, only applying that rejection to claims 2-4. Agreeing with the examiner that \u201cnumerous factors other than those set forth in the equation affect conversion,\u201d the board concluded that the validity of the equation in circumstances other than those specifically described in the specification examples \u201ccannot be accepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">The initial issue with regard to the rejection under section 103 is, quite evidently, the propriety of the combining of the disclosures of the two secondary references with that of the Young patent. Resolution of this question will necessarily depend upon a determination of \u201cthe art to which [the] subject matter [sought to be patented] pertains.\u201d It would appear manifestly artifical and improper, however, to conclude that the \u201cart\u201d to which the instant claimed subject matter pertains is the art of manufacturing isopropanol by the liquid phase hydration of propylene over a sulfonic acid ion exchange resin. The claimed invention deals with optimization of a chemical process and this is the particular province of the chemical engineer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is apparent that the secondary references here were not cited with the idea in mind that they contain information which would suggest to one working with the instant process a method for improving its efficiency, in which case it might be proper to ask why such references would be considered in the first place. Rather, as suggested in the board\u2019s opinion, they were cited in an attempt to prove that it would be within the level of ordinary skill of one trained in the field of chemical engineering to compensate for a decreasing conversion rate provided by a catalyst the activity of which increases at higher temperatures by increasing the reaction temperature. We think this approach was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">Viewing the obviousness rejection in this light, we now consider its propriety. Looking first at the language of the claims, we find that they do, in fact, recite the asserted improvement as the single operative step of increasing the reaction temperature, the increase being accomplished incrementally and each increment being sufficient to substantially maintain the conversion level. We note that the claims require that the reaction process be a continuous one, employing a specific type of catalyst, and having a conversion level initially fixed by selecting pressure, liquid velocity and starting temperature values. While it is not expressly stated in the claims, we observe that the claimed improvement additionally requires that, with the exception of temperature, those factors which are initially selected to fix a conversion level (all of which would affect conversion if altered), are to be maintained constant during the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-10\">Given the known facts, which seem to be admitted by appellant, that the conversion level of the basic process tends to diminish with time and that this is caused by the catalyst becoming deactivated, it follows that claim 1 in particular, reads on nothing more than the general method of compensating for decreased catalyst activity in this process by increasing the reaction temperature. The Patent Office having established that one of ordinary skill in this art was aware that the activity of this particular catalyst did increase at higher temperatures and accepting the secondary references as properly applied to demonstrate the expected level of ordinary skill in the art, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>we are persuaded that the conclusion of obviousness was correct and the rejection of claim 1 on that ground must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">With regard to claims 2-4, reciting the formula, we are similarly satisfied that the rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 was proper. The examiner made the observation that this formula was empirically derived, but unfortunately did not explain how he came to that conclusion or what effect that fact would have on the obviousness of the claimed improvement. Nevertheless, we do observe that the only variable in the formula is the temperature, every other parameter having a fixed value. Setting aside, for the moment, the position of the board that these claims are too broad since other factors would affect conversion, we are unable to see any other way that the formula could have been obtained except by observation and plotting of the daily temperature increments necessary to accomplish the result of maintaining the conversion level constant, and conversion therefrom to an algebraic equation. Claims 2-4 then, are also drawn to what we have already decided is the obvious expedient of increasing the temperature to offset catalyst deterioration in an otherwise constant process, with the additive factor of providing a method whereby the necessary daily increment based on fixed starting values may be predetermined. The recited formula is manifestly little more than a convenience factor. The specification does not indicate how it was determined and we find nothing in the record which sufficiently rebuts the examiner\u2019s position that such a determination would also be within the level of ordinary skill in this art. The rejection of claims 2-4 under 35 U.S. C. \u00a7 103 is also affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">Having reached the conclusion that the rejection of the claims under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 should be sustained, we make no decision regarding the rejection under section 112. The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1050-11\">.
