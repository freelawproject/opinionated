In accordance with known principles of secondary emission, a surface bombarded with a primary ion beam emits secondary ions characteristic of the materials composing the surface. In appellants\u2019 microanalyser, those secondary ions are filtered so that only the ions representative of a particular element under investigation are retained. In that respect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>device is like a mass spectrometer. Unlike a mass spectrometer, however, the present microanalyser contains optical elements, such as ion lenses, which serve to retain the ions in positions related to their point of origin in the sample as they pass through the device. The result is that an image or map of the surface with respect to the distribution of a particular element is obtained, whereas in a mass spectrometer a purely quantitative measure, such as a count, of that element is obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">According to appellants\u2019 specification, prior art microanalysers utilized only momentum filtration, that is, the secondary ions were separated according to momentum, with ions of other than a predetermined momentum being discarded by the device. Since the microanalyser is intended to discriminate particles by mass, the employment of momentum filtration alone led to errors, since not all the secondary ions leave the sample with the same initial velocity. Appellants add energy filtration means to the momentum filtration means in a manner to eliminate the effects of variable initial velocities while still preserving the optical image of the surface. To accomplish that, they provide lens means near the sample surface and a spherical capacitor having an exit slit, the capacitor being so positioned as to provide an image cross-over at the slit. The slit eliminate all ions having energies higher or lower than desired. After exiting from the slit, the ion beam is passed through an electrostatic lens system, the momentum filter and thence to an image converter, the beam all the while retaining its optical features to give a true view of the location on the sample surface of the element being investigated. Appellants disclose, as an alternative, that an \u201cion mirror\u201d can be used in place of the spherical capacitor for energy filtration.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Claim 4, rewritten in independent form to include the limitations of non-appealed claims 2 and 3 from which it depends, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">4. A microanalyser arrangement for providing a characteristic ionic image of the surface of a sample by bombarding said sample with particles causing the emission of secondary characteristic ions, said arrangement comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">a primary ion source for bombarding said sample;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">lens means for concentrating said secondary ions to form a beam providing an ionic image of the sample surface;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">means positioned in the path of said beam for eliminating, from said beam, ions having an energy higher than a predetermined value, for obtaining an energy filtered beam;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-12\">magnetic field means positioned in the path of said filtered beam for rejecting therefrom the ions having a momentum different from a predetermined value, said magnetic means having an outlet; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A75\">means located at said outlet for displaying said ionic image,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-13\">wherein said magnetic field means comprise a magnetic sector and means for controlling the magnetic field in said sector,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-14\">wherein said eliminating means comprise a spherical capacitor, having two plates facing each other and an outlet, means for creating between said plates a direct current electric field, and a wall having a slit, said slit being positioned near said outlet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-15\">Claims 5 to 7 are similar to claim 4 except that the energy filtering means recited is an ion mirror rather than a spherical capacitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-16\"> The examiner rejected all the claims for indefiniteness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, being of the view that the terms \u201celiminating\u201d and \u201crejecting\u201d employed in the claims are not \u201cconventional terms.\u201d He suggested defining the two means as \u201cdeflecting\u201d means. The board affirmed that rejection without discussion, beyond adopting \u201cthe reasons set forth in the Examiner\u2019s Answer not overruled by us.\u201d We agree with appellants that those terms used in the claims do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>render them indefinite. In fact, the expressions \u201celiminating\u201d and \u201crejecting\u201d seem to be entirely accurate in describing the action of the energy filter since the filtering components remove from the emission ions of other than a selected energy. Whether the terms are conventional is not necessarily controlling. An applicant is ordinarily entitled to be his own lexicographer, so long as his meaning is clear, as it is here.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The examiner further rejected claim 4 as anticipated by Herzog<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102. Herzog discloses a mass spectrometer utilizing both momentum filtration and energy filtration, the latter being accomplished by what Herzog calls a \u201ctoroid condenser.\u201d Both the examiner and the board were of the view that the \u201ctoroid condenser\u201d of Herzog was the same as the \u201cspherical capacitor\u201d recited in claim 4. We need not pass on that point, for we agree with appellants that the position of the board fails to give proper weight to the difference between a mass spectrometer and a microanalyser of the type appellants claim. As mentioned above, the latter provides an ionic image of a surface; it contains optical elements not found in a conventional mass spectrometer, which gives only quantitative indications of the presence of an element. The board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">Merely denominating apparatus set forth in the preamble of the instant claims as a microanalyzer and further stating its purpose to be for providing an image of a surface of a sample does not set forth structure that differentiates from apparatus which forms an image of slit 18 in Herzog.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">That position appears to ignore the fact that claim 4 distinguishes over mass spectrometers such as Herzog\u2019s by recitations outside the preamble. The body of the claims recites \u201clens means for concentrating said secondary ions to form a beam providing an ionic image of the sample surface,\u201d and also \u201cmeans located at said outlet for displaying said ionic image.\u201d Herzog, whose device terminates with a counter, has no such image-forming or focusing means and no means for displaying an ionic image. The board went on. to say, regarding Herzog:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">Furthermore, even if the claims had been limited to structure whose function was to deflect the ion-beam so as to form an image of the surface of a sample, it is not seen that this would be unobvious under 35 U.S.C. 103 since \u25a0 appellants acknowledge * * * [in] their specification that microanalyzers were known prior to their instant invention * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">We fail to see how appellants\u2019 acknowledgment that some form of microanalyser is old can render the claimed invention obvious. Appellants contend that those prior art microanalysers had only momentum filtration. We have no evidentiary basis for concluding that appellants\u2019 addition of energy filtration means, plus certain optical means for preserving the ionic image of the sample surface, was obvious. Herzog shows, at most that in mass spectrometers, where the optical and image-preservation problems of the present device are not a consideration, it was known to employ both energy and momentum filtration. Since the board has not set forth any reason how or why Herzog would suggest that the use of both kinds of filtration in a microanalyser of the type claimed here would elminate the effects of variable initial velocities of the secondary ions while still preserving the optical image of the surface under investigation, we are unwilling to conclude that such use would have been obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">Essentially the same considerations apply to claims 5-7. The examiner rejected those claims under \u00a7 103 on Herzog in view of Noda,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which shows the use of an ion mirror in a mass spectrometer. The board affirmed, stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>it would be obvious to substitute Noda\u2019s ion mirror in Herzog\u2019s device. That position again overlooks the optical features of appellants\u2019 microanalyser which are designed to preserve the image of the sample surface. Neither Herzog nor Noda, taken separately or together, disclose or render obvious those optical features, and we must accordingly reverse the board\u2019s rejection of claims 5-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\">.
