We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-22\">Walker was convicted in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida on four counts charging narcotics violations. His direct appeal to this court was unsuccessful. Walker v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 397 F.2d 789, cert. denied, 394 U.S. 962, 89 S.Ct. 1311, 22 L.Ed.2d 563. He subsequently filed in the trial court a motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The motion was denied, and no appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-23\">Walker\u2019s next move was to file the petition now before us \u2014 a petition for habeas corpus in the Northern District of Georgia, the district in which he is incarcerated. In his petition Walker questioned the admissibility of certain evidence adduced at his trial. The district court denied the petition, ruling that the proper procedure for raising the issue is a \u00a7 2255 motion filed in the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-24\">The district court\u2019s ruling is clearly correct. A federal prisoner\u2019s primary post-conviction remedy is a \u00a7 2255 motion filed in the sentencing court rather than a petition for habeas corpus filed in the district of confinement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 2255 commands federal district courts to refuse to entertain a habeas corpus petition from a federal prisoner unless it appears that the \u00a7 2255 remedy \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d As this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>said in Accardi v. Blackwell, 5 Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 911, 914, \u201cA federal prisoner seeking habeas corpus relief has the difficult burden of coming forward with evidence which affirmatively shows the ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 relief in his case, and he cannot satisfy this requirement by merely showing that his previous \u00a7 2255 petition was unsuccessful.\u201d Walker has failed to produce any such affirmative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">The district court\u2019s denial of the petition, which was in no way an adjudication on the merits, is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1366-14\">. Pursuant to our Rule 18 this ease is decided without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1366-15\">. United States v.
