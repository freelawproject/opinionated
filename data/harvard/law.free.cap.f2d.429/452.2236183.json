Appellant has discovered that \u201cionizable, halogen-free monoorgano mercuric compounds\u201d are especially useful for catalyzing reactions between compounds having at last one reactive iso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>cyanate group (\u2014 NCO) and compounds having at least one reactive hydroxyl group ( \u2014 OH) to produce a solid, non-cellular polyurethane product. Appellant\u2019s contribution resides entirely in the catalyst used, the process being otherwise old. Referring to the catalysts useful in his process, appellant\u2019s brief states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\">This class of compounds may for convenience be characterized by the formula</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">RHgX</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">wherein R is an organo radical such as an alkyl or an aryl group <em>joined directly to the mercury by a carbon-to-mercury bond, </em>and X represents an organic or inorganic moiety <em>joined to the mercury by some other bond than carbon </em>* * *, e. g., oxygen in the case of a hydroxyl or acid moiety, nitrogen in the case of the ammonium salts, etc. <em>By definition in the specification, compounds which are monoorgano-mercuric have \u201conly one carbon-to-mercury bond\u201d </em>* * * [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Appellant\u2019s brief also explains some of the advantages of the claimed process as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">Appellant\u2019s invention is that certain classes of mercuric compounds selectively catalyze the secondary hydroxylisocyanate (OH-NCO) reaction, and promote it apparently to the substantial exclusion of the water-isocyanate (H20-NC0) reaction when small amounts of H20 are present in the same reactive system with reactive OH groups * * Since these classes of mercuric compounds show no such selectivity when studying their effects in NCO-H2O or NCO-OH reactive systems separately * * *, this selectivity could not be predicted. This discovery is of far reaching commercial importance since it results in the ability to mix monomeric organic polyisocyanates and organic polymeric polyols with one another to provide normally liquid systems for the direct conversion into polymeric elastomers having predictable cure times and reproducible final properties even in the presence of considerable moisture * * *. This was not possible before because other prior known catalytic soluble compounds of metals were either found to indiscriminately promote the water-isocyanate reaction as well as the hydroxyl-isocyanate reaction or to be inhibited by water * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">While the NC0-H20 and NCO-OH reaction competition is encouraged in the formation of polyurethane <em>foams </em>as the carbon dioxide released in the reaction, NCO \u2022+ H20 NHCONH + C02, constitutes the foaming agent, such competition is an anathema to the formation of <em>nom-cellular </em>solid polyurethane rubbers or elastomers. In the latter instance the NCO + OH \u25a0)\u00bb \u25a0 &gt;\u25a0 NHCOO reaction is required to the exclusion of the NC0-H20 reaction since the presence of gaseous reaction products causes bubbling or otherwise results in rubbers or elastomers having inferior physical properties * *. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">Claims 19-26 are directed to the above-described process and claims 27 and 28 to the products of the processes of claims 23 and 25, respectively. Claims 19-21 and 27 are representative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-13\">19. A process for accelerating the urethane linkage forming reaction between isocyanate and hydroxyl groups in the formation of a urethane product, said process comprising reacting an organic compound having at least one reactive isocyanate group with an organic compound having at least one reactive hydroxyl group in the presence of a catalytic amount of an ionizable, halogen-free, monoorgano mercuric compound having a single carbon to mercury valence bond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-14\">20. The process of claim 19 wherein said monoorgano mercuric compound is a phenyl mercuric compound.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-15\">21. The process of claim 19 wherein said monoorgano mercuric compound is a phenyl mercuric salt of a carboxylic acid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>27. A product made in accordance with the process of claim 23.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">There are two prior art rejections under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103, and at least one rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. The latter rejection, which we consider first, was stated in the examiner\u2019s Answer as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">\n<em>Claims 19-28 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112 on the grounds that same are not supported by the disclosure and are unduly broad.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\"><em>It is the Examiner\u2019s position that appellant has not disclosed a suitable number of mercuric compounds falling within the scope of the claims to justify the language in the claims. </em>Thus, the Examiner is at a loss to figure out what compounds appellant intends to include with the scope of the claims. In the specification, appellang discloses two compounds which are readable on the claims [i. e., on which the claims read]: phenyl mercury acetate and phenyl mercury hydroxide.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On page 5 of the specification, appellant discusses in broad terms the catalyst contemplated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Note that appellant states that the \u201cmono-organo\u201d portion of the catalyst may be \u201calkyl\u201d or \u201caryl.\u201d The only example of \u201caryl\u201d is phenyl. There are no examples of \u201calkyl.\u201d Note that no particular meaning for \u201caryl\u201d has been ascribed to in the specification. * * * In this regard, the instant case is similar to <em>In re Sus </em>* * * [49 CCPA 1301, 306 F.2d 494, 134 USPQ 301 (1962)]. The board\u2019s attention is directed to the discussion at 134 USPQ at 304, column 2 and 305, column 1. Note also that in <em>In re Sus </em>several, and not just one example of \u201caryl\u201d appeared in the specification. * * * The instant specification contains no examples of alkyl. * * * the mono-organo portion of the catalysts is not limited to \u201caryl\u201d and \u201calkyl.\u201d Thus an [sic, any?] organic radical is included within appellant\u2019s recitations. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-13\">The salt portion of the mono-organo mercuric salt has not been given any particular meaning in the specification. * * * Insofar as the recitation \u201csalt of a carboxylic acid\u201d in claim 21 is concerned, appellant has likewise failed to ascribe any particular meaning to the recitation. * * * In short, it is impossible to ascertain with any degree of reliability what compounds appellant intends to include within the meaning of the language presently appearing in the claims. <em>In re Surrey * * * </em>[54 CCPA 855, 370 F.2d 349, 151 USPQ 724 (1966).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAh\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-16\">* * * <em>In view of the fact that appellant has ascribed no particular meaning to the \u201cmono-organo\u201d and \u201csalt\u201d portions of his catalysts, it is submitted that the instant disclosure will not support the broad language of the claims. In re Sus, </em>supra. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-17\">The board affirmed the examiner, stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-18\">The term \u201cmono-organo\u201d is indefinite, since it obviously is intended to include the \u201cphenyl mercuric salt of a carboxylic acid\u201d (claim 21), which has two organic groups, phenyl and carboxyl.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-19\">Our review of the arguments presented leads us to agreement with the Examiner\u2019s conclusion that the claims fail to comply with 35 U.S.C. 112. The term \u201cmono-organo\u201d is indefinite for the reason we have given above. Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>thermore, we consider the term \u201c\u00f3rgano\u201d to be far broader than is warranted by the compounds disclosed, even including those rather generally given in the paragraph at the top of page 5 of the specification. The field of organic chemistry is too immense and catalytic action too unpredictable to extrapolate phenyl even to aryl, much less to alkyl and then \u201corgano.\u201d Precedent, in the form of such decisions particularly as <em>In re </em>Surrey [supra] * * * and <em>In re </em>Oppenauer, 31 CCPA 1248 * * * 143 F.2d 974, 62 USPQ 297 [(1944)], cited therein, are believed clear to this effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We find the examiner\u2019s Answer to be singularly unclear as to the particular requirement or requirements of \u00a7 112 which were thought not to have been met.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The first, second and last sentences we have quoted from the examiner\u2019s Answer (see our emphasis) suggest that the <em>specification </em>was thought to be deficient (\u00a7 112, first paragraph<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>) in some unstated respect. From the remainder of the examiner\u2019s remarks, however, it appears that he could not ascertain \u201cwhat compounds appellant intends to include within the scope of the claims,\u201d which amounts to a contention that the <em>claims </em>are indefinite (\u00a7 112, second paragraph<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>). The board contributes to our uncertainty by first \u201cagreeing\u201d with the examiner that \u201cthe <em>claims </em>fail to comply with 35 U.S.C. 112\u201d (second paragraph? \u2014 emphasis ours) and then purportedly supporting this conclusion with observations about the immensity of the field of organic chemistry and the unpredictability of catalytic action (\u00a7 112, first paragraph? \u2014 \u00a7 101?). From the board\u2019s second decision responding to a Request for Reconsideration, it is apparent that a \u00a7 101 rejection was not intended. There the board stated with respect to appellant\u2019s acknowledgment that \u201csome chemist might find an inoperable organo-substituent\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">Neither the Examiner\u2019s holding nor our decision was on this basis, but rather they were based on the <em>lack of reasonable support </em>for the immense breadth of the claim terminology. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">If the examiner and/or the board intended a rejection under the first paragraph of \u00a7 112, it must be reversed inasmuch as the specification contains a statement of appellant\u2019s invention which is as broad as appellant\u2019s broadest claims, and inasmuch as the sufficiency of the specification to satisfy the \u201cbest mode\u201d requirement of \u00a7 112 and to enable one skilled in the art to practice appellant\u2019s process . as broadly as it is claimed has not been questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">Both the examiner and the board seem to have taken the position that in order to \u201cjustify,\u201d as the examiner said, or to \u201csupport,\u201d as the board said, broad generic language in a claim, the specification must be equally broad in its naming, and use in examples, of representative compounds encompassed by the claim language. This position, however, misapprehends the proper function of such disclosure. Mention of representative compounds encompassed by generic claim language clearly is not required by \u00a7 112 or any other provision of the statute. But, where no explicit de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>scription of a generic invention is to be found in the specification (which is not the case here) mention of representative compounds may provide an implicit description upon which to base generic claim language. See <em>In re Sus, </em>supra, cited by the examiner and discussed below. Similarly, representative examples are not required by the statute and are not an end in themselves. Rather, they are a <em>means </em>by which certain requirements of the statute may be satisfied. Thus, inclusion of a number of representative examples in a specification is <em>one </em>way of demonstrating the operability of a broad chemical invention and hence, establishing that the utility requirement of \u00a7 101 has been met. It also is <em>one </em>way of teaching how to make and/or how to use the claimed invention, thus satisfying that aspect of \u00a7 112. However, there has here been no contention by the Patent Office that any of these requirements has not been met. We therefore fail to attach any significance to the absence of representative examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In fairness to the examiner and the board, it is not difficult to see how they might have been led by the <em>Sus, Surrey, </em>and <em>Oppenauer </em>cases, which they cited, to take the position which they appear to have taken. These cases, however, are readily distinguishable from the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In <em>Sus, </em>appellant used the terms \u201caryl and substituted aryl radicals\u201d or \u201csubstituted and unsubstituted aryl radicals\u201d in his claims. However, we found nothing in the way of express statements <em>or examples </em>in the specification that would teach one skilled in the art that \u201call \u2018aryl and substituted aryl radicals\u2019 were properly within the subject matter which appellants considered to be their invention.\u201d Accordingly we held that the claims were broader than the disclosure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (In this regard see note 4 of the opinion.) In the present case, there are express statements of appellant\u2019s invention which are as broad as his claims, and <em>Sus </em>therefore is not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">In <em>Surrey, </em>where the issues were (1) sufficiency of the disclosure to teach \u201chow to use\u201d the claimed compounds (\u00a7 112, first paragraph) and (2) sufficiency of the <em>proof </em>that the compounds were in fact useful (\u00a7 101), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEn\">[Ajppellant here has failed to provide those of ordinary skill in the art, the Patent Office and this court, reasonable assurance, <em>as </em>by <em>adequate representative examples, </em>that the compounds falling within the scope of the claim will possess the asserted usefulness. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">Since \u00a7 112 does not require that a specification <em>convince </em>persons skilled in the art that the assertions therein are correct and since the above statement says <em>\u201cas </em>by adequate representative examples\u201d (emphasis ours), it <em>cannot </em>be reasonably inferred from <em>Surrey, </em>that the mentioned assurance <em>must </em>be provided by examples in the specification as opposed, for example, to affidavits as provided for by Rule 132. Since neither of the issues in <em>Surrey </em>is raised here, this case also is not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">In <em>Oppenauer, </em>somewhat as in <em>Sus, </em>several materials were recited more broadly in the claims than they were disclosed in the specification. As in <em>Surrey, </em>the sufficiency of the \u201chow to use\u201d disclosure of the specification was questioned and the court held that the specification did not contain a teaching that all of the materials of one type recited in the claims as being indefinite (\u00a7 112, ing the desired result.\u201d We do not have a comparable situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\"> We turn now to the possibility that the examiner intended a rejection of the claims as being indefinite (\u00a7 112, second paragraph). The examiner points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>out that appellant does not ascribe any <em>special </em>meaning to terms such as \u201c\u00f3rgano\u201d and \u201csalt of carboxylic acid\u201d and to the \u201csalt\u201d portion of his catalyst. From this he concludes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">it is impossible to ascertain with any degree of reliability what compounds appellant intends to include within the meaning of the language presently appearing in the claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The examiner, however, was able to state, \u201cThus an [sic, any?] organic radical is included within appellant\u2019s recitations.\u201d He also cited four foreign patents<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to show various radicals which he apparently considered to be rather exotic and which the terms used in the claims would encompass in the absence of special meanings. This ability of the examiner to enumerate radicals encompassed by the claim language points up, we think, the weakness of the indefiniteness argument. Giving the language its broadest possible meaning, as we are bound to do in the absence of special definitions by appellant, the breadth of the claims insofar as the catalyst is concerned is indeed immense. However, \u201cBreadth is not indefiniteness.\u201d In re Gardner, 427 F.2d 786, 57 CCPA (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Apparently interpreting the \u201cmonoorgano\u201d as limiting the number of organic radicals possible in appellant\u2019s catalyst to one, the board held this expression to be indefinite because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">it obviously is intended to include the \u201cphenyl mercuric salt of a carboxylic acid\u201d (claim 21), which has two organic groups, phenyl and carboxyl.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Appellant\u2019s specification, however, makes it perfectly clear that it is the number of <em>carbon-to-mercury </em>bonds, rather than the number of <em>organo groups, </em>that is restricted to one by the \u201cmono\u201d in the expression \u201cmonoorgano mercuric compound.\u201d Thus the specification states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">Presently preferred divalent mercury containing compounds are the * * * ionizable monoorgano-mereuric compounds <em>(which contain only one carbon-to-mercury bond). </em>[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">The sense in which appellant uses the expression \u201cmonoorgano mercuric compound\u201d is also consistent with the following definition from Hackh\u2019s Chemical Dictionary (3rd ed.), cited by both appellant and the solicitor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\"><em>organometallic. Pertaining to the carbon-metal linkage, o. compounds. </em>A class of compounds of the type R-M, where R is an alkyl or aryl radical and M is a metal; e.g., PbEt4, tetraethyl lead; R-Mg-X, alkyl-magnesiumhalide. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">In its second opinion, the board noted that appellant\u2019s use of the phrase \u201chaving a single carbon to mercury valence bond\u201d in some of the claims to qualify the expression \u201cmonoorgano mercuric compound\u201d creates somewhat of a redundancy since in the specification the former expression is used to define the latter. We find, however, that rather than rendering the claims indefinite, this redundancy merely removes any question as to the meaning of the latter expression We therefore cannot agree with the board\u2019s reasons for holding appellant\u2019s claims indefinite.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">There remains for our considerations two prior art rejections.

Appellant also points out differences in the catalytic action of the three classes of compounds. Specifically he notes that JAPS shows lead octoate (which JAPS reports as being one of the most active catalysts tested) to be 40 times more active than diphenyl mercury as a catalyst for isocyanate-hydroxyl reactions, while appellant\u2019s specification establishes lead octoate to be about comparable to his monoorgano-mercuric compounds under anhydrous conditions but much worse in the presence of even 0.1% of moisture. Comparing his mono-organo mercuric compounds with the mercuric salts of carboxylic acids, such as the mercuric naphthenate disclosed in Kaestner, appellant urges that the former are \u201cmore potent catalysts\u201d and possess \u201cthe further unexpected advantage, in the casting of one-shot rubbers, of enabling the liquid and pourable mixture which cures to the rubber to stay liquid and pourable for a long period of time while still not increasing the total gelation time * * Although we do not find the latter advantage to be substantiated in the record, comparative examples in appellant\u2019s specification do support the conclusion that the monoorgano mercuric compounds are the more potent catalysts. Having considered all the arguments and evidence of record and the board\u2019s observation about the unpredictability of catalytic action, we conclude that the rejection based on Kaestner and JAPS must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">We affirm, however, the rejection of product-by-process claims 27 and 28 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 on Windemuth which discloses the production of polyurethanes using various tin compounds as catalysts. The examiner took the position that the claimed products and certain of the polyurethane products of Windemuth would not differ materially. Appellant submitted a Rule 132 affidavit containing comparisons of the physical properties of polyurethanes produced using stannic chloride, dibutyl tin chloride, and phenyl mercuric acetate, the first two being disclosed in Windemuth and the last being one of appellant\u2019s catalysts. The examiner criticized the affidavit because of appellant\u2019s choice of tin compounds disclosed in the reference. He felt that a tin compound containing both salt groups and carbon-metal groups, such as dibutyl tin dilaurate disclosed in Windemuth, would have been more similar in structure to appellant\u2019s catalysts and therefore should have been used in the comparison.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant attempts to defend his choice by pointing out that the reference discloses stannic chloride <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>as being a preferred catalyst. However, in considering this rejection, we are not concerned with superiority of the catalysts but rather with differences, if any, in the products produced. <em>We </em>agree with the examiner that to be persuasive the affidavit should have included in the comparison a product obtained using a catalyst more similar in structure to appellant\u2019s catalysts.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In summary, we reverse the rejections under \u00a7 112 and \u00a7 103 and affirm the rejection under \u00a7 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Accordingly, the decision of the board is reversed as to claims 19-26 and affirmed as to claims 27 and 28.</p>\n<p id=\"Att\">MODIFIED</p>\n<judges id=\"b525-7\">WORLEY, C.

As observed by the board, a third specific compound, phenyl mercury octoate, is also disclosed and encompassed by the claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\">. The discussion to which the examiner here refers reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">Among this group [ionizable, halogen-free monoorgano mercuric compounds] are organo-mercuric acetate, borate, benzoate, methacrylate, hydroxide, phthalate, gluconate, salicylate, octoate, stearate, etc.; the organo substituent may be an open or closed claim organic radical which is inert to isocyanateactive hydrogen reactions, as for example an aryl or alkyl group.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b519-21\">. This is unquestionably a criticism never raised by the examiner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b520-6\">. Our consideration of this appeal would have been immeasurably simplified had the examiner merely referred to specific language in \u00a7 112, or at least to the paragraph in which it is to be found. Perhaps more so with respect to \u00a7 112 than with any other section of the statute, it is essential for the orderly resolution of issues that the specific requirement on which the rejection is based be clearly identified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\">. Which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same * * *.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b520-14\">. Which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-15\">The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which applicant regards as his invention.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\">. In <em>Sus, </em>the rejection was based on the second paragraph of \u00a7 112. For the reasons given in In re Halleek, 422 F.2d 911, 57 CCPA (1970) ; In re Borkowski, 422 F.2d 904, 57 CCPA 946 (1970) ; and In re Wakefield, 422 F.2d 897, 57 CCPA 959 (1970), such rejections are more properly considered under the first paragraph of that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b522-20\">.

Appellant challenges the availability of Kaestner on the basis of a parent application filing date. The Patent Office denies his right to rely on the parent.
