Between the commission of the offense and conviction, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 902(e) was repealed by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(g) (Gun Control Act of 1968) (Public Law 90-618, 82 Stat. 1220), which became effective on December 16, 1968. The latter statute is essentially the same as the old section, except that the new section no longer includes the language \u201ccause to be shipped or transported\u201d in interstate or foreign commerce. The issue is whether a conviction based on the old statute can be validly rendered after repeal of that statute. We answer in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-20\">Appellant argues that the indictment was returned on December 30, 1968, fourteen days after repeal of the old statute on which the indictment was based,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that therefore the indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ment and subsequent conviction are invalid. The government argues that the December 30 indictment merely superseded two previous indictments, dated November 19, 1968, and September 24, 1968, and thus the effective date of the indictment was September 24, 1968, and within the effective period of 15 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 902(e). We find it unnecessary to decide the question of the effective date of the indictment, since the general savings clause found in 1 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 109, coupled with judicial construction of that section, disposes of the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The general savings clause provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">\u201cThe repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute, unless the repealing act shall so expressly provide, and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture, or liability. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Under this section, penalties accruing while a statute was in force may be prosecuted after its repeal, unless there is an express provision to the contrary in the repealing statute. In United States v. Reisinger, 128 U.S. 398, 9 S.Ct. 99, 32 L.Ed. 480 (1888), the Supreme Court held that the savings clause should be read in conjunction with the repealing statute. See Great Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, 208 U.S. 452, 28 S.Ct. 313, 52 L.Ed. 567 (1908). In Bowen v. United States, 171 F.2d 533, 534 (5 Cir., 1948), this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201c * * * We have considered and discussed the applicability of the general savings clause * * * in the case of United States v. Carter et al., 5 Cir., 171 F.2d 530, as same related to suits by the United States for injunction and restitution that had been terminated prior to the trial, and we see no occasion for a rediscussion of the views there set out. We are aware of no reason, rule, or decision that requires a different conclusion as to criminal prosecution under the authority of Sec. 109 for acts occurring prior to the repeal of the former statute where neither the former statute nor the repealing statute contain no express provision to the contrary. * * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">The repealing statute, Public Law 90-351, \u00a7 906, contains no such provision. The indictment alleged that appellant acted illegally between May 24 and July 7, 1968. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 902(e), the old statute, was not repealed until December 16, 1968. Therefore, the savings clause allows prosecution under the old statute, and the date on which the indictment was returned is not relevant to this inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-11\">. We dispose of this case on the briefs and record, without oral argument, as provided by our Local Rule 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-21\">.' The new statute was to take effect on December 16, 1968, 180 days after passage (June 19, 1968). See \u00a7 906 of the original Act, Public Law 90-351, 82 Stat. 234 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
