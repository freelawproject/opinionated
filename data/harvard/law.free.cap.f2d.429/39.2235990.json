We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">Court appointed counsel has diligently raised every possible contention of error in an effort to assist his clients. His industry, however, cannot cure a hopeless case. The trial record unmistakably establishes the guilt of the appellants, as charged, and the legal errors sought to be raised, although sincerely urged, do not justify discussion in a protracted opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
