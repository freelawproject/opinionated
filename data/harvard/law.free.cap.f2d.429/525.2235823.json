He filed a petition for money damages for alleged denial of proper medical treatment by the prison medical director and a medical assistant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-17\">The district court dismissed the complaint, holding that, \u201cIt is apparent from the petition that petitioner is not being denied medical treatment but merely that petitioner, from his layman\u2019s point of view, does not feel that the medical care is proper.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-18\">The petition shows that the appellant claims merely that he should have been admitted as an emergency patient on two occasions, but was required to return the following morning; and that he needs remedial surgery on his shoulder, which has been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-19\">Federal courts will not inquire into the adequacy or sufficiency of medical care of state prison inmates unless there appears to have been an abuse of the broad discretion which prison officials possess in this area. See Roy v. Wainwright, 5th Cir. 1969, 418 F.2d 231; Granville v. Hunt, 5th Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 9; Coppinger v. Townsend, 10th Cir. 1968, 398 F.2d 392; Stiltner v. Rhay, 9th Cir. 1967, 371 F.2d 420, cert. denied 387 U.S. 922, 87 S.Ct. 2038, 18 L.Ed.2d 977; United States ex rel. Lawrence v. Ragen, 7th Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-20\">We agree with the district court that the appellant failed to allege such abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>of discretion by prison officials as would be actionable. The dismissal of the complaint was correct and it is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-13\">. Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing. See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5th Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I; and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5th Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 526, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-14\">. The text of the district court\u2019s order, omitting caption and signature, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-15\">\u201cPetition alleging deprivation of civil rights (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983), accompanied by an affidavit of poverty, has been received from Ellis Marlow Haskew, an inmate at the Florida State Prison. Petitioner alleges that various medical problems are not being properly attended by the prison medical staff. It is apparent from the petition that petitioner is not being denied medical treatment but merely that petitioner, from his layman\u2019s point of view, does not feel that the medical care is proper. This case clearly does not contain the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d necessary to merit the interference of the federal courts in state prison administration. Granville v. Hunt, 411 F.2d 9 (5th Cir. 1969). Therefore, it is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-22\">\u201cORDERED:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-23\">\u201c1.
