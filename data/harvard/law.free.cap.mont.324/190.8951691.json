By order entered on October 14, 2004, we ordered the Respondent District Court and/or the Yellowstone County Attorney or Montana Attorney General on behalf of Respondent court, to prepare, file and serve a response to the application, which has now been filed. Further, we granted, at the request of D.M.B., a stay of the Youth Court proceedings herein until resolution of the issues raised in the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b62 The State filed a petition on June 22, 2004, alleging that D.M.B. was a delinquent youth under the Montana Youth Court Act. The petition alleged that D.M.B. had committed the misdemeanor offenses of assault, criminal mischief, and obstruction of a police officer. On August 11,2004, D.M.B. appeared in Youth Court and admitted to the three charged offenses. The Youth Court accepted the admissions and adjudicated D.M.B. to be a juvenile delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\u00b63 Prior to D.M.B.\u2019s dispositional hearing, Youth Court Services Officer Becky Wagner prepared a report regarding D.M.B. for the Youth Court. Wagner\u2019s report set forth D.M.B.\u2019s juvenile record, including a sex offense which had occurred eight years earlier. In light of this past offense, Wagner recommended that D.M.B. undergo a psychosexual evaluation with a qualified evaluator who would provide the Youth Court with an evaluation prior to the entry of a dispositional order by the Youth Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\u00b64 Wagner further noted the inability or unwillingness of D.M.B.\u2019s parents to contact her office or otherwise appear on D.M.B.\u2019s behalf or to be involved in his life and explained that without a parent or other responsible adult to take responsibility for D.M.B., the youth had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>nowhere to go. Wagner noted that over the past eight years, D.M.B. had resided in three different residential psychiatric facilities and three different group homes, had a significant history of alleged offenses, and committed the three charged offenses in this matter about one month after his release from his previous placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b65 However, D.M.B., through counsel, objected to the State\u2019s request for a psychosexual evaluation, asserting that there was no nexus to the underlying offenses. In response, the Youth Court ordered briefing on the issue, and following oral argument granted the State\u2019s request for the evaluation, reasoning that, although there was no nexus between the evaluation and the underlying offenses, the Montana Youth Court Act nevertheless granted broader discretion to fashion a rehabilitative disposition and, therefore, a predispositional psychosexual evaluation was appropriate. D.M.B. then sought supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b66  Supervisory control is an extraordinary remedy that is only appropriate when a district court is proceeding under a mistake of law which, if not corrected, would cause significant injustice and the remedy by appeal is inadequate. <em>Evans v. Montana Eleventh Judicial District Court, </em>2000 MT 38, \u00b6 15, 298 Mont. 279, \u00b6 15, 995 P.2d 455, \u00b6 15. Our determination of whether supervisory control is appropriate is a case-by-case decision, based on the presence of extraordinary circumstances and the need to prevent an injustice from occurring. <em>Park v. Sixth Judicial District Court, </em>1998 MT 164, \u00b6 13, 289 Mont. 367, \u00b6 13, 961 P.2d 1267, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b67 D.M.B. argues that the District Court is proceeding under a mistake of law in two respects. First, although acknowledging that \u00a7 41-5-1512(l)(g) and (i), MCA, provides statutory authority for the Youth Court to order that a youth submit to an evaluation as part of a final disposition, D.M.B. argues that \u00a7 41-5-1503, MCA, allows <em>predisposition </em>evaluations only when the youth has waived his or her constitutional rights. Because D.M.B. has refused to waive those rights, D.M.B. asserts that the Youth Court\u2019s order conflicts with this provision. Secondly, D.M.B., argues that the evaluation is not permitted under this Court\u2019s holding in <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, 293 Mont. 133, 974 P.2d 620, because no nexus exists between the underlying charges and the psychosexual evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">\u00b68 The State responds that the Youth Court was authorized to order the psychosexual evaluation under \u00a7 41-5-1511(2), MCA. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-11\"><em>Before conducting the dispositional hearing, </em>the court shall direct that a youth assessment or predisposition report be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>in writing by a probation officer or an assessment officer concerning the youth, the youth\u2019s family, the youth\u2019s environment, and other matters relevant to the need for care or rehabilitation or disposition of the case .... <em>The youth court may have the youth examined, and the results of the examination must be made available to the court as part of the youth assessment or predisposition report.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-3\">Section 41-5-1511(2), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b69  The State is correct in its assertion that the evaluation ordered in this matter by the Youth Court falls within the plain language of the above-cited provision. However, \u00a7 41-5-1503, MCA, contains more specific provisions in regard to predisposition \u201cmedical or psychological\u201d evaluations, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">(1) The youth court may order a youth to receive a medical or psychological evaluation at any time <em>prior to final disposition </em>if the youth waives the youth\u2019s constitutional rights in the manner prior for in 41-5-331 [setting forth advisory and parental notification requirements].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Given the provisions of \u00a7 41-5-1503, MCA, regarding predispositional medical and psychological evaluations, which is the kind of evaluation here ordered, it must control, as the more specific provision, over the more general authorization for youth assessments provided to the Youth Court under \u00a7 41-5-1511, MCA. As we recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">It is a well-settled rule of statutory construction that the specific prevails over the general. A particular statutory intent controls over a general one which is inconsistent with it. Section 1-2-102, MCA. Further, when two statutes deal with a subject, one in general and comprehensive terms, and the other in minute and more definite terms, the more definite statute will prevail to the extent of any opposition between them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\"><em>State v. Smith, </em>2004 MT 191, 322 Mont. 206, 95 P.3d 137. Thus, the more specific requirements of \u00a7 41-5-1503, MCA, including the requirement that the youth waive the youth\u2019s constitutional rights in order to conduct a predispositional medical or psychological evaluation, must be met. Therefore, the Youth Court erred in ordering a predispositional psychosexual evaluation over the youth\u2019s objection. \u00b610 However, the State argues that even if we would conclude that a predispositional psychosexual evaluation required the youth\u2019s waiver of constitutional rights, the Youth Court could nonetheless order the evaluation as part of its final dispositional order pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-1512(l)(g) and (i), MCA. That provision provides that the Youth Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>may, as part of its disposition, \u201crequire the medical and psychological evaluation of the youth\u201d and \u201corder further care, treatment, evaluation or relief that the court considers beneficial to the youth and the community.\u201d <em>See also </em>\u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(a), MCA. We agree. Although the State argues that the psychosexual evaluation would better serve the interests of D.M.B. if conducted prior to disposition, and we do not disagree that a predispositional evaluation may be more convenient, it is clear from the statutes that an evaluation without the youth\u2019s consent is authorized only as part of the court\u2019s disposition. D.M.B. does not contest this statutory interpretation, but argues that the psychosexual evaluation cannot be ordered in this case by reason of this Court\u2019s holding in <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b611 In <em>Ommundson, </em>a defendant of convicted of DUI challenged the District Court\u2019s imposition of sex offender treatment as a condition of sentence. We reversed the imposition of the condition, holding that a sentencing limitation or condition must have \u201csome correlation or connection to the underlying offense for which the defendant is being sentenced.\u201d <em>Omundson, </em>\u00b6 11. D.M.B. argues that none of the three offenses charged here are sex-related offenses, and therefore, a psychosexual evaluation cannot be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b612  However, <em>Ommundson </em>does not bar the Youth Court from ordering D.M.B. to undergo a psychosexual evaluation as part of D.M.B.\u2019s disposition. Unlike <em>Ommundson, </em>this matter is not a criminal matter, but is brought under the Youth Court Act. Section 41-5-102, MCA, requires that the Act be interpreted and construed to effectuate the \u201cexpress legislative purposes\u201d of providing for \u201cthe care, protection, and wholesome mental and physical development of a youth\u201d as well as \u201ca program of supervision, care, rehabilitation, detention, competency development, and community protection\u201d of a youth. The Youth Court Act\u2019s emphasis on the mental and physical care, development and rehabilitation of a youth are statutory directives which were not at issue in <em>Ommundson. </em>Further, at this point, the Youth Court has merely ordered a psychosexual evaluation for purposes of D.M.B.\u2019s proper placement and has not ordered sex offender treatment, as in <em>Ommundson. </em>The primary purpose of the evaluation, according to Wagner\u2019s report, is to assess D.M.B.\u2019s condition so that placement within the appropriate facility can be made. Her report indicated that without the evaluation \u201cno licensed home or facility will accept him in their program. This is especially true given his lengthy placement history and his history of sexual offending.\u201d Thus, the challenged evaluation is essential to D.M.B.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>appropriate placement, and, therefore, essential to fulfillment of the purposes of the Youth Court Act.</p>\n<p id=\"A7O\">\u00b613 D.M.B. makes additional arguments which we conclude are without merit, including a constitutional argument which we conclude is not sufficiently supported by authority. Therefore, we decline to address the additional issues raised in the petition. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b614 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of supervisory control is hereby granted. This matter is remanded to the Thirteenth Judicial District Youth Court, in and for Yellowstone County, for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b615 The Clerk is directed to mail copies hereof to all counsel of record and to the Honorable Gregory R. Todd, Youth Court Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">DATED this 24th day of November, 2004.</p>\n<judges id=\"b215-7\">JUSTICES RICE, LEAPHART, REGNIER, NELSON and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b215-8\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"A35\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\u00b616 I agree with the Court\u2019s order. However, it appears from the record that the information necessary to place the youth is available in records of examinations and treatment that have already been prepared. The County Attorney represented to the Court that he could not get copies of such records without the consent of the youth\u2019s mother, and she is not only unwilling to cooperate, she is hiding from the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">\u00b617 I fail to see why the District Court accepted without question the representation that the records could not be recovered. A court order to the custodian of the records could have avoided this whole problem. Also, since the mother does not seem to be in the picture, the appointment of a <em>guardian ad litem </em>may have served to avoid this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">\u00b618 It is not always necessary to do things the hard way.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
