We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-22\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b141-23\">\u00b63 Did the District Court lack jurisdiction to grant Forsythe\u2019s motion for a new trial outside of the 60-day deadline mandated by Rule 59(d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>M.R.Civ.P.?</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b64 Forsythe brought this action against Leydon for injuries arising out of a car accident. After a jury trial and special verdict allocating negligence 50/50, Forsythe moved for the District Court to grant her a new trial. Forsythe withdrew her initial motion, but then renewed it on December 19, 2003. A hearing was held on the issue on February 10,2004, and the District Court granted Forsythe a new trial on March 3, 2004. Leydon then brought her appeal to this Court, arguing that once the 60-day limit mandated by Rule 59(d), M.R.Civ.P., had expired, the District Court was without jurisdiction to grant a new trial. In response, Forsythe accepts that Rule 59(d) mandates a 60-day limit, and that the District Court\u2019s ruling exceeded that limit. However, she argues that the 60-day limit of Rule 59(d) is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u00b65 A district court\u2019s jurisdiction is a question of law that we review by asking whether the court had the authority to act. <em>Richards v. Richards, </em>2001 MT 183, \u00b6 5, 306 Mont. 212, \u00b6 5, 31 P.3d 1002, \u00b6 5. Constitutional issues of due process involve matters of law and our review is plenary. <em>In re Mental Health of K.G.F., </em>2001 MT 140, \u00b6 17, 306 Mont. 1, \u00b6 17, 29 P.3d 485, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court lack jurisdiction to grant Forsythe\u2019s motion for a new trial outside of the 60-day deadline mandated by Rule 59(d), M.R.Civ.P.?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">\u00b67 Rule 59(d), M.R.Civ.P., states, \u201cIf the court shall fail to rule on a motion for new trial within 60 days from the time the motion is filed, the motion shall, at the expiration of said period, be deemed denied.\u201d March 3, 2004, is unarguably more than 60 days after December 19, 2003. Therefore, as a matter of law and notwithstanding the District Court\u2019s March 3 order, Forsythe\u2019s motion for a new trial was deemed denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">\u00b68 We have upheld this requirement before and have repeatedly emphasized the need for strict adherence to the rule. In a previous appeal where a respondent argued that an exception be made to the 60-day limit of Rule 59, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">[T]ime and procedural limitations for motions subsequent to judgment set out in the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>mandatory and strictly enforced. And, we have repeatedly warned both judges and attorneys that they must keep careful watch of the requirements set forth in Rule 59 and \u201cfailure to comply results in a loss of jurisdiction and inability of the trial court and this Court to consider questions raised on the merits.\u201d ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\">While the requirements are by design arbitrary, they were implemented to avoid the vagaries and resulting pitfalls that existed because of all the exceptions overlaid on previous rules of post-trial procedure. In other words, we have been there and done that and conclude that in this context, at least, arbitrariness is preferable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><em>Richards, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11 (citations omitted). We have upheld the time limits of Rule 59 on several other occasions. See, <em>e.g., Associated Press v. Crofts, </em>2004 MT 120, \u00b6 37, 321 Mont. 193, \u00b6 37, 89 P.3d 971, \u00b6 37; <em>Johnson v. Eagles Lodge Aerie 3913 </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 474, 479, 945 P.2d 62, 64-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b69 Forsythe argues that the temporal limitations of Rule 59(d) are unconstitutional because they deprive her of procedural due process. She cites no instance of a court, state or federal, striking down a similar time limit on due process grounds. She asserts that the 60-day requirement is arbitrary, but, as we concluded in <em>Richards, </em>just because a rule is arbitrary does not mean it should not be favored. Insisting on a firm time-limit advances the cause of justice by bringing predictability to our process. As we said in <em>Kelly v. Sell &amp; Sell Paint Contractors </em>(1978), 175 Mont. 440, 443, 574 P.2d 1002, 1003, Rule 59(d) \u201cmay in some cases, work harsh results, but it is perhaps more important that the public have the expectation and right to finality of judgments. This can only be accomplished when there is a cut-off time for a District Court to rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b610  We conclude that the 60-day limit of Rule 59(d), M.R.Civ.P., is constitutional and that when that 60-day period expired, the District Court did not have jurisdiction to grant Forsythe\u2019s motion for a new trial. The judgment of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b143-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
