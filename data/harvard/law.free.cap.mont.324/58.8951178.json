G.C. is the father of A.C. and T.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\u00b64 On September 3, 2003, the Department of Public Health and Human Services (the Department) filed a Petition for Emergency Services, Adjudication as Youth in Need of Care and Temporary Legal Custody with regard to A.C., T.C., and C.W. after receiving a report that P.H. was using drugs in front of the children; that P.H. and her boyfriend were seen fighting in front of the children; and that the children had been eating only rice.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\u00b65 On September 11, 2003, the District Court held a show cause hearing. Thereafter, the District Court found that probable cause existed to support the Department\u2019s concerns that the children were abused and neglected or were in danger of abuse and neglect. The District Court determined that the Department had the authority to move the children to either a foster home or a kinship placement, once such placement was found. After initially being placed with their maternal grandmother, the children entered a receiving home in November 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\u00b66 On December 4, 2003, the District Court held an adjudicatory hearing, wherein the children were adjudicated as youths in need of care. Thereafter, a dispositional hearing was set and rescheduled several times until February 26,2004. At the dispositional hearing, the State of Montana (the State) asked that A.C. and T.C. be placed with G.C., since the Department had investigated the placement and had determined that the placement was in the best interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">\u00b67 The District Court ultimately ordered that A.C. and T.C. be placed with G.C. and that their case be dismissed, with the Department having no further obligation to provide services. Because G.C. is not C.W.\u2019s father, nor could C.W.\u2019s father be located, the District Court found that placement of C.W. with his maternal aunt was in C.W.\u2019s best interests. C.W.\u2019s case is ongoing pending P.H.\u2019s completion of her treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">\u00b68 P.H. now appeals the District Court\u2019s Order placing A.C. and T.C. with G.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re </em>2004 MT 202, \u00b6 13, 322 Mont. 286, \u00b6 13, 95 P.3d 699, \u00b6 13. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if the district court interpreted them correctly. <em>In re </em>J.B.K., \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err in awarding G.C. custody of A.C. and T.C.?</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\u00b611 P.H. argues that a due process violation occurred when the State asked the District Court to place A.C. and T.C. with G.C. in Maine, thereby dismissing the case pertaining to A.C. and T.C. under \u00a7 41-3-438(3)(b), MCA. P.H. argues that because she assumed that services would be provided to her and that reunification was the State\u2019s ultimate goal, the finality of the State\u2019s request \u201cvirtually preclude[d]\u201d this reunification possibility. As such, P.H. argues that due process requires that she be afforded notice of the State\u2019s intent to place A.C. and T.C. with G.C., \u201cin order to adequately address the request and present evidence as to the best interests of the children.\u201d In addition, P.H. argues that the treatment plan and P.H.\u2019s completion of that plan are \u201cproperty rights,\u201d that, under the due process clause, \u201ccannot be taken away arbitrarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">\u00b612 The State responds that because P.H. raises her due process argument here for the first time on appeal, this Court should not review it, given that it does not implicate constitutional magnitude. The State also argues that the District Court properly placed A.C. and T.C. with G.C., under \u00a7 41-3-438(3), MCA. P.H. had notice of the dispositional hearing and the options available to the District Court at that hearing. As such, the State maintains that \u201c[s]imply because the district court did not pursue the disposition the mother [P.H.] was expecting, does not mean that she lacked notice.\u201d In addition, the State argues that once A.C. and T.C. were adjudicated youths in need of care, the Department had custody of the children. Hence, once the Department ensured that G.C.\u2019s home was a safe placement for the children, the State contends that the Department did all that was necessary \u201cfor the district court to place the children under Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-3-438(3)(b).\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">\u00b613 Section 41-3-438(3)(b), MCA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">If a child is found to be a youth in need of care ... the court may enter its judgment, making any of the following dispositions to protect the welfare of the child:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>(b) order the placement of the child with the noncustodial parent, superseding any existing custodial order, and dismiss the proceeding with no further obligation on the part of the department to provide services to the parent with whom the child is placed or to work toward reunification of the child with the parent or guardian from whom the child was removed in the initial proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b614 A youth is a \u201cyouth in need of care,\u201d when that youth \u201chas been adjudicated or determined, after a hearing, to be or to have been abused, neglected, or abandoned.\u201d Section 41-3-102(29), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u00b615 In addition, under Article III of the Interstate Placement of Children Compact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">The child shall not be sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state shall notify the sending agency, in writing, to the effect that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\u00b616 We do not address P.H.\u2019s due process argument here, as she raises that issue for the first time on appeal. We have repeatedly held that we do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal, as \u201cit is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>In re D.H., </em>2001 MT 200, \u00b6 41, 306 Mont. 278, \u00b6 41, 33 P.3d 616, \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">\u00b617  P.H.\u2019s parental rights have not been terminated. Rather, under its statutory authority, the District Court ordered placement of A.C. and T.C. with their noncustodial parent, G.C., after the Department found that such placement would be in the children\u2019s best interests. The Department took the necessary steps to ensure safe placement for the children, as required under the Interstate Placement of Children Compact. In addition, the District Court followed statutory procedure in ordering placement of the children with G.C. and in relieving the Department from any further obligation, as the concern for them being youths in need of care was eliminated by such placement. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in awarding G.C. custody of A.C. and T.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b81-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
