Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in finding that the statute of limitations begem running on August 9, <em>1999?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b68 On September 14, 1994, while working at Waste Management, Preston went into the bathroom. As she closed the door, an eight foot, fifteen to twenty pound stretcher that was kept in the bathroom fell on her from behind. As a result of this accident, Preston injured her left arm, for which she received medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b69 Transportation accepted liability for Preston\u2019s industrial accident under Montana\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Subsequently, in the summer of 1995, Preston settled her claim with Transportation for $5,874.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b610 At the time of her settlement, both Preston and Transportation knew that Preston had been diagnosed with depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\u00b611 Preston continued working for Waste Management for the next four years; however, her mental condition deteriorated over time. Consequently, Preston was referred to a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">\u00b6 12 Preston saw a psychiatrist on February 12,1999. At that time, the psychiatrist diagnosed Preston with severe panic disorder with agoraphobia, severe major depressive disorder, post traumatic stress syndrome, and pathological gambling. The psychiatrist also, at that time, stated that it was her belief that one causal factor of Preston\u2019s mental condition was the industrial accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">\u00b613 Preston felt she could no longer continue working due to her mental conditions, so she tendered her letter of resignation to Waste Management on August 9,1999. Thereafter, Preston resigned from her position on August 25,1999, and has not since worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">\u00b614 On August 17,1999, Preston\u2019s then-attorney wrote a letter to the workers\u2019 compensation claims\u2019 adjuster in an attempt to reopen her formerly-settled claim. The claims\u2019 adjuster denied this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">\u00b615 Subsequently, after waiting more than one year after the denial of this request, Preston petitioned the Department of Labor to mediate her dispute with the claims\u2019 adjuster on November 29, 2000. The mediator issued her mediation report and recommendation on January 4, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">\u00b616 Preston then petitioned the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for a hearing on September 19, 2001, regarding the reopening of her formerly-settled claim. Preston submitted this petition sifter waiting more than nine months after the mediator issued her report.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">\u00b617 After a hearing, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>that there existed a mutual mistake of fact between Preston and Transportation regarding the severity of Preston\u2019s mental illness as a result of her industrial accident. However, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court determined that reopening Preston\u2019s formerly-settled claim based on this mutual mistake of fact was time-barred under the two-year statute of limitations delineated in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA. Hence, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denied Preston\u2019s petition to set aside the settlement she entered into with Transportation and dismissed her petition with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b618 Preston now appeals the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b619 We review a Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether those findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Hiett v. Missoula County Public Schools, </em>2003 MT 213, \u00b6 15, 317 Mont. 95, \u00b6 15, 75 P.3d 341, \u00b6 15. We review a Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>Hiett, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">\u00b620 1. Does filing a petition for mediation with the Department of Labor and Industry commence an \u201caction?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">\u00b621 Preston argues that by petitioning the Department of Labor for mediation, she commenced an action as that term is used in \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-101, 27-2-102, and 27-2-203, MCA. Specifically, Preston argues that a petition for mediation is an action, as that term is used in \u00a7 27-2-101, MCA, because the petition is a \u201cspecial proceeding of a civil nature.\u201d Hence, her petition, which was based on Preston and Transportation\u2019s mutual mistake regarding her mental illness, was timely because she petitioned the Department of Labor for mediation on November 29, 2000. Consequently, her petition was filed within two years from the discovery of the mutual mistake, which was August 9, 1999 (the day the statute of limitations began to ran).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">\u00b622 Transportation argues that a petition for workers\u2019 compensation mediation is not a \u201cspecial proceeding of civil nature,\u201d because special proceedings, as those terms are used in \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-101 and 27-2-102, MCA, mean court proceedings, not administrative proceedings. Hence, Preston\u2019s petition to reopen her formerly-settled claim on September 19, 2001, was untimely, as it was not filed within two years from the discovery of the mutual mistake on August 9, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>\u00b623  Under \u00a7 27-2-101, MCA, the term \u201caction\u201d is \u201cto be construed, whenever it is necessary to do so, as including a special proceeding of a civil nature.\u201d Some examples of special proceedings include writs of certiorari, writs of mandamus, and writs of prohibition. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 27-25-101 et seq., 27-26-101 et seq., and 27-27-101 et seq., MCA. We have held that petitions for these writs are \u201cspecial proceedings of a civil nature,\u201d in part because they are based upon a judgment from which an appeal lies. <em>See Application of Bertelson </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 524, 617 P.2d 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b624 In <em>Patterson v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>2002 MT 97,309 Mont. 381, 46 P.3d 642, we held that civil proceedings \u201cmust be conducted in accordance with the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>\u00b6 12. Under Montana\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, mediation is a nonbinding and informal meeting, wherein the claimant and the insurer attempt to settle their dispute with a neutral mediator\u2019s assistance. Specifically, \u00a7 39-71-2408(2), MCA, states the a resolution recommended by a mediator is \u201cwithout administrative or judicial authority,\u201d and, hence, is \u201cnot binding on the parties.\u201d Indeed, \u00a7 39-71-2411(4), MCA, states that during mediation, a party is not limited by the rules of evidence, nor is a verbatim record made of the mediation proceedings, \u00a7 39-71-2410(1)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b625 Here, Preston\u2019s petition for mediation is a petition for a nonbinding and informal meeting with Transportation, the mediator, and herself. This meeting, as the statute states, is \u201cwithout administrative or judicial authority.\u201d Hence, Preston\u2019s petition for mediation is unlike other special proceedings-i.e., writs of certiorari, writs of mandamus, and writs of prohibition, to name a few-wherein the petition inheres from an appealable judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b626  Therefore, we hold that a petition for mediation does not commence an action, as that term is used in \u00a7 27-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b627 2. Does the statute of limitations for filing an action to set aside a settlement of a workers\u2019 compensation claim toll during the pendency of a statutorily-mandated mediation?</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\u00b628 Preston argues that the statute of limitations tolled during the pendency of her mediation because the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not have jurisdiction over her petition to reopen her claim until the mediation was complete. Hence, because the mediation lasted 62 days, the applicable two-year statute of limitations for claims of mutual mistake was extended by 62 days. And, as such, Preston argues that because she filed her petition to reopen her claim on September 19, 2001, and because the two-year statute of limitations had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>extended by the 62 days, she was within the two-year time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"A7Z\">\u00b629 In the alternative, Preston argues that the statute of limitations was tolled under the doctrine of equitable tolling-as this Court articulated that doctrine in <em>Hash v. U.S. West Communications Services </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 326, 886 P.2d 442. Preston also argues that in the event that this Court holds that by petitioning the Department of Labor for mediation Preston did not commence an action, the statute of limitations was equitably tolled. She maintains that under the doctrine, her time within which to file a petition to reopen her workers\u2019 compensation claim was equitably tolled during the pendency of the mediation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b630 Transportation first argues that administrative hearings do not toll a statute of limitations unless a statute expressly so provides. Because the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not contain any statute stating that a mediation tolls any statute of limitations, Transportation argues that Preston\u2019s mediation did not toll the statute of limitations to mutual mistake of fact. Second, Transportation argues that Preston abandoned her argument regarding the tolling of the statute of limitations under \u00a7 27-2-102(l)(a), MCA, as she cited no authority to or explanation of her argument in her appellate brief. In addition, Transportation argues that Preston\u2019s argument concerning \u00a7 27-2-102, MCA, leads to an \u201cabsurd result,\u201d which both conflicts with settled case law and has \u201cnothing to do with when statutes of limitations are tolled,\u201d as the language of \u00a7 27-2-102, MCA, is clear. Finally, Transportation argues that this Court should not consider Preston\u2019s \u201cequitable tolling\u201d argument, as Preston raises that argument for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b631 As to Preston\u2019s equitable tolling argument, we decline to rule on the merits of that argument. Preston did not present her equitable tolling argument to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, and, accordingly, this theory was not properly preserved for appellate review. We have repeatedly held that we will not consider issues raised for the time on appeal because a district court-here the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court-cannot be faulted for not ruling on a theory which was never presented to it. <em>In re Marriage of Gerhart, </em>2003 MT 292, \u00b6 31, 318 Mont. 94, \u00b6 31, 78 P.3d 1219, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b632 However, we still must determine whether the statute of limitations for Preston\u2019s mutual mistake of fact claim tolled during the pendency of her statutorily-mandated mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b633 Section 39-71-2408(1), MCA, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">[I]n a dispute arising under [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act]... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the insurer and claimant shall mediate any issue concerning benefits and the mediator shall issue a report following the mediation process recommending a solution to the dispute <em>before either party may file a petition in the workers\u2019 compensation court. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\u00b634 In addition, \u00a7 39-71-2905(1), MCA, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">A claimant or an insurer who has a dispute concerning any benefits under [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] ... may petition the workers\u2019 compensation judge for a determination of the dispute <em>after satisfying dispute resolution requirements otherwise provided in ... [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act].... </em>After parties have satisfied dispute resolution requirements provided elsewhere in ... [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act]... the workers\u2019 compensation judge has exclusive jurisdiction to make determinations concerning disputes under ... [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act].... Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b635 Here, Preston petitioned for mediation on November 29,2000. The mediator submittedher report on January 4,2001, and from that date, Preston had 25 days within which to accept the mediator\u2019s recommendations or to petition the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for resolution, \u00a7 39-71-2411(6), MCA. Taken together, the statutorily-mandated mediation process that Preston initiated took from November 29, 2000, to January 29, 2001-a total of 62 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b636 As \u00a7 39-71-2408(1), MCA, states, mediation is mandatory under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act before a party can even petition the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for relief. In addition, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court does not have jurisdiction during the pendency of a statutorily-mandated mediation, given that a claimant may only petition the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court \u201cafter satisfying dispute resolution requirements otherwise provided\u201d in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act-such as mandatory mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\u00b637  Given these clear statutory constructs, we hold that the statute of limitations tolled during the pendency of Preston\u2019s mediation. Hence, Preston had 62 additional days within which to file her petition to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court regarding the reopening of her previously-settled claim. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in concluding that Preston\u2019s claim was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">\u00b638 3. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in finding that the statute of limitations began running on August 9, 1999?</p>\n<p id=\"APm\">\u00b639 Because we hold that Preston had 62 additional days within which to file her petition to reopen her formally-settled claim with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, the date the statute of limitations began to run becomes important.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b640 Transportation argues that the statute of limitations began to run on February 12,1999. On this date, Transportation contends that \u201c[i]f the parties to the settlement were operating under a mistake, it concerned the severity of Preston\u2019s mental condition.\u201d In addition, Transportation argues that although Preston felt that she could no longer work due to her mental condition, that fact was \u201cmerely a consequence\u201d to the fact that her mental condition was \u201cmore severe than what was thought at the time of the settlement of her workers\u2019 compensation claim.\u201d Hence, the fact that Preston felt that she could no longer work due to her mental condition was \u201cnot a separate mistake that started the running of the two-year statute of limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b641 Preston argues that because the settlement that she entered into in 1995 pertained only to her wage benefits, and not to her medical benefits, the fact that she realized in February 1999 that she needed medical treatment \u201cdoes not amount to a mistake of fact.\u201d Rather, Preston argues, the realization that she could no longer continue working due to her mental condition of which she began treatment in February 1999 constituted the mistake of fact. Because this did not occur until August 9, 1999, or August 17, 1999, Preston argues, the statute of limitations did not begin to run until either of those dates.</p>\n<p id=\"A0X\">\u00b642 Under \u00a7 28-2-409, MCA, a mistake of fact</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">is a mistake not caused by the neglect of a legal duty on the part of the person making the mistake and consisting in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">(1) an unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact, past or present, material to the contract; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">(2) belief in the present existence of a thing material to the contract which does not exist or in the past existence of such a thing which has not existed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">\u00b643 Section 27-2-203, MCA, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">The period prescribed for the commencement of an action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake is within 2 years, the cause of action in such case not to be deemed to have accrued until the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting fraud or mistake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">\u00b644 We review a workers\u2019 compensation court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Hiett, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">\u00b645 Here, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>I find that on August 9, 1999, the day claimant [Preston] penned her resignation, she was aware that she could no longer continue working on account other mental condition and believed that her condition was related to her 1994 industrial accident. Thus, as of that date she was aware of the alleged mutual mistake of fact upon which she premises her present petition. At the latest, she was aware of the mistake and its connection to her industrial accident on August 17,1999, when Mr. Randall O. Skorheim, the attorney representing her at that time, wrote a letter to Sandy Mayernik requesting the insurer to reopen the claimant\u2019s claim on account of her mental condition and disability....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b646  Upon review of the record, we note that substantial evidence existed on which the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court based the above-quoted finding. Therefore, we hold that Preston was not aware of the mistake of fact regarding her mental condition until August 9, 1999. And, it is on that date that the statute of limitations began to run. Consequently, because the statute of limitations tolled during Preston\u2019s statutorily-mandated mediation, Preston had until October 10, 2001-taking into account the 62 additional days Preston\u2019s claim was in mediation-to file her petition with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Preston filed her petition with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court on September 19,2001. Hence, her petition was timely, and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in concluding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"A8r\">\u00b647 The dissent takes issue with the fact that tolling is not expressly provided under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. However, the Workers\u2019 Compensation statutes themselves give the authority, namely \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-2408(1) and 39-71-2905(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b648  Again, as we stated, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not have jurisdiction during Preston\u2019s mediation, given that: (1) the mediation she entered into was mandatory under \u00a7 39-71-2408(1), MCA; and (2) under \u00a7 39-71-2905(1), MCA, she had to wait to petition the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court until after satisfying the \u201cdispute resolution requirements\u201d otherwise provided in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act-namely, the mandatory mediation of \u00a7 39-71-2408(1), MCA. On that basis, the statute of limitations tolled, thereby giving Preston an additional 62 days within which to file her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\u00b649 In conclusion, we affirm the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Preston was not aware of the mistake of fact on which her claim is based until August 9, 1999. We also hold that a petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>mediation does not commence an action. However, we reverse the Workers\u2019 Compensation\u2019s Court\u2019s conclusion that Preston\u2019s claim was time-barred, as the statutorily-mandated mediation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act tolled the statute of limitations applicable to Preston\u2019s mutual mistake of fact claim. We remand this case to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b650 Affirmed in part; Reversed in part; and Remanded for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-5\">JUSTICES REGNIER, COTTER, LEAPHART, RICE and DISTRICT JUDGE CYBULSKI, sitting for former JUSTICE TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b254-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AH-\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\u00b651 I agree with the Court that filing a petition for mediation with the Department of Labor does not commence an \u201caction\u201d and, consequently, that the 2-year statute of limitations does not begin to run from the date Preston filed her petition for mediation. I also agree with the Court that the WCC\u2019s finding that the statute of limitations began to run on August 9, 1999, is not clearly erroneous. Finally, I agree with the Court that Preston\u2019s equitable tolling argument cannot be addressed because it is raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">\u00b652 I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the 2-year statute of limitations tolled in this case. I would affirm the WCC\u2019s conclusion that Preston\u2019s petition was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\u00b653 Both \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, the statute of limitations for actions grounded on fraud or mistake, and the entirety of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes, are creations of the Legislature, which acted well within its constitutional prerogative under Article V, Section 1 of the Montana Constitution in enacting them. As such, it is this Court\u2019s job to ascertain the legislative intent, wherever possible, from the plain language of the statute; it is not our job to insert into those statutes what the Legislature has chosen to omit. <em>See Dunnington v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 349, \u00b6 13, 303 Mont. 252, \u00b6 13, 15 P.3d 475, \u00b6 13; \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">\u00b654 Section 27-2-203, MCA, is perfectly clear in providing that an action for relief based on mistake must be commenced within 2 years. Section 27-2-203, MCA, also is perfectly clear that the Legislature chose to provide that the cause of action for fraud or mistake does not accrue \u201cuntil the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.\u201d Here, the WCC found-and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Court and I agree-that the 2-year statute of limitations began to run on August 9,1999. Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, the statute of limitations ran before Preston filed her petition with the WCC to reopen the workers\u2019 compensation settlement agreement based on mutual mistake of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b655 The only \u201ctolling\u201d period provided by the Legislature in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, is the \u201caccrual\u201d timing. No other provision in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, or the workers\u2019 compensation statutes provides additional means or methods for tolling the 2-year statute of limitations. The WCC declined, and so should this Court, to insert language into the statute which the Legislature omitted therefrom. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b656 Moreover, it cannot seriously be disputed that the Legislature is well aware of how to include in its statutes of limitations either specific tolling periods or some other mechanism for extending a statute of limitations in particular cases. For example, \u00a7 27-2-204, MCA, is the 3-year general statute of limitations for a tort cause of action. The Legislature expressly \u201cexcepted\u201d from the 2-year general tort statute of limitations two specific tort actions, by providing that \u201c[e]xcept as provided in 27-2-216 [tort action for childhood sexual abuse] and 27-2-217 [tort action for ritual abuse of a minor]\u201d the 2-year limitation period applies. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-2-204(1), MCA. It would have been easy for the Legislature to make a similar \u201cexception\u201d for cases such as the present case, by including an \u201cexcept\u201d provision and inserting a tolling provision into \u00a7 39-71-2408(1), MCA, and/or \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, the statutes relating to the mandatory mediation process in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. It did not choose to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u00b657 Indeed, in this last regard, the Legislature is keenly aware of the means by which it can-when it chooses to do so-toll a statute of limitations for the period required for an administrative proceeding. It has done so, for example, in the Montana Medical Legal Panel Act. There, in \u00a7 27-6-702, MCA, the Legislature has expressly provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIZ\">[t]he running of the applicable limitation period related to a malpractice claim is tolled upon receipt by the director of the application for review as to all health care providers named in the application .... The running of the applicable limitation period does not begin again until 30 days after [various expressly stated circumstances].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In the present case, the Legislature has chosen not to toll the statute of limitations for an action based on fraud or mistake during the period required for the mandatory mediation prior to filing a petition in the WCC. In holding otherwise, the Court intrudes into the Legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>constitutional arena. I will not join it in doing so, especially when the Court advances no authority for its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b658 Moreover, the Court\u2019s response to the lack of authority for its action here-namely, that \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-2408(1) and 39-71-2905(1), MCA, themselves provide the authority-is, at best, facile. The Court simply ignores the fact that those statutes bear no resemblance at all to other tolling provisions the Legislature has enacted when it intended to do so. The required mediation is a relatively short process readily capable of being completed soon after the carrier denies a demand to re-open and long before the running of the 2-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b659 Finally, \u201cplain meaning\u201d and separation of powers concerns aside, I fear rocky times ahead with the Court\u2019s decision here. In the present case, the Court holds that the statute of limitations was tolled for 62 days-the period from Preston\u2019s petition for mediation through the \u201c25 days within which to accept the mediator\u2019s recommendations or petition the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.\u201d In other words, the Court apparently reads \u00a7 39-71-2411(6), MCA, as requiring a petition to the WCC \u201cwithin the 25 days after the filing of the mediator\u2019s report.\u201d The statute does not so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b660 Section 39-71-2411(6), MCA, states that a party must notify the mediator within 25 days of the mailing of the report whether it accepts the recommendation; if either party does not accept the recommendation, the party may petition the court for resolution of the dispute. No time frame for petitioning the court is provided, further buttressing the absence of legislative intent to toll the statute for the mediation process. The Court again inserts what has been omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"ABP\">\u00b661 The fact is that nothing in the statute states that the petition to the court must be filed within the 25 days. While not at issue here, a number of scenarios beg to be addressed. For example, what if a party notifies the mediator on the 25th day after the mailing of the report that she or he does not accept the recommendation? Must that party actually petition the WCC on the same day? If not, will the Court hold firm to its holding here? Or, when the next case comes and the petitioner files with the WCC three days after the 25th day, arguing for a \u201creasonable\u201d period after the 25th day, will the Court determine that it did not really mean within the 25 days, but within a \u201creasonable\u201d period thereafter? If the party notifies the mediator that the recommendations are not accepted on the second day after the mediator mails the report, is the statute of limitations still tolled for the 25-day period? Can a party wait until the last day of the 2-year statute of limitations to petition for mediation-for no reason at all-and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>thereby toll the statute of limitations at that time?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b662 It is true that these scenarios may be cases for another day. In an ordinary case, I would agree that our opinions-by their very nature-often spawn new issues which result in future litigation. But when we create more work for the WCC and this Court by intruding into the Legislature\u2019s proper sphere of action, we are rightly accused of \u201cbringing it on ourselves\u201d when we express concerns about our ability to timely handle our workload.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b663 I dissent from the Court\u2019s unsupported decision that the 2-year statute of limitations is tolled by the mandatory mediation process. I would affirm the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
