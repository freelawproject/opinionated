We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the WCC erred in determining that Shawn was not within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the fall which resulted in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">\u00b63 At the time of his death, Shawn was employed as a deputy for the Phillips County Sheriff\u2019s Department (PCSD). He fell from a hotel balcony while in Great Falls, Montana, for a Montana Narcotics Officers Association (MNOA) conference, sustaining injuries from which he eventually died. Van Vleet is Shawn\u2019s widow and the mother of their child, Vanesa. Van Vleet timely filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with the PCSD\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, the Montana Association of Counties Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust (the Trust), requesting benefits as a result of Shawn\u2019s death. The Trust denied Van Vleet\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">\u00b64 Van Vleet then petitioned the WCC for the death benefits and a determination that the Trust had unreasonably denied benefits for Shawn\u2019s death. She also requested an award of costs, attorney\u2019s fees and a penalty against the Trust for its unreasonable actions. The WCC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>held a hearing on Van Vleet\u2019s petition. Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the WCC subsequently entered findings of fact which set forth the following circumstances surrounding Shawn\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\u00b65 Shawn was employed as a deputy sheriff for the PCSD and assigned to work with the Tri-Agency Drug Task Force (Task Force). Shawn\u2019s direct supervisor in the Task Force was Mark Stolen (Stolen). On January 30, 2001, Shawn and Stolen traveled together to the Holiday Inn hotel in Great Falls, Montana, to attend a conference sponsored by the MNOA. Participants in the conference included law enforcement agents from around Montana, prosecutors and law enforcement equipment vendors. The conference afforded the participants an opportunity to attend courses relating to drug law enforcement and view products offered by the vendors. Shawn and Stolen arrived at the hotel and registered for the conference at approximately 5:00 p.m. on January 30, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u00b66 After registering, Shawn and Stolen went to a hospitality room sponsored by the MNOA where the conference participants could network with each other and meet vendors of equipment they might purchase. Because the Task Force was contemplating the purchase of new equipment, Shawn\u2019s presence in the hospitality room to network and meet vendors was of benefit to the Task Force. Food and alcoholic beverages were available free of charge in the room. Stolen knew alcohol was available in the hospitality room and did not disapprove of Shawn and other agents drinking there, but did instruct them not to drink and drive. Sheriff Tom Miller, Shawn\u2019s supervisor at the PCSD, also was aware that conferences of this type often provided alcohol in hospitality rooms, but he did not prohibit drinking at the conferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u00b67 The hospitality room closed sometime after midnight. At approximately 1:30 a.m., Shawn met up with four other individuals from the conference and they obtained a key to the hospitality room. They went back into the room, where they consumed more alcohol and played \u201cdrinking games.\u201d The group left the hospitality room at approximately 2:00 a.m. Three of the individuals proceeded to a room on the fifth floor. Shawn and the fifth member of the group followed the first three to the room but were not allowed inside. Shawn\u2019s companion then entered his own room on the fifth floor, leaving Shawn alone in the hallway. One wall of the hallway was open, forming a balcony which overlooked an indoor courtyard. Shortly after Shawn was left alone in the hallway, he fell over a balcony railing on either the fourth or fifth floor to the main floor of the hotel, sustaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>injuries from which he eventually died. Shawn had a blood alcohol level of .203 at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u00b68 Based on the above findings of fact, the WCC concluded that Shawn\u2019s intoxication did not bar Van Vleet\u2019s claim, but Shawn was acting outside the course and scope of his employment at the time of his accident and, as a result, Van Vleet and her daughter were not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation death benefits. Consequently, the WCC dismissed Van Vleet\u2019s petition. Van Vleet appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u00b69 Our review of a WCC decision is twofold. We review the court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence and its conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Hiett v. Missoula County Public Schools, </em>2003 MT 213, \u00b6 15, 317 Mont. 95, \u00b6 15, 75 P.3d 341, \u00b6 15. Here, Van Vleet does not dispute any of the WCC\u2019s findings of fact. Consequently, we review only whether the court\u2019s interpretation of, and application of the facts to, the law is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\u00b610 Whether the WCC erred in determining that Shawn was not within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the fall which resulted in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">\u00b611 At the outset, we note the WCC correctly concluded that under \u00a7 39-71-407(4), MCA (1999), Shawn\u2019s intoxication at the time of his fall did not bar Van Vleet\u2019s claim. Although this conclusion is not challenged in this appeal, we will first analyze the issue of Shawn\u2019s intoxication during his conference participation as it is relevant to the argument later. Section 39-71-407, MCA, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">(1) Each insurer is liable for the payment of compensation, in the manner and to the extent provided in this section, to an employee of an employer that it insures who receives an injury arising out of and in the course of employment or, in the case of death from the injury, to the employee\u2019s beneficiaries, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">(4) An employee is not eligible for benefits otherwise payable under this chapter if the employee\u2019s use of alcohol or drugs is not prescribed by a physician is the major contributing cause of the accident. <em>However, if the employer had knowledge of and failed to attempt to stop the employee\u2019s use of alcohol or drugs, this subsection does not apply. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">\u00b612 Here, Shawn\u2019s employers knew he was going to socialize and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>drink alcohol in the MNOA sponsored hospitality room and did not prohibit him from doing so. Shawn\u2019s presence and socializing activities in the hospitality room was to network and meet vendors, which was of benefit to PCSD. The only limitation his supervisor or employer placed on Shawn was not to drink and drive. Shawn did not leave the conference site, but drank alcohol in the hospitality room for approximately six hours with colleagues before it initially closed, then continued drinking with colleagues in the same MNOA sponsored hospitality room between 1:30 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. Thus, the WCC correctly concluded that pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-407(4), MCA, Shawn\u2019s intoxication while at the conference cannot serve as a defense to exclude coverage for Van Vleet. In fact, the WCC held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">The evidence of deputy Van Vleet\u2019s direct supervisor shows his awareness of the claimant\u2019s drinking at the conference. Indeed, drinking was condoned and widespread among conference attendees. The situation in this case is no different than in <em>Thoreson v. Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund, </em>2000 MTWCC 40, wherein I held that the employer\u2019s knowledge of the claimant\u2019s marijuana use immediately preceding his injury precluded the drug and alcohol defense otherwise available under section 39-71-407(4), MCA. I therefore conclude that the claim in this case is not barred under section 39-71-407(4), MCA, (1999).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b613 We also note the WCC correctly concluded Shawn\u2019s attendance at the conference and his participation in the hospitality room was plainly within the course and scope of his employment pursuant to the four-factor test set forth in <em>Courser v. Darby School Dist. No. 1 </em>(1984), 214 Mont. 13, 16, 692 P.2d 417, 419. This conclusion is also not challenged on appeal and should be the point where this matter ended. However, despite the legal and factual background which led the WCC to conclude Shawn was \u201cattending to employment-related matters\u201d for the first six hours of attendance in the hospitality room, the WCC then engaged in an unnecessary deviation analysis to seemingly create a defense where none existed. This analysis resulted in the conclusion that Shawn\u2019s \u201cdrinking and late night activities took him outside the course and scope of his convention attendance\u201d and at the time of his fall, Shawn had substantially deviated from his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u00b614 Despite its conclusion that Shawn\u2019s attendance, drinking and intoxication while at the conference sponsored hospitality room did not bar Van Vleet\u2019s claim, the WCC, analyzing under <em>Dale v. Trade Street, Inc. </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 349, 854 P.2d 828, concluded that death benefits were precluded pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-407(1), MCA (1999). In <em>Dale, </em>we held an employee\u2019s injuries are compensable when the employee is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\u201cattending to employment-related matters\u201d when injured. <em>Dale, </em>258 Mont. at 355, 854 P.2d at 832. We also commented \u201c[i]t is well established in Montana that traveling employees are not covered 24 hours a day, without limitation, regardless of the conduct or activity in which they are involved.... The employee must remain in the course and scope of employment while traveling for the injury to be compensable.\u201d <em>Dale, </em>258 Mont. at 352-53, 854 P.2d at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">\u00b615 Here, the WCC first noted that <em>Dale </em>reaffirmed this Court\u2019s refusal to overrule precedents holding an employee under the influence of alcohol who is nonetheless in the course and scope of his employment is entitled to compensation and that the ultimate test is not whether the claimant is under the influence of alcohol, but whether he was \u201cattending to employment related matters.\u201d <em>Dale, </em>258 Mont, at 355, 854 P.2d at 831. Then, conflicting with its earlier conclusion that Shawn\u2019s hospitality room activities were within the course and scope of his employment, and while there he was attending to employment related matters, the WCC drew a distinction between the earlier six hours of socializing and drinking and the later half-hour of drinking. The WCC noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">[Shawn] was not in the course and scope of his employment when he fell to his death, therefore his widow and other potential beneficiaries are not entitled to death benefits. After the initial closure of the hospitality room, [Shawn] was no longer \u2018attending to employment related matters.\u2019 At that point, it was clearly bedtime for all but [Shawn] and four others who chose to continue drinking. They reopened the hospitality room not for business related to their employment but to drink some more and play drinking games. The tragedy followed on the heels of more drinking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The WCC\u2019s magic termination point of \u201cemployment related matters\u201d was the initial closing of the hospitality room doors. We cannot draw such a distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\u00b616 On appeal, the Trust mirrors the WCC\u2019s conclusion and maintains Shawn substantially deviated from the course and scope of his employment when he reentered the hospitality room and continued to drink alcoholic beverages, and at that point, Shawn abandoned any business purpose as the after hours drinking provided no benefit to the employer. The Trust asserts \u201c[i]t is not reasonable to find compensability based upon the assumption an employer might directly or indirectly approve of excessive drinking and subsequent drinking games (at a closed hospitality room) which resulted in a blood alcohol level of .203.\u201d Van Vleet challenges this conclusion, arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>because Shawn was at the conference for the benefit of his employer, his attendance at the conference and the hospitality room were within the course and scope of his employment and he remained within the course and scope of his employment through the time he fell. We agree with Van Vleet.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">\u00b617 At this point, it is important to note what is not in dispute in this case, both factually and legally. There is no dispute that Shawn\u2019s attendance at the MNOA conference was work related and within the course and scope of his employment. There is further no dispute that Shawn\u2019s attendance in the hospitality room and his consumption of alcohol up until the time it initially closed was approved by his employer and within the course and scope of employment related matters. During this period of work related activity, Shawn consumed alcoholic beverages over a period of approximately six hours. Not surprisingly, evidence disclosed Shawn had a blood alcohol level of .203 at the time of his death. The first six hours of drinking surely contributed to his extreme intoxication. Obviously, the WCC was influenced by the fact that additional drinking took place after the hospitality room closed. Implicit in the WCC\u2019s finding is a determination that somehow the additional half-hour of drinking was the real cause of Shawn\u2019s death. There is absolutely no evidence to support a conclusion that Shawn was not legally intoxicated when he initially left the hospitality room; nor is there any evidence in the record that Shawn was initially sober when he initially left the hospitality room and the additional half-hour of drinking was the cause of the intoxication. To the contrary, the evidence is compelling that Shawn was already intoxicated when the hospitality room initially closed its doors. Had Shawn fallen off the balcony at that point, under the WCC\u2019s analysis, Van Vleet would be compensated.</p>\n<p id=\"AaR\">\u00b618 It must be remembered that the issue is not Shawn\u2019s drinking and intoxication. The WCC concluded, and the parties agree, Shawn\u2019s intoxication during the conference did not bar Van Vleet\u2019s claim. The pivotal question under these facts, according to the WCC, is whether Shawn\u2019s later half-hour of drinking, up until the time of his fall, constituted a substantial deviation from his earlier six hours of drinking, which was established as \u201cemployment related matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Auik\">\u00b619 <em>Gordon v. H.C. Smith Construction </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 166, 612 P.2d 668, is a similar case where a Butte electrician, while on a job site in Denton, met up with some fellow electricians at the local bar where they drank alcohol and played pool for approximately four hours. Gordon was killed when he and his colleagues left the bar and his colleague, who was driving, went off the road. This Court commented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>that \u201cit cannot come as a great shock to the employer or be unforeseeable by the insurer that working men away from their homes and families may visit a saloon for a beer after work.\u201d <em>Gordon, </em>188 Mont. at 174, 612 P.2d at 672. Similarly, here, it is not shocking, nor is it unforeseeable that Shawn and his colleagues, while away from their homes and families, would attend and participate in a conference sponsored hospitality room where alcohol was provided in order to socialize and network.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\u00b620 The insurer in <em>Gordon </em>argued that Gordon had deviated from his employment when stopping at the Denton bar. This Court noted that \u201cWorkers\u2019 compensation legislation is the original no fault insurance. If an employee performs his job negligently and is killed as a result, his death is compensable.\u201d <em>Gordon, </em>188 Mont. at 174, 612 P.2d at 672. The insurer, by arguing Gordon had deviated from his employment, attempted to interject fault into a no fault system. <em>Gordon, </em>188 Mont. at 174, 612 P.2d at 672. Additionally, this Court held Gordon\u2019s death occurred during the course of his employment as our case law demonstrates that a claimant\u2019s intoxication, does not by itself, establish a deviation from the course of employment. <em>Gordon, </em>188 Mont. at 174, 612 P.2d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u00b621 Here, the WCC, through its deviation analysis, has interjected fault into a no fault system. This was not a situation where Shawn left the premises or participated in some peculiar after hours activity at the Holiday Inn not anticipated by his employer. Additionally, Shawn\u2019s employer was well aware that drinking alcohol would be a part of the conference and conceded that Shawn\u2019s presence at the hospitality room and his attendance at the conference was of benefit to the PCSD. Shawn\u2019s intoxication, does not by itself, establish a deviation from the course of employment. Under the WCC\u2019s analysis, after the hospitality room closed, the only choice for attendees of the conference was to go to bed because any compensable claims ended when the doors closed.</p>\n<p id=\"AOm\">\u00b622  The burden of proving an employee deviated from the course and scope of his employment is on the employer or workers\u2019 compensation insurer. <em>See Gordon, </em>188 Mont. at 173, 612 P.2d at 672 (citations omitted). There is no evidence in the record that supports a legal holding that it was bed time for attendees or that drinking alcohol after a set time was prohibited. Thus, under these facts, any drinking that occurred in the hospitality room with colleagues that night is not a deviation from the course and scope of Shawn\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">\u00b623 Here, Shawn and his companions simply continued on with the same sponsored activity, including when they returned to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>hospitality room and up until the time of Shawn\u2019s fall. The drinking that occurred was the continuation of the same activity, in the same way, in the same place, for the same purposes and with the same sanctions of the employer that mandates the conclusion Shawn began the night in the course and scope of his employment and remained there until his fall. It was certainly foreseeable to Shawn\u2019s employer that drinking would not only occur in the hospitality room, but at other times during this conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\u00b624 As we stated earlier, because Shawn did not deviate from the course and scope of employment, there is no need to analyze the case under <em>Dale </em>as the WCC did. Van Vleet correctly argues that if Shawn\u2019s intoxication cannot be used as a defense to compensability, then it is inconsistent and legally incorrect for the WCC to have based its later conclusion regarding course and scope of employment on that same intoxication. As such, we hold the WCC erred when interpreting and applying the four factors from <em>Dale </em>to determine whether Shawn deviated from his traveling employee status.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b625  We hold that the WCC incorrectly determined Shawn was not within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the fall which resulted in his death and erred in dismissing Van Vleet\u2019s petition on that basis. Reversed and remanded to the WCC to enter judgment and an award of benefits to Van Vleet on her behalf and on behalf of Vanesa, their daughter.</p>\n<judges id=\"b541-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b541-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AKj\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">\u00b626 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that Shawn Van Vleet was within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the fall which resulted in his death. It is my opinion that Shawn\u2019s early morning activities constituted a deviation from work-related matters, putting him outside the course and scope of his employment at the time he fell from the balcony. I would affirm the WCC\u2019s dismissal of Van Vleet\u2019s petition for workers\u2019 compensation benefits on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">\u00b627 At the outset, I agree the WCC correctly determined that Shawn\u2019s extreme intoxication at the time he fell does not bar Van Vleet\u2019s petition under \u00a7 39-71-407(4), MCA. I further agree that, pursuant to the four-part test set forth in <em>Courser v. Darby School Dist. No. 1 </em>(1984), 214 Mont. 13, 692 P.2d 417, the WCC correctly determined that Shawn\u2019s presence at the MNOA conference and participation in the hospitality room prior to its closing at midnight were within the course and scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">\u00b628 I strenuously disagree, however, with the Court\u2019s statements that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the WCC\u2019s determination regarding the course and scope of Shawn\u2019s employment resolved the issue before it and that the WCC\u2019s further analysis of whether Shawn deviated from the course and scope of his employment was unnecessary. The Trust argued in the WCC that workers\u2019 compensation benefits were not payable because Shawn had deviated from the course and scope of his employment at the time he fell and it was necessary for the WCC to address this argument. Moreover, in my opinion, the WCC correctly determined that Shawn had deviated from the course and scope of his employment at the time he fell from the balcony.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b629 Section 39-71-407(1), MCA, provides that an insurer is liable for the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an employee or the employee\u2019s beneficiary if the employee \u201creceives an injury arising out of and in the course of employment....\u201d Generally, when an employee is traveling for the purpose of performing an assignment incidental to the employee\u2019s regular employment and of some immediate benefit to the employer, an injury sustained by the employee during that travel may be deemed to have occurred in the course and scope of employment. <em>See Courser, </em>214 Mont. at 16,692 P.2d at 418-19 (citation omitted). In <em>Courser, </em>we set forth four factors applicable in determining whether travel activity during which an injury occurs is work-related and, thus, within the course and scope of the employment: (1) whether the activity was undertaken at the employer\u2019s request; (2) whether the employer directly or indirectly compelled the employee\u2019s attendance at the activity; (3) whether the employer controlled or participated in the activity; and (4) whether both the employer and employee mutually benefitted from the activity. <em>Courser, </em>214 Mont. at 16, 692 P.2d at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b630 The parties do not dispute that the WCC correctly applied the four <em>Courser </em>factors to its initial determination that Shawn\u2019s attendance at the conference and participation in the hospitality room until its closure by the sponsor at midnight was within the course and scope of his employment. However, as the Court correctly observes, traveling employees are not covered 24 hours a day without limitation. The employee must <em>remain </em>within the course and scope of employment during travel in order for an injury to be compensable. <em>Dale v. Trade Street, Inc. </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 349, 352-53, 854 P.2d 828, 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b631 Based on these principles, we have developed what is termed the \u201cdeviation\u201d rule which provides that, if the employee departs from the mutually beneficial purpose of the travel-that is, temporarily leaves the employment and does not attend to employment-related matters-the employment connection is severed and an injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>sustained during the period of the deviation is outside the course and scope of employment. <em>Dale, </em>258 Mont. at 355-56, 854 P.2d at 832. Furthermore, the question of whether an employee deviated by no longer attending to employment-related matters also is resolved by applying the four-part <em>Courser </em>test. <em>Dale, </em>258 Mont. at 355-56, 854 P.2d at 831-32. In other words, the <em>Courser </em>factors are used to determine both whether overall travel is within the course and scope of employment and whether a deviation from compensable travel renders an employee outside the course and scope of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"AqMU\">\u00b632 Here, the WCC applied the four <em>Courser </em>factors and determined that Shawn\u2019s attendance at the conference and participation in the hospitality room prior to its closing at midnight were within the course and scope of his employment. In that regard, the WCC found that Shawn\u2019s attendance at the conference was at least encouraged, if not required, by his employer and that his immediate supervisor attended the conference and participated in the hospitality room with him. The WCC further found that Shawn\u2019s attendance at the conference and hospitality room were of benefit both to himself and his employer because Shawn was to attend training courses, could network with other law enforcement officers and prosecutors, and could meet with equipment vendors to evaluate available products which the Task Force was contemplating purchasing. Thus, Shawn\u2019s participation in the MNOA-sponsored hospitality room until its closure was within the course and scope of his employment under the <em>Courser </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b633 The problem with the Court\u2019s analysis of this case is that, having observed that we apply the four-part <em>Courser </em>test to determine whether an employee\u2019s activities are within the course and scope of employment and that a traveling employee is not covered 24 hours a day without limitation, the Court never returns to or applies these legal concepts. The Court merely concludes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">Shawn and his companions simply continued on with the same sponsored activity, including when they returned to the hospitality room and up until the time of Shawn\u2019s fall. The drinking that occurred was the continuation of the same activity, in the same way, in the same place, for the same purposes and with the same sanctions of the employer that mandates the conclusion Shawn began the night in the course and scope of his employment and remained there until his fall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Simply put, this conclusion is both factually and legally incorrect. Moreover, and at best, the Court\u2019s conclusion leaves the \u201cnot covered 24 hours a day\u201d principle on shaky ground indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u00b634 The MNOA-sponsored hospitality room closed at midnight. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>is no evidence that the MNOA or Shawn\u2019s employer authorized or condoned use of the room after midnight. Consequently, the presence of Shawn and his companions in the room after obtaining a key from a hotel employee was not a \u201csponsored activity.\u201d Moreover, Shawn\u2019s early-morning activities were not a continuation of the same earlier activity and were not conducted for the same purposes. Rather, viewing the facts of this case in light of the four <em>Courser </em>factors reveals that Shawn\u2019s early-morning activities were a deviation from, and not within, the course and scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b635 Shawn\u2019s employer and supervisor did not encourage him, and did not accompany him, in his early-morning activities including personal use of the hospitality room after its sponsor closed it. Nor was there any benefit to his employer in the additional socializing in which Shawn and others participated after obtaining a key to the room from a hotel employee. Shawn was not attending training courses, there no longer were equipment vendors in the hospitality room and, other than Shawn\u2019s four drinking companions, there were no law enforcement officers or prosecutors with which to network for employment purposes. No evidence suggests-much less establishes-that Shawn and his companions were doing other than personal, nonwork-related socializing. Once the MNOA closed the sponsored hospitality room, the <em>Courser </em>factors no longer were met. I would conclude, therefore, that Shawn\u2019s early-morning activities after the hospitality room closed were not work-related and constituted a deviation from the course and scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b636 Furthermore, the Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Gordon v. H.C. Smith Const. Co. </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 166, 612 P.2d 668, is misplaced as that case is readily distinguishable. In that case, we concluded that Gordon was on his way to where he was staying for the night at the time the accident occurred. Consequently, he was within the course and scope of his employment as a traveling employee because he was en route from work. <em>Gordon, </em>188 Mont. at 173-74, 612 P.2d at 672. Thus, the question of whether Gordon\u2019s stop at a bar to drink and socialize constituted a deviation from work-related matters was of no import because Gordon subsequently proceeded on his way home from his j ob, which activity was work-related. <em>Gordon, </em>188 Mont. at 174-75, 612 P.2d at 672-73. In contrast, there is no evidence here that Shawn had discontinued his early-morning activities and was proceeding to his room for the night at the time he fell from the balcony. Indeed, Shawn\u2019s last known activity was trying unsuccessfully to continue with more drinking. There is no record basis for the Court\u2019s determination that the facts of this case are similar to those in <em>Gordon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u00b637 More importantly, however, the Court hangs its hat on <em>Gordon </em>in the context of its continued refusal to accept the reality that the sponsored hospitality room-conceded by all to be within the course and scope of Shawn\u2019s employment-had closed before the activities at issue here began. The Court\u2019s statement, vis-a-vis <em>Gordon, </em>that \u201c[s]imilarly, here, it is not shocking, nor is it unforeseeable that Shawn and his colleagues, while away from their homes and families, would attend and participate in a conference sponsored hospitality room where alcohol was provided in order to socialize and network,\u201d simply and totally ignores the actual facts of this case, which include not only additional drinking, but drinking games after the hospitality room was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b638 Finally, I disagree that the WCC based its conclusion that Shawn was not within the course and scope of his employment when he fell on the fact that Shawn was highly intoxicated at the time. Rather, the WCC concluded that Shawn was not \u201cattending to employment-related matters.\u201d While Shawn\u2019s presence in the hospitality room and his drinking while there prior to its closing was condoned by and beneficial to his employer, his subsequent activities were not. It is not the fact of his intoxication which removed him from the course and scope of his employment. Shawn\u2019s early-morning activities after the sponsor closed the hospitality room, which were devoid of any benefit to his employer, constituted the deviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b639 In my view, the WCC correctly determined Shawn was not within the course and scope of his employment at the time he fell from the balcony. Consequently, I would affirm the WCC\u2019s dismissal of Van Vleet\u2019s petition for workers\u2019 compensation benefits and I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b545-6\">JUSTICE NELSON and JUSTICE RICE join in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
