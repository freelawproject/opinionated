Kenda (Kenda) to tender payment of settlement proceeds to the court, and to require Wyant to file a satisfaction of judgment against Kenda. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in ordering Wyant to file a satisfaction of judgment following her acceptance of Kenda\u2019s offer of judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">\u00b64 On June 1, 2001,Wyant and Kenda were involved in a motor vehicle accident in Belgrade, Montana. Thereafter, Wyant brought suit against Kenda for injuries she had sustained in the accident. At the time of the accident, Kenda was insured by Mid-Century Insurance Company (Mid-Century).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">\u00b65 Wyant received treatment for her injuries from Dan Satchell, P.C., C.C.S.P., of Satchell Chiropractic Clinic, P.C. (Satchell), incurring medical expenses therewith in the amount of $3,014.00. On June 6, 2001, Wyant executed an assignment of her right to collect insurance proceeds in regard to her injuries in favor of Satchell, and thereafter, Satchell filed a notice of lien with Mid-Century on June 7, 2001, claiming priority of payment from Mid-Century.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">\u00b66 On February 5,2003, after conducting discovery, Kenda, through her insurer, made an offer of judgment which stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-13\">Kenda... pursuant to the provision of Rule 68, M.R.Civ.P., hereby offers to allow Judgment to be taken against her in the full sum of $20,000.00 (Twenty Thousand Dollars), inclusive of costs now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>accrued and further inclusive of all payments made on behalf of defendant Kathy Renda by Mid-Century Insurance Company for medical bills ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">On February 20, 2003, Wyant accepted the offer of judgment, and on February 21, 2003, the District Court entered judgment which \u201cordered, adjudged and decreed that plaintiff Victoria Wyant recover from defendant Kathy I. Renda the sum of $20,000.00, inclusive of advance payments and costs accrued through the date of the offer, with interest thereon at the rate of 10% per annum\u201d from the date of the judgment. Mid-Century had previously advanced payments through the date of the offer in the amount of $13,096.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b67 On March 5,2003, Kenda\u2019s attorney personally delivered a check in the sum of $6,903.85, representing the amount of the judgment which exceeded the advance payments, together with copies of Wyant\u2019s assignment of proceeds to Satchell and Satchell\u2019s notice of lien, and a satisfaction of judgment for Wyant\u2019s signature. The settlement check named Satchell as one of the payees. However, disputing Mid-Century\u2019s inclusion of Satchell as a payee, Wyant refused to accept the check and refused to execute the satisfaction of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b68 Renda then filed a Tender of Judgment Payment for Court Disposition, which requested that the District Court require her to deposit the settlement check with the Clerk of Court and Wyant to execute the satisfaction of judgment. Wyant objected, arguing that the inclusion of Satchell as a payee did not satisfy the judgment, that Satchell had refused to endorse the check, and further, that Wyant\u2019s counsel, Martin R. Studer (Studer), had a lien against the proceeds for attorney fees and costs. Renda responded that any dispute between Wyant and Satchell regarding chiropractor fees was not an issue between Wyant and Renda, and was not a proper consideration for the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u00b69 On April 8,2003, the District Court granted Kenda\u2019s motion, and further held that Satchell\u2019s chiropractic lien had priority over Studer\u2019s attorney lien because it was filed earlier. Thereafter, Kenda\u2019s attorney tendered Mid-Century\u2019s check, together with the accrued interest, to the District Court, and Wyant was ordered to execute a satisfaction of judgment. Wyant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\u00b610  The construction and interpretation of a contract is a question of law for the court to decide. <em>Dambrowski v. Champion Int\u2019l Corp., </em>2003 MT 233, \u00b6 6, 317 Mont. 218, \u00b6 6, 76 P.3d 1080, \u00b6 6. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Dambrowski, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err in ordering Wyant to file a satisfaction of judgment following her acceptance of Defendant\u2019s offer of judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b612 In addressing this issue, it is necessary to consider subissues raised by Wyant, including: (1) whether the District Court correctly concluded that the settlement check did not violate the offer of judgment accepted by Wyant and entered by the District Court; (2) whether Mid-Century\u2019s inclusion of Satchell as a payee on the settlement check was a violation of the settlement agreement; and (3) whether the District Court erred in its determination that Satchell\u2019s lien had priority over Studer\u2019s lien. We address these subissues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Did the check presented by Mid-Century violate the parties\u2019 settlement agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u00b613 Wyant argues that Kenda\u2019s attempt to compel payment of Satchell\u2019s bill from the settlement is an improper interjection of ambiguity into a clear and unambiguous Rule 68 offer of judgment. She contends that because the offer of judgment failed to mention Satchell\u2019s lien or the manner in which the debt to Satchell would be paid, there was not a \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d in regard to Satchell\u2019s lien, and payment of that expense was not part of the settlement. Therefore, Wyant argues that Renda is obligated to pay Satchell\u2019s bill in addition to paying the amount agreed in the settlement agreement to Wyant, because, in accordance with our holding in <em>Montana Fair Hous., Inc., v. Barnes, </em>2002 MT 353, 313 Mont. 409, 61 P.3d 170, any ambiguity in a Rule 68 offer must be resolved against the offeror.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">\u00b614 In <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6 7, the offer stated that judgment could be taken against the defendant \u201cin the amount of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000) together with costs only that accrued.\u201d We concluded that the plaintiff did not waive the right to seek attorney fees as \u201c[t]he offer [did] not state that the sum to be paid is consideration for the resolution of <em>all counts,\u201d </em>and thus, the offer of judgment was ambiguous in that regard. <em>Barnes, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19, 20 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">\u00b615 The facts here are distinguishable. Unlike the language which failed to demonstrate settlement of all claims in <em>Barnes, </em>Renda\u2019s offer stated that judgment could be taken against her \u201cin the <em>full sum </em>of $20,000.00 (Twenty Thousand Dollars), inclusive of all costs now accrued and further inclusive of all payments made on behalf of Renda by Mid-Century [ ] for medical bills ....\u201d (Emphasis added.) Following Wyant\u2019s acceptance of the offer, the District Court entered judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>against Renda for this \"full sum,\u201d stating that the judgment was for \u201c$20,000.00, inclusive of advance payments and costs accrued.\u201d However, in order to accommodate Wyant\u2019s interpretation of the agreement, which would require Renda to pay Satchell\u2019s bill in addition to paying Wyant, we would need to construe the offer of judgment to read \u201cin the full sum of $23,014.00, inclusive of advance payments and costs accrued.\u201d This is contrary to the plain terms of the offer. We concur with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the language of the offer \u201cclearly includes the Satchell bill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Did Mid-Century\u2019s inclusion of Satchell as a payee on the settlement check violate the settlement agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b616 Wyant argues that the District Court erred in concluding that Renda properly included Satchell as a payee on the settlement check. Wyant asserts that the inclusion of Satchell as a payee is unnecessary, was not part of the offer of judgment, and is an attempt to force Wyant to hold Mid-Century harmless from any claims Satchell might assert pursuant to \u00a7 71-3-1117, MCA, et seq., the healthcare provider lien statutes. She further contends that there is no statutory requirement that Satchell be included as a payee on the basis of its lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\u00b617 Section 71-3-1117, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">If any insurer or person, after receiving notice of lien, makes a payment on account of injury ... and the amount of the lien claimed by any... chiropractor... has not been paid, the insurer or person is liable to the ... chiropractor ... for the reasonable value of his services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">\u00b6 18  Wyant assigned her interest in payment of insurance proceeds to Satchell to the extent of the cost of his services, and thereafter, Satchell filed a notice of lien with Mid-Century. Thus, \u00a7 71-3-1117, MCA, obligated Mid-Century to pay Satchell\u2019s bill upon making any payment to Wyant for her injuries, or face direct liability to Satchell for payment of the value of his services. As we have already concluded herein, Renda\u2019s offer of settlement was for the \u201cfull sum\u201d and included Satchell\u2019s bill. Thereafter, to honor the lien, Mid-Century named Satchell as payee on the settlement check. Although there is not a statutory requirement that Satchell be included as a payee, we conclude that so naming Satchell was an appropriate way for Mid-Century to satisfy its statutory obligation to Satchell under the lien statute. Although Wyant argues that naming Satchell as payee does not satisfy the offer of judgment because Satchell refuses to endorse the check, Satchell is not a party to this action, any dispute between Wyant and Satchell is not before us, and we decline to address that matter. Further, although both parties have asserted in their briefs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>that Wyant\u2019s bill with Satchell has been discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding, the record does not address these contentions, the District Court did not address them, and we decline to address them as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Did the District Court err when it determined that the Satchell lien had priority?</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b619  Relying on \u00a7 71-3-113, MCA, which provides that \u201c[o]ther things being equal, different liens upon the same property have priority according to the time of their creation,\u201d the District Court concluded that Satchell\u2019s lien had priority over Studer\u2019s lien because it was filed in June 2001, prior to the filing of this action in June 2002, which created Studer\u2019s lien pursuant to \u00a7 37-61-420(2), MCA. Wyant argues that the court erred by overlooking \u00a7 71-3-1114(3), MCA, which she contends is determinative of the issue of priority between Satchell\u2019s and Studer\u2019s liens. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">A... chiropractor... claiming a lien under this part is not liable for attorney fees and cost incurred by the injured person, the injured person\u2019s estate or successors, or a beneficiary in connection with obtaining payments or benefits subject to a lien under this part. <em>The lien of an attorney provided for in 37-61-420 has priority over a lien created by this part.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Section 71-3-1114(3), MCA (emphasis added). Accordingly, pursuant to this provision, Studer\u2019s attorney lien had priority over Satchell\u2019s lien, regardless of the timing of the liens\u2019 creation. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court erred in holding that the Satchell lien had priority over Studer\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u00b620 Wyant also argues that the settlement check did not satisfy the judgment because it did not include interest. However, there was no dispute between the parties about Kenda\u2019s obligation to pay interest under the agreement, the District Court ordered Renda to pay interest on the judgment, and Renda takes no issue with this directive from the District Court. Therefore, this fact does not undermine the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"Asi\">\u00b621 The District Court did not err in ordering Wyant to file a satisfaction of judgment herein. Renda has performed as required by the judgment entered against her by the District Court. Only the declaration of priority of the liens was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">\u00b622 Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b367-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICE COTTER, WARNER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
