The resulting collision caused Woods\u2019 death. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issues before this Court is:</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in finding that BNSF was not negligent <em>per se?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err in allowing the jury to consider whether Woods was contributorily negligent?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err in allowing BNSF employees to testify regarding BNSF\u2019s safety rules?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">\u00b66 The facts pertinent to the issues in this case are undisputed and uncontested. On August 23, 2000, Woods, a welding supervisor employed by BNSF, accompanied Holloway, a track supervisor for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>BNSF, in a hy-rail vehicle to inspect a specific section of track. Prior to departing from their point of origin, Holloway, in accordance with federal regulations and company rules, obtained a \"track warrant\u201d (warrant), which gave Holloway\u2019s vehicle exclusive use of the segment of track described in the warrant. The segment of track described in track warrants always has a clearly identifiable starting and ending point, and is known as the \u201cworking limits\u201d of the warrant. Under the warrant, until Holloway notified the railroad dispatcher that he no longer required exclusive use of that segment of track, the dispatcher would not allow any other trains or railway vehicles coming from the opposite direction to be within the working limits assigned to Holloway.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">\u00b67 Once Holloway reached the point <em>of </em>destination described in his track warrant, he was not authorized to proceed further down the track until he obtained a new track warrant defining new working limits. Holloway, nonetheless, proceeded more than four miles beyond the destination point of his working limit, at which time he encountered an <em>oncoming </em>train. The train struck the hy-rail vehicle. Holloway was able to jump clear but because Woods was constrained by a seat belt, he was unable to do so and was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b68 After the accident, BNSF conducted an investigation which determined that Holloway had violated the working limits of his exclusive track warrant authority by proceeding beyond the destination point identified in the warrant. The Railroad concluded that Holloway\u2019s error had caused Woods\u2019 death.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b69 In June 2001, Lillian sued BNSF under the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA). In September 2002, Lillian moved for partial summary judgment seeking an order that BNSF was negligent <em>per se </em>for violating the railroad safety rules promulgated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). BNSF argued that the federal rules do not prohibit a hy-rail vehicle from exceeding the limits defined in a track warrant; therefore, Holloway had not violated federal safety rules, and BNSF was not negligent <em>per se. </em>Moreover, BNSF claimed that Woods was contributorily negligent because he did not stop Holloway from exceeding the working limits. After a hearing on November 13, 2002, the District Court concluded that BNSF was not negligent <em>per se </em>and denied Lillian\u2019s Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b610 On November 21, 2002, just one day after receiving a copy of the District Court\u2019s Order denying her Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on negligence <em>per se, </em>Lillian filed a \u201cNew Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d seeking a ruling that Woods was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>contributorily negligent because he was, in no way, in control of the hy-rail vehicle. The District Court denied the Motion as untimely explaining that the Scheduling Order required that all pre-trial motions be filed by November 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b611 A jury trial was held from January 6-9, 2003. At the close of the trial, the jury reached a special verdict awarding Lillian $969,796.78. The jury also found that Woods was 50% negligent. As a result, the District Court entered a judgment in favor of Lillian for $484,898.39. Lillian appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b612 The District Court\u2019s determination that BNSF was not negligent <em>per se </em>is a conclusion of law. We conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of a court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether its interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Reidelbach v. Burlington Northern Ry. Co., </em>2002 MT 289, \u00b6 14, 312 Mont. 498, \u00b6 14, 60 P.3d 418, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). <em>See also State v. Ray, </em>2003 MT 171, \u00b6 35, 316 Mont. 354, \u00b6 35, 71 P.3d 1247, \u00b6 35 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u00b613 The dispositive issue in this case is whether the District Court erred in ruling, as a matter of law, that BNSF was not negligent <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUB\">\u00b614  Negligence <em>per se </em>is simply negligence that is established as a matter of law, so that breach of the duty is not a jury question. It usually arises from a statutory violation. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Seventh Edition. It is well established, however, that under the FELA, the violation of a safety <em>regulation </em>also constitutes negligence <em>per se. Bevacqua v. Union Pacific Co., </em>1998 MT 120, 289 Mont. 36, 960 P.2d 273. <em>See also Walden v. Illinois Central Gulf R.R. </em>(7th Cir. 1992), 975 F.2d 361, 364. Accord <em>Kernan v. American Dredging Co. </em>(1958), 355 U.S. 426, 78 S.Ct. 394, 2 L.Ed.2d 382 (holding that recovery was permissible, without any showing of negligence, for death resulting from the violation of a <em>rule </em>concerning lighting equipment (emphasis added)); <em>Pratico v. Portland Terminal Co. </em>(1st Cir. 1985), 783 F.2d 255 (wherein the court determined that a jury instruction requiring the jury to find the defendant negligent as a matter of law if the defendant violated an OSHA <em>regulation </em>and such violation was a proximate cause of plaintiffs injury, was correct as a matter of law (emphasis added)). <em>Bevacqua, </em>\u00b6 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">\u00b615 In <em>Bevacqua, </em>Bevacqua\u2019s knee was injured in three different work-related incidents over an almost twenty-year period. After the last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>incident, he filed a FELA claim against Union Pacific alleging that the railroad was liable, under the theory of negligence <em>per se, </em>for his injuries. Union Pacific argued it could not be negligent as a matter of law because it had not violated a statute, but rather a locomotive noise-emission regulation, and that the injury Bevacqua sustained was not the type of injury that was foreseeable under the breached law. Citing <em>Walden </em>and <em>Kernan, </em>we held that violation of a federal regulation is negligence <em>per se </em>under the FELA, and as such it is not necessary to establish the element of foreseeability. <em>Bevacqua, </em>\u00b6 86. The Court, therefore, reinstated the original award of $320,000. <em>See also Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co. </em>(1957), 352 U.S. 500, 77 S.Ct. 443, 1 L.Ed.2d 493 (In a FELA action, the railroad will be held liable if the employer\u2019s \u201cnegligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b616 The FELA has been protecting railroad workers for almost one hundred years. Since its final enactment in 1910, courts have broadly interpreted it in an effort to honor the Congressional intent of the Act, which was \u201cto protect railroad workers and to provide assured compensation for those workers injured by the negligence of their railroad employer.\u201d <em>Reidelbach, </em>\u00b6 20. The liability section of the FELA states that \u201cevery common carrier by railroad ... shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier ... for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier <em>...\u201d Reidelbach, </em>\u00b6 19 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b617 Under the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970,45 U.S.C. \u00a7 421 <em>et seq., </em>the Secretary of Transportation promulgated the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations, which are published at 49 C.F.R., Subpart B, Chapter II, parts 200-50. Part 214 is dedicated to Railroad Workplace Safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b618 Lillian argues that Holloway\u2019s violation of the terms of his track warrant constitute a violation of multiple regulations within Part 214. She maintains that had Holloway stopped the maintenance vehicle at the location required in his track warrant, the maintenance vehicle would not have been in the path of an oncoming train. Lillian asserts that BNSF\u2019s regulatory violation was the exclusive cause of her husband\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b619 BNSF acknowledges that Holloway proceeded to travel past the warrant limits without proper authority. The Railroad argues, however, that this was not a violation of federal safety regulations but rather a violation of internal BNSF rules and as such does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>constitute negligence <em>perse. </em>BNSF maintains that the federal \u201cworking limits\u201d regulation that Lillian alleges it violated merely defines the extent of working limits. In other words, it argues, the regulation defines the limits by describing the clearly identifiable physical features constituting the points of origin and destination, but does not-by specific language-prohibit exceeding them.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b620 Before discussing the relevant regulations, it is important to note that \u201cthe United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that FELA is to be given a liberal construction in favor of injured railroad workers so that it may accomplish the humanitarian and remedial purposes intended by Congress. This Court has followed federal case law in giving a liberal construction to FELA in favor of injured railroad workers.\u201d <em>Bevacqua, </em>\u00b6 49 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b621 The purpose and scope of the FRA \u201cRoadway Worker Protection\u201d regulations is set forth at 49 C.F.R. 214.301. The regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">(a) The purpose of this subpart is to prevent accidents and casualties caused by moving railroad cars, locomotives or roadway maintenance machines striking roadway workers or roadway maintenance machines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">(b) This subpart prescribes minimum safety standards for roadway workers. Each railroad and railroad contractor may prescribe additional or more stringent operating rules, safety rules, and other special instructions that are consistent with this subpart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">(c) This subpart prescribes safety standards related to the movement of roadway maintenance machines where such movements affect the safety of roadway workers. This subpart does not otherwise affect movements of roadway maintenance machines that are conducted under the authority of a train dispatcher, a control operator, or the operating rules of the railroad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\u00b622 Lillian also relies on 49 C.F.R. 214.319 and 214.321. Section 214.319 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">Working limits established on controlled track shall conform to the provisions of \u00a7 214.321 Exclusive track occupancy, or \u00a7 214.323 Foul time, or \u00a7 214. 325 Train coordination. ... Working limits established under any procedure shall, in addition, conform to the following provisions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-11\">(a) Only a roadway worker who is qualified in accordance with \u00a7 214.353 of this part shall establish or have control over working limits for the purpose of establishing on-track safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>(b) Only one roadway worker shall have control over working limits on any one segment of track.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-3\">49 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.319.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b623 As referenced in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.319, the method used by railroads for granting and controlling \u201cexclusive track occupancy\u201d is set forth in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.321:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">Working limits established on controlled track through the use of exclusive track occupancy procedures shall comply with the following requirements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">(a) The track within working limits shall be placed under the control of one roadway worker by either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">(1) Authority issued to the roadway worker in charge by the train dispatcher or control operator who controls train movements on that track,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">(2) Flagmen stationed at each entrance to the track within working limits and instructed by the roadway worker in charge to permit the movement of trains and equipment into the working limits only as permitted by the roadway worker in charge, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">(3) The roadway worker in charge causing fixed signals at each entrance to the working limits to display an aspect indicating \u201cStop.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">(b) An authority for exclusive track occupancy given to the roadway worker in charge of the working limits shall be transmitted on a written or printed document directly, by relay through a designated employee, in a data transmission, or by oral communication, to the roadway worker by the train dispatcher or control operator in charge of the track.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-11\">(1) Where authority for exclusive track occupancy is transmitted orally, the authority shall be written as received by the roadway worker in charge and repeated to the issuing employee for verification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-12\">(2) The roadway worker in charge of the working limits shall maintain possession of the written or printed authority for exclusive track occupancy while the authority for the working limits is in effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-13\">(3) The train dispatcher or control operator in charge of the track shall make a written or electronic record of all authorities issued to establish exclusive track occupancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-14\">(c) The extent of working limits established through exclusive track occupancy shall be defined by one of the following physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>features clearly identifiable to a locomotive engineer or other person operating a train or railroad equipment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">(1) A flagman with instructions and capability to hold all trains and equipment clear of the working limits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">(2) A fixed signal that displays an aspect indicating \u201cStop\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">(3) A station shown in the time-table, and identified by name with a sign, beyond which train movement is prohibited by train movement authority or the provisions of a direct train control system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">(4) A clearly identifiable milepost sign beyond which train movement is prohibited by train movement authority or the provisions of a direct train control system; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">(5) A clearly identifiable physical location prescribed by the operating rules of the railroad that trains may not pass without proper authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">(d) Movements of trains and roadway maintenance machines within working limits established through exclusive track occupancy shall be made only under the direction of the roadway worker having control over the working limits. Such movements shall be restricted speed unless a higher speed has been specifically authorized by the roadway worker in charge of the working limits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">\u00b624 BNSF argues that statutory construction begins with the text of the statute, or in this case, the regulation, and where the language is \u201cplain, unambiguous, direct and certain,\u201d there is nothing left for the court to construe. Lillian argues that regulations must be read together and considered as a whole to further their overall purpose and intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">\u00b625  We conclude that because FELA is a remedial statute and the specific purpose and intent of the FRA regulations is to \u201cprevent accidents and casualties caused by moving railroad cars, locomotives or roadway maintenance machines striking roadway workers or roadway maintenance machines,\u201d we will review and construe the regulations as a comprehensive scheme of protection for railroad workers. Moreover, when more than one interpretation is possible, in order to promote justice and give effect to the purpose of the regulation, we will reject an interpretation that leads to an unreasonable or absurd result in favor of another that leads to a reasonable result. <em>Hiett v. Missoula County Public Schools, </em>2003 MT 213, \u00b6 36, 317 Mont. 95, \u00b6 36, 75 P.3d 341, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">\u00b626 Section 214.319 mandates that only one railroad worker shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>have control over working limits on any one segment of track. In this case, that railroad worker was Holloway. The record shows that Holloway followed the detailed procedure for obtaining the track warrant that allowed his hy-rail vehicle to have exclusive track occupancy within the working limits defined in his warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b627  Section 214.321 requires that on-track safety be guaranteed through \u201cexclusive track occupancy procedures\u201d which establish working limits to be set forth in track warrants. There is no dispute that the procedures are \u201cexclusive,\u201d or that the warrants categorically set the physical limits of exclusive track occupancy. To conclude that these regulations do not, however, require an employee to comply with and not exceed the provisions of the warrant, leads to an absurd construction. There would be absolutely no utility in imposing strict limits if violation of those strict limits was not prohibited. This Court has always refrained from interpreting statutes in such a way as would defeat their purpose. <em>American Linen Supply v. Dept. of Revenue </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 542, 545, 617 P.2d 131, 133. <em>See also Hawley v. Board of Oil and Gas Conservation, </em>2000 MT 2, \u00b6 13, 297 Mont. 467, \u00b6 13, 993 P.2d 677, \u00b6 13; <em>Missoula Rural Fire Dist. v. Missoula County </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 178, 182, 720 P.2d 1170, 1173. Were we to interpret the above regulations to impose strict limits but no obligation of compliance, the purpose of the regulations would be defeated. Moreover, the purpose and intent of the FELA would not be served. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court erred in concluding that violation of the working limits of the track warrant, which resulted directly in Woods\u2019 death, was not negligence <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b628  Lillian further appeals the District Court\u2019s ruling allowing BNSF to argue to the jury that Woods was contributorily negligent. This ruling flowed directly from the District Court\u2019s erroneous conclusion that BNSF was not negligent <em>per se. </em>Under the FELA, no employee \u201cshall be held to have been guilty of contributory negligence in any case where the violation by such common carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 53. This restriction against the use of contributory negligence as a defense has been extended to violation of regulations as well. <em>See Eckert v. Aliquippa &amp; Southern R.R. Co. </em>(3rd Cir. 1987), 828 F.2d 183, 187 (violation of regulation promulgated pursuant to Federal Railroad Safety Act precluded use of contributory negligence). The caveat-that \u201c[p]roof that the employee\u2019s own negligence was the <em>sole </em>cause of his or her injury is a valid defense because it eliminates the possibility that the regulatory violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>contributed in whole or part to the injury\u201d-is not applicable here. <em>Walden, </em>975 F.2d at 364. It is undisputed that any alleged negligence on the part of Woods was not the <em>sole </em>cause of his death. It was error for the District Court to allow BNSF to argue contributory negligence. \u00b629 Because we conclude that the District Court erred in its rulings on negligence <em>per se </em>and contributory negligence, it is not necessary that we address the last issue presented by Lillian.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b630 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the District Court\u2019s Decision and Order denying Woods\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the issue of negligence <em>per se. </em>Accordingly, we vacate the finding of contributory negligence and remand for a judgment reinstating the jury\u2019s award of $969,796.78 to Lillian.</p>\n<judges id=\"b180-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"AIC\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"ALh\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b631 I dissent. The majority has erroneously construed FRA regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\u00b632 The controlling principles missed by the Court are rather simple: The statutes and regulations say to a railroad \u201cthou shall\u201d do what we say to promote safety, and if you do these things, you have followed the law. Next, a railroad\u2019s Maintenance of Way Operating Rules says to its workers \u201cthou shalt not\u201d violate these rules for if you do, you may be injured or killed. It is possible for a railroad to comply with the statutes and regulations and an employee may still be injured. It is not possible for an employee to be injured without some violation of safety rules because they, in essence, say \u201cdon\u2019t get hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\u00b633 Congress and the FRA have enacted statutes and regulations which must be followed to promote safety in the dangerous railroad industry. The Court is correct that a violation of either the statutes or the regulations which causes an injury is a violation of law, constitutes negligence <em>per se, </em>and in such instance there can be no comparative fault assessed by the fact-finder. <em>Bevacqua, </em>289 Mont. at \u00b6 83. The Court acknowledges that BNSF followed the statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"ArW\">\u00b6 26. BNSF, pursuant to 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.317, promulgated safety rules to provide on-track safety for its employees. A violation of these safety rules can be careless, that is, negligent, but such is not negligence <em>per se. </em>Comparative fault is a partial defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">\u00b634 The District Court, unlike this Court, understands the difference between a violation of regulations and a violation of safety rules. It denied Woods\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment because it found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u201cthe alleged negligent conduct of Holloway was not a violation of the federal regulations cited by Plaintiff.\u201d Holloway complied with both 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.319 and 321. For example, it was undisputed that Holloway was the sole roadway worker in control of track limits, as required by 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.321(a), and the extent of the working limits were clearly identifiable, as required under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.321(c). He did not violate an applicable statute or regulation, no such violation caused injury to Woods, and BNSF is not negligent <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b635 Holloway admittedly violated a BNSF Maintenance of Way Operating Rule which expressly prohibited him from going beyond the track warrant limits. Thus, BNSF was negligent, which it admitted. However, such negligence does not arise because of the violation of a regulation, but because of human error in violating a safety rule. Woods also violated this safety rule. Woods\u2019 fault must be compared to the fault of Holloway, which is what the jury did.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b636 The Court acknowledges Holloway complied with the regulations because he \u201cfollowed the detailed procedures for obtaining a track warrant that allowed his hy-rail vehicle to have exclusive track occupancy within the working limits defined in his warrant.\u201d \u00b6 26. The Court then proceeds beyond the authorized legal limit and states that it would lead to an \u201cabsurd result\u201d to conclude the regulations themselves do not require an employee to comply with and not exceed the provisions of the track warrant. The Court ignores the fact that these same Federal regulations explicitly provide, \u201c[e]ach [railroad]... shall provide on-track safely for roadway workers ....\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.317; and that such provisions are formally reviewed by the FRA to ensure that the rules comply with federal law. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.307(b). Thus, by concluding regulations say the same thing as the railroad\u2019s safety rules, the Court eliminates the need for the safety rules and casually eliminates the defense of comparative fault in FELA cases. Then, the Court boldly says that it expands FRA regulations to include the safety rules, thereby eliminating the contributory negligence defense, because it will not interpret statutes in such a way as to defeat their purpose. \u00b6 27. My mind boggles at this sorcery.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b637 Following the law would not lead to an absurd result as the majority concludes. The FRA regulations set forth the standard procedures that each railroad must follow for establishing track warrant limits. Each railroad is responsible for setting forth on-track safety procedures that are consistent with the federal regulations, but are specific to their own operations. BNSF had its on-track safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>rales, one of which required all roadway workers to comply with track warrant instructions. Holloway complied with the regulations, but both Holloway and Woods failed to comply with the BNSF safety rule when they exceeded the track warrant limits. Therefore, there is no negligence <em>per se, </em>but the jury could find that both men were negligent and their negligence caused Woods\u2019 death.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b638 The Court has ignored the rale of statutory [regulatory] construction that where the language of a statute is \u201cplain, unambiguous, direct and certain,\u201d there is nothing left for the court to construe. <em>Curtis v. District Court </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 231, 235, 879 P.2d 1164, 1166. While under some circumstances it may be necessary to liberally construe Congressional language in order to avoid an obvious inequity, that is not the case here. The United States Supreme Court has clearly explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">[tjhat FELA is to be liberally construed, however, does not mean that it is a workers\u2019 compensation statute. We have insisted that FELA \u201cdoes not make the employer the insurer of the safety of his employees while they are on duty. The basis of his liability is his negligence, not the fact that injuries occur.\u201d And while \u201c[w]hat constitutes negligence for the statute\u2019s purposes is a federal question,\u201d we have made clear that this federal question turns on principles of common law: \u201c[T]he [FELA] is founded on common-law concepts of negligence and injury, subject to such qualifications as Congress has imported into those terms[.]\u201d Those qualifications, discussed above, are the modification or abrogation of several common-law defenses to liability, including contributory negligence and assumption of risk. Only to the extent of these explicit statutory alterations is FELA \u201can avowed departure from the rules of common law.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\"><em>Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Gottshall </em>(1994), 512 U.S. 532, 543-44, 114 S.Ct. 2396, 2404, 129 L.Ed.2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b639 In my view, if Congress had intended courts to liberally construe the statutory and regulatory language so as to infer a regulatory violation when a railroad worker is killed or injured, it would not have modified, but would have abrogated, contributory negligence as a defense, the same as it did with assumption of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\u00b640 While it was Congress\u2019 intent in enacting FELA to shift part of the \u201chuman overhead\u201d of doing business from the worker to the railroad, and to ensure the railroad industry would bear \u201csome of the cost for the legs, eyes, arms, and fives which it consumed in its operations,\u201d it was not Congress\u2019 intent to place the entire burden on the railroad, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>except under those circumstances explicitly stated. <em>Consolidated Rail </em>Corp., 512 U.S. at 542, 114 S.Ct. at 2404 (citing <em>Wilkerson v. McCarthy </em>(1949), 336 U.S. 53, 68, 69 S.Ct. 413, 420, 93 L.Ed. 497).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">\u00b641 Because BNSF was not negligent <em>per se, </em>it was proper for the District Court to submit the question of contributory negligence to the jury. Title 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 53 only bars a defense of contributory negligence where the railroad has violated a safety statute or regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b642 It is wrong to hold that federal regulations preempted BNSF on-track safety rules where the federal regulations themselves explicitly required the railroad to adopt such rules, and where the rules, even though more stringent, were not in conflict with the federal regulations. The District Court was not in error in allowing BNSF\u2019s expert witness to testify as to whether Woods violated such rules, because a qualified expert witness may offer his opinion as to the meaning of a company\u2019s internal rule and whether such rule has been violated. See <em>Mahan v. Farmers Union Cent. Exch., Inc. </em>(1989), 235 Mont. 410, 420, 768 P.2d 850, 857 (experts may \u201ctestify as to whether the company complied with or violated its own policies.\u201d) The court also did not err in allowing BNSF\u2019s lay witnesses to testify as to their understanding of the on-track safety rules. Lay witnesses may offer opinions based on their first-hand knowledge and perceptions. Rule 701, M.R.Evid. In this case, the lay witness testimony was based on the witness\u2019 first-hand experience in performing the same job as Woods. Additionally, \u201c[testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d Rule 704, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b643 For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b183-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
