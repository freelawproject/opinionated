This confidential informant stated that he had seen marijuana plants in the window of Kathie\u2019s residence. The officers did not have a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">\u00b64 Upon answering the door, the officers told Kathie that it had been reported that someone had seen a marijuana plant growing in her house. After some discussion, the context of which is disputed, Kathie consented to a search of her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">\u00b65 In the basement, the officers discovered a locked bedroom door, and from that bedroom they heard a beeping noise, like that of an alarm. Deputy Misner advised Lieutenant Rash to go outside to see if he could look into the windows of the bedroom. The windows, however, had been blackened out. Deputy Misner did observe several extension cords running into the locked bedroom. Again, after some discussion with the officers, which Kathie later disputed as to its context, Kathie advised the officers to kick down the door. The officers did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">\u00b66 After kicking down the door, the officers found Gilmore asleep on a couch in the bedroom. They saw a bong sitting on a table in plain view. The officers arrested Gilmore, and thereafter obtained a search warrant, removing marijuana and other drug paraphernalia from the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">\u00b67 Gilmore was charged with two felony and two misdemeanor drug counts. Thereafter, Gilmore moved to suppress the evidence that the officers obtained as a result of their warrantless search. The District Court held a suppression hearing, the testimony from which is discussed in the following analysis. Ultimately, the District Court denied Gilmore\u2019s motion, and Gilmore pled guilty to the charges. He received an eight year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>\u00b68 Gilmore now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Merrill, </em>2004 MT 169, \u00b6 6, 322 Mont. 47, \u00b6 6, 93 P.3d 1227, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err in denying Gilmore\u2019s motion to suppress?</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\"><em>\u00b611 </em>Gilmore first argues that the District Court\u2019s Finding of Fact Number One is clearly erroneous because it recites paragraphs contained in the Fergus County Sheriffs Office Case Supplement that were never made part of the record. As such, Gilmore claims a finding as to facts not part of the record \"clearly\u201d evidences that the District Court created those facts through ex parte solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">\u00b612 In addition, Gilmore argues that the District Court also failed to include critical facts that were necessary for a proper determination of the case. In particular, Gilmore maintains that these critical facts included: (1) that Kathie told Deputy Misner that Gilmore was in the downstairs bedroom; (2) that Lieutenant Rash testified that before he and Deputy Misner entered the bedroom, Kathie made comments that led them to believe that Gilmore was in the bedroom; (3) that both officers knew Kathie did not have a key to the bedroom; and (4) that the officers had to kick down the bedroom door in order to gain access. Because these critical facts were not included in the District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact, Gilmore argues that the findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">\u00b613 Finally, Gilmore argues that the District Court misapplied the facts presented to it. Specifically, Gilmore argues that he had an expectation of privacy in the bedroom, as evidenced by his locking the bedroom door and darkening the windows. Although Kathie consented to the search of the bedroom, Gilmore maintains that her consent does not fall within one of the exceptions to the search warrant requirement because: (1) the bedroom door was locked; (2) Kathie did not have key to the bedroom; and (3) Kathie did not have a right to access the bedroom. \u201cUnder all three [of these] scenarios,\u201d Gilmore argues, Kathie cannot show that she had actual authority over the bedroom in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>to give the officers consent to search. As such, Gilmore maintains that the consent exception to the search warrant requirement does not apply and all evidence seized from the illegal search of the bedroom must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b614 The State of Montana (the State) argues that the officers had Kathie\u2019s consent to enter into her residence and into the locked bedroom. Indeed, the State maintains that Kathie herself instructed the officers to enter the bedroom, because she feared her son and wanted him out of her residence. Thus, the State argues that Gilmore was a trespasser, and therefore did not have an expectation of privacy over the bedroom. In addition, the State argues that the District Court\u2019s Finding of Fact Number One is not clearly erroneous because the report with which Gilmore takes issue was: (1) on file, before the suppression hearing, in the District Court\u2019s pleading record as incorporated in the State\u2019s Memorandum In Opposition to Motion to Suppress; (2) referred to during the suppression hearing; and (3) used extensively during direct and cross examination by the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b615 As to Gilmore\u2019s argument regarding the District Court\u2019s remaining Findings of Fact, the State contends that: (1) \u201c[a] district court\u2019s suppression order need not exhaustively resolve and discuss every minutiae of adduced evidence,\u201d especially when the District Court deduced that Kathie\u2019s boyfriend was using the locked bedroom and the record does not establish that Kathie in no way had access to that bedroom; (2) the doctrine of implied findings applies in that \u201cthe district court implicitly found that Appellant [Gilmore] did not possess the key, and at most, the boyfriend possessed the key,\u201d and, as such, Gilmore had no privacy interest over the bedroom \u201cwith or without the physical possession of a key;\u201d and (3) Gilmore is asking this Court to reweigh the evidence, which this Court should decline to do since \u201c[t]he credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony is exclusively within the province of the finder of fact and will not be disturbed... on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b616 The State also argues that Gilmore\u2019s contention regarding Kathie\u2019s actual authority to consent to a search of the locked bedroom is \u201cfallacious.\u201d The evidence \u201ccredited by the district court\u201d supports Kathie\u2019s authority, the State maintains, in that Kathie told the officers that: (1) the bedroom was a \u201chideout\u201d for Gilmore; (2) Gilmore was present in her home against her consent; and (3) the bedroom was used by her boyfriend as a storage room. Finally, the State contends that the issue of whether Kathie\u2019s consent was free and voluntary is not an issue before this Court and this Court should decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>\u00b617 The District Court determined the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">It is this Court\u2019s distinct impression that this statement [by Kathie that \u201cRoss keeps his door locked so I do not know what might be in his room\u201d] was obtained after the search. While the deputies were busting down the door of the room at Ms. Gilmore\u2019s request, the dominant scenario was clearly indicated by both officers\u2019 testimony: it was a room where her boyfriend kept materials and which he had locked, and it was a room where her son might be located but in which she did not want him. Officers operating under those scenarios are not violating the <em>McLees </em>standard. Ms. Gilmore had actual authority to direct the officers to break down the door and gain entry to the room in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlT\">\u00b618  Witness credibility and the weight afforded to witness testimony will not be disturbed by this Court on appeal, as assessment of this credibility and weight is within the province of the trier of fact. <em>State v. Bauer, </em>2002 MT 7, \u00b6 15, 308 Mont. 99, \u00b6 15, 39 P.3d 689, \u00b6 15. If there exists conflicting evidence, again, it is within the province of the trier of fact to resolve the conflict. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 15. We have held that \u201c[o]nly in those rare cases where the story of a witness is so inherently improbable or is so nullified by material self-contradiction that no fair-minded person could believe it may we say no firm foundation exists for the verdict based on it.\u201d <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>State v. Gaimos </em>(1916), 53 Mont. 118, 126, 162 P. 596, 599).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b619 Review of the record shows that in Kathie\u2019s Voluntary Statement to the Lewistown Police Department, she told the officers that: (1) she was afraid of Gilmore because he had previously assaulted her; (2) she had asked Gilmore to leave because he was only living in her house on a temporary basis and she did not want him living there any longer; (3) Gilmore never paid rent; (4) she did not have a key to the bedroom; and (5) upon hearing the beeping sound coming from the locked bedroom, she advised the officers to kick down the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b620 However, at the suppression hearing, Kathie recanted part of her story. She stated that, while she had advised the officers to kick down the door to the locked bedroom, the officers had actually told her to write down in her Voluntary Statement that Gilmore never paid rent. She also claimed that the statement regarding the fact that she wanted Gilmore to leave, and that she had previously asked him to leave, was incorrect. Kathie claimed that statement referred to how she previously felt about Gilmore\u2019s presence in her house and not how she felt at the time she wrote down her Voluntary Statement. She maintained that Gilmore had previously assaulted her, that she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>fearful of him, and that she did not have a key to the locked bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"AgD\">\u00b621 In addition to Kathie\u2019s testimony, the District Court received testimony from Deputy Misner and Lieutenant Rash. Both officers stated that Kathie had initially told them that some of her boyfriend\u2019s belongings were in the locked bedroom; that Kathie was afraid of Gilmore; that Kathie did not want Gilmore living at her house; that Kathie had previously asked Gilmore to leave; and that Kathie had advised them to kick down the bedroom door.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b622 In <em>State v. McLees, </em>2000 MT 6, 298 Mont. 15, 994 P.2d 683, we held that \u201cfor third-party consent to be valid as against the defendant, the consenting party must have actual authority to do so.\u201d <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 32. It was within the province of the District Court to assess both the credibility of the witnesses at the suppression hearing and the weight to be given to the witnesses\u2019 testimony. After hearing all of the testimony, the District Court found that the officers were operating under the appropriate authority-namely that Kathie had actual authority to consent to a search of the locked bedroom because her boyfriend\u2019s belongings were stored in the locked bedroom, and she was afraid of Gilmore and did not want him in her house. Here, the focus is on what Kathie told the officers at the time of their entry into the bedroom-i.e., what facts they were operating under then. While Kathie\u2019s recanted testimony at the suppression hearing paints a different picture of those statements, it was up to the District Court to resolve the conflict between what the officers said that Kathie said at the time of the entry and what, subsequently in the suppression hearing, Kathie said she said. The District Court judge, having resolved that conflict in the State\u2019s favor, we hold that, as a trespasser, Gilmore did not have an expectation of privacy in the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b623  The officers\u2019 entry into the bedroom, therefore, was lawful and the subsequent search reasonable. The District Court did not err in denying Gilmore\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b509-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b509-8\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AiN\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">\u00b625 I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">\u00b626 In <em>State v. McLees, </em>2000 MT 6, 298 Mont. 15, 994 P.2d 683, we rejected the doctrine of apparent authority whereby law enforcement officers would be allowed to rely on third parties who appear to have authority to consent to a search. In <em>McLees, </em>instead of using the principles of property law to determine authority to consent to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>search, we looked to mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">[Cjommon authority is, of course, not to be implied from the mere property interest a third party has in the property. The authority which justifies the third-party consent does not rest upon the law of property, with its attendant historical and legal refinements ... but rests rather on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\"><em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting <em>United States v. Matlock </em>(1974), 415 U.S. 164, 171 n.7, 94 S.Ct. 988, 993 n.7, 39 L.Ed.2d 242, 250 n.7).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u00b627 In <em>McLees </em>we held that the grandfather, although he owned the apartment in question, did not have actual authority to consent to the police search because he had no \u201ccommon authority\u201d over the apartment: he did not co-occupy the apartment; he had no key; and he did not enter the apartment when his son or grandson were absent.</p>\n<p id=\"At1B\">\u00b628 In the present case, the District Court found that Kathie had actual authority to consent to the search because her boyfriend\u2019s belongings were stored in the locked bedroom, and she was afraid of Gilmore and did not want him in her house. The facts that the boyfriend\u2019s belongings were stored in the bedroom and that Kathie was afraid of Gilmore do not establish that Kathie had actual authority to consent. Storage of a boyfriend\u2019s belongings and fear of the occupant have no bearing on the issue of who has authority nor do they establish that Gilmore was a \u201ctrespasser\u201d as this Court so holds. The facts that the bedroom had a separate entrance, that Gilmore had a key and Kathie did not, and that the officers had to kick down the door, clearly indicate that Kathie did not have actual authority to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\u00b629 The State failed to carry its burden of proving an exception to the requirement that searches be conducted pursuant to a warrant.
