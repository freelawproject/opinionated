On the day of trial, December 2,2002, but before voir dire proceedings began, the prosecutor moved to challenge two jurors for cause. Bearchild objected to both challenges. The District Court denied the first challenge, but granted the second challenge. On December 3,2002, the jury found Bearchild guilty of incest. Bearchild appeals from the District Court\u2019s decision to permit the State to challenge the second juror for cause prior to voir dire. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court substantially complied with the statutory procedure to ensure the fair selection of jurors when it entertained the State\u2019s challenge for cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>of a juror without an inquiry examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b63 On February 14, 2002, Bearchild was charged with sexual intercourse without consent and incest. Both charges arose from a single incident where Bearchild\u2019s step-daughter alleged he touched her inappropriately. Bearchild pleaded not guilty. A trial on the charges began December 2, 2002. Before voir dire proceedings began, Deputy County Attorney John Parker (Parker) requested the District Court to excuse panelist No. 43, Michelle Ellington (Ellington), because she previously worked in the county attorney\u2019s office as a receptionist and had access to a wide range of information relating to criminal and youth in need of care cases, both of which Bearchild had been involved in. Further, Parker had recently fired Ellington for unsatisfactory performance. Defense counsel resisted the challenge, arguing an in-court examination of Ellington was required to determine if she would be unfair to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b64 District Court Judge Neill granted Parker\u2019s request because he was concerned about even having Ellington on the jury panel because of the possibility she may have feelings or predilections for one side or the other. He also felt there was a danger of her communicating with other prospective jurors. He noted that since she was No. 43 on the venire list, it was unlikely she would ever become an active member of the jury panel. In fact, after Ellington was removed from the prospective panel, the last juror questioned during voir dire was panelist No. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u00b65 After the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Bearchild moved for a directed verdict on the sexual intercourse without consent charge, arguing there was no evidence of penetration. The District Court granted the motion and dismissed the charge. However, the jury found Bearchild guilty of incest.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\u00b66 On January 28, 2003, Bearchild was sentenced to 20 years in the Montana State Prison, five years suspended, with no possibility of parole for ten years. Bearchild now appeals from the District Court\u2019s decision to permit Parker to challenge juror Ellington for cause prior to voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">\u00b67 The District Court\u2019s decision to permit the State to challenge a juror for cause prior to a voir dire examination involves a conclusion of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>is correct. <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, \u00b6 14, 298 Mont. 358, \u00b6 14, 2 P.3d 204, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b68 Did the District Court substantially comply with the statutory procedure to ensure the fair selection of jurors when it entertained the State\u2019s challenge for cause of a juror without an inquiry examination?</p>\n<p id=\"A9eA\">\u00b69 Bearchild argues the District Court\u2019s removal of Ellington without an in-court examination constitutes structural error requiring automatic reversal. Relying heavily on our holding and discussion in <em>LaMere, </em>Bearchild contends the District Court failed to comply with the statutory jury selection procedures. He claims this error has implications for all defendants, specifically that it affects a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury and invades the fairness of the entire jury process. Bearchild points to the case of <em>State v. Blem </em>(S.D. 2000), 610 N.W.2d 803, where the South Dakota Supreme Court reversed a trial court\u2019s decision granting a prosecutor\u2019s request to remove two jurors prior to voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b610 The State argues the test for structural error was not met in this case and that Bearchild failed to establish presumptive prejudice as required by <em>State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, \u00b6 59, 309 Mont. 113, \u00b6 59, 43 P.3d 948, \u00b6 59. Although the State does not dispute there may have been a technical violation of the jury selection statutes, it argues the District Court\u2019s removal of Ellington was harmless because the composition of the jury was not affected and Ellington would never have served on the jury in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">A. Jury Selection Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">\u00b611 Section 46-16-115, MCA, governs challenges for cause. It permits the challenge of a juror having a state of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party. Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. Further, the statute provides that a judge may grant a challenge for cause for any reason the court determines. Section 46-16-115(2), MCA. The statute provides that \u201ceach challenge must be tried by the court.\u201d Section 46-16-115(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">\u00b612 Under the federal jury selection statutes, it is permissible for a court to exclude a juror for hardship or bias prior to voir dire. <em>United States v. Contreras </em>(10th Cir. 1997), 108 F.3d 1255, 1269. In <em>Contreras, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">[W]e are aware of no authority holding a defendant\u2019s right to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>impartial jury is violated per se by the pre-voir dire excusal of jurors. In fact, the Jury Selection and Service Act indicates the district court may properly exclude summoned jurors prior to voir dire based on hardship or bias. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1866(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABI5\"><em>Contreras, </em>108 F.3d at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b613 Other Circuit Courts of Appeals have deemed certain pre-voir dire dismissals proper. <em>See e.g. United States v. North </em>(D.C. Cir. 1990), 910 F.2d 843, 909-10 (prevoir dire excusal of jurors for cause not erroneous), <em>superseded in part on other grounds, </em>920 F.2d 940 (D.C. Cir. 1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>500 U.S. 941 (1991); <em>United States v. Parodies </em>(11th Cir. 1996), 98 F.3d 1266, 1279-80 (district court did not commit \u201csubstantial violation\u201d of the federal Jury Selection Act by excusing jurors <em>sua sponte </em>prior to voir dire based solely on their answers to juror questionnaires).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b614  We conclude the District Court erred when it excused the jurors for cause before voir dire. Our statutes are fairly explicit as to the need for an in-court examination of the juror when considering a challenge for cause. Section 46-16-115(1), MCA, specifically provides that a challenge for cause must be tried by the court. There was no \u201ctrial\u201d when the court considered the challenges prior to voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">B. Substantial Compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u00b615 While it is true statutory jury selection procedures are designed to protect against violations of the underlying constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury, <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 65, not every violation of the statutory process governing the formation of a trial jury results in reversal. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 55. Technical departures from the jury selection statutes and violations which do not threaten the goals of random selection and objective disqualification do not constitute a substantial failure to comply. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 58. Thus, we require a \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the statutory procedures to ensure the right to an impartial jury will remain inviolate for all. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">\u00b616 In <em>LaMere, </em>a Native American defendant appealed a district court\u2019s denial of a pre-trial motion to strike the entire jury panel, on the basis that telephone summoning of jurors by the court clerk constituted a substantial failure to comply with statutory jury panel selection procedures. We held the failure to summon jurors by mailing or personally serving prospective jurors with written jury summons constituted failure to substantially comply with the statute, and was structural error affecting the essential fairness of the trial, resulting in per se reversible error. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">\u00b617 We stated that a material failure to substantially comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Montana statutes governing the procurement of a trial jury cannot be treated as harmless error because: (1) such an error precedes the presentation of any evidence to the jury, and cannot be analyzed as mere trial error without resorting to speculation; (2) such an error, because it precedes the trial process, cannot be quantitatively assessed for its prejudicial impact relative to the evidence introduced at trial; (3) such an error, being other than an error in the trial process, affects the very framework within which the trial proceeds; and (4) the impartiality of the jury goes to the very integrity of our justice system, and the right to an impartial jury is so essential to our conception of a fair trial that its violation cannot be considered harmless error. <em>LaMej\u2019e, </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b618 Further, in <em>Good, </em>we reiterated that structural error occurs when there is a material failure to substantially comply with statutes governing the procurement of a trial jury. <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 60. We even went as far as to say that \u201c[e]rrors involving jury selection indelibly affect the fairness of the trial since the errors precede the trial.\u201d <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 60 (citation omitted). However, in <em>Good, </em>we were reviewing the district court\u2019s discretion in denying a defendant\u2019s challenges for cause. It is important to point out this Court is not reviewing the merits of the State\u2019s challenge for cause-only the District Court\u2019s decision to entertain the challenge prior to voir dire proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b6 19  A material failure to substantially comply with Montana\u2019s jury selection statutes does result in structural error requiring reversal. <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 60; <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 75. Unlike in <em>LaMere, </em>however, the District Court\u2019s error was not a material failure to substantially comply with Montana\u2019s statutes governing the procurement of a trial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b620 The entire jury pool was affected by the error in <em>LaMere. </em>Every member of the jury pool was contacted by telephone, thus excluding an entire class of people who did not own a telephone. We stated that the impact of this type of violation on the trial process, \u201ccannot be discerned from the record\u201d and is so \u201cpurely speculative\u201d that prejudice to the defendant is presumed. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 41 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\u00b621  Here, however, Bearchild is not challenging the cross-sectional composition of the jury. In truth, he is not even challenging the impartiality of the jury. Bearchild is, in essence, challenging a specific juror. Although a defendant is entitled to an impartial jury, he has no right to a particular juror. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 37 (citing <em>State v. Gollehon </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 1, 11, 864 P.2d 249, 255; <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 142, 146, 542 P.2d 100, 102; <em>Tribby v. Northwestern Bank of Great Falls </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 196, 208, 704 P.2d 409, 416).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>\u00b622 Even though it occurred prior to trial, the impact of Ellington\u2019s dismissal can be discerned from the record. The outcome of Bearchild\u2019s trial would be the same regardless of Ellington\u2019s dismissal, because as No. 43 on the venire, she never would have served on the jury in any event. In contrast to <em>LaMere, </em>the error in this case can be isolated and assessed for its prejudicial impact; Ellington\u2019s dismissal did not affect Bearchild\u2019s right to an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b623  Thus, while the District Court committed error in excusing the jurors for cause prior to voir dire, its action was not a material failure to substantially comply with Montana\u2019s statutes governing the procurement of a trial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">C. Harmless Error.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b624 If the district court substantially complies with the Montana statutes regarding jury procurement, then the error is not structural. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 47-50; <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 60. If the error is not structural, harmful error review applies. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Good, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 60-61. Montana\u2019s harmful error statute provides that \u201c[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d Section 46-20-701(2), MCA. While harmless error generally occurs during the actual trial, <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 41, and is often referred to as \u201ctrial error,\u201d <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 61, it also applies to \u201ctechnical or immaterial violations\u201d of the statutory jury selection scheme. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 60-61. Prejudice will not be presumed where the record shows the district court\u2019s error affected neither the constitutional or jurisdictional rights of the defendant, and the defendant on appeal has failed to demonstrate prejudice to his substantial rights resulting from the error. <em>State v. Austad </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 70, 87, 641 P.2d 1373, 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b625  Bearchild cannot demonstrate prejudice to his right to an impartial jury based on the District Court\u2019s error because even if Ellington had not been dismissed prior to the voir dire proceedings, she never would have sat on Bearchild\u2019s jury because the last juror empaneled was juror No. 36 and Ellington was juror No. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">D. <em>South Dakota v. Blem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">\u00b626 Bearchild\u2019s reliance on <em>Blem </em>is misguided. In <em>Blem., </em>the prosecution sent a letter to the trial court and to Blem\u2019s attorney requesting it remove two potential jurors. Blem\u2019s attorney objected to their removal. At a motions hearing, both sides argued the removal of the jurors to the trial court. The judge dismissed the two jurors. On appeal, Blem argued the statutory jury selection process was violated and that he was denied an opportunity to determine if the jurors were biased. The South Dakota Supreme Court adopted our rationale in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>LaMere </em>and held the removal of the two jurors was a substantial failure to comply with the jury selection statutes. <em>Blem, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b627 While we agree with the <em>Blem </em>court that removal of potential jurors for cause should occur after voir dire, we disagree that failure to do this constitutes structural error. The <em>LaMere </em>rationale applies to structural errors, those that cannot be assessed for their prejudicial impact without speculation. Ellington\u2019s dismissal did not affect the entire jury pool. The impact of her dismissal can be assessed without speculation, as she never would have served on Bearchild\u2019s jury in any event. The <em>Blem </em>court never reached this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b628  In sum, we hold the District Court erred when it permitted juror Ellington to be removed from the venire without a proper in-court examination to determine actual bias. However, because the District Court substantially complied with the jury selection statutes, we find this error to be subject to harmless error review. Bearchild did not prove he was prejudiced by this error, and therefore the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b629 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b462-7\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b462-8\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"ADr-\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">\u00b630 I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">\u00b631 The Court concedes that the District Court committed error when it excused the jurors for cause prior to voir dire and without the in-court examination or \u201ctrial\u201d as required by \u00a7 46-16-115(1), MCA. The Court concludes, however, that the error did not amount to a \u201cmaterial failure to substantially comply\u201d with statutory procedures, and, thus, the Court engages in a harmless error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">\u00b632 The Court purports to distinguish the decision in <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, 298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204, where we held that the failure to summon jurors by mailing or personally serving prospective jurors with written jury summons constituted a material failure to substantially comply with the jury selection statutes. However, in focusing on the fact that the juror in question was panelist #43 and was thus \u201cimmaterial\u201d or of no consequence to the jury as empaneled, the Court ignores the analytical principles established in <em>LaMere.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">\u00b633 In <em>LaMere </em>we held that the \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d standard is designed to \u201cprotect the random nature and objectivity of the jury selection process.\u201d <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 57. \u201cIn turn, technical violations-even numerous such violations-that do not frustrate these goals or result in discrimination and arbitrariness do not constitute a substantial failure to comply.\u201d <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 58. To be substantial deviation, the departure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>must be \u201ca material one.\u201d <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b634 In light of the above principles, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">Therefore, if the statutory violation is \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cmateriaF-viewed in terms of the underlying principles of ensuring that jury venires are selected randomly and on the basis of objective criteria-then it cannot be considered non-prejudicial to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-6\"><em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u00b635 Importantly, for purposes of this case, we went on in <em>LaMere </em>to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">A departure from the statutory scheme that directly or materially affects the random nature or objectivity of the jury selection process establishes a substantial violation <em>independently of the departure\u2019s consequences in an individual case. </em>Conversely, a mere \u201ctechnical\u201d or \u201cimmaterial\u201d violation-one that does not undermine the objective procedures designed to produce a jury venire consisting of a fair cross-section of the community-constitutes non-prejudicial error under the substantial compliance standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-9\"><em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 60 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">\u00b636 Here, the departure from the statutory scheme consists in excusing a panel member without the requisite \u201ctrial\u201d by the court. Thus, the question is, does the excusing of a panel member without trial by the court materially affect the objectivity of the jury selection process? Under <em>LaMere, </em>this question must be answered independently of the departure\u2019s consequences (or lack thereof) in this particular case. Clearly, the excusing of prospective jurors at the behest of a litigant, without a statutorily required \u201ctrial\u201d by the court \u201cmaterially affects\u201d the objectivity of determining juror disqualification. The error was thus structural in nature, and the Court should not have adopted a harmless error rationale.</p>\n<judges id=\"b463-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and JUSTICE NELSON join in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
