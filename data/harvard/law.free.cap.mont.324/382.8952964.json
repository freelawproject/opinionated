Horton (Robert) appeals various findings and conclusions included in the Dissolution Decree issued by the Montana Twentieth Judicial District Court on April 23,2003. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">\u00b62 The issue before the Court is whether the District Court erred in its distribution and valuation of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">\u00b63 Tammy Horton (Tammy) and Robert were married on August 21, 1993. They have lived in Montana since their marriage. The couple have two children, Garrett, born January 5, 1995, and Demi, born November 21, 1997. The parties separated in January 2002 and a Petition for Dissolution was filed on May 8, 2002. Tammy and Robert have entered into a court-approved Parenting Plan, the terms and conditions of which are not a part of this appeal. A trial was held on March 24, 2003. The District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decree on April 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">\u00b64 In the Decree, the court distributed the marital property in a manner that resulted in each party receiving a net distribution totaling $72,960.00. Robert\u2019s distribution consisted of a 1991 Ford Explorer, his guns, his retirement/IRA account and life insurance policy, a 1993 Ford pickup truck, his mounts, miscellaneous premarital property which also included guns, and personal property in his possession. Tammy was also required to make an equalization payment to Robert of $32,640.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">\u00b65 Tammy\u2019s property distribution included six horses, her tack, her mounts, her \u201chorse business,\u201d the horse trailer, the computer and accessories, her personal property in her possession, and specified premarital property. It also included the marital home, the value of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>was agreed upon by Tammy and Robert to be $200,000. Tammy assumed a mortgage of $40,000, which reduced the value allocated to her to $160,000. The court then farther reduced the value of the home allocated to Tammy by $80,000. This was done based upon the testimony of Tammy and her father that her father had gifted to her home building labor and materials valued at $80,000. Reduced by the mortgage and the gift, Tammy\u2019s allocated value of the marital home was therefore $80,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b66 Robert challenges the $80,000 \u201cgift\u201d reduction from the home\u2019s value. He also maintains that the court erred by including the value of his guns under both the pre-marital property and marital property calculations, and by undervaluing Tammy\u2019s tack. Lastly, he argues that the court entered erroneous findings regarding the income of the parties and that because such erroneous income figures were used to support the court\u2019s property distribution, the property distribution was farther flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact regarding a division of marital assets to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. Findings are clearly erroneous if: (1) they are not supported by substantial evidence; (2) the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence; or (3) the district court made a mistake. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the conclusions are correct. We will affirm a district court\u2019s division of property, absent clearly erroneous findings, unless we identify an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Bartsch, </em>2004 MT 99, \u00b6 13, 321 Mont. 28, \u00b6 13, 88 P.3d 1263, \u00b6 13 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\u00b68 We first address Robert\u2019s claim that the court\u2019s reduction of the value of the marital home by $80,000 was arbitrary, prejudicial, and unsupported by the record. Robert maintains that Tammy failed to meet her burden of establishing that her father had actually \u201cgifted\u201d to her his contracting services and home building materials worth $80,000. He also asserts that the District Court erroneously neglected to consider his contribution to the marital residence when it decided how much of the gift to exclude from the marital estate and attribute to Tammy personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">\u00b69 Tammy and Robert bought property in Sanders County shortly after their marriage. It is undisputed that they paid $12,000 for the property. They began construction of their home in the mid-nineties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>During construction, many friends and family members assisted in projects related to the home-building. Many of these people testified at trial that Tammy\u2019s father, an experienced log home builder, donated substantial time over one to two years working on the house. Also, Tammy testified that, while she was in high school, her father told all of his children that in lieu of a college education, he would build them each a house. She and her father viewed the effort, as well as the materials he donated to the project, as the gift he had previously promised Tammy. Robert maintains that he knew nothing of this \u201cgift\u201d until divorce proceedings were underway.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b610 Section 40-4-202, MCA, describes how property should be divided upon a marriage\u2019s dissolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">(1) In a proceeding for dissolution of a marriage, ... the court ... shall... equitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both, however and whenever acquired and whether the title thereto is in the name of the husband or wife or both....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">In dividing... property acquired by gift... the court shall consider those contributions of the other spouse to the marriage, including</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">(a) the nonmonetary contribution of a homemaker; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">(b) the extent to which such contributions have facilitated the maintenance of this property....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">\u00b611  As we have indicated in the past, this statute vests the district court with broad discretion to apportion a marital estate in a manner which is equitable to each party under the specific circumstances. <em>In re Marriage of Binsfield </em>(1995), 269 Mont. 336, 888 P.2d 889. Furthermore, in non-jury cases, such as this one, the district court judge is charged with listening to and weighing the evidence presented. The judge must determine the credibility of each witness based upon his or her demeanor, temperament, attitude, and candor, among other things. For these reasons, this Court defers to the district court\u2019s discretion in matters of evidence weight and credibility, particularly when conflicting evidence is presented. <em>In re Marriage of Grende, </em>2004 MT 36, \u00b6 27, 320 Mont. 38, \u00b6 27, 85 P.3d 788, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">\u00b612 Robert asserts that the record is void of \u201cany evidence\u201d that would tend to establish that Tamm/s father gifted to her labor and materials valued at $80,000. This is incorrect. Rather, there was conflicting evidence. Some witnesses claimed they did not believe that such a gift was given, while others claimed they did not know whether such a gift was made. However, the fact that some witnesses did not know of the arrangement between Tammy and her father does not necessarily doom it to non-existence. Tammy and her father both testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>had promised, years earlier, to build a home for Tammy and his other children. By the time he began working on Tammy\u2019s home, he had already fulfilled this promise for his oldest child. Tammy\u2019s father also testified that he would not have done this for Robert; he intended his gift of labor and materials for his daughter. The District Court concluded that, based on the totality of evidence, Tammy had met her burden and established that her father had given to her his time, labor and some materials in the building of her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b613 Robert also argues that the \u201cgift\u201d is not traceable because Tammy\u2019s father kept no records of the value of the gift and thus it is commingled into the entire house and cannot be separated. Unlike in <em>In re Marriage of Herron </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 396, 608 P.2d 97, traceability in this case is not a complex notion. In <em>Herron, </em>the court had to trace an initial gift from 1962 to 1979 and across several residential home purchases, sales, and cross-country moves. Here, there is a single gift embedded into the total value of one home. Upon a finding of the existence of the gift from a non-marital source, i.e., Tammy\u2019s father, there is essentially nothing to \u201ctrace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b614 Robert also relies on <em>In re Marriage of Steinbeisser, </em>2002 MT 309, 313 Mont. 74, 60 P.3d 441, which we conclude is distinguishable from the case at bar. In <em>Steinbeisser, </em>there was a protracted pattern of commingling and expenditure of inherited funds, making it impossible to trace the money and its eventual dissipation. Such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b615 Lastly, we are unpersuaded by Robert\u2019s argument that the entire gift should be considered marital property because the value of the gift was commingled and cannot be separated from the value of the house as a whole. Commingling of a gift with jointly-owned marital property does not automatically preclude the gift from being considered separate property. <em>See In re Marriage of Engen, </em>1998 MT 153, 289 Mont. 299, 961 P.2d 738 (Proceeds from the sale of a home given to husband by his mother, deposited into couple\u2019s joint checking account and used to purchase a condominium were held to be separate property of the husband upon dissolution of the marriage); <em>Herron, </em>186 Mont. at 404, 608 P.2d at 102 (Property gifted to both parties by wife\u2019s father and held jointly as and commingled with marital property should not be distributed equally to the parties because the wife\u2019s father had given the properties to provide for his daughter). See also <em>Siefke v. Siefke, </em>2000 MT 281, 302 Mont. 167, 13 P.3d 937. Upon determining an accurate value for the gift from Tammy\u2019s father, and complying with the requirements of \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA., the District Court may attribute all or some of that value to Tammy as separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>property despite the commingling.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b616 We next turn to the Court\u2019s valuation of the gift. Tammy\u2019s father did not keep records of the value of the materials and time he provided. At trial, he accepted Tammy\u2019s estimate that his time, materials and services had an $80,000 value. In an effort to establish a fair value for the services and materials her father provided, Tammy obtained quotes, in 2002, from various log home builders and calculated an average cost of $80,000 for materials and construction of all or a part of a log home. Additionally, a full-time assistant to Tammy\u2019s father, who also worked on Tammy\u2019s house, testified to his belief that the value of Tammy\u2019s father\u2019s labor alone would be $80,000. In short, there was some testimony to support the $80,000 value assigned to Tammy\u2019s father\u2019s contributions; the problem is that it is vague and inherently conflicting. This problem is compounded by the fact that we are unable to mathematically reconcile the District Court\u2019s $80,000 valuation of that gift with the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b617 As stated above, the parties agree that the value of the property at the time of dissolution was $200,000. Also, the parties agreed that they paid $12,000 for the property. Furthermore, Robert submitted to the court a \u201cConstruction Cost Breakdown\u201d presented to Glacier Bank in conjunction with a home building loan. This document projected the cost of property, labor and materials for the home to be in the range of $160,000. Given the parties\u2019 general agreement on the value of the home and the cost of building it exclusive of Tammy\u2019s father\u2019s contributions, the assignment of an $80,000 value to Tammy\u2019s father\u2019s contribution simply doesn\u2019t add up. Therefore, we must remand this matter to the District Court for a reassessment of the gift value and redistribution of property in accordance with this reassessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b618  Robert further claims that the District Court failed to consider his contributions to the marital residence and real property in dividing the real property. There was testimony regarding Robert\u2019s contribution to the building of the home, as well as to the improvements, <em>i.e., </em>barn, corral, fencing, which were built after the house was finished. There was also testimony regarding Tammy\u2019s substantial contribution to the family and the building of the house. Robert claims that the District Court failed to consider his contributions. A more accurate statement is that the District Court failed to include specific findings relating to this issue in its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decree. As we have stated on numerous occasions, \u201c[wjhile articulation of [the] factors [in \u00a7 40-2-202, MCA] is encouraged, the absence of specific findings does not automatically warrant remand.\u201d Rather, we look to determine if substantial evidence exists to support the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>findings. <em>In re Marriage of Mouat </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 430, 743 P.2d 602. Here, the court was presented with evidence as to both parties\u2019 substantial contributions to the maintenance and total value of this property. Sufficient evidence was presented to support the court\u2019s conclusion that the contributions of both parties was fairly equivalent. As such, it was unnecessary that the District Court offset the value of Tammy\u2019s father\u2019s gift to reflect Robert\u2019s contributions to the property. \u00b619 Next, Robert argues that the District Court erred in valuing the marital estate. He complains of the values assigned to his guns and Tammy\u2019s equestrian tack. Conflicting evidence was presented by the parties and other witnesses as to the value of these items. As we have frequently held, the district court is in the best position to observe and judge witness credibility, therefore, \u201cwe will not second guess the district court\u2019s determination regarding the strength and weight of conflicting testimony.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Mease, </em>2004 MT 59, \u00b6 50, 320 Mont. 229, \u00b6 50, 92 P.3d 1148, \u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b620  Lastly, Robert maintains that the District Court erred in its findings regarding the income of the parties. The District Court noted in its Decree that \u201cboth parties did an incomplete and poor job of stating Income and Deductions.\u201d The court, therefore, used its discretion to assign a reasonable income to both parties based upon the evidence presented. We conclude that the court\u2019s decision was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b621 Based on the foregoing, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Tammy\u2019s father made a gift to her of labor and materials in the construction of the family home. However, in light of the conflicting evidence on valuation, as set forth above, we reverse the District Court\u2019s attribution of $80,000 to the value of the gift. We remand for a reassessment of the value of this gift and redistribution of the marital estate accordingly. With the exception of those Findings and Conclusions relating to valuation of the gift and the resulting distribution of the marital property, we affirm the remainder of the District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decree.</p>\n<judges id=\"b408-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b408-8\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"AbD\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\u00b622 I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">\u00b623 The Court finds the evidence sufficient to establish that part of the house was gifted to Tammy by her father. However, the Court concluded that evidence was insufficient to establish its value. I agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>that the evidence of the amount of the gift was not a full detailed appraisal. However, Tammy did research by going to four separate log home builders to obtain pricing information. Estimates were admitted into evidence. She did inform herself and testify as to what the value of the gift was. Her witnesses did confirm an estimate of such value.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq3\">\u00b624 There was disputed testimony concerning how much material and labor Tammy\u2019s father put into the house. The District Court obviously believed the evidence Tammy presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b625 Robert insisted that there was no gift at all. While he presented evidence that there was no gift, and said that Tammy\u2019s father did not donate all that he said he did, Robert presented no evidence that the gift was worthless, or less than the $80,000 Tammy claimed. Therefore, I conclude that the District Court did not err when it found the value of the gift based on evidence that was unimpeached and sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b626 As the Court concluded, the parties agreed that the land, house and grounds had a value of $200,000. The District Court found there was a debt on the house of $40,000, that $80,000 of its value was a gift to Tammy and that the remaining $80,000 was to be divided between the parties. The District Court\u2019s figures add up. For some reason, the Court is concerned about the figures on an exhibit entitled Construction Cost Breakdown introduced into evidence by counsel for Robert during his cross-examination of Tammy. This exhibit is as follows: [Publisher\u2019s Note: See end of document for exhibit.]</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b627 Tammy knew nothing about the exhibit, other than it had been submitted to the bank. She did not know when. She pointed out that the exhibit was inaccurate and stated it was probably just a proposal. At no time did Robert, or anyone else, testify this exhibit represented $159,950 in costs and labor, in addition to the $12,000 paid for the land. Robert\u2019s counsel\u2019s statement, in his reply brief, that such is the case is a misrepresentation. Likewise, counsel\u2019s representation in his proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law filed with the District Court, that Robert testified this exhibit reflected an accurate breakdown of the home\u2019s construction costs, is not supported by the record. Robert did not dispute at trial Tammy\u2019s testimony that the cost of the land was doubled in this exhibit, $24,000 and not the $12,000 actually paid. Nor did he dispute her testimony that labor had been marked \u201cpaid\u201d and was not included in any cost estimate. The exhibit itself is undated, but says \u201cTotal paid to date $65,700.\u201d Then, it appears that the proposal is for another $128,750 in material and $31,200 in labor. Of course, the total of these amounts is $225,650, which is more than the parties themselves agreed the property is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>worth. Further, there is no way to evaluate the labor that was somehow already paid for. This exhibit cannot be used to add up anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b628 The District Court believed Tammy\u2019s documentary evidence and testimony that the value of the gift from her father to her was $80,000, and so found. This finding is supported by substantial evidence, is essentially uncontroverted, and is not clearly erroneous. I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to remand this action for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b410-5\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
