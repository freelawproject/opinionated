Did the District Court err in granting Gentry\u2019s motion for summary judgment, thereby voiding McDonald\u2019s Judgment and Quiet Title Decree?</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in finding that Gentry had a continuing right of redemption?</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in denying McDonald\u2019s Motion to Compel and in granting Gentry\u2019s Motion for a Protective Order?</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">\u00b66 Gentry purchased Spotted Bear Ranch, an outfitting business, described as improvement number 226, and located on Forest Service Land, S17, T25, R15 (the Property). Gentry has operated this business since 1994 by way of a special use permit granted to it by the United States Forest Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">\u00b67 In 1998, Flathead County assessed taxes on the Property. These taxes went delinquent and the Property went up for tax sale. Flathead County became the purchaser of the Property when nobody purchased the tax lien. However, McDonald, thereafter paid Flathead County the delinquent tax amount and was assigned Flathead County\u2019s interest in the Property in April 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-16\">\u00b68 In May 1998, McDonald published notice that a tax deed may issue, listing Flathead County as the purchaser and himself as the assignee. Notice was sent to Wildlife Development Federation of North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>America (Wildlife), the record property owner, but not to Gentry, the occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\">\u00b69 In August 1998, Flathead County issued McDonald a tax deed to the Property, as nobody responded to McDonald\u2019s previous notice. Thereafter, McDonald moved to quiet the title, naming Wildlife as a defendant. Service on Wildlife proved unsuccessful, so McDonald also published notice in Flathead County\u2019s newspaper, the <em>Daily Interlake, </em>regarding his motion to quiet the title to the Property. Again nobody responded, default was taken, and the District Court in August 1999 found that McDonald was entitled to quiet enjoyment of the Property. A decree was entered stating that McDonald was the owner in fee simple on August 6, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b610 Gentry, claiming that it had not received notice as the current occupant of the Property, thereafter moved to void this decree. McDonald, in response, moved to compel discovery so as to defend Gentry\u2019s other motion seeking a protective order. The District Court granted Gentry\u2019s Motion for a Protective Order, thereby halting the discovery process pending its determination of Gentry\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Ultimately, the District Court granted Gentry\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and voided McDonald\u2019s quiet title decree, on the basis that Gentry was not given notice as required under \u00a7 15-18-212, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b611 McDonald now appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment. Additional facts will be discussed as they become applicable in the following analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo. Cole ex rel. Revocable Trust v. Cole, </em>2003 MT 229, \u00b6 8, 317 Mont. 197, \u00b6 8, 75 P.3d 1280, \u00b6 8. The movant must prove that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once the movant demonstrates this, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to prove that a genuine issue of material fact does exist. After a district court determines that no genuine issues of material fact exist, the district court must then determine whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Cole, </em>\u00b6 8. We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions for correctness. <em>Cole, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">\u00b613 1. Did the District Court err in granting Gentry\u2019s motion for summary judgment, thereby voiding McDonald\u2019s Judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>and Quiet Title Decree?</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b614 Both McDonald and Gentry argue separately issues that we believe are best addressed under the one issue of whether the District Court erred in granting Gentry\u2019s motion for summary judgment. However we set out their respective arguments in the following analysis as each was presented separately in their respective briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Genuine Issues of Material Fact</p>\n<p id=\"A0s\">\u00b615 McDonald argues that several genuine issues of material fact remained at the time the District Court granted Gentry\u2019s motion for summary judgment. According to McDonald, these issues include: (1) Gentry\u2019s status as an owner of the Property and an occupant of the Property; (2) the existence of a street address or other known address for the Property; and (3) McDonald\u2019s diligence regarding his inquiry about the owner of the Property. Because these issues remain, McDonald argues that the District Court erred in granting Gentry\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b616 Gentry argues that McDonald cannot determine whether Gentry is or is not an occupant on the Property. In support of its argument, Gentry directs this Court to McDonald\u2019s admission that Gentry purchased the Property and has been operating the ranch since 1994. Yet, given this admission, McDonald denied that Gentry occupied the Property. These \u201ctransparent contradictions,\u201d Gentry argues, do not create genuine issues of material fact, just as the District Court found. In addition, Gentry argues that the street address for the Property \u201cwas not and is not a fact issue,\u201d as McDonald raises this issue for the first time now on appeal. Also, Gentry argues that under Rule 4D of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, evidence of diligence is not required and no such evidence was presented to the court regarding this issue. Hence, Gentry argues, that the District Court did not err in finding that no genuine issues of material fact existed and, thereby, in granting Gentry summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">\u00b617 McDonald maintains that Gentry was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law because: (1) the assignment certificate and accompanying notice complied with \u00a7 15-17-323, MCA ; (2) the published and mailed notices complied with \u00a7 15-18-212, MCA; (3) the proof of notice complied with \u00a7 15-18-212(7), MCA, and \u00a7 15-18-216, MCA; and (4) the tax deed satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 15-18-211, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">\u00b618 Gentry responds that McDonald simply failed to notify Gentry, as the current occupant of the Property, as required by \u00a7 15-18-212, MCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>And, as such, Gentry argues that whatever notices McDonald did serve were deficient and the tax deed issued to him is therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Voiding of McDonald\u2019s Judgment and Quiet Title Decree</p>\n<p id=\"A94\">\u00b619 McDonald first notes that the redemption period for tax sales \u201cexpires either three years after the first day of the tax sale, or sixty days after giving notice that a tax deed may issue, whichever is later.\u201d As such, McDonald argues that Gentry\u2019s right of redemption expired on July 17, 1998, and the District Court erred in concluding that Gentry had a continuing right to redeem. In addition, McDonald argues that the requisite notices he filed comported with statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b620 Gentry argues that McDonald neither notified the occupant of the Property regarding the fact that a tax deed may issue, nor did he file the proper proof of notice regarding the same. As such, Gentry contends that the District Court was correct in concluding that the notices and proof of notice were deficient and the tax deed was void.</p>\n<p id=\"AG3\">\u00b621 Before we address the issue of whether the District Court erred in granting Gentry\u2019s motion for summary judgment, we must first address whether McDonald was mandated by statute to give Gentry notice initially.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b622 Section 15-18-212(l)(a), MCA, states that notice must be given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVe\">for each property for which there has been issued to the county a tax sale certificate or for which the county is otherwise listed as the purchaser or assignee, the county clerk shall <em>notify all persons considered interested parties in the property and the current occupant of the property, </em>if any, that a tax deed may be issued to the county unless the property tax lien is redeemed prior to the expiration date of the redemption period. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\u00b623 Whereas, \u00a7 15-18-212(l)(b), MCA, states that notice must be given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">for each property for which there has been issued a tax sale certificate to a purchaser other than the county or for which an assignment has been made, the purchaser or assignee, as appropriate, shall <em>notify all persons considered interested parties in the property, </em>if any, that a tax deed will be issued to the purchaser or assignee unless the property tax lien is redeemed prior to the expiration date of the redemption period. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">\u00b624 However, \u00a7 15-18-212(4), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\"><em>The notice required under subsectionO (1) </em>... <em>must be made by certified mail, </em>return receipt requested, <em>to each interested party </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>and the current occupant, </em>if any, of the property. The address to which the notice must be sent is, for each interested party, the address disclosed by the records in the office of the county clerk and, for the occupant, the street address or other known address of the subject property. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b625  Flathead County assigned its right to the Property to McDonald. As such, \u00a7 15-18-212(l)(b), MCA, applies. Interestingly, that section does not require notice to be given to current occupants, although that language appears in subsection (l)(a). However, regardless of this discrepancy, we note here that \u00a7 15-18-212(4), MCA, states both clearly and explicitly that the notice required under subsection (l)-inclusive of subsections (a) and (b)-must be made to each interested party and the current occupant. Further, we have held that \u201c[e]very essential and material step required by the tax deed statutes must be strictly followed,\u201d given that an owner risks losing his or her property for a \u201cmere pittance,\u201d should these statutes not be followed strictly. <em>Moran v. Robbin </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 478, 482-83, 863 P.2d 395, 397-98. To that end, we conclude that McDonald was mandated by statute to give Gentry notice. We proceed with our analysis of that notice on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b626 Again, \u00a7 15-18-212(4), MCA, states that notice must be given to the current occupant of the property by certified mail, with the notice being sent to the occupant at the street address or other known address for the subject property. While McDonald argues that both Gentry\u2019s status as the current occupant of the Property and the address of the Property are questions of material fact, the District Court found to the contrary. Indeed, the District Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">Defendant [McDonald] does not deny that he failed to notify the occupant of the property, but offers excuses as to why he didn\u2019t. Defendant suggests that somehow Plaintiff [Gentry] was not the property occupant, although that fact is not in dispute. Defendant suggests that there is no street address for Spotted Bear Ranch, thus notice couldn\u2019t have been mailed and that notice via general delivery would be ineffective. None of these are statutory excuses. There was no attempt to notify the occupant which the statute requires, whether effective or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u00b627 Review of the records shows that in McDonald\u2019s Answer to Gentry\u2019s Complaint, McDonald admitted that: (1) \u201cin December 1994, Plaintiff [Gentry] purchased an outfitting business;\u201d (2) \u201cPlaintiff has continued to operate the outfitting business from 1994 through the date of its [Gentry\u2019s] Complaint;\u201d and (3) Plaintiff has acquired and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>maintained a special use permit. Even more telling is McDonald\u2019s answer to the following allegation, as articulated in Gentry\u2019s Complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-3\">3. Flathead County assessed property taxes upon the buildings and improvements of Spotted Bear Ranch, described as \u201cimprovement number 226 on Forest Service land, located in S17, T25, R15 Flathead County, Montana.\u201d Plaintiff [Gentry] did not receive any notice of tax assessment nor of taxes due. These taxes therefore went delinquent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b628 In response to Gentry\u2019s above-quoted allegation, McDonald stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7i\">3. In response to Paragraph 3 of Plaintiffs Complaint on file herein <em>McDonald admits that Flathead County assessed the taxes as alleged in Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint </em>but denies that Plaintiff did not receive notice of the assessment and further denies that this was the reason the taxes went delinquent. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b629 As is evident from the above-quoted language, the District Court was correct in finding that Gentry\u2019s status as the occupant of the Property was \u201cnot in dispute.\u201d McDonald admitted that he was aware that Gentry had been and currently was operating an outfitting business. McDonald also admitted that he was aware that Flathead County had assessed taxes as alleged in Gentry\u2019s Complaint, namely that \u201cFlathead County assessed property taxes upon the buildings and improvements of Spotted Bear Ranch,\u201d located on Forest Service Land in S17, T25, R15 of Flathead County.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b630  Under \u00a7 15-18-212(4), MCA, McDonald was mandated to give notice to Gentry, as the current occupant of the Property, that a tax deed may issue. McDonald admittedly knew that Gentry was the occupant and where Gentry was located, and McDonald simply did not provide the requisite notice. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court was correct in voiding McDonald\u2019s quiet title decree and in granting Gentry summary judgment, as no genuine issues of material fact existed and Gentry was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"AAu\">\u00b631 2. Did the District Court err in finding that Gentry had a continuing right of redemption?</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b632 McDonald argues that because the tax deed was executed and issued to him on August 18, 1998-more than three years after the applicable tax sale on July 11, 1995-his title to the Property became absolute on August 18, 1998. And, as such, McDonald argues that Gentry\u2019s time to redeem expired, as Gentry \u201cno longer had standing to challenge the tax deed on the basis of an alleged error in the deed itself....\u201d Therefore, McDonald argues that with no right of redemption, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Gentry\u2019s claim to title of the Property also expired, and Gentry could not invalidate the tax deed because he could not quiet title.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b633 Gentry first argues that this Court should not address McDonald\u2019s arguments regarding the quiet title decree, as he raises his arguments now for the first time on appeal. In the alternative, Gentry argues that \u201ceven as an occupant or unrecorded \u2018interest holder,\u2019 \u201d it had a right of redemption, as the right of redemption \u201ccontinues indefinitely until proper notice is given.\u201d In addition, Gentry argues that McDonald\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 15-18-413, MCA, \u201cas an absolute cure\u201d is misplaced, given that this Court previously noted in <em>Hudson v. McDonald </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 426, 747 P.2d 221, that \u201c[t]he focus of this appeal is the propriety of the procedure <em>before </em>the issuance of the tax deed, not after. A curative statute cannot validate a void tax deed.\u201d Further, Gentry argues that McDonald\u2019s affidavit for published summons was inadequate under Rule 4(D)(5)(c) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure because McDonald did not conduct a diligent search for all persons claiming title. Therefore, Gentry argues that the District Court \u201ccorrectly concluded that the quiet title court lacked jurisdiction and the prior quiet title decree was void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b634  We have held that a county is without jurisdiction to issue a tax deed if the statutory requirements for notice that a tax deed may issue are not followed. <em>Moran, </em>261 Mont. at 483, 863 P.2d at 398. Hence, because we hold that the District Court was correct in voiding McDonald\u2019s quiet title decree given that Gentry did not receive adequate notice that a tax deed may issue, it follows that Flathead County was without jurisdiction to issue McDonald the quiet title decree. As a result, Gentry\u2019s right to redeem continued, and the District Court did not error in finding the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b635 3. Did the District Court err in denying McDonald\u2019s Motion to Compel and in granting Gentry\u2019s Motion for a Protective Order?</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b636 McDonald argues that because of the District Court\u2019s denial of his Motion to Compel, he was not afforded the opportunity to conduct \u201cany\u201d discovery. Such a ruling, McDonald contends, is in error, as the \u201cMontana Rules of Civil Procedure make no provision for avoiding or tolling discovery while a motion for judgment on the pleadings is pending,\u201d nor do the \u201cRules of Evidence contain any provision that define \u2018relevance\u2019 as contingent upon a court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">\u00b637 Gentry argues that McDonald did not preserve the above-articulated argument on appeal, as he did not \u201cexpressly appeal the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>district court\u2019s protective order of May 30, 2002.\u201d As such, Gentry contends that this Court cannot review or rule upon the District Court\u2019s Order, given that McDonald did not attach the Order, nor did he make any references to the Order. And, even assuming that McDonald did preserve his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s Order, Gentry argues that because McDonald did not properly raise before the District Court the issue he raises here by attaching a copy of his discovery, McDonald\u2019s argument is still procedurally barred from this Court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\">\u00b638 Rule 9(a) of the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJm\">The original papers and exhibits filed in the district court, <em>the transcript </em>ofproceedings, if any, and a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the clerk of the district court shall constitute the record on appeal in all cases. <em>It is the duty of a party seeking review of a judgment, order or proceeding to present the supreme court with a record sufficient to enable it to rule upon the issues raised. </em>Failure to present the court with a sufficient record on appeal may result in dismissal of the appeal and/or the imposition of some other appropriate sanction. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b639 Review of the record reveals that upon Gentry\u2019s Motion for a Protective Order and McDonald\u2019s response therein, the District Court found that \u201cpending a ruling on Plaintiffs [Gentry\u2019s] Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff is excused from responding to discovery.\u201d Nowhere in the record does McDonald provide this Court with the actual Interrogatories and Requests for Production that he served upon Gentry. Hence, we cannot review McDonald\u2019s claim that because he could not conduct discovery he thereby could not adequately defend Gentry\u2019s contentions during oral argument on its summary judgment motion. We are at a loss as to what facts McDonald wished to discover. It is McDonald\u2019s burden to provide this Court with a sufficient record to enable us to address the issue he raises here. McDonald did not meet this burden. Accordingly, we do not address his argument here.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b640 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-6\">JUSTICES REGNIER, COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
