Did the District Court err by granting the Estate\u2019s petition to obtain assets in kind (rather than in cash) in distribution?</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">\u00b65 2. Did the District Court err when it voided the sale, which former directors of the defunct Monte Christo Mining Company purported to conduct, of the Estate\u2019s interest in certain property, and ordered appellant Hunt to deed real property to the Estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">\u00b66 The present appeal is the second taken from orders issued by the District Court in this case. In <em>Estate of James v. Hunt </em>(2002), 202 MT 218N, 312 Mont. 525, 55 P.3d 419 (hereinafter, <em>Estate of James I), </em>we held that the District Court did not err when it ruled that (1) the former Monte Christo Mining Company had been subjected to involuntary dissolution by the Montana Secretary of State, and (2) that Hunt\u2019s attempt to reinstate the corporation after its dissolution merely resulted in the creation of a new corporation with the same name as the old, rather than a reinstatement thereof.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We then remanded the case for clarification of the District Court\u2019s order. We incorporate herein the factual and procedural background set forth in <em>Estate of James I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">\u00b67 Pursuant to our Opinion in <em>Estate of James I, </em>the Estate\u2019s personal representative, Darlene M. Rose (Rose), petitioned the District Court for in-kind distribution of the Estate\u2019s real property, which she claimed was then being held by trustees of Monte Christo. The hearing on this motion was scheduled for March 11, 2003. On March 4, 2003, MCMC\u2019s Board of Directors purported to liquidate the Estate\u2019s property interests by sale to one of its members, Shirley Groff, a former officer and trustee of Monte Christo. The price was one hundred twenty-five dollars, a sum arrived at by referring to the old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Monte Christo shareholders\u2019 agreement. Ms. Groff and Donald Hand, <em>\u201cas </em>trustees of the dissolved Monte Christo Mining Company,\u201d then moved the District Court to dismiss the Estate\u2019s petition for in-kind distribution as moot. To justify the sale, they cited a portion of our <em>Estate of James I </em>Opinion, and \u00a7 35-6-104(5), referred to therein, both of which they construed as requiring in-cash distribution of the property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b68 This move did not sit well with the District Court. In his subsequent order, Judge Tucker voided the liquidation sale on equitable grounds, characterizing it as an attempt to deprive his court of jurisdiction by means of a deal made by insiders in violation of fiduciary duties owed to the beneficiary of a trust. Ruling, moreover, that neither \u00a7 35-6-104(5) nor the statutes which it, in turn, references, require in-cash distribution, he ordered Monte Christo\u2019s former directors to immediately distribute to the James Estate its fractional share of the assets of the defunct corporation in kind. Judge Tucker did not address the argument that Appellants base on our <em>Estate of James I </em>Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b69 We review findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous and conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Dome Mountain Ranch, LLC v. Park County </em>(2001), 307 Mont. 420, \u00b6 12, 37 P.3d 710, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted). The District Court did not expressly divide its order into findings and conclusions, but the issues raised by Hunt and Monte Christo implicate both fact and law.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b610 <em>1. Did the District Court err by granting the Estate\u2019s petition to obtain assets in kind (rather than in cash) in distribution?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">\u00b611 Appellants claim that we ruled in <em>Estate of James I </em>that Rose must pursue an in-cash distribution, that an in-cash distribution thus became the law of the case, and that the District Court therefore clearly erred in ordering distribution in kind. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">\u00b612 The portion of <em>Estate of James I </em>which Appellants interpret as having ordered in-cash distribution reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-11\">The District Court correctly determined MCMC is not a reinstatement of the dissolved Monte Christo, as discussed above. Liquidation of the property and assets of an involuntarily-dissolved corporation is governed by \u00a7 35-6-104(5), MCA, and the statutes referenced therein. Thus, Hunt has not established that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>he has any authority to require the Estate to take shares of stock in MCMC in exchange for its shareholder interest in Monte Christo. Because this proceeding does not concern all of Monte Christo\u2019s corporate assets, but only the Estate\u2019s stock in that dissolved corporation, the District Court appropriately limited the scope of its order to instructing Rose to \u201ctake such steps as are required by law to distribute the property of the estate to the heirs and beneficiaries of the estate.\u201d <em>We presume the District Court meant in that portion of its order, and in its statement concerning \u201cthe then existing shareholders\u201d and \u201cthe real estate owned by the then existing corporation,\u201d that Rose should pursue liquidation of the assets of Monte Christo as provided in \u00a7 35-6-104(5), MCA, and the other statutes referenced therein.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><em>Estate of James I, </em>\u00b6 22 (emphasis added). Appellants argue that the italicized sentence required an in-cash distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b613 The issue of precisely how the Estate should receive its distribution from the assets of the dissolved Monte Christo, however, was not before this Court in <em>Estate of James I. </em>Rather, we simply held that the District Court did not err when it ruled that the Estate was entitled to such a distribution. The text of the paragraph which follows the one that Appellants rely upon confirms this conclusion, and properly delimits the judgment we rendered on this point: \u201cWe hold the District Court did not err when it confirmed that Monte Christo had been dissolved and ordered distribution of the Estate\u2019s property.\u201d <em>Estate of James I, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b614 According to the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine, where this Court upon an appeal, in deciding a case presented, states in its opinion a principle or rule of law necessary to the decision, such pronouncement becomes the law of the case and must be adhered to throughout its subsequent progress, both in the trial court and upon subsequent appeal. <em>Federated Mut. Ins. Co. v. </em>Anderson, 1999 MT 288, \u00b6 60, 297 Mont. 33, \u00b6 60, 991 P.2d 915, \u00b6 60. Since we did not decide, in <em>Estate of James I, </em>how distribution should be effectuated, the law-of-the-case doctrine did not apply so as to limit the District Court\u2019s discretion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"AcY\">\u00b615 Even if the italicized sentence announced a mandate from this Court, which it clearly did not, it would not have prevented the District Court from ordering distribution to the Estate in kind. Section 35-1-935, MCA, prescribes the effect of the dissolution to which the Montana Secretary of State subjected Monte Christo. It provides that a dissolved corporation may do nothing except what is appropriate to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs, including (b) disposing of its properties that will not be distributed in kind to its shareholders, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>and (d) distributing its remaining property among its shareholders according to their interests. <em>See </em>\u00a7 35-1-935, MCA. Subsection (b) allows for in-kind distribution of at least some of the corporate assets after dissolution. Subsection (d) provides that assets which were not liquidated under (b) or otherwise disposed of in payment of outstanding liabilities should be distributed in kind to the shareholders. Winding up and liquidation, therefore, may include in-kind distribution of corporate assets. <em>See also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 839 (5th ed. 1979) (\u201cLiquidation: Winding up of corporation so that assets are distributed to those entitled to receive them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><em>\u00b616 </em> We therefore hold that the District Court did not err in ordering an in-kind distribution to the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b617 <em>2. Did the District Court err when it voided the sale, which former directors of the defunct Monte Christo Mining Company purported to conduct, of the Estate\u2019s interest in certain property, and ordered appellant Hunt to deed real property to the Estate?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b618 The District Court, in the ruling challenged in <em>Estate of James I, </em>determined that Hunt and MCMC had no right or title to, or interest in, the real estate owned by Monte Christo, and ordered that Hunt should \u201chave and take nothing of the property or assets\u201d of the dissolved corporation. Hunt objected to this ruling, and requested clarification of the District Court\u2019s order, pointing out that certain Monte Christo shareholders had sold him their stock in the former company. The Estate conceded that the District Court may have erred in this regard. We accordingly remanded to allow the District Court to clarify its order. <em>Estate of James I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b619 By way of clarification on remand, the District Court amended its prior order to \u201crecognize that Delbert Hunt and Monte Christo Mining Co[mpany] are entitled to retain whatever rights they may have acquired when Delbert Hunt purchased stock from Monte Christo\u2019s shareholders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">\u00b620 Appellants elaborate on these purchases in their brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">Delbert Hunt made offers to each and every one of the stockholders of Monte Christo mining wherein he offered to purchase <em>both the land donated to the corporation and each individual shareholder\u2019s stock in the corporation. </em>Each of them, except the estate of Alvaretta James, accepted the offer and took Delbert Hunt\u2019s money. This is a matter of record. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">\u00b621  The District Court found that Monte Christo\u2019s shareholders received a distribution in kind. We hold that the court did not clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>err in so finding, however informally the distribution was carried out. As noted above, Appellants themselves point emphatically to the fact that Hunt made offers to all of Monte Christo\u2019s former shareholders, without exception, for their interests in the assets formerly owned by that company, offers accepted by all but the Estate. <em>Estate of James I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26. Thus, by the time Hunt made these offers, the property, including the real property, formerly owned by Monte Christo had passed from the Monte Christo trustees\u2019 control back into that of the individual shareholders. Had it been otherwise, the shareholders could not have sold the property to Hunt, since it would have remained under the control of the Monte Christo trustees. Section 35-1-935, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b622  Rights to the property which Alvaretta J ames deeded to Monte Christo when it was incorporated had therefore devolved upon her Estate when Hunt made his offer. The Estate\u2019s refusal of his offer retained those rights. Thus, MCMC\u2019s Board of Directors, lacking rights of ownership over the Estate\u2019s property, had no authority to sell it.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay1\">\u00b623 Appellants further argue that it was the testamentary intent of Alvaretta James that the property which the original shareholders deeded to Monte Christo upon incorporation should be preserved as an economic unit for mining purposes, and that the District Court consequently erred in ordering that the Estate should retain the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b624 Appellants base their argument on two documents: the will of Alvaretta James, which does not specifically dispose of, or indeed even mention, the property at issue; and the Monte Christo stockholders\u2019 agreement, in which the original shareholders, including the decedent, agreed that ownership of Monte Christo stock, which the shareholders received in exchange for the real property they deeded to the corporation, should generally be limited to those who then owned it.</p>\n<p id=\"AYip\">\u00b625 Although this issue was raised below, the District Court did not address it in its final order. It was also briefed by both the Appellants and the Respondent. Since resolving this issue depends on a determination of the testamentary intent of Alvaretta J ames, a factual inquiry, we remand to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b626 Respondents raise the issue of imposing Rule 32 sanctions upon the Appellants on the grounds that they have brought a meritless appeal. Given the procedural posture of this case, it is premature to address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u00b627 Affirmed in part, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b49-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-13\"> As we did in <em>Estate of James I, </em>we will refer to the former, dissolved, Monte Christo Mining Company as \u201cMonte Christo,\u201d and to the current corporation of that name as \"MCMC.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
