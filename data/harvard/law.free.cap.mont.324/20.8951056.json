His friend had apparently cut his hand with a miter saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\u00b64 While en route to the emergency room, Officer Armstrong clocked Boettiger going 93 miles per hour. Officer Armstrong thereafter initiated a stop and began questioning Boettiger. He noted that Boettiger\u2019s friend\u2019s hand was not bleeding, nor was his condition life threatening. He also noted that Boettiger\u2019s speech was slurred, his eyes were bloodshot and glossy in appearance, and when asked for his license, registration, and proof of insurance, Boettiger provided Officer Armstrong with the title to the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\u00b65 Boettiger admitted to having had \u201ca couple of beers,\u201d and thereafter failed several field sobriety tests. Officer Armstrong arrested Boettiger for driving under the influence of alcohol, and then he arranged transportation to the hospital for Boettiger\u2019s friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\u00b66 Boettiger chose to have a bench trial in Justice Court. He was found guilty of the offense of driving under the influence of alcohol and of the offense of speeding. Boettiger then appealed his convictions to the District Court. A jury trial was held, at which Officer Armstrong testified to the details of Boettiger\u2019s arrest on June 22, 2002. Counsel for Boettiger objected to this testimony on the basis that he was not provided Officer Armstrong\u2019s name as a potential witness. The District Court admitted the testimony over this objection, although counsel for Boettiger subjected Officer Armstrong to an extensive cross examination. The jury ultimately found Boettiger guilty of both offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">\u00b67 Boettiger now appeals the District Court\u2019s evidentiary ruling admitting Officer Armstrong\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Strauss, </em>2003 MT 195, \u00b6 18, 317 Mont. 1, \u00b6 18, 74 P.3d 1052, \u00b6 18. A district court has broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence, and we will not overturn a district court\u2019s rulings absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Strauss, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err in allowing the arresting officer to testify at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b610 Boettiger notes that the State of Montana (the State) did not identify Officer Armstrong on its witness list as a witness whom the State intended to call. Regardless of this fact, however, Boettiger notes that the District Court allowed Officer Armstrong\u2019s testimony over Boettiger\u2019s objection. Hence, Boettiger argues that the District Court abused its discretion, because the State violated the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 46-15-322(l)(a), MCA. Boettiger claims that such an abuse of discretion requires that his case be remanded to the District Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b6 11 The State argues that while it \u201crecognizes that the prosecution did not provide <em>written </em>notice to Boettiger that specifically stated that it would be calling Officer Armstrong to the stand,\u201d the District Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the testimony, because \u201cthe record clearly established that Boettiger\u2019s attorney had sufficient prior notice of the existence of Officer Armstrong as the State\u2019s witness....\u201d In addition, the State argues that Boettiger makes no assertions that he was prejudiced or surprised as a result of Officer Armstrong\u2019s testimony. This is especially true, the State argues, because Boettiger knew that the State would call Officer Armstrong as a witness. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\u00b612 Upon objection from Boettiger\u2019s counsel, the District Court noted the following with regard to the State\u2019s request to call Officer Armstrong to the stand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">THE COURT: Well, this is an appeal from Justice Court, and this is the officer that signed the ticket, so I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s really any issue as to whether or not the defense didn\u2019t have notice that this witnesses was going to testify in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">\u00b613 We noted in <em>State v. Sol </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 69, 936 P.2d 307, that, upon a challenge similar to Boettiger\u2019s here, the defendant, Sol, was \u201cunable to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice or surprise as a result of the State\u2019s alleged discovery violations.\u201d <em>Sol, </em>282 Mont. at 79, 936 P.2d at 313. Sol was unable to demonstrate prejudice or surprise given that he was aware of the test results at issue, as those test results had been received as testimony previously at two separate hearings. <em>Sol, </em>282 Mont. at 79, 936 P.2d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">\u00b614 Section 46-15-322(l)(a), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-11\">Upon request, the prosecutor shall make available to the defendant for examination and reproduction the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>material and information within the prosecutor\u2019s possession or control:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\">(a) the names, addresses, and statements of all persons whom the prosecutor may call as witnesses in the case in chief[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b615 Here, Officer Armstrong-the arresting officer-testified at Boettiger\u2019s bench trial in Justice Court regarding Boettiger\u2019s actions on the day in question. From the disposition of this bench trial, Boettiger appealed to the District Court. At that trial, Boettiger objected to the admission of Officer Armstrong\u2019s testimony, because Officer Armstrong was not listed as a potential witness. When the District Court overruled Boettiger\u2019s objection, counsel for Boettiger thereafter subjected Officer Armstrong to an extensive cross examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u00b616 We do not condone the State\u2019s failure to provide Boettiger with the name of Officer Armstrong as a potential witness. However, as in <em>Sol, </em>Boettiger does not demonstrate that he was prejudiced as a result of the admission of Officer Armstrong\u2019s testimony. Boettiger knew about what Officer Armstrong would testify, since Officer Armstrong testified at Boettiger\u2019s bench trial in Justice Court. Boettiger merely concludes, without more, that because he was not provided Officer Armstrong\u2019s name as a potential witness, as required by statute, he is therefore entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AdA\">\u00b617  We must disregard any error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect the accused\u2019s substantive rights. Section 46-20-701(2), MCA. Boettiger has failed to meet this standard of proof. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Officer Armstrong\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b43-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
