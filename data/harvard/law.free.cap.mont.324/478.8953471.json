Toeniss (Toeniss). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the WCC erred in holding the hourly attorney fee rule requirement of \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA (1999), passed constitutional scrutiny under substantive due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether the WCC erred in holding the hourly attorney fee rule requirement of \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA (1999), passed constitutional scrutiny under equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">\u00b65 3. Whether the WCC erred when interpreting \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA (1999), to disallow an attorney fee to be based upon a contingency fee agreement existing between Bustell and Toennis.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">\u00b66 Bustell was injured in a trucking accident in Indiana on December 2, 1999, from which she was rendered a quadriplegic. She filed a Montana workers\u2019 compensation claim arising out of that accident. Respondents AIG Claims Service, Inc., and The Insurance Company of Pennsylvania (the Insurers), denied the claim on the ground it was not cognizable under the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act). Bustell hired Toeniss to represent her claim. They entered into a written contingency fee arrangement, which would allow Toeniss to recover twenty-five percent of the post-judgment award. The matter proceeded to trial on April 23 through 25, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-15\">\u00b67 On May 15, 2002, the WCC entered judgment finding Bustell\u2019s claim to be compensable under the Act, the Insurers\u2019 denial of liability to be unreasonable and Bustell entitled to an award of attorney fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA. The Insurers did not appeal. Subsequently, a dispute over the computation of attorney fees ensued and was heard by the WCC on May 13, 2003. Bustell moved that her attorney fee award should be based upon the contingency agreement she entered into with Toeniss. Instead, on November 14, 2003, the WCC entered judgment granting attorney fees in the amount of $66,794 (477 hours x $140/hour), pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA, and Department of Labor and Industry (the Department) Regulations. Bustell appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u00b68 The standard for reviewing conclusions of law is whether they are correct. <em>Powell v.

Every presumption must be indulged in favor of the constitutionality of the legislative act. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 13 (citations omitted). A party challenging the constitutionality of a statute bears the burden of proving the statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Henry v.

Any doubts regarding constitutionality must be resolved in favor of the statute. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u00b69 This Court will not interfere with a determination of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees absent a showing that the WCC has abused its discretion. <em>Baeta v.

Co. </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 78, 899 P.2d 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AIIK\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\u00b610 Whether the WCC erred in holding the hourly attorney fee rule requirement of \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA (1999), passed constitutional scrutiny under substantive due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">\u00b611 Both the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, section 17, of the Montana Constitution provide that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 28. \u201cSubstantive due process primarily examines the underlying substantive rights and remedies to determine whether restrictions... are unreasonable or arbitrary when balanced against the purpose of the legislature in enacting the statute.\u201d <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 28 (citations omitted). The WCC, while not specifically analyzing the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>conclude it passes constitutional scrutiny. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b612 Section 39-71-611, MCA, requires costs and attorney fees to be paid when, as here, a claim is first denied and is later found compensable. It states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">(1)The insurer shall pay reasonable costs and attorney fees as established by the workers\u2019 compensation court if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">(c) in the case of attorney fees, the workers\u2019 compensation court determines that the insurer\u2019s actions in denying liability or terminating benefits were unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Once it is determined the insurer\u2019s actions were unreasonable, the WCC then calculates those fees pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">(1) The amount of an attorney\u2019s fee assessed against an insurer under 39-71-611... must be based exclusively on the time spent by the attorney in representing the claimant on the issues brought to hearing. The attorney must document the time spent, but the judge is not bound by the documentation submitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">(2) The judge shall determine a reasonable attorney fee and assess costs. The hourly rate applied to the time spent must be based on the attorney\u2019s customary and current hourly rate for legal work performed in this state, subject to a maximum established by the department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">(3) This section does not restrict a claimant and an attorney from entering into a contingency fee arrangement under which the attorney receives a percentage of the amount of compensation payments received by the claimant because of the efforts of the attorney. However, an amount equal to any fee and costs assessed against an insurer trader 39-71-611 ... and this section must be deducted from the fee an attorney is entitled to from the claimant under a contingency fee arrangement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">\u00b613 Section 39-71-614, MCA, was enacted in 1985 as a direct response to our holding in <em>Wight v. Hughes Livestock, Co. </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 98, 664 P.2d 303 <em>superseded by statute as stated in Baeta overruled on other grounds by Kloepfer, </em>which created a strong presumption in favor of the reasonableness of a contingent fee contract. Section 39-71-614, MCA, was intended to eliminate any question that the basis for determining the fee would be an hourly fee, for which the judge has discretion in determining what is reasonable. <em>Baeta, </em>254 Mont. at 491-92, 839 P.2d at 569 <em>overruled on other grounds by KLoepfer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">\u00b614 Bustell argues the hourly attorney fee rule requirement of \u00a7 39-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>71-614, MCA, is unconstitutional because it violates substantive due process in that it fails to protect claimants\u2019 net benefits, particularly those who have entered into a contingency fee arrangement with their attorney. Bustell argues it is not reasonable that the Insurers, whom the WCC found to have acted with \u201ccallous disregard\u201d and to have partaken in \u201cabhorrent behavior,\u201d can now use \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA, to reward their bad act by limiting her net benefit, making her unable to recoup her true costs and shifting the burden of paying full attorney fees to her instead of the Insurers. As such, Bustell maintains, this statutory scheme violates substantive due process because it is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b615 The Insurers assert Bustell has not sustained her burden of overcoming the presumption of the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA. The Insurers argue that the question in this matter is whether it is unreasonable for the Legislature to impose an hourly rate for attorney fees based on findings of \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA, in lieu of a dollar-for-dollar contingent attorney fee replacement for the claimant. The Insurers contend Bustell\u2019s claim that the statute is unconstitutional because it is unfair, unreasonable, capricious and arbitrary to assess an attorney fee which is not equal to her contingency fee does not have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b616  Indeed, it is Bustell\u2019s argument that the statutory scheme is unreasonable and unfair. However, as the Insurers point out, no authority has been cited for this proposition other than Bustell\u2019s belief it was improper for the Legislature to change the holding in <em>Wight </em>by enacting \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA. As such, we hold Bustell did not meet her burden of overcoming the presumption of the constitutionality of the statute. Therefore the WCC did not err in determining the statute does not violate the Due Process Clause of the United States or Montana Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u00b617 Whether the WCC erred in holding the hourly attorney fee rule requirement of \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA (1999), passed constitutional scrutiny under equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u00b618 Bustell further asserts \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA, is unconstitutional in that it violates equal protection because it prevents her from seeking her reasonable attorney fees as compared to other similarly situated claimants. Bustell maintains the statute violates equal protection because it limits only severely injured claimants, whose benefits have been denied wrongfully, from receiving their full fees while providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>that same fee recoupment to other less economically damaged claimants. The Insurers assert Bustell has not overcome the presumption of the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA, for equal protection purposes. The WCC, while not specifically analyzing the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA, did conclude it passes constitutional scrutiny. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b619 Both the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, section 4, of the Montana Constitution provide that no person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 16. The principal purpose of Montana\u2019s Equal Protection Clause is to ensure that Montana\u2019s citizens are not subject to arbitrary and discriminatory state action. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 16. When analyzing workers\u2019 compensation statutes, we use the rational basis test because the right to receive Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits is not a fundamental right nor does the Act infringe upon the rights of a suspect class. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 29. Under the rational basis test, the question becomes whether a legitimate governmental objective bears some identifiable rational relationship to a discriminatory classification. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 21 (citations omitted). In creating a right to seek attorney fees, the Legislature cannot deny that right in significant part to one group while granting the right in total to others without a rational basis. <em>See Henry, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahhe\">\u00b620 Proper equal protection analysis involves identifying the classes involved, determining whether they are similarly situated and then using the appropriate level of scrutiny to determine if the statute is constitutional. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-29. Therefore, the first prerequisite to a meritorious claim under the equal protection clause is a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 22. Consequently, when addressing this type of challenge, we must first identify the classes involved and determine if they are similarly situated. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b621 Bustell claims her class is the \u201cworkers whose claims [of significantly large awards] have been denied unreasonably and who have suffered catastrophic injuries or diseases,\u201d and the other class is the \u201cgroup of workers whose unreasonably denied benefits are significantly less.\u201d She maintains the larger the denied benefits are, the more likely the claimant is entitled to seek recoupment of full attorney fees, thereby creating two classes of claimants based on amount of award. In other words, although both \u201cclasses\u201d are entitled to recoup their attorney fees under \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA, because of the insurer\u2019s unreasonableness in denying liability awards pursuant to \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>39-71-611, MCA, those claimants who suffer more injury and are due to receive a larger award should be deemed a \u201cclass\u201d subject to equal protection analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b622  We conclude these are not two legitimate classes for an equal protection challenge because every claimant under these statutes is treated equally. As Bustell herself points out, contingency fee contracts are allowed under \u00a7 39-71-614(3), MCA, however claimants get credit off the contractual fee for the hourly amount awarded. \u201cAn award of the full fees would not increase that contract fee but would merely prevent the reduction of benefits to claimants, and in some cases medical providers ....\u201d Bustell is clearly within the class of persons awarded attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA, which are subject to computation pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA. However, any claimant who falls under this statutory scheme of awarding attorney fees is in her same class. The amount of those fees awarded is not relevant to any discriminatory treatment of the claimants themselves. Therefore, because there are not two separate classes of claimants, an equal protection analysis is not necessary. Accordingly, we hold the WCC correctly determined \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA, does not violate equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b623 Whether the WCC erred when interpreting \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA (1999), to disallow an attorney fee to be based upon a contingency fee agreement existing between Bustell and Toennis.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b624 Bustell argues even if \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA, is constitutional, she should <em>still </em>recoup the <em>fall </em>contract <em>fee in </em>this case because it is the only reasonable outcome. At the root of this appeal is Bustell\u2019s repeated argument that it is \u201cpatently unfair to require [her] to pay the bulk of her attorney\u2019s fees and thereby create an economic benefit for the insurer, to her detriment\u201d because \u201can award that is based on hourly rates for typical non-contingent fee cases will not even begin to compensate for the true attorney fee cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b625 However, as we discussed above, the WCC correctly determined the reasonable attorney fees under the statutory scheme of \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA, and \u00a7 39-71-614, MCA. Instead of awarding the contingency fee, the WCC awarded fees based on hours worked by Toennis, pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-614(2), MCA, which requires payment at either the attorney\u2019s usual and customary hourly rate or a $75 per hour maximum established by the Department. Although Toeniss did not have a \u201cusual and customary hourly rate\u201d as he conducted all of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>business on a contingency basis, he submitted that for this matter, the hourly rate award should be $225. Concerning this rate, the WCC noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">[t]hat figure is not a rate he charges clients as all his work is on a contingent fee basis. Rather, it is the amount of his contingency earnings in 2001 divided by the number of hours he worked that year. That figure does not represent a \u201ccustomary and current hourly rate for legal work performed in this state.\u201d It is also a volatile figure which could dramatically change year-to-year based on his recoveries for his clients. Most importantly, it exceeds the maximum amount prescribed by the Department of Labor and Industry (Department).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b626 The WCC also noted that in addition, the Department\u2019s Rule 24.29.3802, A.R.M. (Rule), allowed it \u201c[f]or good cause shown ... [to] approve a variance providing for fees in excess of the guidelines ....\u201d The Rule lays out ten factors an attorney has the burden of proving, through clear and convincing evidence, to demonstrate an entitlement to receive increased fees. The WCC analyzed Bustell\u2019s case under each of the ten factors and determined Toennis was entitled to receive a variance from the $75 maximum established by the Department to an increased fee of $140 per hour. In applying the factors, the WCC found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">\n<em>(i) The anticipated time and labor required to perform the legal service properly.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">This case involved an accident occurring in Indiana, a jurisdictional dispute, and a significant dispute over employment status. Out-of-state depositions were required. As shown by the actual hours Toennis worked, the case required more time and effort than many other workers\u2019 compensation cases. Assuming Toennis had six billable hours a day and worked 2080 hours a year, the time spent on this case amounted to nearly one-third of a billable year. That in turn amounts to a significant part of his practice which is even more significant given the risk of no recovery. This fact favors Toennis\u2019 request for an increase in the hourly rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">\n<em>(ii) The novelty and difficulty of legal issues involved in the matter.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">The issues were both novel and difficult. Initially, there was a jurisdictional dispute, a dispute which was complicated by the insurer\u2019s initial indication that Montana was the proper jurisdiction for the claim and its later repudiation of that indication and its insistence that Indiana had jurisdiction. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>was also a significant dispute over employment status, a dispute complicated by the particular facts and circumstances of this case and the nature of the interstate trucking industry. This fact favors Toennis\u2019 request for an increase in the hourly rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">\n<em>(Hi) The fees customarily charged for similar legal services.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_GY\">Testimony by the insurers\u2019 expert attorney witness established that the usual and customary fee in Billings for workers\u2019 compensation litigation is between $125 and $150 an hour. The testifying attorney (Geoffrey R. Keller), like Toennis, has extensive experience and expertise in workers\u2019 compensation matters and typically charges $140 an hour. I find that $140 an hour is a reasonable fee for the work Toennis performed. This fact therefore favors Toennis\u2019 request for an increase in the hourly rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">\n<em>(iv) The possible total recovery if successful.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">This case involves a relatively young quadriplegic. The potential total recovery over her lifetime is in the millions of dollars, encompassing not only compensation benefits but significant medical expenses and domiciliary care. Toennis estimates that benefits will be in the range of $6 million over the claimant\u2019s life. This factor favors Toennis\u2019 request for an increase in the hourly rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">\n<em>(v) The time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances of the case.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">There were no unusual time limitations imposed in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">\n<em>(vi) The nature and length of the attorney-client relationship.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">The facts do not establish a long-term attorney-client relationship or a relationship that is unusual for a workers\u2019 compensation case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">\n<em>(vii) The experience, skill and reputation of the attorney.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">The facts, as well as my own experience with Toennis in litigated matters, establish that Toennis is highly skilled in workers\u2019 compensation matters. Indeed, his practice is almost exclusively devoted to workers\u2019 compensation. This factor favors Toennis\u2019 request for an increase in the hourly rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-13\"><em>(viii) The ability of the client to pay for the legal services rendered. </em>Toennis\u2019 testimony established that claimant was financially unable to pay for his services on an hourly rate and that a contingent fee contract was necessary. Indeed, claimant was confronted not only with the necessity of securing and paying for counsel but with a total loss of income and catastrophic expenses for medical and domiciliary care. This factor favors Toennis\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>request for an increase in the hourly rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">\n<em>(ix) The risk of no recovery.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">There was a significant risk of no recovery based on the jurisdictional and employment issues. Indeed, this case was vigorously defended by able counsel for the insurer. This factor favors Toennis\u2019 request for an increase in the hourly rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">\n<em>(x) The market value of the lawyer\u2019s services at the time and place involved.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">Again, based on the testimony of Geoffrey R. Keller, I find that the market value of Toennis\u2019 services was $140 an hour. <em>{See factor (Hi).) </em>This factor favors Toennis\u2019 request for an increase in the hourly rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\u00b627 Here, the WCC correctly followed established statutory and case law. The award <em>must </em>be based on the hourly rate of the attorney and the hours expended. Section 39-71-614(1), MCA; <em>Gullett v. Stanley Structures </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 365, 367, 722 P.2d 619, 621. Where a contingency fee arrangement exists, the WCC is to determine what would be a reasonable fee on a contingency basis. <em>See Davis v. Jones </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 158, 162, 745 P.2d 362, 364-65 (citations omitted). Further, the WCC is not bound by what the attorney puts forward and has much discretion when determining what is reasonable under the circumstances. <em>See Baeta, </em>254 Mont. at 492, 839 P.2d at 569 <em>overruled on other grounds by Kloepfer; </em>Section 39-71-614(1), MCA. Further, while a claimant and an attorney may enter into a contingency fee arrangement, the amount assessed against the insurer under \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA, must be deducted from the fee an attorney is entitled to from the claimant under such contingency fee arrangement. Section 39-71-614(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">\u00b628  While the maximum hourly fee is $75 under the Rule, a variance is allowed when an attorney\u2019s work meets the ten factor criteria established by the Department. The WCC, using its discretion, denied the contingency amount of $225 per hour put forward by Toennis and instead awarded a variance of $140 per hour. While this may not be the $225 per hour fee he was seeking, it is an amount that was determined correctly under the statutory scheme. As such, we conclude the WCC did not abuse its discretion in its award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">\u00b629 We affirm the WCC on all issues.</p>\n<judges id=\"b503-11\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
