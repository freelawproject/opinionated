Cox (Cox) and Eugene Joseph Paslov (Paslov) regarding their minor son, Dylan. At the time of this appeal, two courts, the Third Judicial District Court, Powell County, Montana, and the High Court of American Samoa, had rendered conflicting custody determinations regarding Dylan. Cox appeals from the July 22, 2002, order of the Third Judicial District Court which enforced an earlier parenting plan issued on September 11,2000, over a custody order issued by the High Court of American Samoa on July 17, 2001. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-16\">\u00b62 Cox presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b115-17\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in failing to recognize the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>custody order entered by the High Court of American Samoa.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in modifying the original parenting plan issued by the State of Oregon by awarding sole custody of Dylan to Paslov.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b65 Paslov presents the following issue on cross-appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b66 Whether Cox timely appealed the District Court\u2019s September 11, 2000, custody order. Because we affirm on Appellant\u2019s Issue 1, it is not necessary to reach either Appellant\u2019s Issue 2 or Respondent\u2019s issue on cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">\u00b67 Paslov and Cox were married in Nevada on February 5,1991, and later moved to Oregon. At the time of their marriage, Cox had two older children from a previous marriage, Diedre and Warren Enteron. Paslov and Cox had one child together, Dylan, born November 8,1994. The parties were divorced in Oregon on March 14, 1999. The final parenting plan issued by the Oregon court granted sole custody of Dylan to Cox and provided that Paslov pay $300 per month child support. Additionally, the Oregon Court granted the parties\u2019 agreed upon parenting plan which provided that Paslov have regular visitation on alternating weekends with Dylan at his paternal grandparent\u2019s home in Carson City, Nevada, with Paslov to pay for air transportation for Dylan, who would be accompanied by an adult (either Cox, Deidre or Warren). Paslov was to have parenting time with Dylan on Dylan\u2019s birthday, alternating holidays and for one month during the summer after notifying Cox of the time period by May 1 of each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">\u00b68 After the divorce, Paslov moved back to Nevada and, sometime in the fall of 1999, Cox moved to Deer Lodge, Montana, in anticipation of her marriage the following summer to Don McGee, a Butte resident. Paslov asserts this move was made without notification, which Cox denies. Whatever the case, ongoing relations between the parties proved difficult, and visitation between Paslov and Dylan was sporadic. Paslov asserts Cox\u2019s relocation was an attempt to deny his opportunity to visit Dylan. Cox counters Paslov\u2019s failure to pay for Dylan\u2019s airfare to Carson City was the reason for any visitation difficulty Paslov may have encountered.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">\u00b69 Paslov then traveled to Helena, Montana, and secured an attorney to initiate modification to the parenting plan for more visitation time with Dylan. On April 3,2000, Paslov filed in the Third Judicial District Court (1) a petition to recognize and register the Oregon parenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>plan, and (2) a motion to amend the Oregon parenting plan. The motion requested Cox remain Dylan\u2019s sole custodian, but that Paslov be granted expanded visitation with Dylan.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b610 On May 18, 2000, in response to Paslov\u2019s petition, Cox stipulated that the District Court could recognize and register the Oregon decree of dissolution and final parenting plan and assume jurisdiction over the parenting plan proceedings. However, she objected to Paslov\u2019s request for modification of the parenting plan. The following day, the District Court also granted an <em>ex parte </em>motion by Paslov requiring Cox to produce Dylan for a weekend visit in Butte, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b611 On May 22, 2000, the District Court, noting that both Cox and Dylan were residing in Deer Lodge, Montana, and that Dylan had significant contacts in the State of Montana, issued an order in which it recognized and registered the Oregon decree of dissolution and parenting plan as a valid decree. It also accepted jurisdiction in all matters involving the custody and visitation of Dylan, including Paslov\u2019s motion for amending the parenting plan and all other subsequent actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b612 While Paslov\u2019s motion to modify the parenting plan was pending before the District Court, relations between Cox and Paslov worsened. Among other things, Paslov was angry because he was not receiving his phone calls from Dylan, and Cox was angry that Paslov was insisting upon his court-ordered parent-child contact for the summer. On June 16, 2000, Cox filed a motion to hold Paslov in contempt for failure to pay thousands of dollars in child support. Then, on June 22, 2000, four days before Paslov was to pick up Dylan for his month-long summer visitation, Paslov and Cox had a publicly heated argument at a Wal-Mart in Butte. During this argument, Cox asserts Paslov threatened to ruin her upcoming wedding, stalk her for the rest of her life, and harm both her and her children. On June 28, 2000, Paslov filed an <em>ex parte </em>motion to enforce the parenting plan regarding the summer parent-child visitation, which was subsequently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\u00b613 Following this public scene and Paslov\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>motion, Cox petitioned the Silver Bow Justice of the Peace for a temporary restraining order (TRO), which was granted. However, the order was almost immediately rescinded when Justice Court learned that a custodial proceeding was pending in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\u00b614 Cox was never served with the <em>Ex Parte </em>Order for Parent-Child Contact regarding the summer visit; nor was she notified of the rescinded TRO. She was not notified because she left Montana with Dylan and returned to American Samoa, her homeland, asserting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>safety concerns for herself and her children. Cox left without notice to either Paslov or the District Court, she was not found, and Paslov did not receive any parent-child contact in the summer of 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b615 On August 1,2000, Paslov amended his pending motion to request he receive sole custody of Dylan. Paslov also requested Cox\u2019s contact with Dylan be restricted to supervised visitation, Cox undergo a psychological evaluation, and Cox pay Paslov\u2019s attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"A4S\">\u00b616 On September 7,2000, the District Court conducted a hearing on Paslov\u2019s petition to change Dylan\u2019s custody. Cox was not in attendance at the hearing, despite being served notice of the hearing both at her last known address and by publication. On September 11, 2000, the District Court granted Paslov\u2019s petition and awarded sole custody to Paslov. Additionally, the court ordered Cox have no parent-child contact with Dylan, unless and until she submit to, and successfully complete, a full psychological evaluation. Once the evaluations were complete, the therapist would provide a written report to the District Court regarding a recommendation for visitation between Cox and Dylan so the court could determine what, if any, parent-child contact Cox should have with Dylan. In fact, the court order specifies that both parents participate in psychological evaluations in order for the court to have complete and well-rounded information. The court also terminated Paslov\u2019s child support obligations, and awarded Paslov attorney fees and costs. Additionally, the court ordered that all law enforcement agencies were to continue their efforts in searching for Cox and Dylan, as their whereabouts were still unknown at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"AFD\">\u00b617 On November 22, 2000, Cox filed an action in the American Samoan court system to modify the September 11, 2000, order of the District Court. She sought to be designated as the exclusive custodian of Dylan. On April 5, 2001, The High Court of American Samoa conducted a trial on Cox\u2019s petition in which both Cox and Paslov personally appeared with counsel. Paslov contested the jurisdiction of the Samoan court and requested it recognize the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b618 On July 17,2001, the High Court of American Samoa entered its opinion and order, concluding it had jurisdiction over the matter and that Dylan\u2019s interests would best be served by residing with his mother. It modified the District Court\u2019s September 11,2000, order by granting sole custody to Cox, with reasonable supervised visitation rights to Paslov. Paslov initially appealed the Samoan decision, but subsequently withdrew his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u00b619 On March 7, 2002, Paslov filed a motion in District Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>enforce its September 11, 2000, custody order. On the same date, Dylan\u2019s paternal grandparents also filed a motion in District Court to enforce grandparent contact with Dylan. Cox responded with a motion to quash on the basis that the Samoan Court had jurisdiction over this matter. On July 22, 2002, after briefs and oral arguments were submitted, the District Court issued an order granting both Paslov\u2019s motion to enforce its September 11, 2000, custody order and the grandparents\u2019 motion for increased grandparent visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b620 While Paslov\u2019s motions were pending, Cox entered into negotiations with the Powell County Attorney\u2019s office regarding an earlier charge of Parenting Interference, a felony, pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-634, MCA, for her removal of Dylan from Montana. These negotiations resulted in a March 22,2002, deferred prosecution agreement in which Cox agreed to not violate any Montana laws for a period of one year and to follow all valid court orders issued in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b621 On August 20,2002, Cox filed a Writ of Supervisory Control with this Court, alleging the District Court erred in failing to recognize the jurisdiction of the High Court of American Samoa to issue a modified parenting plan which awarded custody to her. We denied the writ on grounds an appeal would provide an adequate remedy for the error alleged by Cox. On October 10,2002, Cox filed a notice of appeal of the District Court\u2019s July 22,2002, enforcement order. Paslov filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely. We denied Paslov\u2019s motion, concluding Cox\u2019s appeal, although filed beyond thirty days after the order, was nonetheless timely filed under Rule 5(c), M.R.App.P., because a notice of the entry of judgment had never been served.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u00b622 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Shape </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 409, 416, 916 P.2d 744, 748 (citation omitted). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Shupe, </em>276 Mont. at 416, 916 P.2d at 748 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">\u00b623 The District Court correctly assumed jurisdiction of the Oregon Parenting Plan and modified it to award Paslov sole custody of Dylan. The Samoan Court subsequently asserted jurisdiction over the Montana modification and awarded Cox sole custody of Dylan. As maintained by Cox, the resolution of these conflicting custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>determinations must be decided under the federal Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (PKPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A, which sets forth jurisdictional guidelines in face of competing custody decisions by sister states. Cox asserts that under the PKPA: (1) Montana does not have exclusive jurisdiction over this custody dispute, and (2) American Samoa properly exercised jurisdiction in rendering its custody decision. Conversely, Paslov argues the District Court never lost jurisdiction over this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b624 While both parties have acted grievously in this matter with assertions of abuse, stalking and kidnaping, the case before us is simply one of a jurisdictional matter. The essential question in this case is which of two state courts had jurisdiction to make a custody determination involving Dylan: the District Court or the Samoan Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which have rendered opposing custody determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b625 The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) has been adopted in all fifty states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands. <em>Stoneman v. Drollinger, </em>2003 MT 25, \u00b6 12, 314 Mont. 139, \u00b6 12, 64 P.3d 997, \u00b6 12. The UCCJA was created \u201cto remedy th[e] intolerable state of affairs where self-help and the rule of \u2018seize and run\u2019 prevail ....\u201d Lansing &amp; Sherman, <em>The Legal Response to Child Snatching, </em>7 J.Juv.L. 16,19 (1983) (quoting UCCJA, Commissioners\u2019 Prefatory Note, 9 Uniform Laws Annotated (ULA) 112 (1979)). In 1999, the Montana Legislature adopted the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), which repealed and replaced the UCCJA provisions in Montana law. <em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b626 However helpful the uniform enactments have been, they nonetheless operate in large part at the state level, while the parental conduct they are designed to prevent is essentially interstate in nature. Thus, in 1980, the federal government enacted the PKPA to establish national standards addressing the continuing problems of forum shopping and child snatching. Full faith and credit must ordinarily be given to a custody determination made by a court of another state if that court appropriately exercised jurisdiction under PKPA standards. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(a); <em>Erler v. Erler </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 65, 69, 862 P.2d 12, 15; <em>Shape, </em>276 Mont. at 414, 916 P.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>747.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b627 For convenience, we will refer to the state that originally entered the custody decree as the \u201cDistrict Court,\u201d and the state that modified that decree as the \u201cSamoan court.\u201d The PKPA provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u00a7 1738A.

These provisions of the PKPA provide that a second state may only modify the custody decree of the first state in very limited circumstances, even though both states may have an interest in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">\u00b628 Subsection (f) is the key modification provision of the PKPA and creates a two-pronged test for courts to apply. Before a second state may modify the decree of the first state, (1) the second state must have jurisdiction under its own laws, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(f)(l); and (2) the first state must have lost or given up its jurisdiction, both \u201ccontinuing\u201d and \u201cpending.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(f)(2). If the first state has neither lost nor refused jurisdiction, there would be no need to ascertain whether the second state has authority to assume jurisdiction. Thus, we turn to the question of Montana\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">Montana\u2019s Jurisdiction over the Oregon Parenting Plan</p>\n<p id=\"AFp\">\u00b629 The State of Montana may assume jurisdiction for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>modifying a child custody determination when a conflict arises involving a disparate decree from sister states under the UCCJEA, codified at \u00a7 40-7-203, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\">Jurisdiction to modify determination. Except as otherwise provided in 40-7-204, a court of this state may not modify a child custody determination made by a court of another state unless a court of this state has jurisdiction to make an initial determination under 40-7-20l(l)(a) or (l)(b) and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">(1) the court of the other state determines it no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under 40-7-202 or that a court of this state would be a more convenient forum under 40-7-108; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">(2) a court of this state or a cotut of the other state determines that the child, the child\u2019s parents, and tuny person acting as a parent do not presently reside in the other state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Section 40-7-201(l)(a) and (l)(b), MCA, referenced in \u00a7 40-7-203, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">Initial child custody jurisdiction. (1) Except as otherwise provided in 40-7-204, a court of this state has jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">(a) this state is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding or was the home state of the child within 6 months before the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this state but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">(b) a court of another state does not have jurisdiction under subsection (l)(a), or a court of the home state of the child has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that this state is the more appropriate forum under 40-7-108 or 40-7-109, and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-11\">(i) the child and the child\u2019s parents, or the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent, have a significant connection with this state other than mere physical presence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">(ii) substantial evidence is available in this state concerning the child\u2019s care, protection, training, and personal relationships</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">In sum, under the UCCJEA, in order to modify a determination made by a court of another state, a Montana court must have jurisdiction under \u00a7 40-7-20l(l)(a), MCA, or \u00a7 40-7-20l(l)(b)(i) and (ii), MCA; <em>and </em>\u00a7 40-7-203(1), MCA, <em>or </em>\u00a7 40-7-203(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">\u00b630 In its order accepting jurisdiction over the Oregon parenting plan, the District Court found that both Cox and Dylan were residing in Deer Lodge and that Dylan had significant contacts in Montana. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Additionally, a review of the record reveals that Cox and Dylan moved to Montana in the fall of 1999, most likely in October, which would have established the requisite six-month \u201chome state\u201d criteria of \u00a7 40-7-201(l)(a), MCA,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> prior to Paslov\u2019s filing of his April 2000 motion to amend the Oregon parenting plan. Neither party asserts that the six-month period was not satisfied. The District Court\u2019s finding of \u201csignificant contacts\u201d constitutes fulfillment of only part of the requisite criteria of \u00a7 40-7-201(1)(b), MCA, specifically, subpart (i). However, fulfillment of \u00a7 40-7-201(1)(b), MCA, is not necessary in light of fulfillment of the criteria of \u00a7 40-7-201(1)(a), MCA, as long as \u00a7 40-7-203(1) or \u00a7 40-7-203(2), MCA, is met. The court\u2019s finding that Dylan and Cox were residing in Montana meets the requirement of \u00a7 40-7-203(2), MCA (\u201cthe child, [and] the child\u2019s parents ... do not presently reside in the other state\u201d). Thus, Montana met the requisite jurisdictional requirements under \u00a7 40-7-201(1)(a) and \u00a7 40-7-203(2), MCA. Additionally, the record reflects that Cox specifically stipulated to Montana jurisdiction. Therefore, we accept as appropriate Montana\u2019s initial decision and exercise of jurisdiction over the Oregon parenting plan leading to its order of September 11, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b631 The question then'becomes whether the District Court retained that jurisdiction under subsection (d) of the PKPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Montana\u2019s Jurisdiction under the PKPA</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b632  The PKPA enables a sister state to modify a child custody determination of the first state when (1) it has jurisdiction to make such a child custody determination under its own laws; <em>and </em>(2) the court of the first state no longer has jurisdiction, either by losing jurisdiction or declining to exercise such jurisdiction to modify such determination. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(f); <em>Erler, </em>261 Mont. at 70, 862 P.2d at 15-16. Therefore, before a second state may modify a decree of the first state, the first state must have lost or given up its \u201ccontinuing\u201d or \u201cpending\u201d jurisdiction. If Montana has not lost jurisdiction, the Samoan Court has no authority to assume jurisdiction, and instead, it must enforce the Montana custody determination. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u00b633  A state retains \u201ccontinuing\u201d jurisdiction as long as it satisfies two requirements: (1) it has jurisdiction under its own law, and (2) it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>remains the residence of the child or any of the contestants. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(d). If a state has \u201ccontinuing\u201d jurisdiction, other states must enforce, and may not modify, the custody determination by the first state. Here, at the time the District Court made its September 11, 2000, custody determination awarding sole custody to Paslov, the District Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 40-7-203, MCA, satisfying the first requirement of \u00a7 1738A(d): jurisdiction under its own law. Nevertheless, the second requirement of subsection (d)-the state remains the residence of the child or any of the contestants-was no longer satisfied as of July 8, 2000, when Cox and Dylan relocated to American Samoa. Although Cox and Dylan were no longer in Montana because Cox removed Dylan across state lines while custody proceedings were pending in Montana, an act which the PKPA was designed to prevent, the fact remains that neither of the parties nor the child resided in Montana. Thus, Montana did not retain \u201ccontinuing\u201d jurisdiction as that term is defined for the specific purposes of the PKPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b634 However, the PKPA also provides that, in addition to \u201ccontinuing\u201d jurisdiction, the first state may also retain \u201cpending\u201d jurisdiction. Subsection (g) of the PKPA directs a court to abstain from exercising jurisdiction in \u201cany proceeding for a custody or visitation determination commenced during the pendency of a proceeding in a court of another State where such court of that other State is exercising jurisdiction consistently with the provisions of [the Act] to make a custody or visitation determination.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(g). Thus, the question is whether, following the District Court\u2019s custody order of September 11, 2000, it retained \u201cpending jurisdiction\u201d of the matter at the time Cox Initiated the action in American Somoa on November 22, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b635 Judge Mizner\u2019s order of September 11,2000, clearly provides that he was anticipating psychological reports from licensed therapists for further custody and visitation determinations. Additionally, the court ordered that the search for Cox\u2019s whereabouts continue and be reported back to it. Further, Cox, in her deferred prosecution for Parental Interference, agreed to follow all valid court orders issued in this matter. All of these demonstrate the District Court still had \u201cpending\u201d proceedings that ultimately were going to impact the custody and visitation of Dylan.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b636 While it is not necessary for further analysis, we will briefly review Cox\u2019s argument that American Samoa could exercise emergency jurisdiction pursuant to the PKPA. The PKPA provides for emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>jurisdiction when the child is physically present in the state and it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child has been \u201csubjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(2)(C)(ii). Cox asserts her decision to return to American Samoa was based on fear because Paslov had threatened her life and the lives of her children, and that Paslov had a propensity for violence. Paslov, conversely, characterizes Cox\u2019s actions as a \u201csecret flight to Samoa\u201d for the purpose of unilaterally \u201csnatching\u201d the child in hopes of finding another forum in which she could obtain a more favorable outcome. Even if Cox\u2019s allegations of Paslov\u2019s drug abuse, violent propensities and fear for her and her children\u2019s lives are true, at best, the Samoan court should only have exercised temporary emergency jurisdiction under the PKPA whereby it protected Dylan from substantial and imminent harm and continued emergency jurisdiction only until the proper forum was determined; and in this case, that forum is the Montana court system. In fact, the District Court found that Cox \u201chad several legal remedies available to her to protect herself and her child from [Paslov] in this jurisdiction if in fact she felt threatened by him.\u201d Instead, Cox left the jurisdiction without notice to either Paslov or the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b637  It must be remembered that the purpose of the UCCJEA, and the PKPA, is to prevent precisely what occurred here, the removal of a child from one jurisdiction to another, in order to obtain a different result regarding custody or other matters affecting the minor child. While bad acts occurred on both sides of this case, it remains that under the law, Cox cannot divest Montana of jurisdiction simply by removing Dylan to American Samoa, which does not recognize the UCCJEA, thereby to restart the entire issue. We are satisfied the District Court was fully aware of and properly applied the correct law in addressing this jurisdictional issue. We conclude the District Court did not decline jurisdiction to American Samoa, and instead retained jurisdiction under the \u201cpending\u201d jurisdiction provision of the PKPA.</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">\u00b638 The District Court\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\"> <em>See Erler v.

Further, the Court completely ignores the only proper factfinding-that which is based upon discovery, sworn testimony of parties represented by counsel, cross-examination and credibility determinations by a neutral magistrate-which has been conducted in this case, that of the High Court of American Samoa. Concluding that American Samoa had no jurisdiction, the Court then refuses to consider the only credible evidence herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b641 Indeed, the Court brushes aside the facts and declares, without evidentiary support, that \u201cboth parties have acted grievously in this matter with assertions of abuse, stalking and kidnapping.\u201d Nothing could be further from the truth. While the Court may find such blame-spreading convenient, the evidence establishes that only Paslov has engaged in such behaviors-over many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b642 The Court\u2019s inadequate review mimics that of the District Court, which passed judgment on the Samoan order after only the briefest consideration. It made only the sparse finding that \u201cthe parties had an argument in the Wal Mart store in Butte, Montana after [Paslov] had been repeatedly denied visitation with his son,\u201d and did so without benefit of a hearing with all parties present. This Court refers to that incident innocuously as a \u201cpublicly heated argument,\u201d but worse, fails to acknowledge the mountain of evidence of Paslov\u2019s repeated abuse beyond the Wal-Mart incident. In its opinion and order, which this Court chooses to ignore, the Samoan court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">This court, unlike the Montana court, had the benefit of an <em>inter partes </em>adversarial trial. The evidence before us clearly shows that Respondent [Paslov] has a history of drug abuse and a demonstrated propensity for violence. Furthermore, Respondent\u2019s recent pattern of hostility towards Petitioner [Cox] because of her proposed marriage culminating in the incident at the Montana Wal Mart, makes evident Respondent\u2019s current instability and inability to cope with certain realities, namely Petitioner\u2019s plan to remarry. We are not satisfied that Minor will not be subjected to these harms while in Respondent\u2019s primary care, and therefore, exercise jurisdiction to protect the child\u2019s best interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">This conclusion is consistent with the background of the litigation. The original custody decree, entered in Oregon, designated Cox as Dylan\u2019s primary custodian and restricted Paslov to supervised visitation for which he was required to pay Dylan\u2019s transportation costs. Thus, two jurisdictions, Oregon and American Samoa, have reviewed this matter with proper factfinding, and both have concluded that Paslov should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>not have custody of Dylan. However, this Court, without benefit of proper factfinding, reaches the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b643 The Court attempts to avoid the facts by claiming this is \u201csimply a jurisdictional matter.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 24. However, it has erred in its application of jurisdictional principles as well. First, the Court minimizes Paslov\u2019s stalking and violence by tritely declaring, without benefit of evidence, that \u201cbad acts occurred on both sides.\u201d However, this washing of Paslov\u2019s abuse from the Court\u2019s hands is incorrect as a matter of law. Domestic violence is a concern which the courts must consider superior to a victim\u2019s relocation to another area to avoid such harm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">[W]e hold that when a court finds <em>intimate partner violence or abuse of a child has occurred or that a party has fled Montana to avoid further violence or abuse, </em>the court is authorized to consider whether the party and the child might be better protected if further custody proceedings were held in another state. ... <em>[W]e urge district courts to give priority to the safety of victims of domestic violence when considering jurisdictional issues </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIT\"><em>Stoneman v. Drollinger, </em>2003 MT 25, \u00b6 26, 314 Mont. 139, \u00b6 26, 64 P.3d 997, \u00b6 26 (emphasis added). Thus, Paslov\u2019s death threats, physical assaults upon Cox, drug abuse and ongoing threats of stalking (for which there is evidentiary support) should be given priority consideration in considering jurisdictional questions. Today, the Court turns its back on that important principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u00b644 In its next error of law, the Court concludes that American Samoa, at best, should have only exercised \u201ctemporary emergency jurisdiction under the PKPA\u201d to protect Dylan. <em>See </em>\u00b6 36. To the contrary, this was not an option for the Samoan court. \u201cTemporary emergency jurisdiction\u201d is not provided by the PKPA, but, rather, is authority provided by the UCCJEA, which the Montana Legislature adopted in 1999, and which is codified at Section 40-7-204, MCA. The error here is the failure to recognize that American Samoa has not adopted the UCCJEA, and, thus, cannot exercise \u201ctemporary\u201d jurisdiction thereby. As explained herein, American Samoa assumes custodial jurisdiction in two ways: (1) under its common law, and (2) by reference to the <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, </em>\u00a7 79 (1971). Section \u00a7 79(b) of the <em>Restatement, </em>entitled \u201cCustody of the Person,\u201d mirrors the language in the PKPA regarding \u201cemergency jurisdiction\u201d without reference to the term \u201ctemporary.\u201d <em>See Restatement (Second) of Conflict of La ws </em>\u00a7 79(b)(1971)(1988 Revisions). Therefore, American Samoa, which i s included under the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>PKPA, properly proceeded under the jurisdiction available to it under the federal act: \u201cemergency jurisdiction.\u201d No reference to \u201ctemporary\u201d jurisdiction exists in the PKPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b645 To determine whether American Samoa properly acted to protect Dylan requires application of the two-pronged test for jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(f)(l) and \u00a9(2) of the PKPA. Specifically, a state court has jurisdiction for purposes of the PKPA if (1) it has custody jurisdiction under its own laws, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(l), and (2) one of the following five conditions is met: (a) home state jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(2)(A); (b) significant connection jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(2)(B); (c) emergency jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(2)(C); (d) default jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(2)(D); or (e) continuing jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b646 American Samoa exercises jurisdiction and modifies foreign custody decrees where the child in question is present in the territory. The High Court of American Samoa explained that Samoa exercises its jurisdictional authority under its common law and by reference to the <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws. See, e.g. In re Minor Child, </em>28 A.S.R.2d 33 (Trial Div. 1995); <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 79(b) (1971) (\u201cA state has power to exercise jurisdiction to determine the custody ... of a child ... who is present in the state ....\u201d). Although American Samoa has adopted neither the UCCJA nor the UCCJEA, such statutory basis for the proper exercise of jurisdiction over child custody determinations is not a requirement under the PKPA, which provides that a state need only \u201cha[ve] jurisdiction under the law of such State.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(1). Thus, American Samoa\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction based upon its finding that Dylan was present in the territory, and had, in fact, been there from July 8, 2000, was proper under its laws, and therefore satisfied the initial requirement of the PKPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u00b647 However, for a child custody or visitation determination to be consistent with the PKPA, it is additionally necessary for a court to have met one of the five conditions enumerated in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(2). Subpart (c)(2) of the PKPA reveals that the High Court of American Samoa correctly noted in its July 17,2001, opinion and order awarding custody to Cox that only one of the five bases need be met. The Samoan court stated that it had jurisdiction if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">(C) the child is physically present in such State and (i) the child has been abandoned, or (ii) it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child, a sibling, or parent of the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>has been subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse[.] Although the District Court stated in its July 22, 2002, enforcement order that \u201c[a] reading of the decision of the Samoan court reveals that it did not determine its jurisdiction based on the exigent and emergency circumstances now urged by the Respondent [Cox],\u201d it is evident from the foregoing excerpt of the Samoan court\u2019s order that it did so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b648 The Court\u2019s errors of law are evident from a reading of the authorities in the field, which address this precise situation. As noted by Minneman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">Where an emergency situation is alleged there is a clear tension between the goal of acting immediately to protect the child and the goal of not allowing the emergency jurisdictional provision of the UCC JA and PKPA to be used to end-run other jurisdictional rules. The temptation to a parent to cry emergency when there is no real emergency is no doubt strong, inasmuch as a loving parent often has little problem in convincing himself or herself that the established custody arrangement is harmful.... [Thus,] trial court judges would be advised to <em>take a close look </em>to determine if they should invoke emergency jurisdiction under the UCC JA or PKPA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6h\">Minneman, 80 A.L.R. 5th at 142 (emphasis added). The Court today overlooks Minneman\u2019s admonition that courts must \u201ctake a close look\u201d at the facts to determine the jurisdictional question. Minneman, 80 A.L.R. 5th at 142. Instead, the Court completely ignores the facts found by the Samoan Court. The Samoan Court took a very close and very complete look at the facts in determining whether to invoke emergency jurisdiction, conducting a trial on the custody issue with both Cox and Paslov present and represented by counsel. The court heard testimony from Cox, Paslov, Warren, Diedre, and Don McGee, Cox\u2019s fiance. Cox testified, and Warren\u2019s deposition testimony corroborated, that on June 22, 2000, Paslov publicly threatened Cox and her children and said he was going to ruin her wedding, stalk her for the rest of her life, and make her miserable. As it turned out, this was but the tip of the iceberg of Paslov\u2019s abuse. Beyond this incident-the only incident the District Court referenced-there were many others, demonstrating a pattern of abuse by Paslov over many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b649 Cox further testified that during their nine-year marriage, Paslov had a history of drug abuse, using crack and cocaine regularly. She added that Paslov\u2019s physical abuse was a fairly regular event which occurred in front of the children. She stated that in 1993 Paslov was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>jailed for grabbing her by the neck. She further indicated that over the years she had been granted temporary restraining orders when Paslov physically hurt her, including one incident in which she sustained a broken wrist. Cox testified, and both Warren and Diedre corroborated, that Paslov had physically abused Warren, then aged 13, by grabbing him by the neck and slamming him against the wall, when he tried to intervene in an altercation between Paslov and Cox, who was then nine months pregnant with Dylan. Warren testified that he found drug paraphernalia and drugs in the house during the time his mother was married to Paslov, including cut-up straws, razor blades, and zip lock packages containing cocaine powder. Warren also testified that Paslov drank.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b650 Warren, now aged 19, further characterized Paslov as a manipulative and dangerous man with whom he never liked being alone. Both Diedre and Warren testified that when Dylan, as an infant, was left in Paslov\u2019s care, Paslov would leave the house in the middle of the night, leaving them to care for Dylan when he cried. At other times, Paslov would shake his fists at Dylan when he cried, or shake the crib and tell him to \u201cjust shut up.\u201d Warren testified he heard Paslov tell Cox he hated her; and Cox testified Paslov said he hated Warren and Diedre, and hoped the baby (Dylan) would die.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b651 Based upon the parties\u2019 testimony at trial, the Samoan court entered detailed and complete findings of fact. It found that throughout the couple\u2019s marriage, Paslov demonstrated an \u201cunpredictably violent temperament\u201d and \u201cphysical hostility.\u201d Paslov \u201cbecame obsessively concerned with the possibility of another father figure in his son\u2019s life, and very resentful, if not outright jealous, over [Cox\u2019s] proposed remarriage.\u201d On June 22, 2000, four days before Paslov\u2019s scheduled visit with Dylan, and two days before Cox\u2019s marriage to McGee, Paslov \u201csomehow managed to track down [Cox] while she shopped for things for her wedding at Wal Mart in Butte, Montana,\u201d and \u201cranted and raved in the store\u201d calling Cox, among other things, \u201can evil adulteress cunt,\u201d and threatened to \u201cruin her wedding, stalk her for the remainder of her life, harm her and her children, and make the rest of her years miserable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b652 The Samoan court further found that Cox had been primarily responsible for Dylan\u2019s upbringing and his day-to-day needs, and that, as of the time of trial, she \u201ccontinued to provide [Dylan] with a stable and nurturing environment.\u201d The court found that while managing single parenthood, Cox had maintained gainful employment, but Paslov had not. The court also found significant Dylan\u2019s interaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>with his two older siblings, both of whom had actively participated in his upbringing. The court stated that it was \u201cnot convinced of [Paslov\u2019s] suitability for sole custody given his background with drug abuse coupled with his aggressive behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b653 This is compelling testimony, offered by multiple parties under oath and subject to cross-examination. Yet the Court ignores this evidence in favor of a platitude not based on evidence: that both parties have been \u201cbad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b654 In its final error of law, the Court concludes that Montana retained \u201cpending jurisdiction\u201d of the matter following the entry of its order on September 11,2000, and therefore, American Samoa was not empowered to later act under the PKPA. <em>See </em>\u00b6 37. However, for the first state to retain \u201cpending\u201d jurisdiction in a custody proceeding following its determination of custody, it must make a specific reservation or retention of jurisdiction to review the situation, to conduct further hearings, or to enter further orders. <em>See Diane W. v. Norman W. </em>(N.Y. 1982) 446 N.Y.S.2d 174, 175 (California\u2019s interlocutory order stating \u201cuntil further order of the court, which reserves jurisdiction in this regard,\u201d sufficient to prohibit New York\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction); <em>Burch v. Burch </em>(Fla. Ct. App. 1983), 424 So.2d 187, 188 (Florida erred in exercising jurisdiction where New York\u2019s order stated, \u201cmatter will come on for review in March, 1982\u201d); <em>Zellat v. Zellat </em>(Pa. Super. 1985), 506 A.2d 946, 950 (Pennsylvania could not exercise jurisdiction where Tennessee court ordered \u201cfurther hearings\u201d in the matter); <em>Greene v. Greene </em>(Fla. Ct. App. 1983), 432 So.2d 62, 62 (Florida court erred in assuming jurisdiction where Virginia court stated that it \u201cretained jurisdiction over the subject matter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b655 In the case <em>subjudice, </em>although the District Court\u2019s September 11, 2000, order granting custody to Paslov required the parties to undergo further psychological evaluations, the order does not indicate what, if any, further action was contemplated by the court. Under the case law, this ambiguity in purpose was insufficient to reserve \u201cpending jurisdiction,\u201d as defined by the PKPA, for purposes of barring the exercise of emergency jurisdiction by American Samoa.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u00b656 Based upon the foregoing, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that it retained subject matter jurisdiction was an incorrect interpretation of law under the PKPA. The District Court lost \u201ccontinuing\u201d jurisdiction when the child and both contestants relocated outside of the state. It retained \u201cpending\u201d jurisdiction only until September 11, 2000, when its custody order was entered. Thereafter, American Samoa was eligible to exercise emergency jurisdiction under the limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>circumstances allowed under the PKPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b657 It may appear counterintuitive and contrary to traditional jurisprudence to conclude that a court can acquire jurisdiction for purposes of determining custody, only to lose jurisdiction to another state following its custody determination because the custody matter is no longer \u201cpending.\u201d However, it must be understood that the loss of both \u201ccontinuing\u201d and \u201cpending\u201d jurisdiction is a limited possibility under the PKPA and occurs here only because of the very unique facts: the child and both parents were permanently located outside the state, and a custody proceeding was no longer pending in this state. It must also be understood that this loss of jurisdiction is possible under the PKPA in order to fulfill a narrow, but vital, purpose: to authorize another state to exercise jurisdiction under very specific circumstances-here, for American Samoa to protect the child in an alleged emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b658 The District Court\u2019s inadequate review of the American Samoan decision led it to conclude that the Samoan court \u201cdid not determine its jurisdiction based on ... exigent and emergency circumstances.\u201d However, to the contrary, the Samoan court concluded that \u201c[t]he circumstances in this case clearly create an emergency substantial enough to confer upon this court jurisdiction to protect Minor from Respondent [Paslov].\u201d Likewise, this Court has turned its back on the evidence, rejected a sister state\u2019s careful action to protect a child from abuse, and made an error of great significance.
