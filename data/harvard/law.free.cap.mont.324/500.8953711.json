Collins (Lonnie) appeals from the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law entered by the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, awarding marital assets to his former spouse, Gail N. Collins (Gail). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">\u00b62 We restate the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in determining the value of</p>\n<p id=\"b517-16\">the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-17\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in distributing the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-18\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b517-19\">\u00b65 Gail and Lonnie were married on December 31,1972, in Billings, Yellowstone County. At the time of the dissolution, the parties had been married nearly 32 years. When they were first married, Lonnie was working as a switchboardman for Burlington Northern Railroad and Gail briefly worked two jobs at El Caf\u00e9 and Montgomery Wards in Billings, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-20\">\u00b66 In 1973, the parties moved to Laurel and purchased a house and three lots with joint assets. Between 1973 and 1978, Gail maintained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>and renovated the house as well as cared for Lonnie\u2019s mother as she battled with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Gail also cared for three of Lonnie\u2019s children from another marriage during the same time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b67 In 1979, Lonnie was injured in a railroad accident and received a $135,000 settlement in a claim against Burlington Northern. The proceeds of that settlement were used to purchase and move another house from Billings onto the lot in Laurel where their existing house was situated. The existing house and the new house were joined together at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b68 The couple also used the proceeds to set up an antique business, Blue Bell Businesses (Blue Bell), in the back portion of the new house. Although Blue Bell was set up as a <em>de facto </em>partnership, Gail eventually ran Blue Bell as a sole proprietorship and Lonnie operated a separate sole proprietorship selling antiques called Frogfur Businesses (Frogfur) under the business license for Blue Bell. Both Gail and Lonnie earned money from their respective businesses and expended the same on the real property, each other and the businesses. Lonnie also received auctioneer work after graduating from the Western College of Auctioneering in the 1980s. Gail had no other source of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b69 On July 5, 2002, Lonnie obtained Gail\u2019s keys to the premises and locked her out of the residence. Barring her from the house, Lonnie forced Gail to move out of the residence and into the office/storeroom of Blue Bell. About a week later, a physical altercation ensued between Lonnie and Gail over Gail\u2019s alleged removal of certain items from the premises. The police responded to the situation and Gail was taken to the YWCA Gateway House. On July 29, 2002, Gail obtained a temporary order of protection against Lonnie.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u00b610 On August 8, 2002, Lonnie and Gail signed documents prepared by a certified public accountant, Steven Cosner, entitled, \u201cJoint Petition for Dissolution of Marriage, Declaration of Assets, Liabilities, Income and Expenses.\u201d The couple also signed a quit-claim deed transferring interest in the residence from Gail to Lonnie. Lonnie\u2019s disclosure in the documents did not include Frogfur\u2019s value and Gail did not have any input in their preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u00b611 Upon review of the documents, Gail called Lonnie to inform him the documents did not accurately depict the property in her possession. Lonnie replied the documents had to appear equal in order to secure a divorce. Gail went ahead and signed the documents which were subsequently notarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">\u00b612 On August 9, 2002, Lonnie filed the joint petition for dissolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>in Yellowstone County and recorded the quit-claim deed with the Yellowstone County Clerk and Recorder. On August 12, 2002, Gail filed a response to the joint petition for dissolution and related documents claiming the original filing was signed under duress. On the same date, a final order of protection was issued by the Justice Court, City of Billings, continuing the terms and conditions of the July 29, 2002, temporary order of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b613 On January 3, 2003, Lonnie encumbered the real property with a deed of trust to secure a loan from CitiFinancial, Inc., in the amount of $44,050.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b614 After the parties\u2019 separation, Gail attempted to run Blue Bell on her own. However, the business failed to be profitable or provide her with a livable income. Discouraged, Gail held a \u201cgarage sale\u201d where she attempted to sell Blue Bell\u2019s inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b615 A trial was held on November 17, 2003. After trial, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on January 12, 2004, awarding 55% of the marital estate to Gail. Lonnie appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\u00b616  We review a district court\u2019s division of marital property to determine whether the findings of fact on which the court relied are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Engen, </em>1998 MT 153, \u00b6 26, 289 Mont. 299, \u00b6 26, 961 P.2d 738, \u00b6 26. If the findings are not clearly erroneous, we will affirm the distribution of property unless the court abused its discretion. <em>Engen, </em>\u00b6 26. To conclude that a district court abused its discretion in dividing marital property, we must determine that the district court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Engen, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">\u00b617  The district court has broad discretion in determining the value of property in dissolution. Its valuation can be premised on expert testimony, lay testimony, documentary evidence, or any combination thereof. The court is free to adopt any reasonable valuation of marital property which is supported by the record as long as it is reasonable in light of the evidence submitted. <em>In re Marriage of Meeks </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 237, 242-43, 915 P.2d 831, 834-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ALI\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">\u00b618 Whether the District Court erred in determining the value of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u00b619 Lonnie argues the District Court abused its discretion in determining the value of the marital estate. Specifically, Lonnie asserts the District Court\u2019s findings lack substantial credible evidence supporting its valuation of the couple\u2019s real property and businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"AGd\">\u00b620 Initially, Lonnie asserts the District Court erroneously included the commercial portion of the couple\u2019s residence in valuing the real property at $140,135. Lonnie contends the court\u2019s valuation including both the residential and commercial space was incorrectly based on an informal appraisal conducted by a private real estate broker and the value placed on the property by the State of Montana for tax purposes, neither of which took into account the outstanding encumbrance of $44,050. He maintains the valuation should be placed at $100,000 based on the existing debt and the testimony of his expert who utilized a comparable sales approach in estimating the property\u2019s value. Further, Lonnie alleges the court incorrectly awarded half the value of the real property without consideration of the debt owing. Instead of awarding Gail the fair market value less the encumbrance, he argues the court unfairly burdened him with the outstanding debt while providing Gail an additional award of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b621 Lonnie next alleges the District Court erred in valuing Blue Bell at $8,114 and Frogfur at $30,419. Lonnie argues the court incorrectly based its findings on the testimony of Gail\u2019s expert, James Connors (Connors), who, Lonnie claims, is unqualified as an expert in valuing businesses. Lonnie also contends the court credited assets to Gail twice even though she liquidated inventory from the businesses to support herself after the petition for dissolution was filed. As such, Lonnie alleges Gail was allowed to liquidate marital property yet receive a benefit in the decree based on assets no longer in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b622 Gail first argues the District Court correctly determined the value of the real property. Gail asserts the testimony of her expert, Vern Gebhart (Gebhart), a real estate broker previously hired by Lonnie to assist in selling the property, established a high value of the entire property at $168,667. Gail also presented the testimony of Sharon Grant, manager of the Yellowstone County Department of Revenue, who placed a low total value of $129,070 on both the residential and commercial portions of the real property. Gail contends the District Court did not abuse its discretion by averaging these two valuations and disregarding Lonnie\u2019s expert\u2019s appraisal, whose assessment was made for the purpose of enabling Lonnie to take out a loan after the dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u00b623 Gail next argues the District Court did not err in reaching its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>valuation of the businesses. Gail contends her expert witness, Connors, made an accurate appraisal of the businesses utilizing an asset-based approach which provides a liquidation value of all assets and liabilities of the business to arrive at a proper valuation. Although Gail admits Connors had never valued a small business for purposes of a divorce, his testimony was based on a treatise published by the ABA Section of Family Law and consistent with standards applied by leading national experts in the field. Gail also contends the valuation of inventory and equipment for both businesses was made at the date of the parties\u2019 separation and includes all items sold at the garage sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b624  We conclude the District Court did not err in determining the value of the marital estate. First, the court properly considered substantial credible evidence in valuing the real property. Indeed, both parties presented evidence at trial regarding the real property\u2019s value. Lonnie\u2019s expert estimated a value of $100,000 for the residential portion of the real property. Gail\u2019s experts, Gebhart and Grant, valued the real property, including both the residential and commercial portions, at $168,667 and $129,070 respectively. Adjusting Gebhart\u2019s valuation to the Laurel market and averaging it with the State\u2019s value, the District Court found the real property, including both the commercial and residential portions, yielded a value of approximately $140,135. Further, the District Court found Lonnie, acting in his individual capacity, had encumbered the real property with a deed of trust in the amount of $44,050 and therefore was solely responsible for its repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b625 Second, the District Court also correctly considered substantial credible evidence in valuing the Blue Bell and Frogfur businesses. Again, the court was presented with testimony regarding the value of both businesses. Through videotape deposition, Gail submitted the testimony of Connors, an expert in the field of business valuation. Connors testified to three different methods used when valuing a business. Of the three methods, the District Court adopted the asset-based approach, which provides a liquidation value of all assets and liabilities of the business to arrive at a business valuation. The District Court reasoned the asset-based approach was the only accurate method to use when a business was no longer a going concern, as is the case here. Further, the District Court noted Lonnie did not introduce expert testimony regarding the proper valuation method nor did he have the business valued by an appraiser or other qualified individual. Finally, the court found the \u201cgarage sale\u201d to which Lonnie alluded and objected to, was made as of the date of the parties\u2019 separation in 2002 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>and thus did not factor into the valuation for either business.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b626 We have recognized district courts face a considerable task in determining property valuation. In the final analysis, it is not a question of whether we would be persuaded to reach a different conclusion after considering the same evidence. Rather, the test is whether the district court had adequate evidence to support its conclusions. <em>In re Marriage of Haines, </em>2002 MT 182, \u00b6 23, 311 Mont. 70, \u00b6 23, 53 P.3d 378, \u00b6 23. Therefore, we affirm the District Court\u2019s findings in regards to the valuation of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b627 Whether the District Court erred in distributing the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\u00b628 Lonnie argues the District Court abused its discretion by attributing to him the full amount of the home mortgage and the Frogfur business. Lonnie asserts his share should not be burdened with the home mortgage because he used the loan proceeds to pay off Gail\u2019s credit card debts, make improvements on the commercial building and replace other items taken by Gail after she filed for dissolution. Further, Lonnie maintains the court erred in dividing the value of the real property while awarding him the value of Frogfur\u2019s inventory and equipment. Lonnie asserts since the court awarded him the value and possession of the inventory and equipment, he is also entitled to the value of the commercial building that currently houses those items.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">\u00b629 Gail counters the District Court did not abuse its discretion in distributing the marital estate. Gail asserts the mortgage was procured after the parties separated and without her consent. Further, Gail contends Lonnie failed to produce any evidence at trial indicating the loan proceeds had been paid to a creditor, used for improvements or employed to replace household items. Finally, Gail maintains she contributed to the real property\u2019s purchase, maintenance and renovation during the party\u2019s marriage and therefore is entitled to an equitable portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">\u00b630 The criteria for determination of the division of property is defined in \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">(1) In a proceeding for a dissolution of a marriage ... the court... shall... finally and equitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both, however and whenever acquired and whether the title thereto is in the name of the husband or wife or both. In making the apportionment, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>court shall consider the duration of the marriage ... the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of each party... [T]he court shall consider those contributions of the other spouse to the marriage, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">(a) the nonmonetary contribution of a homemaker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">(b) the extent to which such contributions have facilitated the maintenance of this property ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In applying the statute, the court enjoys wide discretion in equitably apportioning the marital estate. <em>In </em>re <em>Marriage of Dow </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 319, 323, 862 P.2d 1123, 1125. An equitable distribution does not require a 50/50 distribution of the marital estate. <em>In re Marriage of McNellis </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 492, 501, 885 P.2d 412, 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u00b631  We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in distributing the marital estate. The court properly considered testimony at trial Lonnie, acting in his individual capacity, encumbered the real property with a deed of trust to secure a loan from CitiFinancial, Inc., in the amount of $44,050. The court found Lonnie used $14,252 of the loan proceeds to pay off the existing mortgage on the real property and $2,048 was used to pay the costs of the loan. The remaining proceeds, $27,750, were used by Lonnie for personal expenses. The court presumably did not make additional findings as to the disposition of the remaining $27,750 because Lonnie did not produce receipts, invoices or other documents showing debt remittal, costs for improvements or replacement costs as he alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"Ait\">\u00b632  Similarly, the District Court did not err in apportioning 55% of the marital estate to Gail and 45% to Lonnie. First, the court found the terms of the August 8, 2002, property settlement agreement were unconscionable and unenforceable due to Gail\u2019s inability to aid in its preparation, Lonnie\u2019s failure to disclose the value of the Frogfur business and the inherent inequity its enforcement would procure. Next, the court made extensive findings regarding the health, education and economic position of both parties. The court found Gail contributed as a homemaker and caregiver for Lonnie\u2019s children and mother. Gail suffered from a medical condition which necessitated spending at least $100 a month on medication and had no medical insurance coverage. Further, Gail was unsuccessful in running the Blue Bell business herself after the separation, was unemployed and did not have a college degree. Finally, the court found Lonnie graduated from Western College of Auctioneering and received $1,200 a month in fixed income from a back injury he suffered in 1979 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>adversely affected his writing abilities. As such, the court distributed the assets according to the duration of the marriage, the age of the parties, their health, education and training pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\u00b633 Therefore, we affirm the District Court as to its distribution of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u00b634 Finally, Gail requests we award her attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P., based upon Lonnie\u2019s appeal of the District Court\u2019s order \u201cwithout substantial or reasonable grounds.\u201d As a general rule, this Court will not impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P., unless the appeal is entirely unfounded and intended to cause delay or unless counsel\u2019s actions otherwise constitute an abuse of the judicial system. <em>In re Marriage of Moss, </em>1999 MT 62, \u00b6 41, 293 Mont. 500, \u00b6 41, 977 P.2d 322, \u00b6 41 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\u00b635  In this case, we hold Lonnie\u2019s appeal was based on substantial and reasonable grounds, and was not intended to cause delay. Indeed, Lonnie elucidated several arguments why the District Court\u2019s valuation and division of property could have been modified or reversed. However, we are satisfied from the record and presentation of the appeal no reversible error occurred. Accordingly, we will not award Gail her attorney\u2019s fees and costs for having to respond to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\u00b636 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court as to its property valuation and distribution of the marital estate and do not award Gail attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b524-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
