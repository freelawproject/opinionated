Did the District Court err in admitting at the sentencing hearing interviews and testimony from victims in criminal cases in which Bar-Jonah had been convicted many years prior and from alleged victims of long past incidents never reported to the police?</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\u00b610 On the morning of December 13, 1999, Detective Robert Burton (\u201cDetective Burton\u201d), a nine-year veteran of the Great Falls Police Department, was driving to work when he observed Bar-Jonah walking a few blocks away from an elementary school. Burton stated he was concerned when he saw Bar-Jonah walking in that area because he knew Bar-Jonah had been previously convicted in Massachusetts of the kidnaping and attempted murder of two young boys while posing as a police officer, and he had been arrested in Great Falls in 1994 for sexual assault and charged with fondling the penis of an eight-year-old boy. (The charges in that case were dismissed in May 1996 because the victim\u2019s mother refused to allow the child to testify.) Burton also stated he had observed Bar-Jonah in the same area on two prior occasions the previous week. Burton contacted dispatch and requested a patrol unit make contact with Bar-Jonah to find out what he was doing in the vicinity of the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">\u00b611 Two Great Falls police officers responded to the call. Officer Brunk (\u201cBrunk\u201d) made contact with Bar-Jonah in the 400 block of 27th Street South. It was still dark outside, so Brunk turned on his spotlight and shined it on Bar-Jonah. Bar-Jonah was wearing a dark blue police-style jacket, a knit cap, and he had his hands in his pockets. Brunk asked Bar-Jonah to come to the front of the car and remove his hands from his pockets. Bar-Jonah ignored his request even after Brunk asked him a second time to take his hands from his pockets. At that time, Officer Badgley (\u201cBadgley\u201d) arrived. Brunk asked Bar-Jonah if he had something in his pocket and Bar-Jonah responded that he had a stun gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">\u00b612 Brunk had Bar-Jonah place his hands on the patrol car and Badgley did a pat down search for officer protection. Badgley found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>two cans of pepper spray, a toy gun, and a badge. Badgley then reviewed Montana statutes regarding impersonating a police officer and carrying a concealed weapon and contacted his shift commander, who advised him to file a report and release Bar-Jonah pending further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b613 Detective Bellusci (\u201cBellusci\u201d), an eighteen-year veteran of the Great Falls Police Department, and the investigating officer on the 1994 case against Bar-Jonah in which charges of sexual assault were eventually dropped, followed up on the police report from the December 13 incident. Bellusci consulted with Deputy County Attorney Julie Macek (\u201cMacek\u201d). Macek believed Bar-Jonah should be charged with Impersonation of a Public Servant (a police officer), in violation of \u00a7 45-7-209(1), MCA, and Carrying a Concealed Weapon (the toy gun), in violation of \u00a7 45-8-316, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b614 On December 15, 1999, Bellusci applied for a warrant to search Bar-Jonah\u2019s residence, and the warrant was issued. The warrant stated the police believed they had probable cause to believe Bar-Jonah had committed the offenses of Impersonation of a Public Servant and Carrying a Concealed Weapon. The warrant specified the police had reason to believe they would find the following items at Bar-Jonah\u2019s residence related to those offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">(1) a stun gun;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">(2) any police or law enforcement badges or replicas thereof or any other type of law enforcement identification, real or otherwise;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">(3) any police or law enforcement clothing items or replicas thereof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">(4) any items used for purposes of detaining other individuals, including but not limited to handcuffs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">(5) any guns or replicas thereof!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">The affidavit also requested permission to search for any other items of evidence or contraband discovered in the lawful course and scope of the authorized search related to the above-described offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">\u00b615 On December 15,1999, upon execution of the search warrant, the police seized numerous items from Bar-Jonah\u2019s apartment, including: a blue police coat, a silver toy revolver, a silver badge, a Stunmaster stun gun, a ball cap with the logo \u201csecurity enforcement,\u201d two disposable cameras, two albums with cutouts of children, one coat with a badge in the pocket and numerous photos and negatives. Bar-Jonah was subsequently arrested and charged with Impersonation of a Public Servant and Carrying a Concealed Weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">\u00b616 On December 17,1999, the Cascade County Attorney applied for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>a second search warrant. The application for the second warrant contained the same language as that for the first warrant pertaining to probable cause and related to the same offenses, Impersonation of a Public Servant and Carrying a Concealed Weapon. However, the second affidavit requested permission to search for developed pictures of young children or adults and undeveloped film, in addition to any other items of evidence related to the above-described offenses. Bellusci stated he applied for the second warrant because he felt it was necessary to gather evidence to show motive for the offenses listed in the warrant. The court signed the warrant on that date and the police searched Bar-Jonah\u2019s residence for the second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b617 During the course of the second search, the police seized a bulletin board containing pictures, 28 boxes of miscellaneous papers, newspaper clippings, and other miscellaneous items.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b618 Great Falls Police Sergeant John Cameron (\u201cCameron\u201d) was then assigned to investigate the Bar-Jonah case. Cameron had specialized training in interviewing victims of sexual abuse. Cameron examined all of the evidence seized from Bar-Jonah\u2019s apartment. One of the items recovered in the first search of Bar-Jonah\u2019s apartment appeared to be a victim list that Bar-Jonah had written in his own handwriting. The list contained many names, including those of the victims from Bar-Jonah\u2019s previous convictions in Massachusetts, and also the name of Zachary Ramsay, a Great Falls child who disappeared early one morning while on his way to school in 1996. While reviewing the victim list, Cameron and FBI agent James Wilson (\u201cWilson\u201d) were able to determine that two of the names on the list belonged to children who lived in the apartment directly above Bar-Jonah. Cameron also determined that some of the photographs from disposable cameras recovered in the first search depicted those same two children in Bar-Jonah\u2019s apartment, on his couch and on his bed. The same roll of film also contained pictures of Bar-Jonah on his bed in the nude, displaying his penis in various stages of erection. Given Bar-Jonah\u2019s past history as a pedophile, Cameron became concerned the children were possible victims of sexual abuse by Bar-Jonah.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b619 On June 29, 2000, Cameron and Wilson went to the apartment above Bar-Jonah\u2019s to request an interview with R.J., one of the children depicted in the photographs. Cameron interviewed R. J., who was fourteen years old at the time. R.J. disclosed that Bar-Jonah had sexually abused him. After interviewing R.J., Cameron and Wilson went to the residence of R.J.\u2019s cousin, S.J. S.J. disclosed that Bar-Jonah had also sexually abused him.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>\u00b620 In an information filed on July 5, 2000, Bar-Jonah was charged with three counts of Sexual Assault, one count of Aggravated Kidnaping and one count of Assault With a Weapon. Bar-Jonah pled \u201cnot guilty\u201d to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b621 On November 13, 2000, Bar-Jonah filed a Motion for Change of Venue. In the motion he contended, due to the publicity which linked him to the disappearance of Zachary Ramsay (\u201cRamsay\u201d), and due to the depth of feelings in Great Falls that surrounded the emotionally charged case, he could not receive a fair trial. The District Court granted the motion, ordering a change of venue for jury selection to Butte, Silver Bow County. However, jurors selected from Silver Bow County would be sequestered for the actual trial, which would be conducted in Cascade County. Trial was set to commence on January 16, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b622 On December 6, 2000, Bar-Jonah moved to suppress the items seized during the two searches of his residence. Before the District Court heard the Motion to Suppress, the State of Montana filed charges against Bar-Jonah for the aggravated kidnaping and deliberate homicide of the Ramsay boy. Upon the filing of these charges, Bar-Jonah\u2019s counsel withdrew due to a conflict of interest. On January 2,2001, new counsel for Bar-Jonah was appointed, and both the trial and the hearing on the suppression motion were vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"Aro\">\u00b623 On January 17,2001, the District Court held a status conference to address all charges pending against Bar-Jonah. At that conference, Bar-Jonah requested the District Court set the Ramsay homicide case for trial before the trial in the instant case due to the nationwide publicity surrounding the Ramsay case and the seriousness of the charges. The State objected, requesting the instant case be tried first, it being the oldest.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u00b624 On April 25, 2001, the District Court issued an order setting this case for trial on September 10, 2001, in Butte.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u00b625 On June 4, 2001, new counsel for Bar-Jonah filed a Motion to Suppress, to Dismiss and Supporting Memorandum. Bar-Jonah moved to suppress the items seized during the two searches of his residence on December 15 and 17, 1999, on the following basis: the searches resulted from an invalid investigative stop on December 13,1999; the searches were based on stale information; the searches were pretextual; and the items seized far exceeded the scope of the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\u00b626 On July 11, 2001, Bar-Jonah filed a Motion to Continue Trial, wherein he again requested the trial in this case be continued until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>after the Ramsay murder trial. Bar-Jonah argued this was the only way he could receive a fair trial in the Ramsay case.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b627 On July 25,2001, the District Court held a hearing on the motions to dismiss and to continue. The court reserved its ruling on both motions pending further briefing. Based upon Dr. Cohen\u2019s testimony, Bar-Jonah filed a second Motion for Change of Venue on August 8, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b628 On August 15, 2001, the District Court issued an order denying Bar-Jonah\u2019s motions for change of venue and to continue the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AEXG\">\u00b629 On August 17, 2001, the District Court issued an order denying Bar-Jonah\u2019s motion to suppress and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b630 OnFebruary 11,2002, Bar-Jonah filed another Motionfor Change of Venue based upon the high rate of prejudice indicated in the responses to juror questionnaires and upon negative pretrial publicity. The District Court denied the motion, and on February 19, 2002, this Court denied Bar-Jonah\u2019s Emergency Application for Writ of Supervisory Control.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\u00b631 The trial commenced on February 20, 2002. During the trial, the State offered as evidence two photo albums containing thousands of pictures of children, among them several photos of one of the alleged victims. Bar-Jonah objected to the exhibits, but the District Court admitted them into evidence. The State also offered as evidence a document containing an explanation of how to tie various knots, and an article entitled \u201cAutoerotic Asphyxia\u201d found in Bar-Jonah\u2019s apartment. Counsel for Bar-Jonah objected, but again the District Court overruled the objection and admitted the items into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"A-M\">\u00b632 On February 25, 2002, the jury found Bar-Jonah guilty on one count each of Sexual Assault, Aggravated Kidnaping and Felony Assault, not guilty on one count of Sexual Assault, and was deadlocked on one count of Sexual Assault. The court declared a mistrial on the deadlocked count and ordered a presentence report and psychosexual evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\u00b633 On May 23,2002, the District Court held a sentencing hearing in Great Falls. At the sentencing hearing, Bar-Jonah objected to the admission of pre-recorded interviews with victims of two of Bar-Jonah\u2019s previous convictions, Robert O\u2019Connor (\u201cO\u2019Connor\u201d) and Allan Enrickias (\u201cEnrickias\u201d), on the grounds the interviews constituted improper victim impact evidence. Bar-Jonah next objected to the admission of an interview with Dr. Eric Sweitzer, a Massachusetts counselor whose testimony that Bar-Jonah was not a sexually dangerous person contributed to his release from Bridgewater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Treatment Center in Massachusetts in 1991, on the grounds the interview lacked relevance. The District Court overruled Bar-Jonah\u2019s objections and allowed tapes of this testimony to be played and considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b634 Bar-Jonah also objected to the testimony of Dr. Robert Fournier, who claimed to have been sexually abused by Bar-Jonah when he was a child, twenty-five years earlier. Bar-Jonah was never charged with any offense in such alleged incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b635 Lori Kicker (\u201cMs. Kicker\u201d), the probation officer who prepared the presentence investigation and report (\u201cPSI\u201d), also testified at the sentencing hearing. Bar-Jonah moved to strike the PSI as biased because Ms. Kicker made no attempt to contact any members of his family and because he alleged she functioned as a victim\u2019s advocate in preparing the PSI, in spite of the statutory requirement to provide the court with an objective report and assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b636 The District Court found Bar-Jonah is a Level III sex offender (high level to reoffend) who poses an extreme danger to society, and his prospects for rehabilitation are virtually non-existent. The court sentenced Bar-Jonah to MSP for 10 years for Aggravated Kidnaping, 100 years for Sexual Assault, and 20 years for Felony Assault. The sentences are to be served consecutively with no possibility of parole. This appeal followed. Additional facts follow as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A-V\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\u00b637 Did the District Court err in denying Bar-Jonah\u2019s motion to suppress evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\u00b638 We review a district court\u2019s order on a motion to suppress to determine if the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Clayton, </em>2002 MT 67, \u00b6 8, 309 Mont. 215, \u00b6 8, 45 P.3d 30, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">\u00b639 Bar Jonah raises two arguments why his motion to suppress was improperly denied by the District Court. He first argues, given the totality of the circumstances, the police lacked the requisite particularized suspicion to conduct an investigative stop on December 13, 1999, and thus, because the information gained in that stop was used to support the probable cause necessary to issue the subsequent search warrants, any evidence gained as a result of the execution of the warrants must be suppressed. Second, Bar-Jonah argues the searches conducted on December 15 and 17, 1999, were improper because they exceeded the scope of the search warrants, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>information supporting probable cause was \u201cstale\u201d and the searches were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b640 We conclude the District Court did not err when it denied Bar-Jonah\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">A. The Initial Stop</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u00b641 Bar-Jonah contends the initial stop and questioning conducted by police in the early morning hours of December 13,1999, constituted an improper investigative stop and police violated Bar-Jonah\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, \u00a7 11 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u00b642 The standards in <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, and <em>United States v. Cortez </em>(1980), 449 U.S. 411, 417-18, 101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621, have been codified in Montana at \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">Investigative stop. In order to obtain or verify an account of the person\u2019s presence or conduct or to determine whether to arrest the person, a peace officer may stop any person ... that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person ... has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">\u00b643 In <em>Kleinsasser v. State, </em>2002 MT 36, \u00b6 12, 308 Mont. 325, \u00b6 12, 42 P.3d 801, \u00b6 12, we cited <em>State v. Gopher </em>(1991), 193 Mont. 189,194,631 P.2d 293, 296, wherein we set forth a two-part test for determining whether particularized suspicion is present. \u201c[I]n asserting that a law enforcement officer had the particularized suspicion to make an investigatory stop, the State has the burden to show: (1) objective data from which an experienced officer can make certain inferences; and (2) a resulting suspicion that the occupant of a certain vehicle is or has been engaged in wrongdoing ...,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">\u00b644 This Court has further held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">[W]hether particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact dependent on the totality of the circumstances. In evaluating the totality of the circumstances, a court should consider the quantity, or content, and quality, or degree of reliability, of the information available to the officer.\u2019 When the totality of the circumstances does not support a particularized suspicion, the investigatory stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>is not justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 13 (citations omitted). However, \u201c[a] particularized suspicion does not require that the law enforcement officer be certain that an offense has been committed.\u201d <em>State v. Henderson, </em>1998 MT 233, \u00b6 12, 291 Mont. 77, \u00b6 12, 966 P.2d 137, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b645 Bar-Jonah argues, in viewing the totality of the circumstances, the Great Falls Police Department lacked the requisite particularized suspicion of criminal activity to conduct an investigative stop. Bar-Jonah alleges his conduct on the date in question provided no objective indication of any type of criminal activity as he was simply walking down the street a few blocks from his home, minding his own business. He points out the stop occurred at least two blocks from the elementary school, there were no reports of children being anywhere in the vicinity and, although the application for search warrant contained a statement to the effect there had previously been a series of incidents reported of an unknown male in the school area who had approached children, these reports were unsubstantiated. Without citing any supporting case law, he argues the fact Detective Burton was familiar with Bar-Jonah\u2019s criminal history in and of itself is insufficient to justify an investigative stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u00b646 The State argues the initial contact between the officers and Bar-Jonah did not rise to the level of an investigative stop, rather it was merely a police-citizen encounter, which did not implicate the Fourth Amendment or Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution. <em>See United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554-55, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (holding the government may stop and question any individual for any reason as long as the person to whom questions are put remains free to disregard the questions and walk away; such an encounter is not a seizure). Citing <em>Clayton, </em>\u00b6 27, and <em>State v. Wagner, </em>2003 MT 120, \u00b6 31, 315 Mont. 498, \u00b6 31, 68 P.3d 840, \u00b6 31, the State argues under the present circumstances a reasonable person would have felt free to disregard the officer or leave. It was only when Bar-Jonah volunteered he had a stun gun in his pocket that the encounter became an investigative stop and, at that point, the officers had the \u201crequisite suspicion to conduct the ensuing investigative stop or seizure.\u201d <em>See Wagner, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>Clayton, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u00b647 Alternatively, the State argues even if the officer\u2019s initial encounter with Bar-Jonah was a seizure, based on the totality of the circumstances, the officer had particularized suspicion prior to initiating the stop based on his knowledge of Bar-Jonah\u2019s past crimes against children and his observation of Bar-Jonah walking near the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>elementary school, while it was still dark outside, wearing a dark police-style jacket and stocking cap, at a time when young children would be going to school.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b648 In denying Bar-Jonah\u2019s Motion to Suppress, the District Court, relying on <em>Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (holding mere police questioning does not constitute a seizure under the Constitution), agreed with the State\u2019s position that the initial stop of Bar-Jonah was not an investigative stop, but was merely a police-citizen encounter. Citing <em>United States v. Burton </em>(4th Cir. 2000), 228 F.3rd 524 (holding a police-citizen encounter may become an investigative stop), the District Court concluded the matter became an investigative detention only when Bar-Jonah admitted he was carrying a concealed stun gun, giving \u201cthe officer grounds to not only believe that a crime was being committed, but to conduct a protective search.\u201d <em>See United States v. Davis </em>(8th Cir. 2000), 202 F.3rd 1060, 1063 (\u201cThe danger to officer safety that justifies a protective search may arise after a consensual encounter or investigative stop has commenced\u201d). Therefore, the pat down search that produced the items, which together with other facts, formed the basis of the subsequent search warrants, was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b649  We disagree with the court\u2019s determination that the initial stop was a mere police-citizen encounter. Under the present circumstances a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave. In <em>State v. Roberts, </em>1999 MT 59, \u00b6 15, 293 Mont. 476, \u00b6 15, 977 P.2d 974, \u00b6 15, this Court held where a police officer who is armed and in uniform displays his authority by exiting his patrol car and approaching a citizen, the encounter constitutes an investigative stop, rather than a mere police-citizen encounter. In Bar-Jonah\u2019s case, Officer Brunk initiated the stop by pulling his police car over to the side of the road and shining a spotlight on Bar-Jonah in the dark. At that point, Bar-Jonah continued to walk down the sidewalk away from Brunk. As in <em>Roberts, </em>Brunk, who was armed and in uniform, demonstrated his authority over Bar-Jonah by immediately exiting his patrol car and ordering Bar-Jonah to stop. Brunk then repeatedly requested that Bar-Jonah remove his hands from his pockets and come to the front of the police car. When Bar-Jonah failed to comply, Brunk asked Bar-Jonah if he had something in his pocket he needed to be concerned about. During this time, a second uniformed officer appeared on the scene in his police car. It is clear that under these facts, the initial contact with Bar-Jonah constituted an investigative stop and not a voluntary encounter from which Bar-Jonah was free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b650  The District Court was correct in concluding there were sufficient facts to support a particularized suspicion that Bar-Jonah had or was about to commit the offense of impersonating a police officer. In applying the totality of the circumstances test to the facts of this case, we note that Detective Burton was an experienced officer with nine years on the Great Falls Police Department at the time he dispatched officers to initiate a stop of Bar-Jonah. This Court has consistently recognized that the experience of the law enforcement officer is an important element to consider in this analysis. <em>Gopher, </em>193 Mont. at 193, 631 P.2d at 295. Detective Burton, as an experienced law enforcement officer, could reasonably surmise that Bar-Jonah had committed, was committing, or was about to commit an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b651 The police did not rely on a single factor alone to infer Bar-Jonah was involved in criminal activity. Detective Burton believed Bar-Jonah had committed or was about to commit the offense of Impersonating a Public Servant, in violation of \u00a7 45-7-209(1), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">A person commits the offense of impersonating a public servant if the person falsely pretends to hold a position in the public service with the purpose to induce another individual to submit to the pretended official authority or otherwise to act in reliance upon that pretense to the individual\u2019s prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u00b652  At the time the stop was initiated Detective Burton knew Bar-Jonah had previously been charged with the kidnaping and attempted murder of two young children while posing as a police officer; Burton had been involved in investigating an allegation against Bar-Jonah of sexual assault on a youth in Great Falls; Burton observed Bar-Jonah wearing a police-style jacket; Bar-Jonah was in the area of an elementary school where there were young children; and Burton had observed Bar-Jonah in that same area twice in the previous week. These known facts, combined with the deductions made in light of nine years of experience in criminal investigation, reasonably led Detective Burton to suspect Bar-Jonah was involved in criminal activity. Taking all of these factors together, we conclude the District Court properly determined there were sufficient facts at the outset to support a particularized suspicion that Bar-Jonah had or was about to commit the offense of impersonating a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u00b653  We further conclude, once Bar-Jonah was lawfully detained, the officers were justified in conducting a pat down search for their own protection in accordance with \u00a7 46-5-401(2), MCA. Bar-Jonah\u2019s contention that the record does not present any evidence to suggest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>officers had reasonable cause to believe he was \u201carmed and presently dangerous\u201d is without merit. It is clear from the record that given Bar-Jonah\u2019s known criminal history and his statement that he was concealing a stun gun, the officers had sufficient reasonable cause to conduct the ensuing pat down search. <em>See State v. Evans </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 218, 226, 806 P.2d 512, 517 (where this Court held a stun gun is a weapon capable of producing serious bodily harm as defined in \u00a7 45-2-101(71), (59), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b654 The information gained from the investigative stop of Bar-Jonah was properly used to establish the probable cause necessary to issue the subsequent search warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">B. The Search Warrants</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b655 Bar-Jonah does not challenge the validity of the search warrant issued on December 15,1999, nor does he challenge the validity of the seizure of certain items specifically described in that warrant, such as the stun gun, garments and badges, that clearly related to the stated offenses of Impersonating a Public Official and Carrying a Concealed Weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u00b656 However, he argues the police went beyond the scope of the warrant and also seized cameras, photo albums, film negatives and various other items that were not in any way related to the offenses named in the search warrant. Bar-Jonah argues the evidence gathered during the searches of his residence on December 15 and 17, 1999, should be suppressed because the searches exceeded the scope of the search warrants, the searches were pretextual and some of the information used to establish probable cause for the warrants was impermissibly stale. Bar-Jonah asserts that since the seizure exceeded the scope of the warrant, both in terms of the items seized and the offenses which were the subject of the search, all such items must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\u00b657 We first note that \u201ca search and seizure, whether with or without a warrant, may not be held to be illegal if... any irregularity in the proceedings has no effect on the substantial rights of the accused.\u201d Section 46-5-103(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">\n<em>Scope of the Search</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">\u00b658 Bar-Jonah alleges that certain evidence seized as a result of the searches of his residence on December 15 and 17, 1999, should be suppressed because the searches exceeded the scope of the warrants. He argues that \u201conly items specifically enumerated [in the search warrant] may be seized, and once those items are found, the search must stop.\u201d <em>See United States v. Tamura </em>(9th Cir. 1982), 694 F.2d 591, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>595.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b659 With regard to the search warrant of December 17, Bar-Jonah alleges the items seized, including a bulletin board with pictures and 28 boxes of miscellaneous items, bore no relationship to the stated offenses and, therefore, also exceeded the scope of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b660 Finally, Bar-Jonah argues the \u201ccatchall\u201d language contained in both the December 15 and December 17 search warrants cannot justify the overbroad searches and seizures. Bar-Jonah contends this language exceeds that authorized by \u00a7 46-5-224, MCA, which authorizes only \u201cevidence\u201d or \u201ccontraband\u201d to be seized pursuant to a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b661 Relying on <em>United States v. Clark </em>(9th Cir. 1994), 31 F.3d 831 (holding a search warrant allowing the seizure of \u201cfruits and instrumentalities\u201d of an offense was overbroad), he argues, the \u201clanguage in the warrant authorizing the seizure of\u2018fruits\u2019 is overbroad and impermissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b662  The District Court correctly ruled items not described in a warrant may be seized so long as a \u201creasonable relationship\u201d exists between the items seized and the search authorized. In denying the Motion to Suppress, the District Court stated, \u201c[t]he officers performing the search[es] had reason, based on their experience, to believe the items that were not listed in the search warrant but were seized, might indicate a motive for the offense of impersonating an officer and would aid in the prosecution of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u00b663 Consistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">No warrant to search any place, or seize any person or thing shall issue without describing the place to be searched or the person or thing to be seized, or without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation reduced to writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The requirements for issuing a search warrant in Montana are codified in \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-11\">A judge shall issue a search warrant to a person upon application ... made under oath or affirmation, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-12\">(1) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-13\">(2) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that evidence, contraband, or persons connected with the offense may be found;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-14\">(3) particularly describes the place, object or persons to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>searched; and</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">(4) particularly describes who or what is to be seized. Additionally, \u00a7 46-5-224, MCA, defines what may be seized pursuant to a search warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">A warrant may be issued under this section to search for and seize any:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">(1) evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">(2) contraband; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">(3) person for whose arrest there is probable cause, for whom there has been a warrant of arrest issued, or who is unlawfully restrained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u00b664 With respect to the items that are the subject of the search, the warrant description must be specific enough to enable the person conducting the search reasonably to identify the things authorized to be seized, preventing general exploratory searches and indiscriminate rummaging through a person\u2019s belongings. <em>United States v. Spilotro </em>(9th Cir. 1986), 800 F.2d 959. However, the description need only be \u201creasonably specific rather than elaborately detailed.\u201d \u201cThe degree of specificity required is flexible and may vary depending on the circumstances and the type of items involved.\u201d <em>United States v. Holzman </em>(9th Cir. 1989), 871 F.2d 1496, 1508, <em>overruled on other grounds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">\u00b665  In determining whether the scope of the search is valid, this Court has long applied the \u201creasonable relationship\u201d test set forth in <em>State v. Quigg, </em>155 Mont. 119, 132, 467 P.2d 692, 699. In applying that test to the facts of this case, we agree with the District Court that a reasonable relationship existed between the items seized and Bar-Jonah\u2019s motive for impersonating a police officer and carrying a concealed stun gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">\u00b666  This Court has previously concluded where the items seized tend to establish whether or not an individual had a motive to commit the enumerated crime, it is sufficient to establish a fair probability that the items sought in a warrant application are connected to that crime. <em>See State v. Marks, </em>2002 MT 255, \u00b6 19, 312 Mont. 169, \u00b6 19, 59 P.3d 369, \u00b6 19 (concluding insurance and financial documents listed in the warrant were lawfully seized because they tended to establish a motive for committing the crime of arson specified in the warrant); <em>See generally Andresen v. Maryland, </em>427 U.S. 463, 467-68, 96 S.Ct. 2737, 2742, 49 L.Ed.2d 627 (where search warrant application sought permission to search for specified documents pertaining to the sale of a specified parcel of real estate, the Court concluded documents seized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>that related to other parcels not specified in the warrant were lawfully seized to show petitioner\u2019s motive or intent to commit the crime stated in the warrant). The fact the items seized may be used later to help form the evidentiary basis of another charge does not require their suppression in the present case. <em>Andresen, </em>427 U.S. at 484, 96 S.Ct. at 2750.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b667 With respect to the search warrant of December 15, the search warrant application set forth the basis for the officer\u2019s belief that Bar-Jonah may have been impersonating a police officer and carrying a concealed stun gun on December 13,1999, in an effort to kidnap and either molest or murder a child. Picture albums containing hundreds of photos of children, loose photos of children, undeveloped film and the other items at issue were reasonably related to Bar-Jonah\u2019s motive for impersonating a police officer and carrying a concealed stun gun. Further, the disposable cameras and undeveloped film might reasonably be expected to contain photos of Bar-Jonah dressed as a police officer, or photos of possible victims of assault or molestation.</p>\n<p id=\"A8R\">\u00b668 With respect to the items seized pursuant to the warrant dated December 17, it was reasonable for the police to return to Bar-Jonah\u2019s residence to sort through the numerous other boxes containing photographs and paper clippings to determine if any of those items would provide additional evidence of Bar-Jonah\u2019s motive for impersonating a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b669  Based on all the facts and circumstances, we conclude the description of items to be seized contained in the December 15 and 17, 1999, warrants were specific enough to enable the person conducting the search reasonably to identify the things authorized to be seized so as to not violate Bar-Jonah\u2019s constitutional rights and the officers had adequate reason to believe, based on their experience, common sense and knowledge of Bar-Jonah\u2019s criminal history, that the items in question (photo albums, disposable cameras, undeveloped film, and the three articles introduced at trial) were reasonably related to the criminal behavior enumerated in the warrant application.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b670 With respect to the items not entered into evidence at trial, the issue of whether their seizure was proper is moot and any error was harmless because Bar-Jonah\u2019s substantial rights were not affected. Section 46-5-103(l)(c), MCA. The fact that some of the items in question may have later been used by police as an evidentiary basis in filing charges against Bar-Jonah in the Ramsay case does not require us to suppress such evidence with respect to the instant case. <em>See Andresen, </em>427 U.S. at 484, 96 S.Ct. at 2750.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>\n<em>Pretextual Searches</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b671 Bar-Jonah next argues the searches that took place on December 15 and 17, 1999, were both \u201cpretextual\u201d searches in which the police were actually seeking evidence related to the disappearance of Ramsay. He contends the police returned the stun gun, police badge and other items to him when they stopped him on December 13,1999, because they intended to use those items as a \u201cpretext\u201d to gain access to Bar-Jonah\u2019s residence to search for evidence of more serious crimes. He further contends, because the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) participated in both searches, the searches were a pretext to gather evidence for the Ramsay case, as the FBI would not have involved itself had the charges been purely for impersonating a police officer and carrying a concealed weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b672 Finally, Bar-Jonah suggests his right to privacy has been violated under the Montana Constitution and accordingly, the evidence should be suppressed. However, Bar-Jonah does not cite any authority for this argument, in violation of Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. Therefore, we decline to address it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b673 The record does not support Bar-Jonah\u2019s contention that the searches were pretextual. First, Officer Badgley testified at the suppression hearing that the reason he did not arrest Bar-Jonah on December 13 was because he was not sure if a stun gun qualified as a weapon in Montana. Therefore, upon the advice of his superior officer, he returned the items to Bar-Jonah and let him go home until the police had a chance to investigate the issue further. Bar-Jonah did not present any evidence to contest this testimony. As probable cause existed for issuance of the search warrant, the officer\u2019s subjective intent in securing the warrant was irrelevant. <em>See Whren v. United States </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 1774, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (\u201cSubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis\u201d); <em>followed in State v. Farabee, </em>2000 MT 265, <em>\u00b6 </em>29, 302 Mont. 29, \u00b6 29, 22 P.3d 175, \u00b6 29 (\u201cWe have never held ... that an otherwise objectively justifiable traffic stop is nonetheless unlawful because a law enforcement officer used the stop to investigate a hunch about other criminal activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b674 Even were we to consider a subjective motive of law enforcement in securing the warrants, a search is \u201cpretextual\u201d only when the motivation or primary purpose of the arresting officers is to arrest a defendant for a minor offense so as to allow police to search for evidence of some other unrelated offense for which the police lack probable cause to arrest or search. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mota </em>(9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>1993), 982 F.2d 1384, 1386. Here, as in <em>Mota, </em>the fact that Bar-Jonah was arrested for one offense, but the searches revealed evidence that may have supported the charge of an even more serious offense, is not sufficient to conclude the searches were pretextual. Further, the searches were \u201creasonably related\u201d to the nature and purpose of Bar-Jonah\u2019s subsequent arrest for Impersonating a Public Official and Carrying a Concealed Weapon. Additionally, the two-day delay in obtaining a search warrant was justified by the officer\u2019s desire to ensure Bar-Jonah could be properly arrested for the offenses stated in the warrant. Once officers were sure of the law in this regard, they acted with due diligence to execute the search warrant to secure the evidence necessary to charge Bar-Jonah with those offenses. <em>See Williams v. United States </em>(9th Cir. 1969), 418 F.2d 159, 161. Accordingly, we hold the searches of Bar-Jonah\u2019s residence on December 15 and 17 were not pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\n<em>Stale Information</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b675 Bar-Jonah contends information in the applications for the December 15 and 17 search warrants was \u201cstale\u201d and could not be used to support probable cause. He argues the only instance the police could point to in which he utilized a \u201cpolice badge\u201d in the commission of a crime occurred 22 years prior. He also argues the police should not have relied on his 1993 arrest for sexual assault in support of the application because the case was dismissed in May 1996, and the charge was therefore unsubstantiated. He argues that under any legal standard, the information was \u201cstale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b676 Contrary to Bar-Jonah\u2019s contention that the information in the applications for search warrant is stale under \u201cany standard,\u201d applying the appropriate standard in Montana to the facts in this case, we hold the information was not stale, and thus was proper for use in supporting a determination of probable cause.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">A determination of whether information is too stale to be considered in establishing probable cause depends largely on the nature of the activity at issue. Where criminal activity is continuing in nature, information which would be stale when considered individually will carry greater weight in a probable cause determination when combined with more recent information. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\"><em>State v. Anderson, </em>1999 MT 60, \u00b6 14, 293 Mont. 490, \u00b6 14, 977 P.2d 983, \u00b6 14; <em>See also State v. O\u2019Neill </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 386, 395, 679 P.2d 760, 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u00b677 In <em>Anderson </em>this Court concluded that where an informant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>provided information related to the defendant\u2019s drug-related activities between 7 and 10 months prior to the search and seizure, the defendant had drug-related arrests 5 years and again 7 months prior to the search; and during the search, drugs were discovered in the trailer where Anderson was staying, a \u201cpattern of continuous conduct\u201d was demonstrated and the information was not stale for purposes of determining probable cause. Anderson, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b678 Similarly, in Bar-Jonah\u2019s case, the warrant applications established Bar-Jonah was a sexual offender whose prior convictions for kidnaping and attempted murder entailed the use of a police badge and handcuffs, making it reasonable for the police to conclude his <em>modus operandi </em>in gaining the confidence of young children was to impersonate a police officer; he was arrested again in 1993 for the sexual assault of a child, but the charges were subsequently dismissed; when police encountered Bar-Jonah near the elementary school on December 13, 1999, he was wearing a police-style jacket and was carrying a badge, stun gun and pepper spray. Taken together, these facts demonstrate a \u201cpattern of continuous conduct\u201d sufficient to support probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b679  Therefore, we agree with the District Court \u201c[t]he fact that the information of Mr. Bar-Jonah\u2019s prior conduct spanned a time frame from 1977 to 1993 does not disqualify it from being valid data to be considered with more recent information in determining whether or not a search warrant should be issued, and thus it is not impermissibly stale as the Defendant contends.\u201d Further, under the totality of the circumstances test set forth in <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527, and adopted in Montana in <em>Gopher, </em>these facts were sufficient to establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u00b680 Did the District Court err in denying Bar-Jonah\u2019s motions requesting a second change of venue and a reordering of the trials?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u00b681 In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for change of venue, this Court has held that it will only reverse the District Court\u2019s decision upon a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Hill, </em>2000 MT 308, \u00b6 50, 302 Mont. 415, \u00b6 50, 14 P.3d 1237, \u00b6 50. Our standard in reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for continuance is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Root, </em>1999 MT 203, \u00b6 13, 296 Mont. 1, \u00b6 13, 987 P.2d 1140, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\u00b682 Section 46-13-203, MCA, provides for a change in the place of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>criminal trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\">(1) The defendant or the prosecution may move for a change of place of trial on the ground that there exists in the county in which the charge is pending such prejudice that a fair trial cannot be had in the county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">(2) If the District Court determines that there exists in the county in which the prosecution is pending such prejudice that a fair trial cannot be had, the District Court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">(a) transfer the cause to any other county in which a fair trial may be had;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">(b) direct that a jury be selected in any county where a fair trial may be had and then returned to the county where the prosecution is pending to try the case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">(c) take any other action designed to ensure that a fair trial may be had.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">\u00b683  Mere allegations of prejudicial pre-trial publicity are an insufficient basis on which to grant a motion for change in the place of trial. Rather, facts must be shown creating a \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d that a fair trial cannot be had. <em>See State v. Link </em>(1991), 194 Mont. 556, 560, 640 P.2d 366, 368. The defendant must show the pre-trial publicity actually inflamed community prejudice to such an extent the defendant is denied a fair trial. <em>State v. Moore </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 20, 51, 885 P.2d 457, 477, <em>overruled on other grounds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">\u00b684 Based on the testimony of Dr. Allan Cohen (\u201cCohen\u201d), his jury consultant in the Ramsay case, Bar-Jonah contends the adverse publicity in this case was \u201cinflammatory\u201d and prejudiced the community to the extent that \u201ca clear and present danger\u201d existed to Mr. Bar- Jonah\u2019s right to a fair trial in Silver Bow county. Therefore, the District Court erred in not granting Bar-Jonah\u2019s motion to continue and second motion for change of venue. Bar-Jonah also argues a \u201cmajority of the jurors had prior specific knowledge either of the pending homicide charges or of Mr. Bar-Jonah\u2019s criminal history ... adding to the highly charged atmosphere that surrounded the trial of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">\u00b685  Our review of Dr. Cohen\u2019s testimony and media penetration study, upon which Bar-Jonah relies, leads us to the conclusion that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in deciding, while facts reported in the media relating to the alleged kidnaping, murder and cannibalism of Zachary Ramsay could not help but arouse strong feelings in the community against Bar-Jonah, the news reporting did not go beyond the objectivity expected of the press. For example, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Cohen suggests in his survey the news articles prejudiced Bar-Jonah by including \u201csullen-looking\u201d pictures of him next to smiling pictures of Zachary Ramsay. However, we conclude these pictures were not prejudicial or inflammatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b686 Additionally, while Dr. Cohen\u2019s survey indicated the media penetration in Cascade and Silver Bow Counties was higher than in Yellowstone County, even Dr. Cohen admitted if the trial had been moved a second time to Yellowstone County, the media coverage would have increased there as well. Therefore, we agree with the District Court that moving the trial a second time from Silver Bow to Yellowstone County would have served no useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b687 Furthermore, \u00a7 46-13-203(2), MCA, preserves the court\u2019s options to take any other action, short of a change of venue, to ensure he would receive a fair trial. The District Court took the appropriate steps to ensure that he would still receive a fair trial. For example, the court granted the initial change of venue from Cascade County, where the majority of the media coverage took place, to Silver Bow County; the court issued an extensive supplemental jury questionnaire that was jointly prepared by the State and Bar-Jonah\u2019s defense counsel; and the court allowed liberal individual voir dire on the issues that would tend to expose whether or not prospective jurors were so biased they could not lay aside their pre-trial opinions and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b688  Following our decision in <em>State v. Sullivan </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 313, 321, 880 P.2d 829, 834-35, we decline to find an abuse of discretion based on the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused, rather, we hold, sufficient impartiality is established if the juror can lay aside his opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented. <em>See also State v. Armstrong </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 407, 422-23, 616 P.2d 341, 350 (holding the district court properly denied Armstrong\u2019s motion for an opinion survey where the court gave Armstrong the opportunity to dig out and expose, through voir dire examination, any bias or prejudice that would have prevented a fair trial and the voir dire examination failed to reveal any such prejudice); <em>State v. Falls Down, </em>2003 MT 300, \u00b6 27, 318 Mont. 219, \u00b6 27, 79 P.3d 797, \u00b6 27 (potential juror was not subject to removal for cause in prosecution for deliberate homicide even though she assumed the defendant was guilty when she first read about the incident, because she said she could follow the court\u2019s instructions in basing her decision solely on evidence presented in the courtroom). Nothing in the record indicates the jurors in Bar-Jonah\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>case failed to decide the issues based solely on the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b689  Additionally, Bar-Jonah has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the decision to hold the trial in Butte. Bar-Jonah concedes that during voir dire, each juror assured that they would act with impartiality. The jury\u2019s impartiality was evidenced in the fact that the jury deadlocked on one count of sexual assault and acquitted Bar-Jonah of one count of sexual assault. A judgment may not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial. Section 46-20-701(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b690 Regarding the motion to continue, which requested that the trial in this case be postponed until after the Ramsay trial, the record shows that Bar-Jonah\u2019s motion was based on his concern that his trial in this case could prejudice his trial in the Ramsay capital homicide case, not the other way around. That case was ultimately dismissed. So, Bar-Jonah obviously cannot establish that the order of the trials adversely affected him. In any case, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in setting the trial in the instant case first, as this case was filed before the Ramsay case; the alleged victims were children whose memories could be affected by further delay; and the victims were entitled to a timely resolution of their allegations against Bar-Jonah.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u00b691 Did the District Court err in refusing to grant Bar-Jonah\u2019s request for additional peremptory challenges and to strike the entire jury panel for its exposure to pretrial publicity?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u00b692 Bar-Jonah asserts the pre-trial publicity in this case made it impossible for him to select an impartial jury. Therefore, he argues, his motion to strike the entire jury panel should have been granted. He further asserts, in spite of the statutory grant of an equal number of peremptory challenges to the defense and prosecution in a non-capital criminal case, the District Court should have granted him additional peremptory challenges to assist his counsel in selecting a jury \u201cuntainted by the hoards of negative publicity.\u201d Finally, Bar-Jonah asserts the failure of the court to grant his motion for additional peremptory challenges violated his right to a fair and impartial trial by jury under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article II, Sections 17 and 24 of the Montana Constitution, and that his constitutional rights should have taken precedence over the controlling statute, \u00a7 46-16-116, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u00b693 The State argues Bar-Jonah is barred from raising the constitutional challenge on appeal because he did not make this argument in the court below. The rule is well established that a party may not raise new arguments or change his legal theory on appeal. <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 39, 320 Mont. 211, \u00b6 39, 89 P.3d 947, \u00b6 39. While this Court may discretionarily review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made, we decline to do so here, as our refusal to do so will not result in a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>See State v.

Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., states the argument portion of an appellant\u2019s brief \"shall contain the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and pages of the record relied on.\u201d <em>See Heath, </em>\u00b6 32. Absent any citation of authority, we decline to address this issue. <em>See, e.g., State v.

He received assurances from each prospective juror that he or she would act impartially. Nevertheless, Bar-Jonah has failed to cite authority for his contention. Again, we decline to address an issue when the appellant fails to cite supporting authority. <em>See State v. Ellenburg, </em>2000 MT 232, \u00b6 49, 301 Mont. 289, \u00b6 49, 8 P.3d 801, \u00b6 49.

Ford </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 353, 361, 926 P.2d 245, 250. It is also well-established that a district court\u2019s weighing of potential prejudice against probative value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>will be upheld absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Laird </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 306, 312, 732 P.2d 417, 421. This Court also applies the abuse of discretion standard when reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on whether to admit evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts. <em>State v. Aakre, </em>2002 MT 101, \u00b6 8, 309 Mont. 403, \u00b6 8, 46 P.3d 648, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b698 Bar-Jonah argues the District Court erred when it admitted into evidence two photo albums containing hundreds, possibly thousands, of pictures of young children, only a few of which were of the alleged victims in this case. First, he argues the albums should not have been admitted because the photos of children other than the alleged victims were not relevant. Second, he argues the albums should not have been admitted because Bar-Jonah submitted two motions in limine to keep them out and the State had given prior assurances that it would not introduce any evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts, under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. Third, he argues the albums should not have been admitted because they were highly prejudicial and were therefore inadmissible under Rule 403, M.R.Evid. Fourth, he argues the albums should not have been admitted because they were inadmissible character evidence under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. Bar-Jonah contends, the admission of this evidence was even more egregious because the prospective jurors had prior knowledge of his criminal history or of the horrendous charges pending against him in the Ramsay case. He argues the evidence branded him as a pedophile and influenced the jury to convict him for \u201cwho he is, rather than for what he allegedly had done.\u201d Bar-Jonah makes these assertions citing the \u201cModified Just Rule.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b699 Rule 401, M.R.Evid., defines relevant evidence as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">[E]vidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Relevant evidence may include evidence bearing upon the credibility of a witness or hearsay declarant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">This standard is meant to allow wide admissibility of circumstantial evidence limited only by Rule 403, M.R.Evid., or other special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>relevancy rules. <em>State v. Buckingham </em>(1989), 240 Mont 252, 259, 783 P.2d 1331, 1336. Additionally, in <em>Havens v. State </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 195, 200, 945 P.2d 941, 944, this Court set forth the rule that evidence is relevant and admissible if the state is able to demonstrate a link between the evidence and the fact or element in question. <em>See also State v. Ingraham, </em>1998 MT 156, \u00b6 42, 290 Mont. 18, \u00b6 42, 966 P.2d 103,\u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b6100 In <em>Laird, </em>225 Mont. at 312, 732 P.2d at 421, this Court held \u201cdirty\u201d magazines found during a search of Laird\u2019s apartment were relevant because they tended to buttress the victim\u2019s credibility. In <em>State v. Hall </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 161, 169-70, 797 P.2d 183, 188-89, we held the trial court in a child sexual assault case did not abuse its discretion by finding relevant the testimony of a police officer who stated the defendant told him he had masturbated the day before the assault in the same storage room where the assault took place because the evidence was useful in establishing why police had concentrated on the defendant as opposed to other persons who had been patrons of the library at or near the time in question. Similarly, in <em>Ford, </em>278 Mont. at 363, 926 P.2d at 250, this Court held evidence of Ford\u2019s sexual preference was relevant because he was charged with sexual intercourse without consent of a person of the same gender. The evidence that Ford was bisexual was relevant to whether Ford fit the profile of someone who would commit the act for which he was accused.</p>\n<p id=\"AM8t\">\u00b6101 Bar-Jonah\u2019s contention that the albums were not relevant is simply not supported by the record or the pertinent case law. The State proved the relevancy of the photo albums by linking them to Bar-Jonah\u2019s motive for befriending the boys, for enhancing the credibility of the victim witnesses, and to rebut Bar-Jonah\u2019s asserted defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"AUn\">\u00b6102  We also conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion because admission of the photo albums was not unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403, M.R.Evid. In <em>Ford, </em>this Court held the probative value of the evidence that Ford was bisexual was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>Ford, 278 </em>Mont. at 363, 926 P.2d at 251. Similarly, in <em>Laird, </em>this Court held since the \u201cdirty\u201d magazines were necessary to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony, they were not unfairly prejudicial, and it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to allow their admission as physical evidence. <em>Laird, </em>255 Mont. at 312, 732 P.2d at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b6103  We conclude the facts in this case are not dissimilar to those in <em>Ford </em>and <em>Laird. </em>Therefore, we hold that on balance, the District Court did not commit error in finding the probative value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the photo albums outweighed any prejudice to Bar-Jonah in introducing them into evidence. We further hold the photo albums did not constitute impermissible evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts as asserted by Bar-Jonah.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b6104  Even if the photo albums could be construed to reflect on Bar-Jonah\u2019s character, they were clearly not offered for that purpose. Rather, the record reflects the albums were primarily offered as proof of Bar-Jonah\u2019s motive to befriend young boys. As such, it squarely falls under the exception to the inadmissibility of character evidence provided for in Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. Furthermore, as we held in <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 45, 317 Mont. 331, \u00b6 45, 77 P.3d 224, \u00b6 45, Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., is not applicable simply because the evidence implies the defendant is of bad character.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">ISSUE FIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b6 105 Did the District Court err in admitting into evidence an article found in Bar-Jonah\u2019s apartment on how to tie rope knots and a pamphlet entitled, \u201cAutoerotic Asphyxia\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\u00b6106 Rulings regarding the admissibility of evidence are left to the sound discretion of the trial court, and will not be overturned on appeal absent a showing of manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Ford, </em>278 Mont. at 361, 926 P.2d at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">\u00b6107 Bar-Jonah contends the District Court erred when it admitted into evidence three of the State\u2019s exhibits in spite of Bar-Jonah\u2019s objections that the exhibits constituted hearsay, lacked foundation, were irrelevant and were highly prejudicial. All three exhibits in question were seized during the searches of Bar-Jonah\u2019s residence in December 1999. The first exhibit, Exhibit 91, is an article entitled \u201cThe Right Ropes, The Top Knots,\u201d which contained an explanation, ten diagrams and instructions on how to tie knots. The other two exhibits are Exhibit 92-A, a pamphlet entitled \u201cAutoErotic Asphyxia,\u201d and 92-B, an envelope addressed to Bar-Jonah from \u201cBereaved Parents, Inc.,\u201d the organization that generated the pamphlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">\u00b6108 Bar-Jonah further argues the doctrine of cumulative error should apply in this case to warrant a reversal of the judgment. The doctrine of cumulative error refers to a number of errors, which taken together, prejudice a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>State v. Ottwell </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 150, 157, 779 P.2d 500, 504. Under this doctrine, once such accumulated errors are identified as having prejudiced a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, reversal is required. <em>State v. Enright, </em>2000 MT 372, \u00b6 34, 303 Mont. 457, \u00b6 34, 16 P.3d 366, \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u00b6109 The trial court overruled Bar-Jonah\u2019s objections to all three exhibits. The court agreed with the State\u2019s argument that Exhibit 91 was directly relevant to the incident in which Bar-Jonah allegedly put a noose around S.J.\u2019s neck and hung him from the ceiling. The court also agreed with the State\u2019s argument that Exhibits 92-A and 92-B were relevant because they talked about tying a noose around one\u2019s neck to gain sexual arousal. In overruling Bar-Jonah\u2019s objections, the court also ruled the exhibits did not constitute hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b6110 Bar-Jonah now argues the District Court\u2019s ruling that Exhibit 93, an article on autoerotic death, was inadmissible, proves that the District Court improperly admitted Exhibits 92-A and 92-B, which contained similar content, thereby justifying a reversal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"A1xr\">\u00b6111 With respect to Exhibit 91, it is clearly relevant and admissible to corroborate S.J.\u2019s testimony that Bar-Jonah placed a rope around his neck and hung him from the ceiling. It did not constitute hearsay as its purpose was not to prove that the ropes were the \u201cright ones\u201d and the knots were the \u201ctop knots,\u201d but to show that Bar-Jonah was interested in ropes and knots. The District Court did not err in admitting Exhibit 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b6112 In spite of Bar-Jonah\u2019s failure to include in the record a copy of Exhibit 93, upon our review of the record and of the content of Exhibits 92-A and 92-B, we conclude the District Court did not err in finding Exhibits 92-A and 92-B were relevant to corroborate the testimony of S.J. that Bar-Jonah put a rope around his neck and choked him. These exhibits do not constitute hearsay, as they were offered to prove Bar-Jonah performed the act of choking S.J., not to prove the tmth of the contents of the exhibits. Also, the District Court was in a better position than this Court to determine whether the content of Exhibit 93 was sufficiently different in nature from the content of Exhibits 92-A and 92-B to justify the court\u2019s admission of these exhibits, while excluding Exhibit 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b6113 Since Bar-Jonah was not prejudiced by the errors alleged, we will not apply the doctrine of cumulative error.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">ISSUE SIX</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b6114 Did the District Court err in refusing to strike the pre-sentence investigation and report because Bar-Jonah alleged it was inaccurate and was prepared by a biased probation officer?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\u00b6115 This Court reviews a District Court\u2019s imposition of sentence for legality only. <em>State v.

On sentencing questions regarding statutory interpretation, we review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law to determine whether it is correct. <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6 16. When the issue on appeal concerns whether the district court violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights at sentencing, the question is a matter of law which we review <em>de novo </em>to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Mason, </em>2003 MT 371, \u00b6 19, 319 Mont. 117, \u00b6 19, 82 P.3d 903, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b6116 Bar-Jonah alleges the District Court erred in not granting his motion to strike the PSI because the probation officer, Ms. Kicker, did not contact Bar-Jonah\u2019s family in preparing the social history. He argues this shows the PSI was inaccurate, and that Ms. Kicker was unfairly biased. Bar-Jonah also argues such bias is shown because Ms. Kicker testified one of her roles in preparing the PSI was to act as a victim\u2019s advocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b6117 The District Court did not err in denying Bar-Jonah\u2019s motion to strike the PSI. Section 46-18-111(1), MCA, requires the district court to direct a probation officer to prepare a PSI when a defendant is found guilty of a felony offense. The district court is required to \u201cconsider\u201d the PSI prior to sentencing, \u00a7 46-18-111(1), MCA, however, there is \u201cno requirement that the sentencing judge adopt the recommendation of the [PSI].\u201d <em>State v. McPherson </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 484, 491, 771 P.2d 120, 124, <em>overruled on other grounds. </em>Section 46-18-112, MCA, requires the probation officer to \u201cpromptly inquire into and report on\u201d such things as \u201cthe defendant\u2019s criminal record and social history\u201d and \u201cthe harm caused, as a result of the offense, to the victim, the victim\u2019s immediate family, and the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b6118 The statute does not specify how the probation officer is to go about compiling this information. Bar-Jonah would have this Court believe that in compiling the social history, the probation officer is required by statute to make direct contact with the defendant\u2019s family. This requirement is neither stated in the plain language of the statute, nor is it implied. This Court has never held that in preparing the PSI, the probation officer is required to contact the defendant\u2019s family members. The standard set forth repeatedly by this Court is that \u201ca defendant is entitled to have his sentence predicated on substantially correct information.\u201d <em>See, e..g., McPherson, </em>236 Mont. at 490, 771 P.2d at 123-24. We have further held, \u201c[this] Court, however, will not strain at worst-case assumptions in order to find a mistake and we presume the District Court to be correct.\u201d <em>McPherson, </em>236 Mont. at 490, 771 P.2d at 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>\u00b6119 Here, the District Court based its sentence on a PSI prepared by defendant\u2019s probation officer, as required by \u00a7 46-18-111, MCA; on the psychological evaluations of Bar-Jonah\u2019s own psychologists, Drs. Beljan and Espy; and on the sexual offender report prepared by Dr. Michael Scolatti. We hold that these documents adequately substantiate the court\u2019s rationale and that they come within the purview of substantially correct information as required by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"Aur\">\u00b6120 With regards to the alleged bias of Ms. Kicker in preparing the PSI, Bar-Jonah\u2019s allegation that he is entitled to be re-sentenced because Ms. Kicker somehow infected the court with a bias against him is not supported by the record. As stated above, a convicted defendant has a due process right against a sentence predicated on misinformation. <em>Mason, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Kills on Top v. State, </em>2000 MT 340, \u00b6 67, 303 Mont. 164, \u00b6 67, 15 P.3d 422, \u00b6 67. However, the defendant is under an affirmative duty to show the alleged misinformation is materially inaccurate or prejudicial before a sentence will be overturned. <em>Mason, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Kills on Top, </em>\u00b6 67. A mere claim the information is invalid is insufficient. <em>State v. Radi </em>(1979), 185 Mont. 38, 41, 604 P.2d 318, 320. The District Court record is void of any indication the court relied on materially inaccurate or unreasonably biased information in sentencing Bar-Jonah. On the contrary, Bar-Jonah\u2019s counsel admitted at the sentencing hearing that all of the experts making recommendations to the court, including Bar-Jonah\u2019s own experts, testified that Bar-Jonah should receive the maximum sentence of 130 years. The only question, according to Bar-Jonah, was whether he should serve his time in MSP or at Warm Springs. The District Court concluded from all of the reports and evidence presented at the sentencing hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">[Bar-Jonah] is a repeat offender almost certain to offend again if given the opportunity; did not suffer from a mental disease or defect at the time of commission of these acts such that he was unable to appreciate the criminality of his acts or conform his behavior to the requirements of the law; does not accept responsibility for his acts; is unlikely to respond to or even cooperate with treatment; and is an extreme danger to society. The prospects of rehabilitation are virtually non-existent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b6121  Additionally, Bar-Jonah was provided a copy of the PSI before the sentencing hearing. The court provided him the opportunity to explain, argue and rebut the information contained therein. We conclude that Bar-Jonah has not proven Ms. Kicker was biased in her preparation of the PSI or that the sentencing court abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>discretion in sentencing Bar-Jonah. Accordingly, Bar-Jonah is not entitled to be re-sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">ISSUE SEVEN</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b6122 Did the District Court err in admitting interviews and testimony at the sentencing hearing from victims in criminal cases in which Bar-Jonah had been convicted many years prior and from alleged victims of long past incidents never reported to the police?</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u00b6123 Bar-Jonah contends his right to confront and cross-examine witnesses under Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution were violated when the sentencing court allowed testimony from three witnesses who, according to Bar-Jonah, had \u201cno connection whatsoever to the offenses of which [he] was convicted,\u201d and whom he had no chance to cross-examine. Bar-Jonah also argues his rights were violated because he was not provided with any notice of the testimony from these witnesses, and because the court allowed testimony from Dr. Fournier, who claimed to have been sexually assaulted by Bar-Jonah over 30 years ago, but who never reported this event to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u00b6124 We reject Bar-Jonah\u2019s argument that his constitutional right to confront and cross-examine witnesses was violated at the sentencing hearing. Bar-Jonah failed to object on this ground in the court below, thereby waiving his right to appeal on this issue. As stated with regard to Issue Three of this Opinion, the rule is well established that a party may not raise new arguments or change his legal theory on appeal. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 39.
