Moore Enterprises (collectively, Moore), Peyatt\u2019s employer, on Peyatt\u2019s claim for breach of duty under the Montana Safety Act (Act). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">\u00b62 The following issue is presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Moore by holding that the statutory duty to provide a safe workplace did not extend to the out-of-state location at which Peyatt was injured?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">\u00b64 Peyatt was severely injured on February 3, 2001, in Bismarck, North Dakota, when his arm was tom off in the spinning power takeoff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>shaft (PTO) of a tractor. At that time, Peyatt was employed by Moore as a truck driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b65 During the summer of 2000, the State of Montana was adversely affected by fires and drought. Particularly hard hit were ranchers in need of hay for their cattle. Then-Governor Marc Racicot indicated that Montana would need over one million tons of hay to help affected ranchers feed their livestock over the coming winter. Montana received a $300,000 federal grant to provide emergency hay to ranchers, which resulted in the creation of the \u201cI Care a Ton\u201d relief program.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b66 The Montana Department of Agriculture contracted with the Montana Farm Bureau Foundation (MFBF) to handle the administration of the federal grant and day-to-day activities of the \u201cI Care a Ton\u201d program. The contract between the Department and the MFBF stated that the purpose of the program was to \u201corganize, coordinate, supervise, and purchase transportation services\u201d to ship emergency hay to Montana producers affected by fire and drought. To locate hay to be donated to the program, the MFBF placed advertisements within the media of Montana and surrounding states. Those ads requested that interested parties call the MFBF, which would then work with the donor on the specifics of the donation. Once the details were worked out with the donor, MFBF would forward this information to a transportation provider to pick up and deliver the hay. The MFBF would advise donors that they would need to make arrangements for the loading of the hay on the transport trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b67 Many North Dakotans were willing to help Montana in this emergency in light of the help Montana ranchers lent to North Dakota three years earlier in 1997 when North Dakota lost over 100,000 head of livestock during a spring blizzard. Montana ranchers responded by donating hundreds of cows through the \u201cOne Good Cow\u201d program to help North Dakota ranchers rebuild their herds.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b68 Don Reuter (Reuter), a North Dakota farmer, contacted the MFBF regarding his desire to donate hay through the \u201cI Care a Ton\u201d program. The MFBF reached an agreement with Reuter wherein the donated hay would be picked up at Reuter\u2019s property in North Dakota and then be delivered to a destination in Montana. To facilitate that agreement, the MFBF contracted with Moore to provide transportation services. The contract between the MFBF and Moore stated that Moore was to \u201cprovide commercial transportation services to haul hay.\u201d In short, Moore was to supply the necessary truck, trailer and equipment, and Reuter was to arrange for loading the hay. The MFBF gave Moore directions to Reuter\u2019s property in North Dakota. Moore then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>dispatched Peyatt, who was employed by Moore as a truck driver, to pick up the load of donated hay and deliver it back to Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b69 When Peyatt arrived at Reuter\u2019s farm, Peyatt positioned the trailer and prepared for the hay to be loaded by Reuter. Reuter was using machinery borrowed from a neighbor to load the hay onto the truck. In the process of loading one of the bales of hay, the tractor being used by Reuter became stuck in some snow, according to Peyatt\u2019s testimony, some thirty feet away from the truck and trailer. Reuter left the tractor, which was still running with the PTO engaged and spinning, to get his personal pickup to pull the tractor out. Reuter backed his pickup close to the tractor and pulled a chain out to hook between the tractor and his pickup. In an attempt to assist Reuter, Peyatt took one end of the chain and bent down to hook that end to the tow bar at the back of the tractor. As Peyatt attempted to hook the chain to the tow bar, his coat became entangled in the PTO shaft. Peyatt was maimed when his arm was torn off in the spinning mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b610 For reasons unstated in this litigation, Moore was deemed not to have workers\u2019 compensation insurance, and, as an uninsured employer, was subjected to suit for Peyatt\u2019s injuries pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-508, MCA, and was prohibited from raising certain defenses, such as the employee\u2019s negligence, pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-509, MCA. Thus, the issues herein arise in the context of a work-related injury for which there was no workers\u2019 compensation coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b6 11 On December 19,2001, Peyatt brought suit against Moore, raising claims under the \u201cMontana Safety Act\u201d (Act), \u00a7 50-71-101, MCA, <em>etseq., </em>asserting that, while in the scope and course of his employment as a truck driver for Moore, he suffered severe injuries as a direct result of Moore\u2019s failure to: (1) provide him with a safe place to work; (2) adopt and use practices, means, methods, operations and processes that were reasonably adequate to render his place of employment safe; and (3) do any other thing reasonably necessary to protect his life, health, and safety. Moore responded by filing a third-party complaint against Reuter and other unknown potentially liable parties which may have caused or contributed to Peyatt\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b612 Moore then moved for summary judgment, arguing that because Moore lacked control over the location where Peyatt\u2019s injury occurred-that is, Reuter\u2019s farm-that location did not constitute a place of work or employment under the Act, and therefore, Peyatt\u2019s claims failed as a matter of law. In a bench ruling at the hearing on summary judgment, the District Court granted Moore\u2019s motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>judgment. The District Court stated that although the Act does not define \u201cplace of employment,\u201d it must be one which is controlled by the employer, or over which the employer has the right to exercise control. The District Court stated that Peyatt\u2019s place of employment was the truck, and not the loading environment at Reuter\u2019s farm. The District Court ruled that since Reuter\u2019s farm was not Peyatt\u2019s \u201cworkplace,\u201d Moore could not have breached the duties upon employers imposed by \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA, to provide a safe workplace for employees. Peyatt appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b613 Our standard of review on appeal from summary judgment is de novo, and we apply the same criteria as the district court based on Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>Fisch v. Montana Rail Link, Inc., </em>2003 MT 76, \u00b6 6, 315 Mont. 13, \u00b6 6, 67 P.3d 267, \u00b6 6. We set forth our inquiry for summary <em>judgment in Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264-65, 900 P.2d 901, 903, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am9\">In a summary judgment proceeding, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>LaTray v. City of Havre, </em>2000 MT 119, \u00b6 15, 299 Mont. 449, \u00b6 15, 999 P.2d 1010, \u00b6 15. In reviewing the record, all reasonable inferences will be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u00b614 This Court has routinely stated that the purpose of summary judgment is to eliminate unnecessary trials, but that summary adjudication should \u201cnever be substituted for a trial if a material factual controversy exists.\u201d <em>Boyes v. Eddie, </em>1998 MT 311, \u00b6 16, 292 Mont. 152, \u00b6 16, 970 P.2d 91, \u00b6 16. Ordinarily, questions of negligence are poorly situated to adjudication by summary judgment and are better left for jury determination at trial. <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>Scott v. Henrich, </em>1998 MT 118, \u00b6 13, 288 Mont. 489, \u00b6 13, 958 P.2d 709, \u00b6 13; <em>Kolar v. Bergo </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 262, 266, 929 P.2d 867, 869; <em>Wiley v. City of Glendive </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 213, 216, 900 P.2d 310, 312; <em>Pappas v. Midwest Motor Express, Inc. </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 347, 350, 886 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>918, 920; <em>Dillard v. Doe </em>(1992), 251 Mont. 379, 382, 824 P.2d 1016, 1018; and <em>Brown v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 1, 10, 640 P.2d 453, 458).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b615 Peyatt asserts that Moore failed to inquire of Reuter about the nature of the hay loading operation, to insure that any equipment used by Reuter would be safe and to insure that Peyatt would be safe at Reuter\u2019s farm. He further asserts that Moore: (1) failed to provide him with any safety training related to hazards associated with loading hay onto flatbed trucks or with working around farm machinery, although Moore knew that he would be working around this type of machinery during the performance of his job; (2) failed to give him any information on accident and hazard reporting procedures, first aid, or work site hazards; and (3) never instructed him <em>not </em>to assist a farmer in the loading operation or <em>not </em>to do anything else reasonably necessary to accomplish the loading task.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b616 Peyatt asserts these failures by Moore constituted a breach of the duty imposed on Moore by \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA. Section 50-71-201, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">Employer to provide safe workplace and to purchase, furnish, and require use of health and safety items- safe practices. Each employer shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">(1) furnish a place of employment that is safe for each of his employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">(2) with the exception of footwear, purchase, furnish, and require the use of health and safety devices, safeguards, protective safety clothing, or other health and safety items, including but not limited to air masks, hardhats, and protective gloves, that may be required by state or federal law, the employer, or the terms of an employment contract, unless the terms of a collective bargaining agreement provide otherwise;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">(3) adopt and use practices, means, methods, operations, and processes that are reasonably adequate to render the place of employment safe; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">(4) do any other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, and safety of his employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">The primary focus of Peyatt\u2019s argument, both before the District Court and this Court, is that Moore breached the duties imposed by subsection (3) which requires an employer to \u201cadopt and use practices, means, methods, operations, and processes that are reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>adequate to render the place of employment safe,\u201d and by subsection (4) which requires an employer to \u201cdo any other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, and safety of his employees.\u201d Section 50-71-201(3) and (4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b617 Moore responds that \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA, does not apply to the facts surrounding Peyatt\u2019s injury. Focusing primarily on the Act\u2019s references to \u201cplace of employment,\u201d Moore agrees that \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA, requires an employer to provide a safe workplace and to otherwise furnish equipment and other items in the context of ensuring that the workplace is safe for its employees. Further, Moore even concedes that he owed a general duty to his employees, including Peyatt, to provide a safe place to work under \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b618 However, Moore asserts this duty did not extend to the location where Peyatt\u2019s injury occurred. Moore argues that \u201cplace of work\u201d or \u201cplace of employment,\u201d under the facts of this case, would necessarily have to be the property owned by third-party defendant Reuter, where the injury took place. Moore argues that he had no control over or right to control Reuter\u2019s property, and therefore, it cannot be a \u201cplace of work\u201d or a \u201cplace of employment\u201d such that a duty is triggered under \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b619 The District Court agreed with Moore. The District Court focused on the question of whether or not Reuter\u2019s property was a \u201cplace of employment\u201d under \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA. The District Court indicated that, although \u201cplace of employment\u201d is not defined by the Act, it must be a place which is controlled by the employer or over which the employer has the right to exercise control. The District Court held that, because Moore had neither control nor right of control to Reuter\u2019s farm, Peyatt\u2019s \u201cplace of employment\u201d was limited to Moore\u2019s truck which Peyatt drove to the farm, and did not extend to the loading environment at the farm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">And we get down to, [w]hat is a safe place to work? It\u2019s either limited to the truck that the Plaintiff operated; or if it\u2019s extended to the loading environment, which included the tractor and the power takeoff, then we have a question as to whether that environment was safe or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">... Defendant Reuter\u2019s farm and the loading environment, I must conclude, was not a place of work within the meaning of the Safe Place to Work Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">\u00b620 This Court has previously rendered several decisions under \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA. Four of these decisions cited by Moore in support of his motion for summary judgment, and upon which the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>based its decision granting Moore\u2019s motion for summary judgment, include: <em>Pollard v. Todd </em>(1966), 148 Mont. 171, 418 P.2d 869, <em>overruled on other grounds by State ex rel. Great Falls Nat\u2019l Bank v. District Court </em>(1969), 154 Mont. 336, 344, 463 P.2d 326, 330; <em>Shannon v. Howard S. Wright Const. Co. </em>(1979), 181 Mont. 269, 593 P.2d 438; <em>Hackley v. Waldorf-Hoerner Paper Products Co. </em>(1967), 149 Mont. 286, 425 P.2d 712, <em>overruled on other grounds by Lynch v. Reed </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 321, 328-29, 944 P.2d 218, 223;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>Cain v. Stevenson </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 101, 706 P.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b621 Generally, the outcome of these cases turned on the <em>degree of control </em>the employer or his agent exercised over the workplace. In <em>Pollard, </em>where an employee brought suit against his employer for personal injuries resulting from a fall from a scaffold, the lower court entered judgment for the employee, and the employer appealed. This Court held that because the employer had actual, physical control of the scaffolding through the project supervisor who had selected a faulty plank in constructing the scaffolding and had directed the employee to assist, the employer was subject to liability for the employee\u2019s injury. <em>Pollard, </em>148 Mont. at 177, 418 P.2d at 872. In <em>Shannon, </em>where a subcontractor\u2019s employee brought suit against a general contractor for injuries resulting from a fall from a ladder, this Court held that since the defendant retained control over the working conditions at the job site, the general contractor had a duty to provide the employees of the subcontractor with a safe place to work. <em>Shannon, </em>181 Mont. at 281, 593 P.2d at 444. And in <em>Hackley, </em>where an employee of an independent contractor was injured by a fall from a ladder at a job site, this Court held that the landowner was not liable for injuries suffered by the independent contractor\u2019s employee where the landowner did not retain control over the job site.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b622 In <em>Cain, </em>consistent with <em>Pollard, Shannon, </em>and <em>Hackley, </em>the Court initially noted that, under the Act, a general contractor had an obligation to provide a safe workplace which extended to employees of subcontractors \u201cwhen the general contractor controls job safety or has a non-delegable duty of safety arising out of contract.\u201d <em>Cain, </em>218 Mont. at 103, 706 P.2d at 130 (citing <em>Shannon). </em>However, the Court concluded that the Act extended to subcontractors individually without further consideration of the control issue, reasoning only that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>subcontractors were included under the Act simply by virtue of the broad definition of \u201cemployee\u201d thereunder. <em>Cain, </em>218 Mont. at 104, 706 P.2d at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b623 Peyatt correctly notes that these cases did not define \u201cplace of employment\u201d for purposes of the Act, but rather focused on whether the duty to provide a safe place of employment extended to persons other than the employer. He reasons therefrom that the District Court erred in relying on these decisions. However, although not defining \u201cplace of employment,\u201d these cases nonetheless demonstrate that the employer\u2019s control over, or right to control, the location of the injury is essential to determining whether that location is the injured party\u2019s \u201cplace of employment\u201d for purposes of the duties imposed by the Act. Obviously, without the right to control a location, an employer cannot make it safe. <em>See Shannon, </em>181 Mont. at 283, 593 P.2d at 446 (the owner and general contractor both \u201chad a duty to provide the employees of their subcontractors with a safe place to work because each retained control over the working conditions at the Stillwater condominium site\u201d). Although the parties offer arguments regarding the course and scope of Peyatt\u2019s employment, the question here is not whether Peyatt was injured while engaged in his employment, but whether Moore violated his duty under the Act to \u201cfurnish\u201d and \u201crender\u201d a safe place of employment, requirements which necessitate control over the workplace. Section 50-71-201(1) and (3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b624  The facts in regard to Moore\u2019s control or right to control Reuter\u2019s farm are not in dispute. Moore had no involvement in the selection of Reuter as a donor of hay. Moore had no responsibility, under his contract with MFBF, with the loading of hay upon the truck, and was not involved in the method thereof, or the choice of loading equipment, its condition, operation or safety. Moore was not present, did not observe the loading, and, in short, did not participate in the events on Reuter\u2019s farm which led to Peyatt\u2019s injury. We conclude, therefore, as a matter of law, that Moore had no right to control that location and did not, under these circumstances, violate his duty under the Act to furnish a safe place to work under subsections (1) and (3) of \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b625 However, Peyatt also claims that Moore violated the employer\u2019s duty to ensure safety required by subsection (4) of \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA, which mandates that an employer \u201cdo any other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, and safety of his employees.\u201d Peyatt argues that this provision creates a duty for the employer which is not dependent upon the workplace location. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u00b626 We note initially that a clarification is needed in the nomenclature used to refer to \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA, which states: \u201cShort title. This chapter may be cited as the \u2018Montana Safety Act.\u2019 \u201d Moore makes the common error of referring to this statute as the \u201cSafe Place to Work\u201d statute, asserting in his briefing that \u201cabsent the exercise of control, or at least the right to exercise control over the specific location alleged to be a place of employment, the <em>Safe Place to Work Act </em>does not apply.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As quoted above, in its bench ruling granting Moore\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the District Court likewise stated that the loading environment \u201cwas not a place of work within the meaning of the <em>Safe Place to Work Act.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Moreover, at various times since \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA, was enacted in 1969, this Court has also referred to this provision as the \u201cSafe Place to Work\u201d statute, although, technically, the title of the Act has always been the \u201cMontana Safety Act.\u201d <em>See e.g., Trankel v. Dept. of Military Affairs </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 348, 364, 938 P.2d 614, 624; <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 67, 79, 915 P.2d 175, 182; <em>Gibby v. Noranda Minerals Corp. </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 420, 427-28, 905 P.2d 126, 130-31; <em>Steiner v. Department of Highways </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 270, 276, 887 P.2d 1288, 1232; Cain, 218 Mont. at 104, 706 P.2d at 130; <em>Shannon, </em>181 Mont. at 283, 593 P.2d at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b627 Although an error in nomenclature may itself be harmless, here the error helps to obscure the breadth of the Act. Although Moore frames the issue narrowly, i.e., whether Reuter\u2019s farm can properly constitute a \u201cplace of employment\u201d under the \u201cSafe Place to Work Act,\u201d Peyatt argues that the statute is broader. Peyatt correctly asserts that the statute also imposes a duty upon Moore to \u201cdo any other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, and safety of his employees.\u201d Section 50-71-201(4), MCA. In his affidavit filed in opposition to Moore\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Peyatt averred Moore did not advise him that he could not assist a donor in the loading of hay, did not provide him with any safety training or safety instructions related to the loading of hay and did not provide information related to farm machinery, although it was known to Moore that Peyatt would be working around such machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b628 The Wisconsin Supreme Court has held that the concept of \u201csafe employment\u201d is broader in scope than a \u201csafe place of employment\u201d and has explained that inclusion into the Wisconsin safety statute of the words \u201cdo every other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, safety, and welfare\u201d broadens the scope of the statute to mean safe employment rather than a mere place of employment which shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>be safe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">[W]hen [the Legislature] required the employer to \u201cdo every other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, safety and welfare of such employees and frequenters,\u201d even the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis </em>cannot restrain the meaning of such words to the physical aspects of the place of employment alone, because the dominant subject, in connection with which such words are used, is employment which shall be safe rather than a mere place of employment which shall be safe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"><em>Miller v. Paine Lumber Co. </em>(Wis. 1930), 230 N.W. 702, 703. To illustrate the point that \u201csafe employment may require something besides a place of employment that is safe in a physical sense,\u201d the Wisconsin court invoked the example of an employee whose job it is to repair track in a railroad switching yard. The court noted that to render safe the employment of such an employee, it may be necessary to require a warning of the approach of switching engines and train cars. The court noted that in this illustration, and a myriad of others which one could think of, \u201csafe employment calls for something in addition to a safe place of employment in a physical sense.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>230 N.W. at 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b629 In <em>Stratemeyer, </em>we addressed a similar issue to the one raised by Peyatt: whether, under \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA, an employer was liable for an employee\u2019s injuries as a result of the employer\u2019s failure to train or warn the employee of hazards inherent in the job. In <em>Stratemeyer, </em>a Lincoln County sheriffs officer sued the county and others for mental injuries (post-traumatic stress disorder) allegedly received when he witnessed the aftermath of a teenage girl\u2019s suicide on grounds that the county failed to train, counsel, and debrief him following the incident. <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 70, 915 P.2d at 176. Although the district court interpreted \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA, as excluding emotional harm, this Court agreed with Stratemeyer that the plain language of \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA, did not limit its application to only physical harm. <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 80, 915 P.2d at 182. We stated that subsection (4) of \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA, as well as \u00a7 50-71-203(3) and (4), MCA, constituted a \u201cbroad duty\u201d on the part of an employer to assure an employee\u2019s safety. <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 80, 915 P.2d at 182. We remanded the case for jury determination as to whether the employer breached its duty in failing to train, supervise, treat, or debrief Stratemeyer, thereby incurring liability for his emotional injuries. <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 80, 915 P.2d at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b630  The broad language of subsection (4) of \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>of the \u201cMontana Safety Act,\u201d does not limit the statute\u2019s application only to the workplace. Peyatt has raised genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Moore fulfilled his duty under the statute to \u201cdo any other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, and safety\u201d of Peyatt while he was employed with Moore. Although the District Court correctly ruled that, as a matter of law, Reuter\u2019s farm could not be the \u201cplace of employment\u201d for purposes of the Act, its entry of summary judgment in favor of Moore improperly foreclosed Peyatt\u2019s claim under subsection (4) of \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA. A question remains for the jury as to whether Moore breached this duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b631 We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, LEAPHART, WARNER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\"> <em>Hackley </em>is no longer applicable because the Legislature has since repealed and replaced the safety statute and the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under which the case was decided. <em>See Shannon, </em>181 Mont. at 282-83, 593 P.2d at 445.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b280-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"A8v\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b632 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s determination that \u00a750-71-201(4), MCA, of the Montana Safety Act imposed a duty on Moore to \u201cdo any other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, and safety of\u2019 Peyatt under the circumstances presented here. I would affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b633 I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7\u00a7 50-71-201(1) and - 201(3), MCA, did not impose a duty on Moore to provide Peyatt with a safe place of employment at Reuter\u2019s farm in North Dakota because Moore had no contr ol-or right to control-the conditions existing at that location. I also agree that \u00a7 50-71-201(4), MCA, imposes a duty upon an employer which is broader in scope than the duty to provide a safe place of employment. In my opinion, however, the Court interprets this duty too expansively. I would conclude that this broader duty did not arise under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u00b634 Section 50-71-201(4), MCA, requires an employer to \u201cdo any other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, and safety of his employees.\u201d As the Court observes, the Wisconsin Supreme Court has held that nearly identical language in their work safety statutes creates a duty to provide \u201csafe employment,\u201d which calls for something in addition to a physically \u201csafe place of employment.\u201d <em>See </em>Miller v. Paine Lumber Co. (Wis. 1930), 230 N.W. 702,703. Notably absent from the Court\u2019s discussion of <em>Miller, </em>however, is the Wisconsin court\u2019s actual holding in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">We therefore hold that this statute does impose upon employers the duty to warn employees of dangers <em>incident to their employment, </em>not absolutely, but when it is \u201creasonably necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>to protect the life, health, safety and welfare of such employees.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>230 N.W. at 703 (emphasis added). Thus, the duty to provide safe employment is a duty to protect employees from dangers \u201cincident to their employment.\u201d \u201cIncident\u201d is defined as \u201c[dependent upon, subordinate to, arising out of, or otherwise connected with (something else, usu. of greater importance)....\u201d BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 777 (8th ed. 2004).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b635 The following facts are set forth in the Court\u2019s opinion and undisputed by the parties. Moore\u2019s contract with the MFBF provided that Moore was to provide commercial transportation services to haul hay. The MFBF would advise donors of hay that the donor must make arrangements for loading the hay onto the transport trucks, and the MFBF informed Reuter he was to arrange for loading his donated hay onto the truck. In other words, Moore was to supply the necessary truck, trailer and equipment, and Reuter was to arrange for loading the hay. Under the contract between Moore and MFBF, Moore had no responsibility for the loading of hay onto the truck and was not involved with the choice of loading method, the choice of loading equipment or the loading equipment\u2019s condition, operation or safety. Moore employed Peyatt to pick up the load of hay in North Dakota and deliver it back to Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b636 Peyatt was employed to haul hay. The task of loading the hay onto the truck was not within the tasks that his performance of the job of hauling the hay required. I would conclude that any dangers arising from the loading of the hay were not dangers that were \u201cincident to\u201d Peyatt\u2019sjob ofhaulingthehay. Consequently, I would further conclude that it was not \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for Moore to warn or train Peyatt regarding the hazards of loading hay and using the loading equipment provided by Reuter in order to protect Peyatt\u2019s life, health and safety. Where no reasonable necessity to warn or train exists, no duty arises under \u00a7 50-71-201(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b637 The Court cites Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County (1996), 276 Mont. 67, 915 P.2d 175, in support of its conclusion that Moore owed a duty to Peyatt pursuant to \u00a7 50-71-201(4), MCA. I disagree. At the outset, the pertinent issue in <em>Stratemeyer </em>was whether the Montana Safety Act-and the broad duty to do anything reasonably necessary to protect the life, health and safety of employees under \u00a7 50-71-201(4), MCA-is applicable in cases where a plaintiff alleges only mental/psychological, as opposed to physical, injuries. The Court did not address \u00a7 50-71-201(4), MCA, in the context raised here. To the extent <em>Stratemeyer </em>may be applicable in any way, however, it supports the conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>no \u00a7 50-71-201(4), MCA, duty arose in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b638 In <em>Stratemeyer, </em>Deputy Sheriff Stratemeyer sued Lincoln County for damages for psychological injuries he suffered as a result of witnessing the aftermath of a young girl\u2019s suicide. <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 70-71, 915 P.2d at 176-77. Clearly, responding to the scene of the suicide was within the requirements of Stratemeyer\u2019s employment as a sheriff s deputy. Consequently, the psychological trauma resulting from responding to the dispatch call and witnessing the scene resulted from a danger \u201cincident to\u201d his employment as a deputy and, as a result, a duty arose under \u00a7 50-71-201(4), MCA, for Lincoln County to do anything reasonably necessary to provide him with safe employment-e.g., train, supervise, treat and debrief Stratemeyer with regard to his job requirement of responding to the scene of a suicide. In the present case, Peyatt\u2019s employment did not include the requirement of loading the hay onto the truck and, therefore, the dangers of loading were not \u201cincident to\u201d his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b639 I would conclude that, while \u00a7 50-71-201(4), MCA, does impose a broad duty on an employer to provide employees with \u201csafe employment,\u201d the duty arises only to the degree that is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d in relation to the actual requirements of the employment. I would further conclude that, in this case, Peyatt was acting outside the range of his employment requirements at the time he was injured and \u00a7 50-71-201(4), MCA, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u00b640 I would affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Moore and I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
