Larango to exclude certain properties from the Missoula Irrigation District. The Missoula Irrigation District appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue is whether the District Court had jurisdiction to enter its order granting Larango\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">\u00b63 On October 2, 1997, George B. Larango and Mary Louise Larango petitioned, pursuant to \u00a7 85-7-1846, MCA (1997), to exclude certain property they owned in Missoula, Montana, from the Missoula Irrigation District (MID). The District Court granted the Larangos\u2019 petition on July 16, 2003, in an order which also excluded numerous pieces of property owned by other persons. Notice of entry of judgment was filed on August 25,2003, and the MID appealed the same day. We issued our decision in that appeal, captioned <em>Geil v. Missoula Irrigation </em>Dist., 2004 MT 217, 322 Mont. 388, 96 P.3d 1127, on August 17, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">\u00b64 While the appeal was pending, George Larango petitioned to have four additional properties owned by him excluded from the MID. That petition-filed on November 19,2003-was filed as document number 4 in the file with the Larangos\u2019 previous petition for exclusion. The District Court granted Larango\u2019s petition to exclude the additional properties on December 23, 2003, and had its order filed in the Larangos\u2019 earlier file. The MID appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">\u00b65 Did the District Court have jurisdiction to enter its order?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">\u00b66 The MID asserts that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to enter its December 23, 2003, order for two reasons. We address them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">\u00b67 The MID first contends that because the District Court\u2019s July 16, 2003 order excluding numerous pieces of property-including one owned by the Larangos-was pending on appeal, the District Court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>not have jurisdiction to address Larango\u2019s subsequent petition. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b68  After a case is appealed from a district court to this Court, the district court loses jurisdiction to act. <em>Lewistown Propane Co. v. Moncur, </em>2003 MT 368, \u00b6 12, 319 Mont. 105, \u00b6 12, 82 P.3d 896, \u00b6 12. The MID had appealed <em>Geil </em>to this Court approximately four months before the District Court order in the present case, and that appeal remained pending in this Court. We conclude that the District Court did not have jurisdiction in the interim to entertain Larango\u2019s petition or to exclude additional properties from the MID.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u00b69  The MID also argues that, by statute, the District Court lacked jurisdiction over Larango\u2019s petition. Section 85-7-1846, MCA (1997), which authorized and controlled this particular petition process, terminated on December 31, 1998. Because Larango filed his second petition on November 19, 2003, almost five years after the statutory process for filing a petition had terminated, we conclude the District Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u00b610 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
