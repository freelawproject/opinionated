He appeals his conviction. We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-10\">\u00b62 There are five issues raised in this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b23-11\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court should have ordered a competency hearing <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b23-12\">\u00b64 2. When McCarthy did not appear the second day of trial, did the District Court err when it accepted McCarthy\u2019s written waiver of appearance?</p>\n<p id=\"b23-13\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in denying McCarthy\u2019s post-verdict motion challenging the voluntariness of his written waiver of appearance?</p>\n<p id=\"b23-14\">\u00b66 4. Whether there was sufficient evidence to support McCarthy\u2019s conviction of Intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u00b67 5. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying McCarthy\u2019s motion <em>in </em>limine?</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">\u00b68 The standard of review for each issue will be contained in the discussion of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">\u00b69 In August 2001, McCarthy was serving a probationary sentence for harassing his previous stalking victim. Probation and Parole Officer Stephen Ette (Ette) was assigned to supervise him. McCarthy wanted to live in Arizona near his brother while on probation, so on August 6, 2001, Erie\u2019s supervisor, Bernie Driscoll (Driscoll) issued McCarthy a temporary travel permit to look for a job and a residence in Arizona. The temporary permit required McCarthy to return to Montana because, under the Interstate Compact Policy, he could not be physically residing in Arizona if Montana Probation and Parole decided to request that Arizona accept supervision over him.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">\u00b610 On August 22, 2001, McCarthy telephoned Ette and they discussed McCarthy\u2019s job and residence search. Initially, McCarthy was calm and composed, but when Ette informed him that he was required to return to Montana, McCarthy\u2019s demeanor changed and he began to yell obscenities at Ette. McCarthy focused his aggression toward Deputy County Attorney Gary Balaz (Balaz), who had prosecuted him on the original charge of stalking. McCarthy stated that Balaz had ruined his life and \u201che should just come back and put a bullet in the motherfuckin\u2019 cocksucker\u2019s head.\u201d He also stated that if he did have to return to Montana, he was going to do something to ensure he was placed on death row, and he wanted to return to Montana and \u201cdo a Columbine on the whole motheriucking courtroom.\u201d When Ette was asked to explain McCarthy\u2019s statement, he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-10\">I took it that Mr. McCarthy was going to come back to the State of Montana and come into the Law and Justice Center with either numerous weapons or weapons capable of firing semi-automatically and shoot as many people in the courtroom as possible to include Mr. Balaz and Judge Salvagni, myself, or anyone else that was here at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-11\">\u00b611 On September 12, 2001, during another telephone conversation, Ette again informed McCarthy he would have to return to Montana. McCarthy became indignant, yelling there was a conspiracy between Ette and Balaz, and they were ordering his return just to ruin his life. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>McCarthy then declared \u201che was bigger and badder than any motherfucking Iranian terrorist.\u201d Since terrorists had flown airplanes into the World Trade Center the day before, Ette testified he felt McCarthy was going to return to Montana and cause some type of major event or catastrophe.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">\u00b612 McCarthy also requested that Ette get Driscoll, Judge Salvagni and Balaz together in Driscoll\u2019s office and \u201che would take care of the situation there.\u201d Ette testified he believed McCarthy wanted to \u201cget these people together because he focused all of his anger and aggression on them. And that [McCarthy] would do something that would end up placing him, ultimately, in Montana State Prison for the rest of his life. I figured that [McCarthy] would come back and kill them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">\u00b613 McCarthy requested to speak to Driscoll, and during their conversation, McCarthy asked Driscoll to change his decision about the return to Montana. Driscoll denied his request. McCarthy responded, \u201cIf I have to come back there, I\u2019m going to blow Balaz\u2019s fucking head off.\u201d The next day, a warrant was issued for McCarthy\u2019s arrest, he was arrested in Arizona and returned to Montana in July 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">\u00b614 On August 16,2002, the State charged McCarthy by Information with Intimidation, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-203, MCA, for his threats. McCarthy pled not guilty on August 20,2002, and the matter proceeded to trial. During the proceedings, McCarthy continually displayed disruptive behaviors. He repeatedly stated he had been set up, that Balaz, the probation officers and the court system were corrupt and he was innocent of the charge. McCarthy also threw salt packets while saying \u201c[t]here\u2019s one assault. There\u2019s two assaults. There\u2019s three assaults. Give me another case on that. That is no different than what they\u2019ve played with me so far.\u201d While in jail, McCarthy attempted to file several incoherent and confusing letters and documents with the court. On November 19, 2002, these documents were returned to McCarthy\u2019s counsel, William Bartlett (Bartlett), along with a letter explaining that Judge Guenther had not opened the letters as he was \u201cbarred by judicial ethics from reviewing ex parte letters or information during the pendency of or subsequent to a case <em>unless it is presented in open court </em>and notice is given to the other parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">\u00b615 On December 6, 2002, McCarthy filed a motion <em>in limine </em>requesting the District Court exclude any testimony, evidence and argument mentioning the subjective fears, beliefs or opinions of Driscoll and Ette, and to also exclude his threat as it was not made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>under circumstances which reasonably tend to produce a fear that it will be carried out. The District Court denied the motion following argument on December 9, 2002, and allowed Driscoll and Ette to testify about their fears and apprehensions derived from their conversations with McCarthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\u00b616 On December 10,2002, the second day of trial, McCarthy did not appear in court. Bartlett informed the court that McCarthy wished to waive his appearance at trial because the previous evening McCarthy had been in an altercation with the jail staff, which resulted in some injuries to his back and neck and he would not be able to comfortably sit in front of the jury. The prosecutor responded that he preferred McCarthy to be present, but agreed McCarthy had the right to make a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary decision not to appear at trial. McCarthy signed the waiver, which was witnessed by Bartlett, and the court permitted McCarthy to be absent. McCarthy also executed a second written waiver waiving his right to be present when the jury returned its verdict. On December 10, 2002, the jury unanimously found McCarthy guilty of Intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\u00b617 On February 27, 2003, McCarthy filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for a mistrial, arguing his written waiver of appearance was not freely nor voluntarily given. He testified he did not know he would lose his chance to go to trial and defend himself by signing the waiver. The next day, after a hearing, the District Court denied McCarthy\u2019s motion, found McCarthy to be a persistent felony offender and sentenced him to seventeen years in the Montana State Prison without parole. McCarthy appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">\u00b618 Whether the District Court should have ordered a competency hearing <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">\u00b619 McCarthy argues he was not competent to stand trial and assist in his defense, thus, the District Court should have <em>sua sponte </em>ordered an evaluation of him before proceeding to or continuing the trial. The State asserts the District Court was not presented with substantial evidence that McCarthy was incompetent, and prior to and during trial, Bartlett never questioned nor presented any medical opinion on McCarthy\u2019s competency. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">\u00b620 When reviewing a district court\u2019s finding of competence, we inquire whether substantial evidence supports the district court\u2019s decision that the defendant was fit to proceed to trial. <em>State v. Garner, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>2001 MT 222, \u00b6 22, 306 Mont. 462, \u00b6 22, 36 P.3d 346, \u00b6 22 (citation omitted). Although under certain circumstances a retrospective competency hearing may be held, such hearings are disfavored. <em>Garner, </em>\u00b6 29 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">\u00b621  The standard for determining whether a criminal defendant is mentally competent to stand trial is set forth at \u00a7 46-14-103, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">A person who, as a result of mental disease or defect or developmental disability, is unable to understand the proceedings against the person or to assist in the person\u2019s own defense may not be tried, convicted, or sentenced for the commission of an offense so long as the incapacity endures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The district court must determine \u201cwhether [the defendant] has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding - - and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>State v. Bartlett </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 114, 119, 935 P.2d 1114, 1117 (citations omitted). The doubt raised about competency need not come from the defendant or the defendant\u2019s attorney since a court has the duty to order a competency hearing <em>sua sponte </em>if it has reasonable grounds for concluding there is a good faith doubt as to a defendant\u2019s competency. <em>Bartlett, </em>282 Mont. at 120, 935 P.2d at 1117 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">\u00b622 When deciding whether to order a competency hearing, the court does not rely on a single indicia of doubt regarding a defendant\u2019s competency, but must instead consider the totality of events. <em>State v. Bostwick, </em>1999 MT 237, \u00b6 17, 296 Mont. 149, \u00b6 17, 988 P.2d 765, \u00b6 17 (citations omitted). Indicia of an accused\u2019s incompetency necessitating a hearing may include the accused\u2019s demeanor at trial, a prior medical opinion on competence, the nature of the crime, past behavior of the accused, and a claimed defense of mental instability. <em>State v. Garner, </em>2001 MT 222, \u00b6 23, 306 Mont. 462, \u00b6 23, 36 P.3d 346, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">\u00b623 Here, McCarthy claims there were numerous indicia of mental illness which resulted in an inability to assist his counsel, therefore the District Court should have delayed the proceedings and <em>sua sponte </em>ordered an evaluation. However, the District Court was not presented with substantial evidence on McCarthy\u2019s incompetence to stand trial. Throughout the proceedings, McCarthy\u2019s demeanor was odd and destructive, but his statements to the court demonstrate he understood what was occurring with his case. His statements did not call into question his mental health, but rather, reflected his anger at his belief that he was currently being charged with an offense he did not commit and his ongoing position that he had been improperly charged and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>convicted of past offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b624 At McCarthy\u2019s first appearance, the District Court specifically asked him whether he was suffering from any illness or disability that prevented him from understanding the proceedings and he answered, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d McCarthy also told the court he received and read a copy of the Information and understood the general nature of the charges. His responses throughout his initial appearance indicate he thought of himself as the victim of a legal system conspiracy, but also reflect he had a rational and factual understanding of the criminal proceedings against him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">MR. McCARTHY:... I\u2019m going to represent myself. I used to have something until all this stuff started. That\u2019s the elegant simplicity of the law. Originally, I never hit anybody. Now I\u2019m up to threatening to kill prosecutors and shit? This is ridiculous. So, I\u2019m going to have to get down to the bottom by myself here with this now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">MR. McCARTHY: ... I never even hit nobody in the beginning of this. Not even one point in the State of Montana have I struck anybody. Now I\u2019m up to killing punk - excuse me, prosecutors? Gary Balaz is the Messiah of malfeasance. I\u2019m going to get him one day legally and that\u2019s all I ever told him. Legally, he\u2019s going to answer for planting evidence....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">THE COURT: ... Are you prepared to enter a plea to this charge this morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-9\">MR. McCARTHY: Yeah. All right, due to the fast prosecutors with their assistant felony scams, due to the fact that I never hit anybody, all right, and through the mechanics of corruption through this court system, I ended up going to prison, catching ten years on fabricated, false stuff. This next scam here with this threatening to kill this prosecutor and all this crap, last time it was a judge, I mean, it\u2019s just been on and on....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">\u00b625 McCarthy also points to documents and letters he submitted to the court and suggests they should have caused the District Court to question his competency. These documents were incoherent and confusing, including one with an elaborate drawing of a mosquito with some poetry. However, a number of his letters were <em>ex parte </em>and were subsequently returned unread to Bartlett because the court was precluded from reading them for judicial ethical reasons. Thus, we will not consider these letters on appeal as to whether the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>should have doubted McCarthy\u2019s competency. Similarly, a number of the remaining documents and letters were not filed with the District Court until after the jury found McCarthy guilty, and in some cases after his sentencing. Therefore, these letters and documents are not relevant when determining whether the District Court should have doubted McCarthy\u2019s competency because they would not have caused it to have a good faith doubt about McCarthy\u2019s competency when they were never before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"As7\">\u00b626  Additionally, the defense did not present any medical opinions on McCarthy\u2019s competency, request a competency hearing or question his ability to understand the proceedings, answer the allegations against him or assist in his defense. While McCarthy behaved inappropriately at times, his conversations with the District Court and his counsel demonstrate that, although he was angry, he had a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings and the allegations made against him. As such, we conclude the District Court did not have substantial evidence to establish a good faith doubt as to whether McCarthy was incompetent at the time of trial and was not required to order a competency hearing <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b627 When McCarthy did not appear the second day of trial, did the District Court err when it accepted McCarthy\u2019s written waiver of appearance?</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">\u00b628 McCarthy argues the District Court erred when it granted his motion to be tried <em>in abstentia </em>without first determining whether the motion was signed knowingly and voluntarily. He proclaims that although his counsel presented him a waiver, there is no indication he was fully advised of the consequences of signing the waiver, specifically that he would relinquish his right to testify later in the trial. He also argues \u201csince it is required that a waiver be given by the defendant in court, on the record, neither the statement by [his] counsel that the defendant waived his right to be present nor the written document was sufficient to result in a waiver.\u201d The State asserts the District Court correctly accepted McCarthy\u2019s written waiver of appearance as it was made intelligently, knowingly and voluntarily. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"Av\">\u00b629  Whether a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at the critical stages of his or her trial has been violated is a question of constitutional law, and our review of questions of constitutional law is plenary. <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>2004 MT 53, \u00b6 13, 320 Mont. 161, \u00b6 13, 85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>P.3d 1279, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether its interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b630 A defendant has a fundamental right to be present at all stages of a criminal proceeding under both the federal and Montana Constitutions. The federal constitutional right to be present at all criminal proceedings is one of the most basic rights contained in the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. <em>State v. Tapson, </em>2001 MT 292, \u00b6 14, 307 Mont. 428, \u00b6 14, 41 P.3d 305, \u00b6 14 <em>(citing Illinois v. Allen </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 337, 338, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 1058, 25 L.Ed.2d 353). Art. II, Sec. 24 of the Montana Constitution states: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to appear and defend in person and by counsel ....\u201d Since the right to appear and defend in person is found within Montana\u2019s Declaration of Rights, it is a fundamental right. A right is fundamental under Montana\u2019s Constitution if the right is either found in the Declaration of Rights or is a right \u201cwithout which other constitutionally guaranteed rights would have little meaning.\u201d <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 15. This Court recognized in 1922, when interpreting an identical provision of the 1889 Montana Constitution, that \u201cthe defendant must be present throughout the entire trial.\u201d <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 16 <em>(citing State v. Reed </em>(1922), 65 Mont. 51, 56, 210 P. 756, 757).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b631 Section 46-16-122, MCA, outlines those instances in which a defendant may be absent in felony cases after the trial has commenced in his presence. The pertinent portion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">(3) After the trial of a felony offense has commenced in the defendant\u2019s presence, the absence of the defendant during the trial may not prevent the trial from continuing up to and including the return of a verdict if the defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">(b) is voluntarily absent and the offense is not one that is punishable by death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC\">\u00b632  A defendant can waive his fundamental right to be present at trial in two ways: (1) failing to appear, or (2) through an express personal waiver. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 24. Waiver is defined as the voluntary abandonment of a known right. <em>State v. Bird, 2001 MT </em>2, \u00b6 35, 308 Mont. 75, \u00b6 35, 43 P.3d 266, \u00b6 35 (citations omitted). We will not engage in presumptions of waiver; any waiver of one\u2019s constitutional rights must be made specifically, voluntarily, and knowingly. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 35 (citations omitted). Before a defendant can waive a fundamental right, such waiver, to be recognized by the courts, must be informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>and intelligent for there can be no waiver by one who does not know his rights or what he is waiving. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 36 (citations omitted). If a defendant chooses to waive his right to be present at a critical stage of the trial, the court must obtain an on-the-record personal waiver by the defendant acknowledging the defendant voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly waives that right. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b633 McCarthy refers us to <em>Bird </em>and <em>Tapson </em>to support his proposition that the court erred when it accepted his written waiver of appearance at trial and allowed the trial to proceed in his absence because the court never made a determination of whether his waiver was voluntary and whether he fully understood the implications of his waiver. In <em>Tapson, </em>we concluded the District Court violated Tapson\u2019s constitutional right to be present during a critical stage of the criminal proceeding when the judge took verdict forms into the jury room without Tapson or his counsel present and without a waiver by Tapson of his constitutional right to be present. We determined Tapson was not apprised of his rights, nor did he personally make a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his right to be present. In <em>Bird, </em>we concluded the District Court violated Bird\u2019s constitutional right to be present during a critical stage of the criminal proceeding when it granted the State\u2019s motion to conduct individual <em>voir dire </em>of some of the prospective jurors in-chambers with both the prosecutor and defense counsel present, but with Bird absent. We determined that Bird not only did not waive his right to be present, he was never afforded an opportunity to waive that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b634 Unlike the defendants in <em>Tapson </em>and <em>Bird, </em>McCarthy was apprised of his rights through his counsel, he was afforded an opportunity to waive his right, he made a knowing, intelligent and voluntary written waiver of his right to be present, witnessed by his counsel, which was presented to and accepted by the court and is part of the District Court record. In that waiver, McCarthy states he \u201cknowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waives his right to appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFu\">\u00b635 McCarthy finds fault with the fact his waiver was presented to him by his counsel and maintains there is no indication he was fully advised of the consequences of the waiver and instead, he should have personally given the waiver in the District Court and on the record. However, as the State points out, the District Court cannot bear the fault for accepting McCarthy\u2019s written waiver because unlike <em>Tapson </em>and <em>Bird, </em>where the defendants were in court and the court could personally receive their waivers, McCarthy chose not to appear in court. His voluntary absence precluded the court from obtaining an on-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the-record personal waiver. McCarthy\u2019s written waiver was obtained and presented by his counsel. Although McCarthy claims he did not know what he was signing, his counsel explained to the District Court that McCarthy was fully informed and voluntarily signed the waiver. The following discussion occurred prior to beginning the second day of trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">THE COURT: Counsel, I understand there\u2019s matters that the Court needs to be informed of on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">MR. BARTLETT: Thank you, Your Honor. When I arrived at the Law and Justice Center this morning, I learned that there was a problem with Mr. McCarthy in the jail. I went over and found him in a holding cell with two or three other officers there. Roman was in tears and obviously had been crying for some time. His eyes and face are puffy and swollen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">I observed his - - he was sitting in an awkward position on a bed and I observed what I had thought was probably a bad back. And his neck is stiff. He cannot comfortably sit and cannot sit tall in front of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-8\">Last night, Mr. McCarthy apparently was in an altercation with jail staff and the result of that was some injuries to his back and neck. I asked him, \u201cRoman, what do you want to do about this? Do you want to waive your appearance at trial this morning?\u201d And he said, yes, he did. I expect that Roman should be taken to the hospital for an examination as soon as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">So I move the Court, pursuant to 46-16-122. sub (3), subparagraph (b), that Roman be allowed to voluntarily absent himself from the rest of the proceedings. The record will note that he was here yesterday at the time the trial commenced. And I don\u2019t think it would be in his best interest to appear in front of the jury in his present state. And given his present state, there may even be some sort of blow-up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-10\">So I think it\u2019s in his best interest, and he agrees, that he not appear for this morning\u2019s proceedings. We have drafted a waiver, which I will present to Mr. McCarthy for his final decision. And upon obtaining his signature, we will file that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">The State countered with its position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-12\">Your Honor, it\u2019s the State\u2019s position, of course we would prefer the defendant to be here, consistent with his rights. But if it is his knowing and intelligent and voluntary decision not to be here, he has that right pursuant to the criminal code of the State.... I would ask that the Court consider the proposed waiver submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>by Mr. Bartlett. It says that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waives his right to appear. Given the precise instructions of the statute, I would ask that the word \u201cvoluntarily\u201d be included in that last sentence as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Bartlett and the court agreed that \u201cvoluntarily\u201d be included, the court granted McCarthy\u2019s absence and held the court in recess while Bartlett returned to the Law and Justice Center to obtain McCarthy\u2019s signature. The signature was obtained, the waiver was filed in the record, jury instructions were discussed and closing arguments were presented.</p>\n<p id=\"AP2\">\u00b636  The trial had commenced in McCarthy\u2019s presence, therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-122, MCA, he could choose to be voluntarily absent the second day. The written waiver, and the circumstances surrounding that waiver, establish McCarthy was informed of his right to be present, he understood that right, and knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"AG\">\u00b637  McCarthy also claims the District Court should have ordered a mental health evaluation and conducted a competency hearing to determine whether he was capable of voluntarily waiving his appearance at trial. As discussed before, there was not substantial evidence before the court that McCarthy was incompetent, and neither Bartlett nor McCarthy questioned McCarthy\u2019s competence. The District Court had no reason to conduct a competency hearing prior to accepting the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\u00b638 We conclude the District Court correctly accepted McCarthy\u2019s written waiver of his presence at the second day of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">\u00b639 Did the District Court err in denying McCarthy\u2019s <em>pro se </em>post-verdict motion challenging the voluntariness of his written waiver of appearance?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">\u00b640 McCarthy moved for a mistrial on February 27,2003, claiming he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his presence at trial. At a hearing the following day, McCarthy indicated he could not actually read the document he signed, that Bartlett had not fully explained the waiver and he did not understand the waiver would preclude his testifying, which he wished to do. The District Court denied McCarthy\u2019s motion and found his waiver had been knowingly and voluntarily. The District Court also explained to McCarthy that his motion was time-barred and it was an issue more appropriately appealed to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u00b641 A district court\u2019s determination of whether to grant a motion for a mistrial must be based on whether the defendant has been denied a fair and impartial trial. <em>State v. Dubray, </em>2003 MT 255, \u00b6 81, 317 Mont. 377, \u00b6 81, 77 P.3d 247, \u00b6 81 (citation omitted). This Court\u2019s standard of review of a grant or denial of a motion for mistrial is whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Dubray, </em>\u00b6 81. Here, McCarthy mislabeled his post-verdict motion as a motion for mistrial, which must occur during the trial itself. We agree with the District Court that his motion for mistrial is time barred because it occurred after the trial ended. As such, the District Court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b642 However, even giving McCarthy the benefit of the doubt, as the District Court did when it allowed his motion to be considered as a motion for a new trial, he fails. The filing of a motion for a new trial is controlled by \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">(1) Following a verdict or finding of guilty, the court may grant the defendant a new trial if required in the interest of justice. A new trial may be ordered by the court without a motion or may be granted after motion and hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">(2) The motion for a new trial must be in writing and must specify the grounds for a new trial. The motion must be filed by the defendant within 30 days following a verdict or finding of guilty and be served upon the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">A motion for a new trial must be filed within thirty days following a verdict or finding of guilt, and there is no provision in the statute for extending the time period. <em>State v. Gollehon </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 116, 118, 906 P.2d 697, 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">\u00b643  The standard of review of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for new trial is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Azure, </em>2002 MT 22, \u00b6 30, 308 Mont. 201, \u00b6 30, 41 P.3d 899, \u00b6 30 (citations omitted). McCarthy\u2019s motion was filed seventy-nine days after the jury found him guilty and therefore, the District Court did not abuse its discretion and correctly recognized the motion as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">\u00b644 Whether there was sufficient evidence to support McCarthy\u2019s conviction of Intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">\u00b645 McCarthy argues there was insufficient evidence to sustain a verdict of guilty in this matter, and as such, the jury could not find that the threats McCarthy was convicted of making were made under circumstances that would reasonably produce a fear they would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>carried out as required by \u00a7 45-5-203, MCA. The State asserts the opposite. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b646 The standard of review of sufficiency of evidence to sustain a conviction is whether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Ross </em>(1995), 269 Mont. 347, 360, 889 P.2d 161, 169 (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony are to be determined by the trier of fact, and disputed questions of fact and credibility will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Ahmed </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 200, 212, 924 P.2d 679, 686 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">\u00b647  McCarthy was found guilty of Intimidation in violation of \u00a7 45-5-203, MCA, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">(1) A person commits the offense of intimidation when, with the purpose to cause another to perform or to omit the performance of any act, he communicates to another, under circumstances which reasonably tend to produce a fear that it will be carried out, a threat to perform without lawful authority any of the following acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">(a) inflict physical harm on the person threatened or any other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">(b) subject any person to physical confinement or restraint; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">(c) commit any felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">Under this statute, it does not matter whether or not the defendant actually intended to carry out the threat, only that the threat was made under circumstances which reasonably tended to produce fear and resulted in the victim reasonably fearing that the threat will be carried out. <em>Ross, </em>269 Mont. at 360, 889 P.2d at 168. The only intent required is that the accused made the threat for \u201cthe purpose to cause another to perform or to omit the performance of any act.\u201d Section 45-5-203, MCA; <em>Ross, </em>269 Mont. at 360, 889 P.2d at 168-69. Further, the person who receives the threat can be different from the person whom the threat seeks to compel. <em>State v. Lance </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 92, 108, 721 P.2d 1258, 1269. If a person produces a fear in the victims he intended and had the ability to harm a third party, that is enough to constitute intimidation. <em>State v. Hembd </em>(1989), 235 Mont. 361, 367-68, 767 P.2d 864, 868-69 <em>(overruled on other grounds by State v. Loh </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 460, 914 P.2d 592).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">\u00b648 The victim in this case is Probation Officer Driscoll. When Driscoll told McCarthy he had to return to Montana from Arizona, McCarthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>responded if he had to come back to Montana, he was \u201cgoing to blow Balaz\u2019s fucking head off.\u201d The critical question then is whether the circumstances were such that Driscoll was reasonable in fearing McCarthy would carry out his threat against Balaz.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b649 Driscoll, a probation officer for twenty-eight years, met personally with McCarthy and had over twenty telephone conversations with him. Driscoll testified that, based on McCarthy\u2019s threats, he feared something might happen to Balaz. Ette also testified he believed McCarthy would return to Montana and shoot Balaz and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b650 McCarthy maintains it was not reasonable for Driscoll to fear he would carry out his threat because he had made other threats in the past, none of which he had acted upon. However, Driscoll explained the threat to kill Balaz was different from McCarthy\u2019s previous threats. Unlike the previous threats, this time McCarthy did not deescalate when given the opportunity to do so, did not retract his threats and remained angry and hostile. Driscoll\u2019s testimony provided the jury with sufficient evidence that McCarthy\u2019s threat was made under circumstances which reasonably tended to produce fear and resulted in Driscoll reasonably fearing his threat would be carried out. The following testimony, concerning the circumstances surrounding McCarthy\u2019s threats and the fear produced by the threats that they would be carried out, was provided by Driscoll to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">Canty [State\u2019s counsel]: [Biased on your personal observation and speaking with [McCarthy], can you describe his emotional condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">Driscoll: Yeah, he was agitated. He was very upset. After we\u2019d exchanged a little bit of conversation, he seemed kind of combative.... his voice was raised. He was not screaming at the top of his lungs but he was speaking fast and his voice was raised.... He did use profanity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">Canty: How was it that this conversation concluded? Do you recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-10\">Driscoll: Yeah, I do, pretty much. I remember feeling kind of at a loss that we had been in an argument of sorts, me insisting that Roman return to Montana and him insisting that he was going to blow somebody\u2019s head off. I remember hoping - - I\u2019d known him for a long time. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve heard his voice agitated. I had hoped that he would calm down or that he would say, I\u2019m sorry. You know, I\u2019ve experienced that with Roman before. That didn\u2019t happen. I finally asked him to calm down and I asked him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>to call me back in two hours, not knowing what else to do and hoping that perhaps he would calm down in the interim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">Canty: Can you tell us whether or not you provided an opportunity to make certain of what you\u2019re hearing was true. Did you provide him the opportunity to de-escalate from those threats?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">Driscoll: I tried to provide him an opportunity to calm down and de-escalate because I\u2019ve seen Mr. McCarthy de-escalate before. Canty: What happened when you attempted to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">Driscoll: He didn\u2019t give an inch or retract what he had said to me. We were still kind of at loggerheads and that was that. Or that was my impression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u00b651 McCarthy also argues that because his threats against Balaz occurred the day after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Driscoll\u2019s and Ette\u2019s fears were heightened and irrational. He contends the jury was influenced by the heightened fear surrounding the terrorist attacks, and their fear overshadowed the fact his threats were not made under circumstances which reasonably tended to produce a fear that they would be carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">\u00b652  Section 45-5-203(1), MCA, requires a jury to consider the circumstances under which the threat was given and determine whether the threat reasonably tended to produce a fear that it would be carried out. As the State points out, McCarthy\u2019s threat that \u201che was madder than an Iranian terrorist\u201d used the fear surrounding the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to strengthen his threat against Balaz and to scare Driscoll, therefore McCarthy cannot now complain the circumstances surrounding his threat, including the terrorist attacks, made the parties involved and the jury too sensitive or unreasonably influenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">\u00b653  Finally, McCarthy suggests it was unreasonable for Driscoll to fear he would carry out his threats because he was in Arizona with little money or means to return to Montana. This suggestion was refuted by Driscoll\u2019s and Ette\u2019s testimony at trial, which showed sufficient evidence for the jury to find that although McCarthy made threats while in Arizona, Driscoll\u2019s fears were not unreasonable because McCarthy had the resourcefulness to return to Montana to carry out his threats. When reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude there was sufficient evidence to support McCarthy\u2019s conviction for Intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ISSUE FIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b654 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying McCarthy\u2019s motion <em>in </em>limine?</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b655 McCarthy argues the District Court erred in denying his motion <em>in limine </em>to \u201cexclude any testimony, evidence and argument at trial of any mention of subjective fears, beliefs, or opinions....\u201d He asserts his comments can only be considered a threat if they are \u201ccommunicated under circumstances which reasonably tend to produce a fear that it will be carried out.\u201d Section 45-5-203, MCA. McCarthy claims the statute calls for an objective standard as to whether a reasonable person would believe the threat would be carried out. He contends that by allowing Balaz and Ette to testify about the effect the threats had on them, the District Court converted the test from an objective to a subjective standard. He urges this Court \u201cto find that where no objective evidence of threat exists, subjective statements of fear for oneself or another should not be admitted,\u201d and, \u201cthere should be at least some <em>prima facie </em>evidence of danger or a fear reaction before a witness can give a subjective statement of fear.\u201d He asserts that \u201c[a]llowing testimony of a victim\u2019s fear into evidence, before showing circumstances in which that fear was reasonable, violates the defendant\u2019s right to have the state bear the burden of proof required....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b656 The State counters, \u201c[w]hile the intimidation statute requires the jury to determine whether the defendant\u2019s threat was given under circumstances which reasonably tended to produce fear that the threat would be carried out, the statute does not preclude the jury from considering a victim\u2019s fears or beliefs in making the assessment.\u201d It also points out the statute does not require objective evidence of a threat before a victim can testify as to how the victim felt threatened. It asserts the jury must review the impact of the threat on the victim if it is to determine whether the threat tended to produce a fear in the victim that it would be carried out. The State also refers to our prior Intimidation cases to show this type of subjective testimony has been used to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to convict a defendant of the offense. <em>See Ross; State v. Felando </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 144, 152, 810 P.2d 289, 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u00b657 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion <em>in limine </em>for an abuse of discretion. <em>Dubray, </em>\u00b6 47. Here, the District Court denied McCarthy\u2019s motion stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">In rationalizing the issue, the Court finds that the subjective statement of fear by the person is a required element of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>burden of proof. Whether that\u2019s reasonable then becomes an issue of fact for the jury. The jury has to decide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b658 Section 45-5-203, MCA, requires the jury to determine whether the defendant\u2019s threat was given under circumstances which reasonably tended to produce fear that the threat would be carried out, but does not preclude the jury from considering a victim\u2019s fears or beliefs in making the assessment. It does not require objective evidence of a threat before a victim can testify as to how the victim felt threatened. In order to determine whether the threat reasonably tended to produce a fear in the victim that it would be carried out, the jury must review the effect the threat had on the victim in order to consider the circumstances which would reasonably tend to produce the victim\u2019s reaction to the threat, and the victim\u2019s fear that the threat would be carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b659 McCarthy also argues Driscoll\u2019s and Ette\u2019s testimony inflamed the passions of the jury and prejudiced his case. As an example, he points to Ette\u2019s testimony that \u201cconcerned [Ette\u2019s] subjective impression of Mr. McCarthy\u2019s comments and included not only his fears, but terrible fantasies he imagined coming true with Mr. McCarthy\u2019s return.\u201d He also contends the prejudicial effect of this testimony was very great and without such testimony, it is unlikely he would have been found guilty given the charge of Intimidation was based on two telephone calls made from Arizona eleven months prior to the filing of the Information and during which he was very upset. He claims there is no indication he intended to carry out his threats, nor any indication those threatened failed to act in the manner they intended as a result of his words.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b660 The Intimidation statute does not preclude a victim from testifying whether the victim believed or feared the defendant would carry out his threat. As we stated above, a victim must testify, subjectively, whether or not they experienced fear and the jury can determine whether the circumstances justified that fear. The jury should then decide whether that fear is reasonable. The District Court held the prejudicial effect of this type of evidence does not outweigh the relevancy of the proffered evidence since the subjective statement of fear by the person is a required element of the burden of proof. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion when denying McCarthy\u2019s motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\u00b661 We affirm the District Court on all issues.</p>\n<judges id=\"b39-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
