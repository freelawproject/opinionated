We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in affirming the Missoula Municipal Court\u2019s denial of O\u2019Neill\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis that a university security officer had jurisdiction to stop and arrest O\u2019Neill.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">\u00b63 At approximately 2:00 a.m. on February 9, 2003, Michael Blazevich (Blazevich), a campus security officer for the University of Montana (University) Office of Public Safety, was patrolling the University\u2019s South Campus Stadium area, which consists of Dornblaser athletic field, some parking lots and campus family housing. The South Campus Stadium area is bordered to the north by South Avenue, to the west by Higgins Avenue and to the south for a short distance by Pattee Canyon Drive. While patrolling, Blazevich observed a vehicle travel through the intersection of South and Higgins Avenues, and proceed southbound on Higgins Avenue. Blazevich determined by radar that the vehicle was traveling in excess of the posted speed limit, activated the patrol car\u2019s overhead lights and pursued the vehicle. The vehicle continued south on Higgins Avenue, turned east onto Pattee Canyon Drive and stopped about 400 feet thereafter. Blazevich identified the vehicle\u2019s driver as O\u2019Neill, and eventually arrested him for traveling in excess of the posted speed limit and driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">\u00b64 O\u2019Neill subsequently moved the Missoula Municipal Court to dismiss the charges, arguing that Blazevich lacked jurisdiction to either stop his vehicle or arrest him. The Municipal Court denied the motion. O\u2019Neill and the City of Missoula (the City) then entered into a plea agreement by which O\u2019Neill agreed to plead no contest to the DUI charge and the City agreed to dismiss the speeding charge. O\u2019Neill specifically reserved his right to appeal the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. The Municipal Court accepted O\u2019Neill\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>plea of no contest to the DUI charge and imposed a sentence. O\u2019Neill appealed to the District Court. The District Court affirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of O\u2019Neill\u2019s motion to dismiss. O\u2019Neill appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b65 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal proceeding is a question of law which we review to determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusion of law is correct. <em>City of Helena v. Danichek </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 461, 463, 922 P.2d 1170, 1172.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in affirming the Missoula Municipal Court\u2019s denial of O\u2019Neill\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis that a university security officer had jurisdiction to stop and arrest O\u2019Neill?</p>\n<p id=\"A8M\">\u00b67 O\u2019Neill moved to dismiss the charges against him based on Blazevich\u2019s alleged lack of authority to make a vehicle stop or arrest because O\u2019Neill\u2019s speeding and DUI offenses occurred outside the geographic boundaries of Blazevich\u2019s jurisdiction as a University campus security officer. The District Court concluded Blazevich had jurisdiction to stop O\u2019Neill\u2019s vehicle and arrest him pursuant to both \u00a7 20-25-322, MCA, and \u00a7 44-11-101, MCA. O\u2019Neill asserts that the District Court\u2019s conclusion is erroneous. We conclude that the District Court correctly determined Blazevich had jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 20-25-322, MCA, and, consequently, we need not address O\u2019Neill\u2019s assertion that the court erred in interpreting \u00a7 44-11-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u00b68 University campus security officers are peace officers with the general jurisdiction to exercise their authority</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">(a) upon the campuses of the Montana university system and, for campus-related activities, an area within 1 mile of the exterior boundaries of each campus;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">(b) in or about other grounds or properties owned, operated, controlled, or administered by the regents or any unit of the Montana university system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">Section 20-25-321(1), MCA. The District Court correctly concluded that Blazevich was not within his jurisdiction under either subsection (a) or (b) of \u00a7 20-25-321(1), MCA, when he stopped O\u2019Neill\u2019s vehicle. However, the Montana Legislature has provided a method by which the president of any unit within the Montana university system may enter into an agreement with the city or county in which the unit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>located to expand the campus security officers\u2019 general authority as set forth in \u00a7 20-25-321(1), MCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\">The president of each unit may in his discretion enter into an agreement with the city or county in which his unit is located to authorize members of the unit\u2019s security department to issue citations for parking or moving traffic violations as defined by state or municipal laws which occur within the boundaries of the campus or on streets or alleys contiguous thereto. All such citations shall be considered within the jurisdiction of the appropriate local authority and shall be handled in the same manner as citations issued by peace officers of such local authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Section 20-25-322, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b69 In 1993, the University entered into an agreement (Agreement) with the City and Missoula County pursuant to \u00a7 20-25-322, MCA. Section II of the Agreement provided for expanded jurisdiction for University campus security officers, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">B. On streets and alleys contiguous to the campus the University Police officers may issue citations for any parking or moving traffic violation defined by state or municipal law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">C. On streets and alleys within the boundaries of the campus, the University Police officers may issue citations for moving traffic violations as defined by state or municipal laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">D. Anywhere within the boundaries of the campus, the University Police officers may issue citations for violations of Montana Code Annotated, Section 61-8-301 Reckless Driving: Title 61, Chapter 7, Part 1 the Uniform Accident Reporting Act: Section 49-4-302 MCA pertaining to handicapped parking spaces and Section 61-8-356 Prohibition against narking or leaving vehicles on public property. Further, the University Police officers may issue citations for violation of 61-8-401 Persons under the influence of alcohol or drugs and violation of 61-8-406 Operation of a vehicle bv a person with alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more to any person driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the ways of the state open to the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">The District Court concluded Blazevich had jurisdiction to stop and arrest O\u2019Neill pursuant to the Agreement because the sections of Higgins Avenue and Pattee Canyon Drive on which O\u2019Neill committed the acts of speeding and DUI were contiguous to the portion of the University campus known as the South Campus Stadium area. Thus, although not expressly stated in the District Court\u2019s order, it appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the court determined Blazevich had jurisdiction under Section IIB of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b610 O\u2019Neill first asserts the District Court erred in concluding that Higgins Avenue and Pattee Canyon Drive are contiguous to the University campus. He contends that the word \u201ccampus\u201d as used in the Agreement refers only to the University\u2019s main campus property and buildings, rather than every piece of property the University owns within the City and County of Missoula. Thus, according to O\u2019Neill, the area including Dornblaser athletic field and campus housing where Blazevich was patrolling, being separate and apart from the main campus area, is not part of the University\u2019s \u201ccampus.\u201d O\u2019Neill further contends that, because the area Blazevich was patrolling is not the \u201ccampus,\u201d Higgins Avenue and Pattee Canyon Drive are not contiguous to the campus and Blazevich did not have jurisdiction under Section IIB of the Agreement to stop his vehicle for speeding. He does not dispute that speeding is a moving traffic violation as provided in the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b611  As stated above, the area in which Blazevich was patrolling when he observed O\u2019Neill\u2019s vehicle speeding is referred to as the \u201cSouth Campus Stadium area.\u201d Thus, the University deems this area to be part of its campus. Furthermore, the word \u201ccampus\u201d is defined as \u201cthe grounds and buildings of a university, college, or school.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 323 (3rd ed. 1993). The athletic field, parking lots and family housing, as well as the land on which they are located, are clearly \u201cgrounds and buildings\u201d belonging to the University. We conclude the District Court did not err in determining that the area in which Blazevich was patrolling was part of the University campus and, as a result, that the relevant sections of Higgins Avenue and Pattee Canyon Drive were contiguous to the University campus. We further conclude, therefore, that the court did not err in determining Blazevich had jurisdiction under Section IIB of the agreement to stop O\u2019Neill\u2019s vehicle for speeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b612 O\u2019Neill also argues that, even if Blazevich had jurisdiction to stop him for speeding, Blazevich did not have jurisdiction to subsequently arrest him for DUI. He concedes that DUI is a \u201cmoving traffic violation\u201d as that phrase is used in the Agreement. He observes, however, that Sections IIB and IIC of the Agreement give University campus security officers jurisdiction to issue citations for moving traffic violations in general, while Section IID gives them jurisdiction to issue citations for certain specific moving traffic violations including DUI. He contends that, by referring to specific individual traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>violations in Section IID, the Agreement intended to limit campus security officers\u2019 jurisdiction to issue citations for those specific violations to only the geographic area covered by Section IID-namely, only within the boundaries of the University campus-and, therefore, the moving traffic violations referred to in Sections IIB and IIC do not include those offenses specified in IID. Consequently, according to O\u2019Neill, Blazevich did not have jurisdiction to arrest him for DUI because the offense did not occur within the boundaries of the University campus. He further asserts that to define the phrase \u201cmoving traffic violation\u201d as used in Sections IIB and IIC to include the offenses specified in IID would render the language of IID meaningless. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b613 The three paragraphs of the Agreement at issue here each confer jurisdiction on University campus security officers for different geographic areas. Section IIB covers \u201cstreets and alleys contiguous to the campus,\u201d IIC covers \u201cstreets and alleys within the boundaries of the campus\u201d and IID covers all areas \u201cwithin the boundaries of the campus[.]\u201d Thus, Sections IIB and IIC authorize campus security officers to issue citations for all moving traffic violations occurring on streets and alleys within or contiguous to campus. On the other hand, Section IID authorizes campus security officers to issue citations for specified moving traffic violations wherever they might occur within the boundaries of the campus. Interpreting the Agreement in this manner does not render the language of Section IID meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b614  We conclude that the District Court did not err in determining that Blazevich had jurisdiction pursuant to Section IIB of the Agreement to issue a citation to and arrest O\u2019Neill for DUI occurring on a street contiguous to the University campus. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not err in affirming the Missoula Municipal Court\u2019s denial of O\u2019Neill\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u00b615 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-7\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
