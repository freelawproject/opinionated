We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in not suppressing evidence of a methamphetamine pipe found on Griffin\u2019s person when he was arrested?</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in not suppressing evidence found in the bed of Griffin\u2019s pickup truck?</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in not suppressing evidence found in Griffin\u2019s residence?</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">\u00b66 On February 6, 2003, Butte-Silver Bow Police Officer Sharman Hock observed Griffin driving his pickup. Officer Hock was aware Griffin did not have a valid license, but confirmed this fact with dispatch. She followed Griffin to a residence where she observed him exit his vehicle and walk towards the residence. Pursuant to a city court policy directing that anyone stopped for driving on a revoked or suspended license should be arrested, booked, and taken to jail, Officer Hock arrested Griffin and handcuffed him. When asked if he had anything sharp, Griffin replied that he had a knife. Officer Hock felt and retrieved a small hard object in a black case in Griffin\u2019s pocket. The object was a glass pipe with white residue on it. Officer Hock recognized the pipe and white residue as drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">\u00b67 Griffin then informed Officer Hock he had a gun inside his pickup, but declined her request to search the vehicle. Officer Hock applied for and received a search warrant authorizing a search for evidence of drug possession in Griffin\u2019s pickup. When Officer Hock approached Griffin\u2019s pickup to search it, she saw in the open truck bed two semitransparent garbage bags, through which she saw boxes of matches and pseudoephedrine, items she knew could be used to manufacture methamphetamine. Officer Hock then called in the Southwest Montana Drug Task Force. Pursuant to another search warrant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Task Force searched Griffin\u2019s residence and found booby-trapped explosives protecting a methamphetamine lab.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b68 Griffin was charged with four felony counts: Count I, Operation of an Unlawful Clandestine Laboratory, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA; Count II, Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs with Intent to Sell, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-103, MCA; Count III, Criminal Possession of Property Subject to Forfeiture, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-206, MCA; and Count IV, Possession of Explosives in violation of \u00a7 45-8-335, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AdLN\">\u00b69 On May 1, 2003, Griffin filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained in the searches of his person, vehicle, and home and all statements he made. Griffin also filed a motion to dismiss the charge of Possession of Explosives. The motions were set for hearing and heard by the District Court on May 28,2003. The District Court denied Griffin\u2019s motion to suppress June 6, 2003. Thereafter, pursuant to a plea agreement, Griffin pled guilty to Counts I and III and to driving under the influence, a charge related to a previous incident. He reserved his right to appeal all pre-trial rulings by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"A6Q\">\u00b610 Griffin now appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial ofhis motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress \u201cto determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its interpretation and application of the law are correct.\u201d <em>City of Cut Bank v. Bird, </em>2001 MT 296, \u00b6 9, 307 Mont. 460, \u00b6 9, 38 P.3d 804, \u00b6 9. Further, as a reviewing court, this Court\u2019s function is to ultimately ensure the issuing judge had a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d to determine probable cause existed before issuing the search warrant. <em>State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, \u00b6 19, 301 Mont. 408, \u00b6 19, 10 P.3d 83,</p>\n<p id=\"A8U\">\u00b6 19 (citation omitted). A judge\u2019s determination of probable cause is given great deference and every reasonable inference possible will be drawn to support that determination. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A7I\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err in not suppressing evidence of a methamphetamine pipe found on Griffin\u2019s person when he was arrested?</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">\u00b613 Griffin asserts Officer Hock\u2019s warrantless search ofhis person was an unlawful invasion ofhis privacy not justified by a compelling state interest. Specifically, Griffin argues the State\u2019s retrieval of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>methamphetamine pipe from his person was not a lawful search incident to arrest, a recognized exception to the warrant requirement, because none of the grounds listed in \u00a7 46-5-102, MCA, were present.</p>\n<p id=\"AMD\">\u00b614 The State argues Officer Hock\u2019s search of Griffin was authorized by \u00a7 46-5-102(1), MCA, which permits a warrantless search of a person incident to an arrest in order to protect a peace officer from attack. Specifically, the State asserts that, in order to protect herself and other officers from an attack by Griffin, who stated he had a knife, Officer Hock was entitled to search Griffin\u2019s person. The State argues in the alternative, that if this Court finds the search illegal, then the search which discovered the methamphetamine pipe is still valid under the inevitable discovery doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b615 The District Court found Officer Hock\u2019s testimony credible and believed she effectuated a valid search incident to arrest. The Court found Officer Hock was justified in opening the black nylon case in order to discern if the small hard object was the knife. The Court denied Griffin\u2019s motion to suppress on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b616 This Court notes that Griffin was never charged with possession of drug paraphernalia, in violation of \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA. All of the charges filed against Griffin were supported by evidence obtained from a search of Griffin\u2019s house, the legality of which will be discussed later in this Opinion. Thus, the determination of this issue is irrelevant as it has no effect on Griffin\u2019s rights. As such, this Court will not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\u00b617 Did the District Court err in not suppressing evidence found in the bed of Griffin\u2019s pickup truck?</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">\u00b618 Griffin argues that a pipe, untested for drug residue at the time of the search warrant application, is not sufficient probable cause upon which to issue a search warrant for his pickup. Griffin also asserts the District Court\u2019s findings are erroneous because they did not discuss the search of Griffin\u2019s pickup and residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">\u00b619 The State argues the pipe, smudged with what appeared to be white methamphetamine residue, provided sufficient probable cause to believe Griffin\u2019s pickup might contain similar items, especially because Griffin exited his pickup immediately prior to being arrested. The State also points out the items seized from Griffin\u2019s pickup were in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">\u00b620 Section 46-5-221, MCA, states that a judge shall issue a search warrant upon application made under oath or affirmation, that: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed; (2) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that evidence, contraband, or persons connected with the offense maybe found; (3) particularly describes the place, object, or persons to be searched; and (4) particularly describes who or what is to be seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b621  In the context of issuing a search warrant, probable cause exists if the facts and circumstances within an officer\u2019s personal knowledge are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to believe that someone has committed an offense. Probable cause is evaluated in light of a trained law enforcement officer\u2019s knowledge, taking into account all the relevant circumstances. <em>State v. Frasure, </em>2004 MT 242, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 1, \u00b6 15, 97 P.3d 1101, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b622 In <em>Frasure, </em>we upheld a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress drug evidence found in the defendant\u2019s vehicle, stating the facts and circumstances, namely the defendant\u2019s nervousness, accelerated speech, the ceramic pipe found on his person, and the officers\u2019 prior knowledge of the defendant\u2019s methamphetamine addiction was sufficient probable cause to support the search warrant. <em>Frasure, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b623  No such circumstances exist here. The only evidence supporting the search warrant for Griffin\u2019s pickup was the existence of a pipe found on his person with untested white residue on it and the fact Griffin had recently exited his pickup. \u201cA mere affirmance of belief or suspicion by a police officer, absent any underlying facts or circumstances, does not establish probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant.\u201d <em>State v. Lott </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 195, 199, 900 P.2d 306, 309 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u00b624 Regardless of whether the methamphetamine pipe was properly seized, this, without more, is not sufficient evidence to warrant a reasonable person to believe Griffin\u2019s pickup would contain evidence of an offense. Just because a person has a pipe in his pocket with untested white residue on it, does not mean his vehicle will contain evidence of a drug offense. The search warrant issued for Griffin\u2019s pickup was not supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\u00b625  However, the majority of the incriminating items seized from Griffin\u2019s pickup were located in plain view in the pickup bed. While it is true Montana\u2019s Constitution provides its citizens with broad privacy protections, <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6 46, 302 Mont. 228, \u00b6 46, 14 P.3d 456, \u00b6 46, what a person knowingly exposes to the public is not protected. <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 49. We have consistently stated that items stored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>in non-concealed areas of a vehicle are not constitutionally protected. <em>State v. Tackitt, </em>2003 MT 81, \u00b6 20, 315 Mont. 59, \u00b6 20, 67 P.3d 295, \u00b6 20; <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b626  It is not disputed Griffin was lawfully arrested for driving without a license. When Officer Hock went back to Griffin\u2019s pickup, even though the warrant to search the cab was invalid, she was lawfully located in a place from which she could view the evidence in Griffin\u2019s pickup bed-the street on which the pickup was parked. The incriminating nature of the evidence was immediately apparent, and Griffin had no reasonable expectation of privacy in such items. Under these circumstances, Officer Hock did not violate his rights to be free from an unlawful search and seizure when she removed this evidence from the open bed of his pickup.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00b627  Griffin argues the evidence seized from his pickup could have come from another source, namely that someone else put the evidence in the back of his pickup sometime after his arrest but before Officer Hock located it. There is no evidence in the record to support such an allegation. Further, the items found in the pickup bed supported a finding of probable cause to issue a search warrant for Griffin\u2019s house, which is different from the proof necessary to sustain a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"AzI\">\u00b628  While this Court has concluded the search warrant issued for Griffin\u2019s pickup was not supported by probable cause, the District Court\u2019s error was harmless because the items seized from Griffin\u2019s pickup bed did not require a search warrant before being seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b629  As for the items obtained from the cab of Griffin\u2019s pickup, these should have been suppressed. However, all of the charges against Griffin were supported by evidence obtained from Griffin\u2019s residence, the legality of which is discussed below, and therefore the failure to exclude the evidence obtained from the cab of Griffin\u2019s pickup was not prejudicial. Section 46-20-701(1), MCA, provides that \u201c[a] cause may not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial.\u201d <em>State v. Berg, </em>1999 MT 282, \u00b6 22, 296 Mont. 546, \u00b6 22, 991 P.2d 428, \u00b6 22 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\u00b630 Did the District Court err in not suppressing evidence found in Griffin\u2019s residence?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">\u00b631 Although the District Court did not make an explicit finding that probable cause supported the search warrant issued for Griffin\u2019s residence, it was implicit in its decision to deny Griffin\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>suppress. Griffin\u2019s only argument that the search warrant for his residence is invalid is that it was issued based on the items found in his pickup, which Griffin asserts were illegally seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b632  Since we have already determined the evidence from the bed of Griffin\u2019s pickup was legally seized, its existence was sufficient to support a finding of probable cause for issuance of the search warrant for Griffin\u2019s residence. We hold the District Court did not err in not suppressing the evidence obtained from Griffin\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b633 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b170-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
