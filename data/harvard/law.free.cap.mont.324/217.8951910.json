The plea was made pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA, allowing Otto to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of both his Motion to Dismiss and his Motion to Suppress. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">\u00b62 1. Did the District Court err when it denied Otto\u2019s pre-trial Motion to Dismiss on the grounds that the arresting officer did not have particularized suspicion to execute a traffic stop?</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">\u00b63 2. Did the District Court err when it denied Otto\u2019s pre-trial motion to suppress his breathalyzer results when the machine failed to print the results?</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">\u00b64 On the evening of May 30, 2002, Officer Kelly Mantooth was patrolling westbound on U.S. 87 east of Lewistown. He noticed a vehicle in front of him-later determined to be Otto\u2019s-make a \u201cdrastic swerve\u201d to the right and then to the left and straighten out. Mantooth testified that he thought the vehicle might have swerved to avoid a deer or something in the road, so he slowed down to investigate the area. He saw nothing, so he turned on his patrol car\u2019s video camera and accelerated to get closer to the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">\u00b65 Mantooth observed that the vehicle was a white pick-up truck and that it was now closely following a camper trailer. Mantooth did not observe any other questionable driving maneuvers, so he turned off his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>video camera. Shortly thereafter, the camper turned into a gas station, and the pick-up again swerved to the right and then left, crossing about a quarter of its width into the center turn lane. The pick-up then returned to the driving lane. Mantooth described the swerving as \u201cdrastic.\u201d He turned his patrol car video camera back on and activated his emergency lights to stop the pick-up. In response, the pick-up turned into a parking lot, one rear wheel hitting the curb as it did so.</p>\n<p id=\"AeQA\">\u00b66 Mantooth approached the pick-up and asked Otto if he had been drinking. Otto explained that he had been talking on a cellular telephone. Mantooth testified that Otto had red, watery eyes and that he was slurring his words. He also noticed the smell of alcohol on Otto\u2019s person. Mantooth asked Otto to bring his driver\u2019s license, registration and proof of insurance to Mantooth\u2019s patrol vehicle. Otto had some difficulty completing this request. He initially retrieved an expired insurance card and registration papers for a different vehicle. He returned to his vehicle for the correct paperwork and dropped his papers while getting out of the pick-up. Mantooth performed a Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (\u201cHGN\u201d) test on Otto. He then advised Otto that he was under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol and transported him to the police department for further processing. Otto was also cited with violating \u00a7 61-8-302, MCA, for \u201ccareless driving, by crossing centerline and following too close[ly],\u201d according to the citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b67 Otto performed field sobriety tests at the police station and agreed to submit to a breathalyzer test. Mantooth testified that the LED readout on the testing instrument reflected a blood alcohol concentration of .159, but the printer attached to the testing instrument failed to print the result on the printout card. Officer Tom Moring, who is a certified operator of the testing instrument, also observed the .159 reading, and testified that, other than the failure to print the result, the instrument appeared to be functioning properly. Officer Moring printed a blank test card and transcribed the instrument readings onto it.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b68 Otto filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that Mantooth lacked particularized suspicion to stop his vehicle. He also filed a motion to suppress evidence of the breathalyzer result on the grounds that it did not meet the definition of \u201ctest\u201d as found in ARM 23.4.201(31). Both motions were denied. On July 21, 2003, Otto pled guilty and reserved the right to appeal the denials of his motions. He further requested and was granted suspension of the prosecution on the charge of Careless Driving, pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-302, MCA, pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo </em>to determine whether the decision was correct. <em>State v. Loney, </em>2004 MT 204, \u00b6 6, 322 Mont. 305, \u00b6 6, 95 P.3d 691, \u00b6 6 (citation omitted). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is correct. <em>State v. Marks, </em>2002 MT 255, \u00b6 10, 312 Mont. 169, \u00b6 10, 59 P.3d 369, \u00b6 10 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A6x\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err when it denied Otto\u2019s pre-trial Motion to Dismiss on the grounds that the arresting officer did not have particularized suspicion to execute a traffic stop?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\u00b611 Otto argues that he did not violate any traffic laws nor engage in erratic driving in any manner that would have created the particularized suspicion requisite for Officer Mantooth to have executed a traffic stop. He claims that by focusing on the word \u201cdrastic,\u201d as the officer described Otto\u2019s swerving, the District Court found that there was sufficient objective data for Officer Mantooth to stop Otto\u2019s vehicle in contravention of significant evidence to the contrary. Otto points out that Mantooth admitted that on the first observed swerve, he did not see Otto cross either the fogline or the centerline of the highway, and that the maneuver was consistent with avoiding a deer or other obstacle in the road. Otto further claims that the second swerve which Mantooth observed likewise did not cause Otto to cross the fogline. He admits that he did go partway into the center turn lane and then return to his lane of travel, but maintains that to do so was not a violation of any traffic laws. Otto also claims that the District Court misunderstood the design of the roadway where the swerve occurred. He states that there is not a \u201ccenterline,\u201d but rather a center turn lane which divides the eastbound and westbound lanes of travel as U.S. Highway 87 passes through this part of Lewistown. Otto claims that crossing into the center turn lane is not equivalent to crossing the centerline and that the District Court thus twice incorrectly described his vehicle as having crossed the centerline.</p>\n<p id=\"Asp\">\u00b612 The State responds that Officer Mantooth\u2019s observations allowed him to form a particularized suspicion which justified the investigative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>stop of Otto\u2019s vehicle. The State disagrees with Otto\u2019s assertion that he committed no traffic offense when he crossed into the center turn lane and then returned to his lane of travel. The State claims that Otto violated \u00a7 61-8-321(1), MCA, which provides that vehicles must be driven on the right side of the roadway, except for certain situations-none of which applied in this particular instance. The State points to three occurrences-Otto\u2019s initial swerve, his following the camper trailer too closely, and his second swerve-which led to Mantooth\u2019s particularized suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b613 Otto replies that Mantooth\u2019s first observance of allegedly bad driving is irrelevant to the particularized suspicion issue because Mantooth admits the swerve occurred entirely within Otto\u2019s lane of travel, and this Court has held that weaving within one\u2019s own lane of travel is insufficient to establish probable cause. <em>Morris v. State, </em>2001 MT 13, \u00b6 10, 304 Mont. 114, \u00b6 10, 18 P.3d 1003, \u00b6 10. Otto further argues that his swerve partway into the center lane is not a violation under \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA, because moving into a center turn lane is an exception to the rule that vehicles must always drive on the right.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">\u00b614 Otto points to several Opinions in which we have held that questionable driving behaviors observed by police officers were insufficient to allow for particularized suspicion to execute a traffic stop. See <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 46, 899 P.2d 540 (driving which was \u201cbordering on traveling too fast\u201d and waiting too long at a four-way stop sign with no traffic laws broken insufficient for particularized suspicion); <em>State v. Lafferty, </em>1998 MT 247, 291 Mont. 157, 967 P.2d 363 (crossing the fogline twice and driving on it once without any traffic citations issued as a result of the maneuvers insufficient for particularized suspicion); <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 10 (\u201cdrifting\u201d over the fogline without being cited for any driving offenses other than the DUI insufficient for particularized suspicion). But see <em>State v. Loiselle, </em>2001 MT 174, 306 Mont. 166, 30 P.3d 1097 (drifting across the fogline, turning into parking lot of a closed business without signaling and then pulling back out into traffic after \u201closing\u201d patrol car, changing lanes without signaling, driving on the fogline, and weaving slightly back and forth sufficient for particularized suspicion although no other traffic citations issued).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b615  Pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA, a peace officer may stop any vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the occupant has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense. In order to prove the existence of a particularized suspicion sufficient to stop a vehicle, the prosecution must show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>objective data from which an experienced peace officer can make certain inferences and a resulting suspicion that the occupant of the vehicle is engaged in wrongdoing. <em>Lafferty, </em>\u00b6 9 (citation omitted). Whether a particularized suspicion exists to justify an investigative stop is a question of fact which depends on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Lafferty, </em>\u00b6 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b616 In <em>Loney, </em>we reversed a district court\u2019s dismissal of charges against the defendant, on the grounds that the officer who stopped her vehicle had the requisite particularized suspicion to do so. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 16. Loney was observed crossing the centerline of a two-lane highway in a no-passing zone three times at speeds of 65 to 70 miles per hour, and twice crossing the fogline at the edge of the highway. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 2. Loney was stopped by a police officer and subsequently cited for DUI and failing to drive on the right side of the roadway in violation of \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA. While the district court relied on <em>Morris </em>when it dismissed the charges against Loney, we distinguished <em>Morris, </em>noting that, unlike Loney, Morris was not cited for any driving offenses other than DUI. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 9, citing Morris, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b617 In <em>Loney, </em>we relied upon <em>Widdicombe v. State ex rel. Lafond, </em>2004 MT 49, 320 Mont. 133, 85 P.3d 1271, in which highway patrol officers stopped a vehicle which crossed the centerline of a two-lane highway by a tire\u2019s width at least three times. <em>Widdicombe, </em>\u00b6 5. The district court refused to reinstate Widdicombe\u2019s suspended driver\u2019s license and we affirmed, explaining that driving a vehicle across the yellow centerline, absent one of the statutory exceptions, constitutes a traffic violation under \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA. <em>Widdicombe, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b618 Otto would have us distinguish crossing the centerline of a highway from crossing the line which separates the driving lane from a center turn lane. He further maintains that his crossing partway into the center turn lane meets one of the exceptions of \u00a7 61-8-321(1), MCA. He does not, however, tell us which one. In <em>Widdicombe, </em>we explained that \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA, prohibits drivers from \u201ccarelessly crossing the yellow center line and subjecting themselves and other drivers on the road to the possibility of a head-on collision.\u201d <em>Widdicombe, </em>\u00b6 12. In Otto\u2019s case, crossing carelessly into a center turn lane where there is the possibility of meeting on-coming traffic likewise places drivers in the position of potentially facing a head-on collision. Furthermore, the language of \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA, enunciates the specific exceptions to the right-side rule. None of them apply to Otto\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b619  Observation of a traffic offense is sufficient to establish particularized suspicion. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 16. Otto\u2019s protestations to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>contrary, he <em>was </em>cited for another traffic offense. Officer Mantooth observed Otto drive somewhere other than the right side of the roadway, a possible violation of \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA. While Otto\u2019s driving errors may not have been as egregious as those in <em>Loney </em>or <em>Widdicombe, </em>unlike the defendant in <em>Morris, </em>he was cited for a violation other than DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b620  Thus, we conclude the District Court correctly held that Officer Mantooth had the requisite particularized suspicion to execute a traffic stop of Otto\u2019s pick-up, pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA. We affirm its denial of Otto\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u00b621 Did the District Court err when it denied Otto\u2019s pre-trial motion to suppress his breathalyzer results when the machine failed to print the results?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u00b622 Otto argues that the District Court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the results of his breathalyzer test because no printed record of his breath test was obtained after he blew into the breathalyzer machine. He claims that his breathalyzer sample did not meet the definition of \u201ctest\u201d as found in ARM 23.4.201(31), and thus the result should not have been allowed as evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\u00b623 ARM 23.4.201(31), states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">\u201cTest\u201d, in reference to a breath analysis, means a full and complete analysis of properly delivered breath sample(s). Such analysis is to be considered complete when the breath analysis instrument has executed its prescribed program, a final result is obtained and a printed record is produced by the breath test instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">\u00b624 The State points out Otto has not argued that the admission of his breathalyzer results was prejudicial. This Court will not reverse a district court unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial. Section 46-20-701(1), MCA. Furthermore, the State maintains, while a defendant charged with DUI is entitled to the procedural safeguards contained within the administrative rules, in the case at hand, Otto has misconstrued a definition as a substantive directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">\u00b625 The District Court found that, at the time the breathalyzer test was administered, the printer malfunctioned through no apparent fault of Officers Mantooth and Moring. The District Court further found that the breathalyzer did execute its prescribed program and did show a final result-. 159, as witnessed and manually written down by the officers. The District Court further concluded that, while ARM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>23.4.201(31) defines a \u201ctest,\u201d there is no other administrative rule which lists or states the consequences of a failure of the instrument to actually print its result. The District Court acknowledged that \u201csuch a definition serves no purpose, if there is no rule which specifies a consequence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b626 Otto relies on our holdings in <em>State v. Woods </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 124, 947 P.2d 62, and <em>State v. McDonald </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 340, 697 P.2d 1328. In <em>McDonald, </em>the results of a blood test were found to be inadmissible by this Court because the person who drew the defendant\u2019s blood at the hospital was not properly identified on the hospital record as required by ARM 23.3.931. <em>McDonald, </em>215 Mont. at 345-46, 697 P.2d at 1331. In <em>Woods, </em>we reiterated that a defendant charged with a DUI is entitled to the procedural safeguards contained within the administrative rules. <em>Woods, </em>285 Mont. at 127, 947 P.2d at 63. (In a special concurrence in <em>Woods, </em>it was explained that while the <em>McDonald </em>rule may be correct, the <em>McDonald </em>decision itself is of questionable authority due to a change in the applicable statutes which occurred during the course of that proceeding. <em>Woods, </em>285 Mont. at 130, 947 P.2d at 65-66 (Nelson, J., specially concurring.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b627 Regardless, we need not reach <em>McDonald </em>or <em>Woods </em>to render our decision here. Significantly, and as the State notes, Otto has not argued that he was prejudiced by the admission of the breathalyzer results. Moreover, the court had ample other evidence before. it, including the HGN results, the results from the field sobriety test performed at the police station, Otto\u2019s difficulty in retrieving and presenting the relevant paperwork, and the smell of alcohol on his person, much of which was preserved on the patrol car videotape and all of which was the subject of testimony by Officer Mantooth.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b628  On the record before us, the prejudicial effect of the breathalyzer results has not been either argued or established. Thus, we conclude the District Court\u2019s denial of Otto\u2019s Motion to Suppress the breathalyzer results is not cause for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\u00b629 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b244-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
