Whether the District Court erred in awarding Sherri a disproportionate share of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u00b67 At the outset, we note Sherri has raised five additional issues in her brief. However, in order to preserve an issue not raised by the appellant, a respondent must file a notice of cross-appeal. <em>Billings Firefighters Local 521 v. Billings, </em>1999 MT 6, \u00b6 31, 293 Mont. 41, \u00b6 31, 973 P.2d 222, \u00b6 31 (citing <em>Gabriel v. Woods </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 170, 178, 862 P.2d 42, 47). Sherri has not filed a notice of cross-appeal. As a result, we will not address the additional issues she has raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b68 Steve and Sherri were married on May 22,1993. Steve and Sherri separated on March 13, 2001, and on March 27, 2001, Sherri filed a petition for dissolution. Steve and Sherri have two children as a result of their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b69 At the time of their marriage, Steve was the sole proprietor of Northwest Precision, Inc., a machine manufacturing business. Among his other assets, Steve also owned two trucks, a tract of land with a mobile home and two shop buildings as well as interest in real property owned in common with his family. Sherri, on the other hand, came into the marriage with minimal personal items and a 1985 Honda. During the marriage, however, Sherri started Paper Inspirations, a hand-stamp business which personalizes clothing and gift cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\u00b610 At the time of separation, both parties agreed to a parenting plan, division of personal property and retention of their respective businesses. Both parties could not agree, however, on the valuation of Northwest Precision and its assets for the purpose of distributing the marital estate. The parties could also not agree on the income that should be attributed to Steve for determining child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\u00b611 The District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment on September 3, 2003. Steve filed a motion to reconsider, contending the District Court erred by including $258,357 in real property and improvements twice in its valuation of marital assets. On November 5, 2003, the District Court issued its Amended Findings of Fact and Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"APv\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">\u00b612 Whether the District Court erred in determining the property valuation at the time of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">\u00b613 Steve argues the District Court abused its discretion in determining the date of marriage valuation of his real property and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>improvements associated with his business. He claims the court erred when it relied on Sherri\u2019s expert property appraiser, Gene Lard, who incorrectly used the market approach in estimating the property\u2019s value at $100,000 at the time of marriage. Steve alleges no genuine comparable sales existed at the time to accurately gauge his property\u2019s value and contends the cost approach used by his expert, Tom Donovan, was more comprehensive in evaluating the property at $145,000 at the time of the marriage. Finally, he maintains Sherri made no contributions to the purchase price and her assistance with improvements to the property was compensated at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b614 Sherri counters the District Court correctly considered her expert\u2019s property valuation of $100,000 at the time of marriage. She maintains her expert properly used the market method of evaluating Steve\u2019s property holdings, reviewing some 400 sales in the time period in an attempt to find comparable sales and reach a fair market value. Further, Sherri argues Steve\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony was obtained in the form of a perpetuation deposition during which Sherri\u2019s counsel was unable to attend and participate in due to illness. Moreover, Sherri contends Steve\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony was based exclusively on Steve\u2019s estimates regarding improvements and labor on the property. Sherri maintains these improvements occurred after the date of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"AHT\">\u00b615  The district court has broad discretion in determining the value of property in dissolution. Its valuation can be premised on expert testimony, lay testimony, documentary evidence, or any combination thereof. The court is free to adopt any reasonable valuation of marital property which is supported by the record as long as it is reasonable in light of the evidence submitted. <em>In re Marriage of Meeks </em>(1995), 276 Mont. 237, 242-43, 915 P.2d 831, 834-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b616  Based on our review of the record, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining the property value at the time of marriage. The District Court received testimony at trial concerning the appreciation in the value of the property. Between the two experts presented, the court found the appraisal of Sherri\u2019s expert to be more reliable, citing his use of comparable sales as justifying its finding. The court stated, \u201cMr. Lard used a comparable sales method to determine the May, 1993 value and although true comparable sales were hard to find, his comparison and analysis appeared to be justified.\u201d Similarly, the District Court found Donovan\u2019s cost approach valuation \u201cappeared to be unrealistic,\u201d believing his reliance on Steve\u2019s calculations improper. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s determination the value of Steve\u2019s property was $100,000 at the time of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b617 Whether the District Court erred in determining Steve\u2019s sustainable income for purposes of calculating child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b618 Steve argues the District Court\u2019s finding he had sustainable income of $46,000 was unsupported by substantial credible evidence. Steve contends the District Court misconstrued his expert witness\u2019s testimony regarding his annual average income. He also asserts the District Court incorrectly relied on Sherri\u2019s expert, Nick Bourdeau (Bourdeau), who arbitrarily arrived at a determination Steve earned $52,028 in wages plus an additional $35,161 from scrap metal sales and adjustments for business expenses and deductions. Included in Bourdeau\u2019s estimate is $15,000 in income which Steve contends not only is unsupported by evidence in the record but is, in fact, a product of alchemy. Further, Steve maintains the District Court, in using Bourdeau\u2019s testimony, incorrectly considered the three year period immediately preceding the dissolution which failed to reflect the inherent unpredictability of Steve\u2019s business and client base.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b619 Sherri also contends the District Court erred in determining Steve\u2019s income. However, Sherri counters the District Court\u2019s findings fail to reflect Bourdeau\u2019s full estimates regarding Steve\u2019s earnings. Specifically, Sherri maintains the District Court should have used the average of Steve\u2019s income from the prior three years of $52,028 plus an additional $35,161 from unreported scrap income as well as business expenses, depreciations and deductions to estimate Steve\u2019s estate share. Sherri argues Bourdeau is a noted expert in the field of marital asset distribution who correctly followed standard calculations in arriving at his conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b620  We review a district court\u2019s award of child support to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Bee, </em>2002 MT 49, \u00b6 19, 309 Mont. 34, \u00b6 19, 43 P.3d 903, \u00b6 19. To conclude a district court abused its discretion in child support calculations, we must determine whether the district court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>In re Marriage of Kovarik, </em>1998 MT 33, \u00b6 21, 287 Mont. 350, \u00b6 21, 954 P.2d 1147, \u00b6 21. \u00b621 The criteria for determination of income under the child support guidelines is defined in \u00a7 37.62.106, ARM, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">(1) Income for child support includes actual income, imputed income, or any combination thereof which fairly reflects a parent\u2019s resources available for child support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">(2) Actual income includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">(a) economic benefit from whatever source derived ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>(6) \u2018Imputed income\u2019 means income not actually earned by a parent, but which will be attributed to the parent based on:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">(a) the parent\u2019s earning potential if employed full-time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">(7) Income should be imputed whenever a parent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">(a) is unemployed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">(b) is underemployed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u00b622  We conclude the District Court abused its discretion in determining Steve\u2019s sustainable income. In its order, the District Court allocated income of $46,000 to Steve for child support calculations based upon the following: stipulated annual income of $37,000; his average wage of $50,000 for the years 1999 through 2001; Steve\u2019s expert\u2019s opinion he should earn $46,000 annually; and unreported scrap income of $5,000. However, the District Court failed to properly support its findings as to Steve\u2019s average annual income as well as his scrap income.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u00b623 In arriving at its findings concerning Steve\u2019s average annual income, the District Court apparently relied on Steve\u2019s expert\u2019s opinion about the business\u2019 ability to pay Steve a $46,000 salary. Steve\u2019s expert stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">[W]hen you\u2019re looking at business valuations you have to look at what will this business sustain? He should be able to pay himself a $46,000 salary every year. He hasn\u2019t been able to do that. There was only three years in the history of the company when he was over $23,000. So to pick one year out of the middle of all of this other business history is - is not a fair way to look at this because it didn\u2019t do it the three years after, and this year it\u2019s not gonna - right now, as of May, it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s gorma do it. It\u2019s down $7,000 from last year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">Steve\u2019s expert further testified in only three of the last ten years were Steve\u2019s wages at the $40,000 level, and in one of those years the corporation sustained losses. It is apparent the District Court misconstrued the testimony of Steve\u2019s expert. Although the company was able to pay Steve a salary of $40,000 or more occasionally, the business could not sustain Steve\u2019s annual salary at $40,000. Further, the three years used to estimate his average income were not representative because the business continued to sustain loses. Therefore, we conclude the District Court failed to support its findings concerning Steve\u2019s average annual income.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">\u00b624 The District Court also failed to properly support its findings as to Steve\u2019s imputed income. The District Court heard testimony at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>from Sherri\u2019s expert, Bourdeau, that Steve averaged $5,000 a year in unreported income as a result of scrap metal sales. However, as part of his calculations as to Steve\u2019s unreported income, including the scrap metal, Bourdeau admitted his computations were based on uninformed estimates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">Q: Okay. Now, let\u2019s take the scrap thing first. First - well, no, before we take the scrap thing at all, how did you get to the figure $15,000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">A: It\u2019s an estimate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">Q: An estimate based on what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">A: Based upon the kind of expenses that Sherri Helzer said were going through there and Steve Helzer said were going through there and based upon scrap income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">Q: So is it your testimony that they told you that $15,000 a year in personal expenditures were going through there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">A: That was the problem. Nobody would tell me anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">Q: Okay. And the truth is that you made that estimate kind of out of thin air because nobody did tell you anything, you didn\u2019t have any idea, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">A: No. What I did was I went through the expenses that Sherri Helzer thought were going through there and I said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll confirm these.\u201d I was never able to confirm them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">Later in Bourdeau\u2019s cross-examination, the following testimony was adduced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-13\">Q: Okay ... [y]ou never did anything where you mathematically determined that $15,000, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-14\">A: I couldn\u2019t</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-15\">Q: Okay. So that figure is kind of out of thin air or, as the Supreme Court might say, a product of alchemy; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-16\">A: Alchemy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-17\">The above quote refers to our Opinion <em>in In re Marriage of Banka, </em>2003 MT 84, 315 Mont. 97, 67 P.3d 885. In that case, we stated Bourdeau had incorrectly imputed income to the husband based on assets used to produce income as well as a fictitious assumption the husband was under-employed. There, as here, we believe Bourdeau\u2019s reasoning is \u201calchemy at its best.\u201d <em>Banka, </em>\u00b6 41. Indeed, the District Court\u2019s order gives no indication as to how Bourdeau arrived at the figure of $15,000 of which the court used $5,000 as coming from scrap income. In fact, the District Court also heard testimony from Steve\u2019s expert the income from scrap metal was $4,847 in 2001, $376 in 1999 and $1,548 in 1998. Furthermore, Sherri issued subpoenas to every scrap dealer in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Northwest who in turn reported Steve never produced $5,000 in scrap metal for one year. Finally, evidence at trial did not suggest Steve was under-employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b625 Thus, the District Court\u2019s finding Steve averaged $5,000 in scrap sales - let alone $15,000 in unreported income - was arbitrary and unsupported by the evidence. Therefore, we reverse the District Court regarding Steve\u2019s sustainable income and remand for further findings consistent with this decision. Upon remand the District Court shall determine a correct child support award based on its amended findings regarding Steve\u2019s sustainable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b626 Whether the District Court erred by reapportioning a percentage of the marital estate in its amended findings to Sherri after it had mistakenly doubled Steve\u2019s share of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u00b627 Steve argues the District Court abused its discretion in reapportioning a percentage of the marital estate in its amended findings after inadvertently counting the value of the real property twice against the portion of the marital estate awarded to Steve. Steve asserts the District Court rewrote its findings to award Sherri a similar percentage of the marital estate after it acknowledged it had double charged $258,357 against Steve\u2019s share of the marital estate. Specifically, Steve contends the court initially awarded Sherri a cash equalization payment of $75,000 and 57% of the marital estate. The court then amended its findings, changing the cash equalization payment to $55,000 and awarding Sherri 59% of the marital estate. Further, Steve maintains the District Court erred in its amended findings by rejecting the testimony of Steve\u2019s expert, Mark Schickendantz (Schickendantz), who provided valuations of Steve\u2019s property for distribution purposes in favor of Bourdeau\u2019s fictitious estimates.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\u00b628 Sherri counters the District Court did not abuse its discretion in amending its findings and redistributing the marital assets to accurately reflect the testimony at trial. Sherri asserts the District Court correctly adjusted the cash equalization payment and percentage of the marital estate to mirror the experts\u2019 testimony at trial. Sherri contends the difference between the equalization payment of $20,000 and 2% change in her share of the marital estate was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\u00b629 We review a district court\u2019s division of marital property for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Engen, </em>1998 MT 153, \u00b6 26, 289 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>299, \u00b6 26, 961 P.2d 738, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b630  We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion by reapportioning a percentage of the marital estate in its amended findings to Sherri after it had mistakenly doubled Steve\u2019s share of the marital estate. In its Amended Findings of Fact and Judgment, the District Court recognized that it erroneously counted $258,357 in real property twice against the portion of the marital estate awarded to Steve, necessitating a revision of its previous findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b631 In reconsidering its findings concerning the marital estate, the District Court studied the testimony of Schickendantz, a certified equipment appraiser, regarding values on the business\u2019s equipment before, during and after the marriage. In its Amended Findings, the District Court stated, \u201c[t]he Court finds this hard asset appraisal to be biased in favor of the Respondent and that it is necessary to make adjustments in order to accomplish an equitable distribution of the marital estate.\u201d Presumably relying on Sherri\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony at trial as well as Steve\u2019s expert\u2019s estimates at trial, the court then proceeded to itemize the premarital value of the assets as well as their amortization over the nine-year marriage, considering revised estimates of the assets\u2019 worth over the course of the marriage. The District Court then revised its <em>original </em>estimate that all of the equipment owned by Northwest Precision should be valued at 50% of their original value to a higher estimate of 58%. The court then awarded Sherri an increased portion of the total asset value for the end of marriage valuation of Northwest Precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u00b632 Having found an increased value in Northwest Precision, the District Court determined a cash equalization payment of $55,000 from Steve to Sherri was necessary to achieve an equitable distribution of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\u00b633 We have recognized that district courts face a considerable task in determining an equitable distribution of the marital estate. In the final analysis, it is not a question of whether we would be persuaded to reach a different conclusion after considering the same evidence. Rather, the test is whether the district court had adequate evidence to support its conclusions. <em>In re Marriage of Haines, </em>2002 MT 182, \u00b6 23, 311 Mont. 70, \u00b6 23, 53 P.3d 378, \u00b6 23. In this case, we conclude the District Court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s marital estate share awarded to Sherri.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\u00b634 Whether the District Court erred in awarding Sherri a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>disproportionate share of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b635 Steve argues the District Court abused its discretion in awarding Sherri a disproportionate share of the marital estate. Steve maintains Sherri did not seek maintenance or a disparate division of the marital estate. More specifically, Steve contends Sherri entered the marriage with no job, virtually no assets, and made no contribution to Steve\u2019s assets during the course of the marriage. Further, Sherri\u2019s business, which produces a sustainable income of $25,000 a year, was capitalized solely through his business assets. Finally, Sherri failed to contribute or maintain assets which were owned or purchased by Steve before and throughout the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b636 Sherri counters the District Court did not abuse its broad discretion in fashioning an equitable distribution of property. Sherri maintains the court found it was necessary to award her a disproportionate distribution of the marital assets based on the disparate incomes of the parties, the ability to acquire future assets, and the premarital equity in assets awarded to Steve.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b637 We review a district court\u2019s division of marital property to determine whether the findings of fact upon which the division is based are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Lee </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 410, 417, 938 P.2d 650, 654. \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Steinbeisser, </em>2002 MT 309, \u00b6 17, 313 Mont. 74, \u00b6 17, 60 P.3d 441, \u00b6 17. Absent clearly erroneous findings, this Court will affirm a district court\u2019s division of property unless we identify an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Gerhart, </em>2003 MT 292, \u00b6 16, 318 Mont. 94, \u00b6 16, 78 P.3d 1219, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b638 The criteria for determination of the division of property is defined in \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">(1) In a proceeding for a dissolution of a marriage ... the court... shall... finally and equitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both, however and whenever acquired and whether the title thereto is in the name of the husband or wife or both ... [T]he court shall consider those contributions of the other spouse to the marriage, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">(a) the nonmonetary contribution of a homemaker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">(b) the extent to which such contributions have facilitated the maintenance of this property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-11\">(c) whether or not the property division serves as an alternative to maintenance arrangements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u00b639 The District Court made extensive findings regarding the parties\u2019 financial relationships. The court noted Sherri\u2019s purchase and contribution to assets such as a tract of land which was titled to and used by Northwest Precision. Further, the court heard evidence at trial suggesting Sherri contributed to the creation and maintenance of this separate parcel through the use of family transfers. The District Court also presumably determined Sherri worked for Northwest Precision for over ten years, as well as contributed her income from her separate business, Paper Inspirations, and her services to the maintenance of Northwest Precision and its assets. Finally, the District Court also considered evidence at trial Sherri contributed her services as a housewife and mother in maintaining the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b640  We conclude the District Court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous and the court did not abuse its discretion in determining Sherri\u2019s marital share. Section 40-4-202(1), MCA, directs the district court to consider the nonmonetary contribution of a homemaker, the extent such contributions facilitated the maintenance of the property and whether the division serves as an alternative to maintenance arrangements. Here, maintenance is not an issue. Further, the District Court\u2019s findings support our conclusion the court did not award a disproportionate distribution of the marital estate to Sherri in lieu of maintenance. Indeed, the District Court believed it was necessary to equitably divide the marital estate based on the disparate income of the parties, the ability to acquire future assets, and the premarital equity in assets awarded to Steve.
