The dam of the Troy Cotton and Woollen Manufactory built in 1813 raised the natural level of the Watuppa ponds three feet. The defendant\u2019s dam was built in 1827 below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the dam of the Troy company of such height as to flow the ponds two feet higher, and it acquired by grant from riparian owners rights of flowage as high as its dam. <em>Watuppa Reservoir Co. </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>147 Mass. 548, 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">By deed of BJhoda Warren, one of the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in title, given in 1830, the defendant was granted the right to flow the land in question, \u201craising and keeping raised the water of the Watuppa Ponds as high as an iron bolt which is driven into a pudden stone rock in land adjoining the North Pond owned by Barnabas &amp; Abraham Blossom, known by the name of Phillip\u2019s Swamp'.\u201d The declaration alleges and the evidence shows that if the water is raised above \u201cfull pond\u201d it exceeds the height of the dam as well as of the iron bolt in the pudding stone rock. In the plaintiff\u2019s title deed the premises are referred to as \u201cflowed land,\u201d no portion of which would be uncovered when the pond was at full level, and in its natural condition and before any flooding it was covered by water. But when the plaintiff entered into possession quite an amount of filling had been put in where the lot abutted on the street, which at this point forms part of the northerly shore of the south pond, and there were two buildings with platforms, and also a portion of a third building, and a smaller building, all of \u201cwooden frame construction,\u201d which with the platform and walks attached thereto, extended for a considerable distance over the water, and were supported by piles about five feet apart driven into the bed of the pond. The buildings with their equipment and furnishings were used by the plaintiff in \u201ccarrying on a boating and fishing business\u201d when the overflow occurred. It was undisputed, or the jury would have been warranted in finding that the water rose above \u201cfull pond level\u201d flooding the floors \"some six or seven inches\u201d damaging the buildings and causing loss to the plaintiff of his stock in trade consisting of \u201ccandy, fishing tackle, cigars and tobacco.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The right to occupy and improve the property was as between the parties undoubtedly limited only by the easement. The buildings, however, with the piling by which they are supported are to be treated as entire, and not as disconnected and independent structures. The piling was the indispensable foundation or substructure on which they rested and were supported and hence it was incorporated and formed part of their construction. <em>Trues-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number><em>dell </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>13 Gray, 311, 312. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Gardiner, </em>117 Mass. 492. <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>163 Mass. 501. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>206 Mass. 513, 515. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Waldron, </em>92 Maine, 17. <em>Benedict </em>v. <em>Ocean Ins. Co. </em>31 N. Y. 389, 394. The difference between this mode and the filling in of the whole area followed by the erection of buildings thereon would be merely one of degree in its limitation of the defendant\u2019s right of unobstructed flowage. The erection and maintenance of the buildings which were annexed to the soil constituted an unlawful interference with the dominant easement, and the plaintiff cannot recover without proof of intentional injury, of which there is no evidence. <em>Philbrick </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>97 Mass. 133. <em>Macomber </em>v. <em>Godfrey, </em>108 Mass. 219. <em>Watuppa Reservoir Co. </em>v. <em>Mackenzie, supra.
