It was dated April 21, 1911, and is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">\u201cMr. George A. Creighton, Lynn, Mass. My dear Mr. Creighton: \u2014 In accordance with your instructions I have put you down for $1000 of the underwriting of the Eastern Canada Fisheries Ltd. This entitles you to 10 shares of preferred stock and 20 of the common. Payments are 10% on the amount beginning May 1st. In regard to the dividend on the Preferred stock I would say that I will personally guarantee a 7% dividend on your $1000 preferred stock. Very truly yours, Wm. D. Elwell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Dividends on the preferred stock of the Eastern Canada Fisheries, Limited, were paid to the plaintiff in the years 1912 to 1917, inclusive. He contends that the guaranty of a seven per cent dividend by the defendant was to continue as long as he (the plaintiff) was the owner of the stock. He testified that he paid $100 a month for ten consecutive months \u2014 until the subscription price had been fully paid; and that he could not recall the conversation between himself and the defendant with reference to the purchase of the stock, and had no present memory of such conversation. The defendant testified, without objection, that the plaintiff asked concerning dividends; that nothing was said to him as to when dividends would be paid; that the plaintiff inquired whether he would be paid the dividend while he was paying for the stock, and the defendant answered, \u201cwe didn\u2019t know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>when the dividends would be paid, and to satisfy Mr. Creighton I guaranteed a year\u2019s dividend on the stock.\u201d The defendant further testified that when the second payment of $70 was made he told the plaintiff that he didn\u2019t owe him anything, whereupon the plaintiff said, \u201cNever mind, you can make it up out of my business.\u201d In the Superior Court there was a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The agreement was in writing and its construction was for the court. The parties are bound by the contract as written; this rule is not affected by the fact that paroi evidence was admitted without objection. <em>London Guarantee &amp; Accident Co. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>241 Mass. 255. <em>Butterick Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>203 Mass. 122. <em>Mears </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>199 Mass. 319. <em>Blade </em>v. <em>Bachelder, </em>120 Mass. 171. The defendant\u2019s guaranty was that \u201ca 7% dividend\u201d would be paid. It was a guaranty of a \u201cdividend\u201d on the preferred stock. In our opinion, these words do not imply a promise that more than one dividend would be paid, or that dividends for any length of time beyond the single seven per cent dividend would be paid. The promise was limited to one dividend of seven per cent. The words were in the, singular, and there is nothing in the circumstances surrounding the transaction which shows that the meaning of the words expressed in the written guaranty should be extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Whittemore, </em>202 Mass. 39, the guaranty was to pay \u201cdividends amounting to not less than 8% per annum,\u201d and the defendant agreed to repurchase the stock in one year. Dividends were paid for fourteen months at the rate of eight per cent. In that case the word \u201cdividends\u201d was used, and not the words \u201c a dividend,\u201d as in the case at bar. It was held that the guaranty was intended to be limited to one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In <em>Rotch </em>v. <em>French, </em>176 Mass. 1, the defendant\u2019s guaranty was to pay \u201ca dividend of 6% per annum on stock subscribed to.\u201d It was assumed without deciding that more than one dividend was guaranteed. Verdicts for the plaintiff were set aside. Rotch and Seabury were paid dividends during their lives, and the jury were warranted in finding that they paid for their stock on the express stipulation that they should receive the guaranty. It was held that the guaranty continued for a reasonable time. In that case the dividend was to be paid \u201cper annum.\u201d These words are not found in the defendant\u2019s guaranty, in the present case. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>our opinion, the case is distinguishable from <em>Rotch </em>v. <em>French. </em>The true meaning of the guaranty is that a dividend of seven per cent was to be paid and that it was not to extend beyond the payment of one dividend of seven per cent. It was not agreed that the dividend was to be paid annually or per annum. The case is governed by <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Whittemore, supra, </em>and as the plaintiff has been paid more than one dividend, he cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
