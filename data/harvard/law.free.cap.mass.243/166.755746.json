There was medical testimony tending to show that such hernias are caused by \u201csudden lifting, sudden wrenching and falling;\u201d that lifting the cloth in the manner described would be sufficient cause for the hernia, and that the employee\u2019s death on January 5, 1922, resulted from the hernia. On this evidence the board was fully warranted in finding that the fatal injury to the employee arose out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Notice in writing as required by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 42, was not given. The Industrial Accident Board, however, found as a fact that the employer had notice of the injury \u201cas soon as practicable after its occurrence.\u201d By G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 44, it was expressly provided that want of notice shall not bar proceedings, if it be shown that the insured had knowledge of the injury. Mrs. Butler, the petitioner, testified that on the day following the injury to her husband she received a telephone call from the mill where he had been employed, and that she believed the person with whom she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>talked was the paymaster; she told him her husband had been hurt the day before, and it was a serious case. There was testimony from the employee\u2019s foreman that within two or three days following December 27 he was informed by \u201cthe office\u201d it had been reported the deceased was injured while at work in the mill; that he made report to the Industrial Accident Board, saying the injury occurred on December 27, and it occurred while the deceased was \u201cthrowing piece over perch, reaching too high. Moving' truck load to press from perch.\u201d There was further evidence indicating that the employer had knowledge of the employee\u2019s injury and received the knowledge as soon as practicable after its occurrence. <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>226 Mass. 60. <em>Brown\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 31. <em>Lapan\u2019s Case, </em>237 Mass. 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">There was evidence to sustain the findings of the board upon both questions, and these findings must stand. The decree of the Superior Court awarding weekly compensation to Margaret M. Butler, the widow of the employee, of $10 a week for four hundred weeks is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
