Writ dated January 26,1920.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-4\">The defendant originally named in each of the second and third actions was the corporation, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company. On January 5, 1922, motions were 'allowed therein substituting as defendant James C. Davis, the person designated as agent under the provisions of the Federal Transportation Act (1920), 41 U. S. Sts. at Large, 456, and process was issued, summoning him as such agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-5\">The defendant in all the actions appeared specially and filed motions to dismiss, described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-6\">The motions to dismiss were heard by <em>N. P. Brown, </em>J., and were denied; and, being of the opinion that such ruling raised important and substantial questions of law which ought to be determined by this court before further proceedings were had, with the consent and at the request of the parties he reported the actions for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-7\">The Federal Transportation Act (1920), 41 U. S. Sts. at Large, 457, in \u00a7 200 (a) provided in substance that federal control of the railroads should cease on March 1, 1920; that (\u00a7 206 a) suits thereafter brought for causes arising under federal control should be brought, after termination of federal control, \u201cagainst an agent designated by the President for such purpose.\u201d Section 206 (d) reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-8\">\u201cActions, suits, proceedings, and reparation claims, of the character above described pending at the termination of Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>control shall not abate by reason of such termination, but may be prosecuted to final judgment, substituting the agent designated by the President under subdivision (a).\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-3\"><em>R. A. </em>Bidwell, (G. <em>W. Gordon &amp; R. King </em>with him,) for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-4\"><em>M. G.

The second action is brought by the administratrix resident in Connecticut of the estate of a deceased resident of that State to recover damages for personal injury and resultant death of the decedent, all occurring in that State during the period of federal control of the same railroad system while the deceased was working as an employee in its operation. The third action is by an. administrator of a deceased resident of Connecticut to recover damages for the death of the decedent while a traveller upon a way in that State under circumstances which under a statute of Connecticut give rise to a cause of action. The first action was brought against the Director General of Railroads of the United States. Both the other actions originally were brought against the railroad corporation, but by amendment it was sought to substitute as defendant the agent of the United States designated by the President under Act of Congress approved February 28, 1920, \u00a7 206 (a); 41 U. S. Sts. at Large, 461, against whom actions should be brought after the termination of federal control.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Each action was brought in the Superior Court for our county of Hampden. Each cause of action is such that, if it had occurred and been brought against the railroad while in private ownership and control, the courts of this Commonwealth would have possessed and exercised jurisdiction over it and the parties. <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Central New England &amp; Western Railroad, </em>155 Mass. 176. <em>Hanlan </em>v. <em>Frederick Leyland &amp; Co. Ltd. </em>223 Mass. 438, and cases there collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">By virtue of the Act of Congress of August 29, 1916, 39 U. S. Sts. at Large, 619, 645, and the Proclamation of the President of December 26, 1917, 40 U. S. Sts. at Large, 1733, and under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Act of Congress of March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 U. S. Sts. at Large, 451, possession of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad was taken by the Railroad Administration of the United States and supervision of it exercised by the Director General through \u201cone control, one administration, one power for the accomplishment of the one purpose, the complete possession by governmental authority to replace for the period provided the private ownership theretofore existing.\u201d <em>Northern Pacific Railway </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>250 U. S. 135, 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\">It is plain from recent decisions that none of these actions can be maintained against the railroad corporation. <em>Nominsky </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>239 Mass. 254. <em>\u00c6tna Mills </em>v. <em>Director General of Railroads, </em>242 Mass. 255. <em>Missouri Pacific Railroad </em>v. <em>Ault, </em>256 U. S. 554. The United States through the Director General alone is liable for such actions. <em>Dahn </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>258 U. S. 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The federal government, being thus in complete control of the railroad, could not be impleaded in any court of this country except to the extent and upon terms to which it has consented. <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>McAdoo, </em>234 U. S. 627, 629. <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>204 U. S. 331. <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Roper, </em>246 U. S. 335. <em>McArthur Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>197 Mass. 137. <em>Public Service Commissioners </em>v. <em>New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. </em>232 Mass. 465, 470. The question does not relate to the establishment of jurisdiction of the courts of this Commonwealth. It may be assumed that no act of Congress or order of a federal officer can enlarge, restrict or regulate the jurisdiction of State courts, although it may provide that certain new actions within the scope of federal power may be brought under existing jurisdiction already conferred by State laws. <em>Second Employers\u2019 Liability Cases, </em>223 U. S. 1, 56-58. The question is whether the United States in its sovereign capacity has consented to be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this Commonwealth upon the facts here disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In each case, after special appearance, objection that the action was not rightly brought was seasonably made by plea in abatement and motion to dismiss. <em>Paige </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>237 Mass. 482. One ground alleged was that, since the cause of action grew out of the operation of the railroad transportation system under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Director General of Railroads by virtue of acts of the Congress of the United States and the Proclamations of the President pursuant thereto, the plaintiff could not resort to the courts of this Commonwealth for redress of the wrongs alleged for the reason that venue of action therefor was exclusively in courts within the State of Connecticut by virtue of General Order No. 18-A of the Director General of Railroads, dated April 18, 1918, that \u201call suits against carriers while under Federal control must be brought in the county or district where the plaintiff resided at the time of the accrual of the cause of action or in the county or district where the cause of action arose.\u201d The question here presented is not covered by our own decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\">It has been expressly determined by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Alabama &amp; Vicksburg Railway </em>v. <em>Journey, </em>257 U. S. 111, that the General Order No. 18-A was valid and within the power conferred by \u00a7 10 of the Federal Control Act of March 21, 1918, c. 25; 40 U. S. Sts. at Large, 456. That decision was held to follow clearly from <em>Missouri Pacific Railroad </em>v. <em>Ault, </em>256 U. S. 554. The circumstance that in the Journey case the cause of action arose before federal control does not affect the force of the words of that decision as to the scope and authority of General Order No. 18-A concerning venue of actions, because it was said in the opinion that the only question presented and decided was whether the State court erred in holding that General \u201cOrder No. 18 [as amended by General Order No. 18-A] exceeded the powers conferred by Congress on the President and by him on the Director General,\u201d 257 U. S. 113. The decision to the effect that the State court erred in so holding settles the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">That decision is conclusive of the cases at bar. It relates to a matter as to which all other courts of this country are bound to be guided by the highest court of the nation. It is unnecessary to refer to the numerous decisions of State courts where a different conclusion had been reached before this authoritative declaration of the law had been made. It follows that, against the objection of the representative of the United States, none of these actions can be brought in the courts of this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">It becomes unnecessary Jo consider the other questions argued. Let the entry in each case be</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\n<em>Action dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
