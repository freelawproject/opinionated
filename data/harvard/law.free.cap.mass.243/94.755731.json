L. c. 229, \u00a7 7, to recover damages for the death of the husband of the plaintiff, who after conscious suffering died on August 18,1920, from injuries received on that day while working as motorman for the defendant. The defendant was insured under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, now embodied in G. L. c. 152, by policy dated and issued on August 16, 1920, and had given the notice thereof to its employees as required by the act. The deceased had been in the employ of the defendant for about twenty-two years and had not given the defendant notice that he should claim his rights at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The remedies provided by the workmen\u2019s compensation act are exclusive of all other relief in cases within its provisions. <em>White </em>v. <em>E. T. Slattery Co. </em>236 Mass. 28. <em>Zygmuntowicz </em>v. <em>American Steel &amp; Wire Co. of New Jersey, </em>240 Mass. 421. The purpose of the act is to substitute for common law and other statutory remedies previously existing a kind of accident insurance in all instances to which it is applicable. The act provides in \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 22 for notice to be given by the \u00e9mployer to his employee under all the circumstances likely to arise, but by the latter section, \u201cIn case of the renewal of the policy no notice shall be required.\u201d The record does not show whether the policy here in force was renewal insurance, but it is assumed in favor of the plaintiff that it was an original insurance. By \u00a7 24 of the act an employee of an insured employer shall be held to have waived his common law rights unless a notice claiming such rights shall be given at the time of employment or within thirty days after notice of insurance by his employer. That section, however, has no relation to the present action, which is not at common law but is created exclusively by statute. It is only rights at common law which can be retained by the employee by giving notice to that end, and not rights established under the employers\u2019 liability act or other modifications of the common law. There is no right at common law to recover damages for the death of a human being. Such actions are exclusively the creature of statute. <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Bay State Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 370, and cases collected at page 376. <em>Sherlag </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>200 Mass. 232, and decisions cited at page 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\">The employer who is insured under the workmen\u2019s compensation act is relieved of all statutory liability, including that for death of an employee under the employers\u2019 liability act. G. L. c. 153. The provisions as to notice by the employee in G. L. c. 152, \u25a0\u00a7 24, are wholly irrelevant in this connection. It is provided by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 68, being a re-enactment of the substance of the original act, St. 1911, c. 751, Part I, \u00a7 4, that \u201c Chapter one hundred and fifty-three and sections four and seven to ten, inclusive, of chapter two hundred and twenty-nine shall not apply to employees of an insured person.\u201d The word \u201cperson\u201d in this section includes a corporation such as the defendant. G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, cl. 23. The plaintiff\u2019s action avowedly is founded on G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 7. It follows that by the express terms of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the section upon which the plaintiff grounds her action does not apply to the defendant because it was insured under the workmen\u2019s compensation act.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The case of <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid, </em>219 Mass. 420, has no pertinency to the facts here disclosed. See, in this connection, <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Wire Goods Co. </em>233 Mass. 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">While the terms of our statute are not precisely those of other States, the conclusion here reached is in harmony with other well considered decisions. <em>Gregutis </em>v. <em>Waclark Wire Works, </em>86 N. J. L. 610. <em>Shanahan </em>v. <em>Monarch Engineering Co. </em>219 N. Y. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">This result was expressly designed by the framers of the act and was adopted by the General Court in enacting it as drafted.
