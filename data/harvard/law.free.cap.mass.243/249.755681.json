The plaintiff testified that on that afternoon in his office he talked over the telephone with a person whom he recognized from the voice as being the defendant, although this was the second conversation he had had with him, and that the defendant then said to him that he accepted the offer of $3,000 and that he \u201cwanted plaintiff to take a deposit of $50 immediately from Mooradian and to get $450 more from Mooradian before' noon of the next day and then bring the $500\u201d to him before that time. The defendant does not now press his objection to this evidence and concedes that it was admissible. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Peach, </em>186 Mass. 67. The plaintiff further testified that Mooradian was in his office at the time and that he communicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>to him what he had heard over the telephone and immediately received a deposit of $50; that on the following day at about ten o\u2019clock in the forenoon, he, with Mooradian and the latter\u2019s brother, went to the defendant\u2019s store, Mooradian being ready to make a deposit of $500; and that upon their arrival the defendant refused to sell for $3,000 \"because some one had offered him $500 more, and that his wife would not let him sell.\u201d No objection was made to the admission of any part of this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Mooradian testified that he was ready, able, and willing to pay the purchase price; that while he was waiting in the plaintiff\u2019s office he heard him talk with some one over the telephone and was told by him that the person with whom he was talking was the defendant. He was then asked, subject to the objection of the defendant, whether the plaintiff communicated to him the conversation he had had over the telephone and answered that he did. He further testified without objection that as a result of what the plaintiff so told him, he immediately made a deposit of $50 and on the next morning at the time stated in the testimony of the plaintiff went to the defendant\u2019s store prepared to pay over the balance of the deposit and that the defendant refused to sell the property for $3,000. The defendant, while admitting the employment, denied the existence of any conversation over the telephone and said that he had rejected the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The defendant contends that the evidence does not warrant a finding for the plaintiff because the broker did not comply with the terms of his employment in that he failed to procure a further deposit of $450 before noon of the day following the conversation over the telephone; but the defendant\u2019s refusal before that hour to sell the store to Mooradian for $3,000 was not based on this objection, and the plaintiff for that reason was not required to procure the balance of the deposit in order to justify recovery. <em>Witherell </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>147 Mass. 417. <em>Brilliant </em>v. <em>Samelas, </em>221 Mass. 302. <em>Whitkin </em>v. <em>Markarian, </em>238 Mass. 334. In any event the evidence justified a finding that Mooradian went with the plaintiff, within the limited time, prepared to pay the balance of the deposit directly to the defendant, whose rights were not affected because the customer was prepared to pay it to the defendant rather than to his agent, the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The only other question argued relates to the admission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>testimony by Mooradian as to what the plaintiff told him that the defendant over the telephone had said to him. While the answer was \u201cYes,\u201d the witness was not asked to repeat the conversation. No objection was made to evidence offered by the same witness of what he did as a result of what he had been told. See <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Lamson, </em>242 Mass. 129. The admission of the question was right. The plaintiff acting as the agent of the defendant, in order to complete the negotiations, was authorized to tell the customer that the defendant had accepted his offer and the terms of its acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
