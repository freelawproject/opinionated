A decree was entered in the Superior Court directing payments to the daughter on the basis of partial dependency. She has appealed therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The right to recover compensation is the creature of the workmen\u2019s compensation act. <em>Moran\u2019s Case, </em>234 Mass. 152. Since St. 1919, c. 204 (see now G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 32, cl. d), children under the age of sixteen years are conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent upon a \"parent who was at the time of his death legally bound to support\u201d them, although they were living apart from him. The statute does not declare that all children under the age of sixteen living apart from a parent shall be considered as wholly dependent, but only those for whose support there is a legal obligation. It requires the establishment of the existence of the duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The material facts are: In 1913, the employee\u2019s wife deserted him and took their daughter to Canada. The child was then about five years old and ever since has lived with her mother. On the ground of desertion, the father obtained a decree for divorce which became absolute on August 21, 1917, and which made no provision as to the minor. The father was willing and desirous of providing her with a home and of caring for her, but did nothing to procure her return. He contributed $130 to her support during the year prior to his death. She has been with her mother since the desertion; and there is nothing to show that she has not been adequately maintained. These facts did not entitle the daughter to a finding that her father was legally bound for her support. <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>19 Pick. 429. <em>Brow </em>v. <em>Brightman, </em>136 Mass. 187. <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>138 Mass. 449. <em>Foss </em>v. <em>Hartwell, </em>168 Mass. 66, 67. Nor did they indicate that he, being of sufficient ability, unreasonably neglected to support her. See G. L. c. 273, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 8; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acker, </em>197 Mass. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\n<em>Becree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
