No written notice of the injury, as required by \u00a7 15, Part II, of the workmen\u2019s compensation act (now G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 41), was given by the widow. After the case had been recommitted for further hearing on the question of notice or knowledge of the injury, the board found that the date of the injury was June 9,1920; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the employers had knowledge of the injury, through their recognized agent, on June 10, 1920. The main question now argued by the insurer is whether this finding as to the date of the injury was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Section 18 of the act provided: \"Want of notice shall not be a bar to proceedings under this act, if it be shown that the association, subscriber, or agent had knowledge of the injury.\u201d See now G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 44. <em>Barry\u2019s Case, </em>240 Mass. 409. The employee worked as a painter for the Hurley estate for approximately eight years. He handled and used lead in mixing the paints. There was evidence that when he consulted his family physician in November, 1919, complaining of his throat, the doctor noticed the \u201clead line\u201d on Bergeron\u2019s gums, gave him iodide of potassium treatment for lead poisoning, and told him he should be careful. There was further evidence from the dentist and the widow that Bergeron showed some symptoms of lead poisoning two years or more before he died. According to the testimony of the experts \u201cthe assimilation of lead into the system is usually a very slow thing;\u201d and \u201cIt is a slow, cumulative process and ultimately a sufficient amount is in the body to produce definite effects.\u201d The employee worked steadily until he went on a vacation with his family in July, 1919; and after his return worked daily until June 9, 1920. The finding of the board was that \u201cthe date of injury in the Bergeron case, was not the time in November, 1919, when he was first treated for lead poisoning, but was the time when the accumulated effects of the lead poisoning, due to his employment by the subscribers, first incapacitated him for work on June 9, 1920.\u201d There was evidence to warrant the board in so finding. It appears that the employee was able to perform and did perform his regular work daily until and including June 9. Then the disease had progressed to such a serious stage that his physician told him his illness was brought about by lead poisoning and he could not paint any more. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 388. <em>O\u2019Donnell\u2019s Case, </em>237 Mass. 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">On June 10, knowledge of the injury came to Dempsey, who was the general agent and superintendent of the Hurley estate, and who employed and directed the work of Bergeron. When the employee failed to report for work on that morning, Dempsey went to Bergeron\u2019s house; and was told by him what the doctor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>had said, namely, that his illness \u201cwas brought about by lead poisoning and he would have to discontinue painting and take up some other line of business and rest for three months.\u201d Plainly it could be found that the subscribers had knowledge of the injury \u201cas soon as practicable after the happening thereof.\u201d St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 15. <em>Bloom\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 434. <em>Brown\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 31. <em>Walkden\u2019s Case, </em>237 Mass. 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The question whether the insurer was prejudiced by want of notice, does not arise under the second finding of the board member, which was affirmed by the Industrial Accident Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
