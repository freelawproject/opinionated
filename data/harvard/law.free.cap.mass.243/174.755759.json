G. L. c. 107, \u00a7\u00a7 31, 54. <em>Way </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>3 Gray, 412. <em>Jump </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>192 Mass. 511. <em>Massachusetts National Bank </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>187 Mass. 159, 162. <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Wintman, </em>234 Mass. 248. <em>Bovarnick </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>235 Mass. 195. But the record states that the payee transferred the note \u201cfor value ... to a bank in Illinois,\u201d and the immediate indorsement on the back of the note is, \u201cPay the Corn Exchange Natl Bank Chicago, 111. or order First National Bank 70-768 Milford, 111. 70-768 G. F. Patterson, Cashier.\u201d The indorsement directly following, \u201cPay to the order of any bank or banker all prior indorsements guaranteed, The Corn Exchange National Bank 2-5 of Chicago, 111.,\u201d and signed by its cashier, is stamped \u201ccancelled,\u201d across the stamp. It did not appear in what manner the plaintiff became the holder, even if the payee deposed \u201cthat the plaintiff was the legal holder of the note at the time suit was brought,\u201d and on the face of the note and the indorsements title apparently remained in the Corn Exchange National Bank. G. L. c. 107, \u00a7\u00a7 53, 54. <em>Folger </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>18 Pick. 63, 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">\u201cThe court found for the plaintiff on the declaration,\u201d which alleges the making and tenor of the note, and that the payee \u201cindorsed the said note in blank,\u201d and \u201c.the plaintiff is the holder thereof.\u201d By R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 65 (see now G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 71), \u201cThe holder may strike out any indorsement which is not necessary to his title. The indorser whose indorsement is struck out and all indorsers subsequent to him are thereby relieved from liability on the instrument.\u201d The right of the plaintiff to omit tracing his title in the declaration through all subsequent indorsers, and to allege that he is the holder under the previous blank indorsement is conferred by the statute. <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Wintman, </em>234 Mass. 248, 250. <em>Jerman </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>29 App. Cas. (D. C.) 535. The note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>therefore would be transferable by delivery and in effect a note payable to bearer. The presumption of title as well as the presumption of value not having been rebutted were sufficient to enable him to maintain the action. <em>Pettee </em>v. <em>Prout, </em>3 Gray, 502. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>11 Allen, 349, 350. <em>Massachusetts National Bank </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>187 Mass. 159, 162, 163. <em>Merchants National Bank </em>v. <em>Marden, Orth &amp; Hastings Co. </em>234 Mass. 161, 168. G. L. c. 107, \u00a7\u00a7 31, cl. 5, 71, 82. The plaintiff\u2019s fourth request, that the bearer of a note indorsed in blank is presumed to be a holder in due course, was properly given. And the question of consideration as between the defendant and the payee being of no consequence the plaintiff\u2019s first and second requests accurately stated the law. <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Ph\u0153nix Rattan Co. </em>168 Mass. 570. <em>National Bank of Newbury </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>218 Mass. 30. <em>Goodfellow </em>v. Farnham, 236 Mass. 453, 454. <em>Bovarnick </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>235 Mass. 195, 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The defendant\u2019s requests were rightly denied for reasons sufficiently stated, and the giving of the plaintiff\u2019s third request that the \"payee of the note ... is legally entitled to remuneration for services as attorney, if such services are performed, notwithstanding the fact that he is not a member of the bar of Massachusetts, if he is a member of the bar of another State,\u201d although inapplicable, was harmless error. See <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>American Association of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots, </em>233 Mass. 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The order of the Appellate Division dismissing the report is</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
