On February 15, 1921, while he was walking toward the elevator in the course of his employment, he struck his right groin against the corner of a desk, causing a hernia. That same day he told the factory superintendent about the accident; and two days later he informed the doctor at the subscriber\u2019s plant, whose whole duty it was to treat injuries there. Upon the advice of the doctor he went to the Massachusetts General Hospital, was there informed that he had a hernia; and, upon his refusal to undergo an operation because of his age (sixty-nine years), was advised to wear a truss, and subsequently did so. Donnelly continued at his light work until August 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>1921, when he was laid off because the subscriber had moved its plant and abolished the position of doorkeeper. The claim of the employee was filed on August 19, four days after the expiration of the six months period. The Industrial Accident Board found that the hernia arose out of and in the course of Donnelly\u2019s employment; that the insurer was not prejudiced by the failure of the employee to give the statutory written notice of his injury; that the employee had reasonable cause for his failure to file a claim for compensation before the expiration of the six months period; and that the insurer was not prejudiced by said delay of four days.

L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 44, 49. <em>Bergeron\u2019s Case, ante, </em>366. <em>Barry\u2019s Case, </em>240 Mass. 409. <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>241 Mass. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The insurer does not now contend that the above mentioned findings were unwarranted. The only question argued on its appeal is \"whether or not a finding is justified that there was an incapacity resulting from the injury for which . . . [\u00a1the employee] should receive compensation.\u201d The injury occurred on February 15, 1921, and Donnelly continued at his work without loss of wages until August 12, 1921. Thereafter he worked about a day and a half a week, until February 10, 1922; when he resumed work at his former wage of $25 a week. While he was laid off he sought employment with at least four other concerns, but without success. In the opinion of the impartial physician who examined the employee on February 10, 1922, for the Industrial Accident Board, Donnelly, on account of the hernia, the irritation of the truss, and his age, \u201cis incapacitated from doing any other type of work than that in which he was engaged at the time of his injury; i.e., work of the very lightest type.\u201d The board member, after the hearing of October 10,1921, made a finding that \"as a result of the hernia, caused by this injury, although wearing a truss, the employee\u2019s earning capacity has been reduced for doing work which he otherwise would be able to do in general employment, and that the injury will interfere with his obtaining employment so that his average earning capacity, as reduced by the injury, has been and still continues since August 12, 1921, to be $12 per week.\u201d After the hearing on a recommittal of the case in March, 1922, the member found that \u201cthe employee is entitled to partial incapacity compensation at $8.67 a week (being two thirds the difference between $12 and $25) from August 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>1921, to February 10, 1922, when he obtained employment with the subscriber at $25 a week, viz. 26 weeks amounting to $225.42.\u201d The findings were affirmed and adopted by the Industrial Accident Board on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Under the established rule, these findings of fact as to the-employee\u2019s impaired capacity to perform any work but that of the very lightest kind, must stand, as there was some.evidence to-support them. <em>Diaz\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 36. <em>Pass\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 515. The mere fact, that after the injury he was able to continue-the light work assigned him by his old employer, is not of itself conclusive on the issue whether \"his earning power and labor efficiency were lessened within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Capone\u2019s Case, </em>239 Mass. 331, 333.
