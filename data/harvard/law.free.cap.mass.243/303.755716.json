No other counts are directly involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">During the World War the defendant was a manufacturer of munitions and the plaintiff was in the business of obtaining and subletting contracts for war material. The defendant, having had previous dealings with the plaintiff relating to munition contracts, on October 5, 1916, addressed to him a letter in which, for the stated \u201cconsideration of services rendered and to be rendered in securing contracts\u201d from the Poole Company, it agreed to pay him $8,000 because of a contract then existing with that company after payments thereunder were received, and a commission of eight mills for each shell manufactured on \u201c any further contracts for machining shells.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">The plaintiff accepted this proposal and on the evidence a finding would have been justified if not required that for some time thereafter both the plaintiff and the defendant acted under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>its terms in all matters relating to the business of the defendant with the Poole Company. No question arises except as to services rendered after the letter was written.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The defendant contended that the evidence did not warrant a finding for the plaintiff upon the first count and excepted to its submission to the jury. The following facts either were not in dispute or warrantably could have been found: The plaintiff had, prior to October 5, 1916, acted in the defendant\u2019s behalf in relation to a contract with the Poole Company and had received a commission for so doing. While engaged in the defendant\u2019s behalf, he ascertained that the Poole Company, of which he had previously known, had a contract for shells with Russia; he communicated that fact to William T. Marsh, the defendant\u2019s president, who agreed to go to New York or Baltimore when notified by him. After meeting the plaintiff in New York, Marsh went to Baltimore and closed the first contract of the defendant with the Poole Company. After the letter to the defendant dated October 5, 1916, the plaintiff kept \u201cin touch\u201d with the defendant by letter, telegrams, and telephone, and from time to time advised Marsh, who acted in its behalf. He also on different occasions saw the manager, superintendent, and some other officers of the Poole Company about further contracts and interviewed the defendant\u2019s vice-president at his office for the purpose of discussing the possibility of such contracts and before the negotiations between the defendant and the Poole Company relating thereto had been concluded reported these interviews to Marsh. In so doing he acted with the knowledge and authority of the. defendant. The defendant in May and August, 1917, entered into contracts with the Poole Company for machining shells. On cross-examination, the plaintiff testified that he knew that the Poole Company contemplated giving the defendant additional contracts and \u201cassisted\u201d in securing them; \u201cbut he alone did not secure them; he was one of the causes, but not the cause, of the defendant\u2019s obtaining them.\u201d At the request of the defendant the plaintiff also performed services relative to contracts other than those with the Poole Company. Although he was in San Francisco for about three months from July to September, 1917, this did not necessitate a finding that he had abandoned the contract or that his services were then required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>or necessary. One of the \"further contracts\u201d was made before he went away. The letter of February 8, 1917, written to the plaintiff in behalf of the defendant, in which the plaintiff was directed to \u201cdiscontinue any and all activities in reference to securing work for me ^meaning Marsh, acting in behalf of the defendant],\u201d did not cancel or attempt to cancel the agreement relating to the contract for compensation concerning the Poole contracts, nor release the defendant from liability thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The judge construed the letter of October 5, 1916, as providing that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover unless his services were the \u201cefficient cause\u201d of the procurement of the contracts, and defined the meaning of this term. This was sufficiently favorable to the defendant. So far as the record shows the plaintiff did not except to the construction adopted, and the jury found in his favor on the count based on the Poole contracts. The case is considered on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Under the instructions the jury, in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, could find that the plaintiff was the efficient cause of the procurement of the future contracts even though his connection therewith was limited to services relating to the first contract. The judge said that if the plaintiff was the efficient cause in bringing the Poole Company and the defendant together so that the result of their negotiations was the second and third contracts, this was sufficient to justify a verdict for him. The language used considered in connection with the further instruction, that he did not have to show that he had any part in arranging the details of the contract or that he took part in any of the negotiations between the defendant and the Poole Company, is consistent only with this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">While the case is close, we are of opinion that the instruction was sufficiently favorable to the defendant and that on the facts disclosed, notwithstanding the quoted testimony of the plaintiff, it was a question for the jury whether the original bringing together of the parties as herein described was an efficient cause of the future contracts. This result is supported by the letter of the defendant dated October 5, 1916, hereinbefore considered. The letter refers to the plaintiff\u2019s services as \u201crendered and to be rendered\u201d in securing contracts as a consideration for the payments provided for in future as well as then existing con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>tracts. See <em>Tribe </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>L. R. 1 C. P. 505. The illustration used was not harmful error in view of the conclusion here reached. The instruction that the letter of February 8, 1917, did not deprive the plaintiff of any rights he had acquired by reason of anything that he had done prior to its receipt, was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The exceptions to the instructions to the jury relating to the first count are overruled; those which are to the refusal of the defendant\u2019s fourth and fifth requests for rulings are embraced in those already considered and are disposed of by what has been said.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The substantial parts of the agreement, relating to contracts with the United States, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">\u201cNov. 15, 1917.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Mr. James H. Brand,</p>\n<p id=\"AL9A\">12 West 44th Street,</p>\n<p id=\"Adm\">New York City.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Dear Sir:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">It is hereby agreed between W. T. Marsh, representing the Sterling Motor Car Co. of Brockton, Mass, and yourself that in consideration of and for services rendered and to be rendered in the assisting of- securing a contract from the United States Government for One Pound Shells complete . . . also for the assisting in the financing of the order, that the following commission is <em>to </em>be paid to you by the Sterling Motor Car Company, based on the size of the order as per: . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">\u201cIt is further agreed that you are to raise cash or establish a credit based on the size of the order, as follows: . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">\u201cIt is further agreed that the above commission is to be paid by the Sterling Motor Car Company to James H. Brand as and when the contract is signed and the cash delivered or credit established. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">\u201cIt is understood that the credit to be raised by you is the chief object of this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">[Signed] Sterling Motor Car Co.,</p>\n<p id=\"Ad-\">W. R. Marsh, Prest.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-16\">Accepted:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b342-17\">James H. Brand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-18\">A contract with the United States was secured for the manufacture of two million shells which necessitated the establishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>of a credit of $200,000. To accomplish this the plaintiff saw Marsh in Brockton, the defendant\u2019s place of business, and \u201cwent to several Brockton banks. The plaintiff suggested that it would be much easier and better to take the matter up with New York banks where he knew the people\u201d than in Boston, and the matter being left in his hands he saw Mr. Rorick of Spitzer, Rorick and Company, bankers, who had offices in New York and other large cities, Mr. Rorick being his personal friend. In January Marsh came to New York and in company with the plaintiff met this banker who asked for an audited statement of the defendant\u2019s condition, but Marsh did not promise to furnish it. In February he again came to New York and saw the plaintiff. The defendant did not furnish the requested statement and the plaintiff never established any credit with any bank or banker. Later the plaintiff advised Marsh that the best way to obtain credit was to take the matter up with the War Credits Board, of the War Department. See U. S. St. 1917, c. 79, \u00a7 5; 40 U. S. Sts. at Large, 383; Willoughby, Government Organization in War Time and After, 65. After a visit to Washington where he had made an investigation, the plaintiff wrote the defendant that the money could be arranged through that board. The defendant finally obtained advances on its contracts from that source.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">It is not necessary to consider whether the evidence justified a finding that through the plaintiff\u2019s services the War Credits Board advanced the plaintiff on account of its contracts an amount equal at least to that required by the agreement of the plaintiff with the defendant to establish credit. That question is not raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">As to these services the judge instructed the jury, without exception on the part of the plaintiff so far as the record shows, that the plaintiff could not recover for bringing about the loan or advance from the government even if he was the efficient cause of the procurement. That question is not considered. See <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Mead-Morrison Manuf. Co. </em>237 Mass. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">However, the fifth count was submitted to the jury with the instruction that the plaintiff had to prove that he had raised cash or established a credit based on the size of the order; that if the defendant prevented him from carrying out the agreement with Spitzer, Rorick and Company by refusing to procure an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>audited statement, and that if he did everything that was reasonably necessary to carry out his part of the contract, he could recover. In the course of the charge, he said: \u201cIf the plaintiff Brand did all that he reasonably could be expected to do to bring about the financing with Spitzer, Rorick and Company and obtaining the sum of $200,000, either by way of cash or credit and he was prevented from doing that by the omission on the part of the defendant and the' refusal of the defendant to do something that was reasonably necessary to carry out that trade and their refusal and neglect was unreasonable^ under the circumstances, then he has done all he could and the law does not hold him to do impossibilities and he is entitled to recover for the result of the breach of the contract on the part of the defendant in not enabling him to carry out what he said he was going to carry out if they blocked by their unreasonable actions his carrying out a reasonable scheme with a party who was ready, able and willing to advance the money or to extend and establish the credit for the defendant, then he is entitled to his pay for his commissions because he is excused by their failure to do what reasonably must be expected of them in order to make it possible for him to carry out his part of this contract. Before you find in his favor on the whole matter you must find he also assisted in procuring the government order for two million shells.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\">The only exceptions relating to this which are now argued are to the failure to direct a verdict on this count for the defendant and to the \u201cjury\u2019s being permitted to find that the plaintiff was entitled to a commission under the fifth count by reason of his dealings with Spitzer, Rorick and Co.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">These exceptions must be sustained. The contract, although it recited that it was in part in consideration of assistance in financing the contract with the government, expressly provided that the plaintiff was to \u201craise cash or establish a credit\u201d and that this was \u201cthe chief object of this agreement.\u201d It did not contain any provision requiring the defendant to assist in so doing by furnishing a statement of its business or financial condition. There was no evidence of any wrongful act or misrepresentation on the defendant\u2019s part, but simply the omission to supply an audited statement of condition. The jury were allowed to find for the plaintiff, if he did \"all that he reasonably could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>expected to do to bring about the financing with Spitzer, Rorick and Company,\u201d and was prevented from so doing by the failure of the defendant to furnish the statement, which failure under the instructions to the jury could have been found to be unreasonable. The defendant did not agree expressly or by implication that it could or would furnish such a statement, and inasmuch as the willingness of the proposed lender was based on something which he had no right to require and the defendant was not bound to furnish, the plaintiff neither raised the cash nor established a credit, nor was prevented from so doing by the defendant. The instructions given were incorrect as the evidence did not justify the submission of this count to the jury on the ground of liability adopted by the judge. See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Van Auken, </em>190 Mass. 161; <em>Caston </em>v. <em>Quimby, </em>178 Mass. 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><em>Exceptions relating to count </em>1 <em>overruled.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><em>Exceptions relating to count </em>5 <em>sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
