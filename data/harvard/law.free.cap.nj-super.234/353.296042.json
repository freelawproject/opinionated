After trial the jury, in response to special interrogatories, concluded that defendant had not designed the snowblower defectively nor failed to give adequate warnings of its danger. We find no basis for disturbing the verdicts or the denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motions for judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>or new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The snowblower was manufactured by defendant in 1965, and plaintiff, a carpenter, bought it from one of his customers in January 1985. At the time of sale, the seller no longer had the owner\u2019s manual for the snowblower in her possession. Plaintiff therefore never reviewed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Plaintiff first used the snowblower on February 6, 1985. He had never used any type of snowblower before. During the first five minutes of use the chute through which the snow was expelled became \u201cclogged,\u201d and plaintiff twice \u201cvibrated\u201d and \u201cbounced\u201d the machine in an attempt to \u201cjar loose\u201d the snow, and \u201cwiped it with my hand.\u201d However, the third time the chute became clogged, this remedy did not work. Therefore, plaintiff put the machine in \u201cneutral and park,\u201d thereby causing its wheels to stop rolling. However, he did not turn the motor off, and the engine continued to run.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence, the blades inside the chute continued to spin at 1,100 revolutions per minute. Plaintiff then reached his ungloved left hand into the chute to clean out the clogged snow. After removing some of the snow, plaintiff\u2019s fingers were \u201cgrabbed\u201d by the spinning blades causing severe injuries. Ultimately parts of three fingers were amputated.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">It was undisputed that there was no guard over the chute opening. There was, however, a decal on the chute which read: \u201cCaution, stop engine before removing obstructions from blower or rake.\u201d Though plaintiff saw the decal, he testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>understood the word \u201cobstruction\u201d to refer to \u201cwhen you ran over something, a piece of branch or whatever.\u201d He testified that he did not consider snow to be an \u201cobstruction\u201d, and that he did not understand that he was risking injury by putting his hand into the chute. Rather, plaintiff assumed that, by putting the traction in park and the shift lever in neutral, the blades in the chute \u201cwould stop\u201d too. During his initial attempt to clear the clog he did not see that the blades were still spinning in the chute. Nonetheless, he admitted that after he stopped the blower and placed it in park he could \u201chear the thing turning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">According to plaintiff's expert, Richard Schwarz, a mechanical engineer, the industry standard in 1965 was to guard the chute opening with an M-shaped wire, which would fit into the opening of the chute, thereby blocking a hand from coming in contact with the impelling blades. Schwarz testified that had the blower been equipped with an \u201cM guard,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s \u201chand could not have gone in deep enough to have been hit by the rotating blades.\u201d Schwarz also testified that defendant failed to include \u201ca deadman\u2019s clutch,\u201d another available safety device by which the engine and impelling blades \u201cwould be cut off\u201d whenever the operator took his hands off the handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">According to Schwarz, plaintiff had three means of stopping the blades without turning off the engine on his machine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">One was the clutch, which would disengage the blades. Two, the clutch which would disengage the traction and therefore cut power to the blades. The third would be the throttle which would be put in the stopped position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">In Schwarz\u2019s opinion, none of those three methods served as a reasonable substitute for an M guard or deadman\u2019s clutch because each required the operator to \u201cleave its position\u201d or disengage the blades by some affirmative act. Schwarz did testify, however, that the accident would not have occurred if plaintiff had chosen any of the three available options. Schwarz further testified that while defendant had incorporated a deadman\u2019s clutch in some models built before 1965, it did not become required by industry standards until 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Warnings were, however, required as an industry standard by 1965. According to Schwarz, the cautionary decal on plaintiff\u2019s machine was not adequate because it failed to inform users that their fingers could be cut if they inserted their hands in the chute. He stated that \u201c[stronger wording including a pictorial view of rotating blades and fingers being chopped off\u201d was necessary to be adequate. Schwarz further concluded that defendant had a duty, after the guard standards were formally adopted in 1975, to make \u201cpost-sale warnings\u201d to the public through the media, designed to warn prior purchasers of the dangers similar to those encountered by plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The failure to give such a warning, Schwarz testified, constituted a deviation from standard engineering practice. However, he was not aware of any manufacturers who provided this type of retroactive warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Defendant\u2019s Vice President of Engineering during the pertinent time, Willard Tschantz, testified for defendant. Tschantz, a mechanical engineer who supervised the design of defendant\u2019s 1960 and 1965 snowblower models, stated that there were no industry standards relating to the design or manufacture of snowblowers in 1960 or 1965. Nevertheless, defendant\u2019s 1960 model included a deadman\u2019s clutch \u201cwith a lockout which really could defeat the purpose of a dead man clutch.\u201d However, customers did not like this feature because there was no way to stop the forward motion without stopping the blower, thus preventing self-cleaning. Accordingly, the machine was redesigned by 1965 without a deadman\u2019s clutch.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">According to Tschantz, the first industry standards were formally adopted in 1975 by the subcommittee of the American National Standards Institute (\u201cANSI\u201d) of which he was chairman. Tschantz testified that both the deadman\u2019s clutch and the M guard had been known since the 1800\u2019s, and that both could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>have been employed on the 1965 unit. However, Tschantz felt that the warnings in the owner\u2019s manuals and on the decals on the chutes were adequate. He also felt that snow clearly qualified as an \u201cobstruction\u201d within the meaning of the decal.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Defendant\u2019s expert witness, Gilbert Buske, also a mechanical engineer, concluded that defendant\u2019s decision to remove the deadman\u2019s clutch after the 1960 design was \u201cvery reasonable\u201d because it \u201cdidn\u2019t work very well on the snow throwers.\u201d He confirmed that there were no industry standards for snowblowers until the ANSI standards were adopted in 1975, and that M guards were not used on snowblowers until 1967. Buske opined that, \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of scientific probability,\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 snowblower was properly designed. He based that opinion on his knowledge of snowblowers and of the snowblower industry, and his own experience with the 1965 model, which he owned for his personal use. Buske also concluded that defendant\u2019s decal was adequate in warning of danger. According to Buske, had plaintiff followed the caution on the decal, he would not have been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Plaintiffs complain that the trial court committed plain error in failing to instruct the jury, during its charge, that the issue of comparative fault had been removed from the case. Plaintiffs also argue that the omission was prejudicial because the jury was directed to make a finding on \u201c[f]actor[ ] ... 5\u201d of the \u201crisk-utility analysis\u201d relating to the user\u2019s ability to avoid injury by using due care, an issue plaintiffs believe the jury perceived to be akin to comparative fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">At the close of all testimony plaintiffs successfully moved to strike the defense of comparative negligence in the absence of adequate proof that plaintiff had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of danger with respect to the snowblower, and \u201cvoluntarily encountered that risk.\u201d As a consequence, before summations the judge instructed the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>I want to advise you that you have heard some statements here with regard to Mr. Bottignoli\u2019s comparative fault. I want you to know that his comparative fault has been removed from your consideration and for that reason you are not to consider it at all. <em>You\u2019ll see that later on when I charge you, </em>but you should know that in advance, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">However, in his final charge to the jury the judge did not specifically mention comparative negligence or repeat this instruction. He did say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">During the course of this trial the Court has ruled on certain objections of Counsel. It is not only their right, but a sworn duty on the part of Counsel to make such objections. The rulings of the Court on these objections are not to be taken as prejudicing either party. They are based solely on matters of law addressed to the Court and should not enter your consideration of this case. <em>You must exclude from your deliberations any manner\u2014any matter, rather, or testimony which I have excluded, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The judge then charged that in deciding whether the snowblower was defectively designed, the jury had to apply the \u201crisk-utility analysis,\u201d the elements of which he explained in detail. One such element, referred to by plaintiffs as \u201cfactor\u201d five, was \u201cthe ability of foreseeable users to avoid danger by the exercise of care in the use of the snow blower.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Cepeda v. Cumberland Engineering Co., </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>152, 174 (1978). <em>See also O\u2019Brien v. Muskin Corp., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>169, 184-188 (1983); <em>Suter v. San Angelo Foundry &amp; Machine Co., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>150, 171-177 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Plaintiffs objected to the charge, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">Judge, I have one concern, that is that the latter part of your charge when you were telling them one and one is two and that you\u2019re not limited to the proofs and you can draw inferences and then you said something almost identical to that just now in concluding, that they are going to override the admonition you gave them earlier that you had ruled out comparative fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">And I think you ought to go back to that because I think that they\u2019re going to think that it\u2019s okay to go into it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">Thereafter the judge proposed to \u201crepeat for the jury that they are not to consider anything that I have instructed them to exclude from their consideration,\u201d to which plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201c[o]kay. That\u2019s fair.\u201d Accordingly, the judge gave the following curative charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, let me stress something that I\u2019ve told you before, just to highlight it, and that is that you, the members of the jury, are not to consider anything that I have excluded from your consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In his post-verdict motion for judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>or for a new trial, counsel for plaintiffs argued, among other things, that the judge\u2019s charging of factor five was inconsistent with his barring of the comparative-fault defense, in that it effectively invited the jury to consider the excluded defense. Counsel conceded that he had \u201cmissed the boat\u201d by not objecting to the charge or to the judge\u2019s failure to give his promised explanation of the comparative-fault ruling. The trial judge denied the motion, stating that while he \u201cmost likely\u201d would have concluded otherwise as fact finder, he had no authority to second-guess the verdict. With respect to the comparative-negligence issue, the judge further noted both plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s failure to object and that the judge\u2019s own curative charge made with the consent of counsel. He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">This Court is at a loss to comprehend how the jury was confused or misled as to the issue of comparative negligence. Certainly, it was proper to charge the jury as to the risk-utility factor going to Plaintiff\u2019s conduct. Certainly, the jury could have, and apparently did, give substantial weight to this factor in its risk-utility determination that the snowblower in question was not defectively designed. While Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel\u2019s dissatisfaction with this outcome is quite understandable, the jury charge did not mislead the jury and in no way resulted clearly and convincingly in a manifest denial of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">We agree with the conclusions of the trial judge in denying the post judgment motions. Neither the trial judge nor this court has authority to \u201csecond guess\u201d the jury\u2019s determination, expressed in answers to special interrogatories, that the snow-blower was not \u201cdefectively designed\u201d and that defendant\u2019s warning to consumers in 1965 was \u201cadequate and effective.\u201d Further, while defendant does not expressly contend that the trial judge erred in concluding that comparative negligence or fault was not an issue in the case, and while we do not address the issue on the merits in any way, <em>cf. Rivera v. Westinghouse Elevator Co., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>256, 260-261 (1987); <em>see also Cartel Capital Corp. v. Fireco of New Jersey, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>548, 562-64 (1980); <em>M and Wife v. Schmid Laboratories, Inc., </em>178 <em>N.J.Su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>per. </em>122, 126 (App.Div.1981),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we note that any error in the judge\u2019s ruling was harmless to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We conclude that the trial judge adequately responded to plaintiffs\u2019 specific objection related to the perceived inconsistency between the dismissed defense of comparative fault and the risk-utility factor relating to the user\u2019s ability to avoid danger. We therefore find no plain error in the judge\u2019s instructions warranting reversal. <em>Cf. Gaido v. Weiser, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>175, 200-201 (App.Div.1988), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>310 (1989). <em>Compare, Siren v. Behan, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>130, 138-142 (App.Div. 1988) remanded <em>o.g., </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>323 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Plaintiffs contend that they were entitled to a judgment on liability because defendant breached its continuing duty either to warn all users of the danger or to \u201cretrofit\u201d the units with devices to eliminate the hazard. This issue was raised in support of their motion for judgment at the close of all the evidence, which motion was denied. While plaintiffs did not request a jury charge on this point, the subject was again raised on the motion for judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>or new trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">We reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that it is \u201cthe law of this State that the manufacturer of a defective product has a continuing duty to protect a purchaser, even where a defect is discovered after the sale.\u201d While the proposition has been endorsed by at least one member of our Supreme Court, <em>Stephenson v. R.A. Jones &amp; Co., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>194, 216 (1986) (Stein, J., dissenting), the present state of the law is now otherwise in this particular context. <em>See Feldman v. Lederle Laboratories, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>429, 456-57 (1984) for the general proposition. As we said in <em>Jackson v. New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>448 (App.Div.1979), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>330 (1979), relating to a similar issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">There is no duty upon the seller of a machine faultlessly designed and manufactured ... to notify its customers after the time of sale of changes in the state of the art concerning the safe operation of such machine and advise them to install any new, updated or improved safeguards developed since the time of sale. [166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 465].<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Further, we said in <em>Jackson </em>that the alleged defect</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A18\">must be in existence <em>at the time the product is placed in the stream of commerce. </em>Consequently, the failure of these defendants to notify Roberts of changes in safety standards for the mill, cannot result in the imposition of liability upon them. The obligation to maintain the mill in a safe condition must rest with the customer. <em>[Id. </em>at 466 (emphasis in original)].<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Thus, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that existing New Jersey law requires a manufacturer, who manufactures a product which conforms to industry safety standards, to warn purchasers when those standards are subsequently updated. We view a situation in which design standards are updated to be different from discovery that a product believed to be safe actually had a latent danger or design defect before sale. <em>Compare, Feldman v. Lederle Laboratories, supra. See also Hayes v. Ariens Co., </em>391 <em>Mass. </em>407, 462 <em>N.E.2d </em>273, 276-277 (1984) (involving defendant's 1961 snowblower, which carried the same warning label <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>as was on the 1965 model in this case)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; <em>Gauthier v. AMF, Inc., </em>788 F.2d 634, 637-638 (9th Cir.1986), <em>amended and reh\u2019g denied, </em>805 F.2d 337 (9th Cir.1986) (evidence of subsequent design changes to snowblower inadmissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Finally, as the complaint in this case was filed before July 22, 1987 and in the absence of any argument under the Products Liability statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-1, <em>et seq., </em>we do not consider any statutory issue in this case. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-4; L.1987, c. 197, \u00a7 8 (effective date).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The evidence in this case included testimony by Buske and Tschantz that in 1965 industry standards did not require an M guard or a deadman\u2019s clutch, and that the 1965 model was properly designed. While plaintiffs\u2019 expert offered a contrary opinion, the jury was entitled to reject it. Similarly, there was evidence from which the jury could have found that the cautionary decal on the 1965 model provided an adequate warning as to the danger presented by the blades. Further, as the trial judge noted during trial and on the post-judgment motions, there were fact questions for the jury to decide under the risk-utility analysis. While the judge may well have disagreed with the jury\u2019s findings if he were the fact finder, his role upon deciding the post-judgment motions was only to consider whether reasonable persons could disagree as to the result. <em>See, e.g., Dolson v. Anastasia, 55 N.J. </em>2, 5 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">We agree with the trial judge that there was no basis for entering a judgment for plaintiffs as a matter of law and no basis for granting their motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-15\"> The notice of appeal is directed exclusively to the order of September 2, 1988 which denied plaintiffs\u2019 motions for judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>and new trial.

In <em>Jackson, </em>plaintiffs hand was crushed in 1973 by a rubber sheeting mill manufactured in 1931. Evidence proffered by plaintiff would have showed that the mill was not defective at the time of its manufacture, but that as the state of the art developed about twenty years later, design and safety standards required installation of a guard on this type of mill.
