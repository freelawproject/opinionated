His reliance on our holding in <em>North Plainfield v. Perone, </em>54 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1 (App.Div.), certif. den. 29 <em>N.J. </em>507 (1959) is misplaced. The conditions under review in <em>North Plainfield </em>were not only reasonable but were also necessary to the variance granted. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11. Our holding in <em>DeFelice v. Zoning Bd. of Adj., </em>216 <em>NJ.Super. </em>377 (App.Div.1987) is applicable to those situations where the conditions imposed prove invalid, and the original variance has otherwise properly been granted. See also the related cases of <em>State v. Farmland-Fair Lawn Dairies, Inc., </em>70 <em>N.J.Super. </em>19 (App.Div.1961), certif. den. 38 <em>N.J. </em>301 (1962), and <em>Cohen v. Fair Lawn, </em>85 <em>N.J.Super. </em>234, 237-39 (App.Div.1964), concerning the ability of the municipal board to remove a condition previously imposed. We are satisfied that an unreasonable condition, under proper circumstances, may be stricken or removed even if the variance benefit has been accepted. Judge Serpentelli\u2019s position on this issue is, however, without consequence in this case. Further, his conclusion that \u201cthe variance application would not have been approved in 1983 but for the assumption by that Board that the condition was valid\u201d is not disputed. 226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
