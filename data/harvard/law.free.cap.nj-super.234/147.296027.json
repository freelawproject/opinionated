Defendant was found not guilty of intentional murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3a(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">Defendant Manning and his codefendant, Richard Charles Williams, were accused of killing New Jersey State Trooper Philip Lamonaco, robbing him of a gun he had confiscated from Manning during a traffic stop, and fleeing the scene. The trial judge on February 18,1987 sentenced Manning to life in prison, 30 years without parole, to be served consecutive to an earlier federal conviction. The judge also imposed a Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalty of $10,000. The jury could reach no verdict regarding Williams, and a mistrial was declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">On appeal, the defendant raises three issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>I. The trial court unconstitutionally denied an indigent defendant expert services, ruling that <em>State v. Stockling, </em>160 <em>NJ.Super. </em>486 (App.Div.1978), barred such services, no matter how necessary they were to the preparation of the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">II. The jury\u2019s verdicts were fatally repugnant, convicting Thomas William Manning of conduct for which he was not charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">III. The prosecution excused black prospective jurors because of their race, in violation of Article I, Paragraphs 5, 9 and 11 of the Constitution of the State of New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">On its cross-appeal, the State raises a single issue:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">IV. The sentencing court improperly merged defendant\u2019s conviction of escape into defendant\u2019s conviction of felony murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">As we find no merit to any of defendant\u2019s claims, we affirm the decisions of the trial court, although as to the first point, for reasons other than those expressed by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">New Jersey State Trooper Philip Lamonaco was shot and killed at about 4:30 p.m. on December 21, 1981, near mile marker 3.9 on Route 80 west. Ten witnesses, all of whom had been traveling on Route 80 at the time of the shooting, testified about the events prior to and after the shooting, as did Manning himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Reading the witnesses\u2019 testimony is not unlike watching consecutive frames in a movie. Each saw a different scene of the event. Most of the witnesses saw the troopers patrol car with its lights flashing, parked behind another car on the shoulder of the westbound acceleration lane from Exit 4. Charles Hamilton testified that while he was driving east toward the truck stop at Exit 4, he saw the trooper leaning over, with his hat in his left hand, talking to someone through the driver\u2019s window of a \u201cbluish-green mid-size\u201d car. The car was also described as \u201cblue,\u201d \u201cbluish-greyish,\u201d and \u201cdark green.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">The second witness, George Rowe, testified that while he was driving west in his Mack truck toward the two stopped vehicles, he saw the trooper stepping back from the \u201cblue Nova\u201d with his hands \u201cout to his sides\u201d and a \u201cshiny\u201d nickel-plated gun in his left hand. At the same time he saw the driver of the car \u201csitting back\u201d in his seat. Six witnesses testified that there were two people in the Nova, the driver and a passenger. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Three other witnesses testified that there might have been three people in the Nova, two passengers and the driver.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Just moments after Eowe passed the scene, two other witnesses saw the driver standing with his back to the car, facing the trooper, with \u201chis hands up\u201d in \u201ca fist-fight type of confrontation.\u201d His hands were empty. A third witness saw a \u201cshiny\u201d gun in the hands of the trooper; yet another also saw the gun but did not describe it as \u201cshiny.\u201d The driver then ran into the traffic lanes and the trooper fired at him. At that time no gun was seen in the driver\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">While the driver and the trooper were facing each other, a passenger was outside the Nova on the passenger\u2019s side, moving toward the trooper\u2019s car. A gunfight ensued between the trooper and the passenger. Shots were fired; some witnesses said \u201cmany\u201d shots, others limited the number to two or three. \u201cSnow spurts,\u201d presumably caused by bullets hitting the snow, were seen behind the trooper (who was standing a \u201cfew feet\u201d in front of the Nova), as well as between the two cars. After the volley of gunfire, the passenger grabbed his stomach and fell into the snow bank near the rear of the trooper\u2019s car. The trooper was also shot and fell face-first into the snowbank.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">After the trooper fell, the passenger was seen \u201crunning\u201d toward and \u201cbaekpng]\u201d into the front passenger door of the Nova. During the shooting the driver must have reentered the Nova on his side, because a witness testified that after the passenger got back into the car, the driver \u201cjump[ed] out of the left side of the car.\u201d One of the witnesses, Donald Longyore, then saw the driver walk over to the trooper, bend down over him, and stand up with a \u201cshiny\u201d gun in his hand. According to Longyore, the driver pointed the gun over the prone trooper and fired two or three shots. The driver then reentered the Nova, and was seen switching a \u201cnickel-plated\u201d gun from his left hand to either his right hand or the front seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">The Nova then sped west on Route 80. Yet another witness, who had seen part of the confrontation and was driving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>long-haul freight truck back to Colorado, tried to push the car off the road. He was unsuccessful, and the Nova drove off Route 80 at the nearest exit, onto Hainesburg Road. The Nova was next seen on Route 94 in Hainesburg by a witness who saw only two people in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Back at the scene of the shooting on Route 80, after witness George Hamilton left his passenger at the truck stop on Exit 4 he returned to Route 80, this time heading west. The trooper\u2019s car was still parked on the shoulder of the westbound entrance ramp to Route 80, and as Hamilton accelerated to enter Route 80, he saw the trooper lying face down, 15 to 18 feet in front of his car. Hamilton, a \u201cfirst aider\u201d with the Blairstown ambulance corps, checked the trooper for a pulse; when he could not find one, he went into the trooper\u2019s car and called for help.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The defendant testified to a different chain of events. He agreed that the car in question was his, and even stated that he had registered it under the name Barry Easterly. He further acknowledged that the trooper had pulled him over for speeding. But according to the defendant, he had picked up hitchhikers when he entered Route 80, a man and a woman, and therefore when he was stopped by the trooper he had two passengers. The man was seated on the passenger side of the front seat and the woman was seated in the back directly behind Manning. According to defendant, Williams was not in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Manning testified that after the trooper asked him for his license and registration, he recognized Manning as a fugitive and \u201cgrabbed [me] by the shirt ... stuck his weapon right up close to my head and said: \u2018Don\u2019t move Manning. Put your hand on the wheel.\u2019 \u201d The trooper then ordered Manning out of the car, \u201cspun [me] around ... and shoved [me] towards the vehicle ... which caused [me] to start to fall____\u201d The trooper fired his gun near defendant\u2019s head, and Manning dropped to the ground, turning to face the trooper as he dropped. The defendant testified that he hit the trooper with his fist and ran eastward, into the traffic. He then reversed his course and dove across the back of his car, onto the passenger side, \u201cfor cover.\u201d According to the defendant the trooper then began firing (\u201che was trying to kill me\u201d), and Manning, still crouched, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>moved up the passenger side to get his gun from the glove compartment. Although the woman was still in the back seat, the man was standing outside the car and defendant found it necessary to \u201celbow\u201d him out of his way.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The defendant also told the jury that it was then that he began firing at the trooper. The two exchanged volleys while defendant moved backwards down the passenger side of his car, then across the trunk and up the car to the driver\u2019s door for extra ammunition. He then realized two facts: the trooper was no longer firing at him, he was lying on the ground, and the trooper still had Manning\u2019s license. According to the defendant, \u201cI ran to him, stepped between his gun hand and his body. Looked around the area for the license, couldn\u2019t find it, turned and left. Ran back to the car.\u201d According to Manning the trooper was dead (\u201cI felt bodies before, and it was\u2014there was no life at all.\u201d) He put his own gun on the front seat of his car and then drove the car, with both passengers, west on Route 80. Because he \u201cwas getting pressed by some trailer trucks\u201d and the shooting was being discussed on his CB radio, he \u201ctook the first exit\u201d off Route 80 onto Route 94. He then left the car and told his passengers to \u201cjust go;\u201d it was the last time he saw the hitchhikers. Defendant took a screw driver and a \u201cbrazing rod\u201d from his car to try to find another car \u201cto get out of the area\u201d with, but after trying for several hours he was unsuccessful and left the area on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The vehicle, a four-door blue Nova with Connecticut license plates, was found at about 7:80 that night on Station Road, approximately three-tenths of a mile off Route 94. It was stuck in the snow, had bullet holes in the windshield and hood, and blood on the inside panel of the front passenger door, as well as on the front passenger\u2019s side of the seat and headrest. A shoulder holster for a nine millimeter gun was found in the woods off the shoulder of Station Road, on the driver\u2019s side of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Although not dear from the record, Trooper Lamonaco apparently died at the scene. His service revolver, a six shot, .357 Magnum Ruger revolver, was found 5-8 feet east of his body, facing east, about 27 feet west of his car. All six shots had been fired. Another gun, a Smith and Wesson .38 Special, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>taken from the trooper\u2019s body at the hospital. It had five live rounds in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">According to the doctor who performed the autopsy, Lamonaco had been shot nine times, but because he was wearing a \u201cbullet-proof\u201d vest not all the bullets entered his body. One went through only his clothing, never touching his skin; one dented his vest and his skin at his left breast-pocket level; one struck the muscle of his right upper arm, which was not protected by the bullet proof vest; another entered his right leg just above the knee, and another entered and exited his left fourth finger, which was wrapped around his flashlight. (No witness testified to seeing a flashlight in the trooper\u2019s hand, only a gun). The fatal bullet struck his upper left arm, then entered his chest, passed through his lung, his heart and the other lung, and exited through the right side of his chest, getting trapped between his skin and his clothing. Three other bullets had been fired in a cluster into the trooper\u2019s back, at his right shoulder. They were fired, according to the pathologist, at the same 30-degree downward angle while the \u201ctarget\u201d was \u201cprone\u201d and \u201cstationary.\u201d The bullets were fired from a nine millimeter Browning high power semi-automatic pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The defendant\u2019s medical witness, Dr. Robert Wolf, testified that by reviewing the autopsy reports, but not the body, he initially concluded that the three bullets in the trooper\u2019s back were fired when the shooter was seven-and-a-half to ten feet away from the trooper, and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">was standing direct, [while] the deceased was lower down, crouching or with knees bent____the right side of the deceased was pointing generally toward the shooter, but ... the body was ever so slightly rotated, so that the bullet as it passed through the substance of the body of the deceased did not pass perfectly tangentially, but passed with a downward or inward, inward deflection of about an inch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">On cross examination, however, Dr. Wolf testified inconsistently with these quoted conclusions. When he drew the body as he thought it was positioned during the firing of the three bullets, he \u201cdesignated the body to be face-down on the ground in the horizontal position.\u201d When asked by the prosecutor if \u201cthe body would be in the same position vis-a-vis the floor as that pen lying flat [on a table in the courtroom]\u201d the doctor answered \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>On November 23, 1983 Manning and Williams were jointly indicted for murder, felony murder, and the felonies of escape and robbery. Manning was captured in Virginia on April 24, 1985, living with his wife and three children under the alias \u201cCharles Boone.\u201d <em>United States v. Levasseur, </em>620 <em>F.Supp. </em>624, 627 (E.D.N.Y.1985). Manning was not arraigned on the New Jersey charges until five months after his capture. He then stood trial for, and was convicted of, unrelated charges in New York. <em>Levasseur, </em>620 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In his first point defendant argues that New Jersey denied him funds for expert services merely because he was represented by counsel of choice, not the Office of the Public Defender. He states that \u201c[a]n indigent with <em>pro bono </em>counsel has the same right to expert services as an indigent represented by the public defender.\u201d Defendant further argues that because of this \u201cright to expert services,\u201d the holding in <em>In re State v. Stockling, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486 (App.Div.1978), is unconstitutional. <em>Stockling </em>held that \u201can indigent defendant who chooses not to be represented by the Public Defender is not entitled to the service of expert witnesses or other incidents of his defense at the expense of either the county or the State.\u201d <em>Stockling, </em>at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The State argues that defendant\u2019s request for free expert services has a fatal defect in that he has never been adjudicated indigent under New Jersey law. Citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-1 <em>et seq. </em>(the Public Defender Act), the prosecution argues that only indigents may receive State-funded services of any kind, legal or expert. Defendant asserts that the prosecutor and court apparently had accepted the fact of his indigency, because it was not placed in issue. Furthermore, he had been declared indigent in his previous federal trial, and that, he claims, meets the New Jersey statute\u2019s requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the defendant had been determined by New Jersey to be indigent, the State also maintains that he was still not eligible for free expert services because he refused legal assistance from the Office of the Public Defender. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The State argues that it was the Legislature\u2019s intent to provide expert services only for those represented by that office.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The defendant admits that he refused legal assistance from the Public Defender\u2019s office. Due to his ardent political beliefs and the \u201cclose relationship\u201d that had developed between him and his attorney, Manning told the trial court that he would not accept another attorney. If denied Kunstler\u2019s services, he would then withdraw completely from his own trial; he would not represent himself, and he would not assist anyone else in his own defense. He refused to accept such help even after the trial court advised him that by remaining with his current attorney he was forfeiting free expert services. He reiterates, however, that the requirement that he have legal representation by the Public Defender\u2019s office before he is eligible to receive expert services is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In denying the defendant\u2019s motion for free expert services, the trial judge based his denial not on whether defendant was indigent, but on the fact that \u201cthere was no authority to provide any State funds to indigent defendants who elect to be represented by counsel of choice other than those provided by the Office of the Public Defender____\u201d This ruling was warranted by <em>State v. Stockling, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 490. However, we here reject that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The facts of <em>Stockling </em>are similar to those in the case at bar: both defendants were charged with first degree murder, and both were represented by private counsel. <em>State v. Stockling, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>362, 363, n. 2 (Law Div.1977). The one significant difference between the two, however, is that in <em>Stockling </em>it was stipulated that the defendant was indigent; here, the subject might have been in question, had the issue not been rendered moot by the court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Stockling. </em>Yet the trial judge did not base his ruling upon this difference. Another difference, but also not a significant one, is that in <em>Stockling </em>the defendant\u2019s counsel was paid by his parents. <em>Stockling, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 363. In the case at bar the attorneys were serving <em>pro bono publico. </em>Apparently, in neither case was the defendant able to defray the cost of either counsel or necessary expert services.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>While we agree with defendant that an indigent defendant has a right to expert services, we need not reach his constitutional argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In reviewing <em>Stockling </em>and the Public Defender Act, we believe that the authority to provide State funds to indigent defendants represented by private counsel exists in the statute itself. The current version of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-14 states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">[e]ligibility for the services of the Office of the Public Defender shall be determined on the basis of the need of the defendant. Need shall be measured according to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">a. The financial ability of the defendant to engage and compensate competent private counsel; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">h. <em>The ability of the defendant to provide all other necessary expenses of </em>representation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">We read this statute to mean that eligibility for public defender services must include whether the defendant can afford not only legal counsel, but also other services necessary for his defense, and we include in that description the services of experts, where necessary. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-5 expressly provides before and after the 1987 amendments):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">It shall be the duty of the Public Defender to provide for the legal representation of any indigent defendant who is formally charged with the commission of an indictable offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\"><em>All necessary services and facilities of representation (including investigation and other preparation) shall be provided in every case. </em>[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">The 1987 amendments merely made explicit that the Public Defender could weigh the financial constraints of that office and the value of requested services on a case-by-case basis. What determines necessity will be discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">Recognizing the ever-increasing burden on the Public Defender\u2019s Office, we believe the <em>Stockling </em>court interpreted the Act in too restrictive a manner. In <em>Stockling </em>we stated that we could not \u201cperceive any good reason why the State should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>required to provide for the payment of services other than legal representation when an indigent defendant chooses not to be represented by the Public Defender.\u201d <em>Stockling, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 489. We now can perceive at least two good reasons. The Act itself requires that an indigent defendant receive \u201c[a]ll necessary services and facilities of representation (including investigation and other preparation)....\u201d It nowhere conditions those services on the defendant first receiving legal services from the Public Defender. <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2A:158A-5 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Secondly, the increasingly overcrowded docket and insufficient resources, both monetary and personnel, of the Office of the Public Defender limit the number of cases that office can handle effectively. <em>See </em>122 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>1461 (Dec. 8, 1988). Permitting the cost of legal services to be borne by a charitable attorney or a third party would relieve the State of the legal costs and use of personnel involved in such defenses. In the usual situation, if an indigent defendant requires expert services beyond his means, he must refuse an offer of <em>pro bono </em>or third-party-funded legal services merely to avail himself of the State-financed experts. The State would then be required to pay for both legal and expert services, when it could have saved the cost, in both money and personnel, of the legal services.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">In <em>State v. R.G.D., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>1 (1987), the New Jersey Supreme Court distinguished the general right to expert services established in <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, supra, </em>from the right to expert services in a juvenile waiver hearing. In <em>R.G.D. </em>the juvenile had been denied a psychiatric expert in a waiver hearing on the basis that he had private counsel \u201cand consequently was not entitled to any services available through the Public Defender\u2019s office.\u201d 108 <em>N.J. </em>at 18. The Court noted that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, supra, </em>had \u201cheld that an indigent defendant has a constitutional right to a psychiatrist when sanity is a significant factor at trial ... in proceedings where \u2018an individual\u2019s life or liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>[was] at risk.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Ake, </em>470 <em>U.S. </em>at 78, 105 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 1094, 84 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 63). The Court concluded, however, that the New Jersey waiver proceeding was not one where life or liberty was at risk, and therefore no expert service need have been provided to the juvenile. Since Manning\u2019s liberty was at risk here, the same is not true in our case. Manning should not have been denied State-funded expert services because he was represented by private counsel, whether that counsel was <em>pro bono </em>or paid by a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">There are, however, at least three other recognized reasons to deny a defendant payment for expert services, and we find that such a denial was appropriate in this case for three of these four reasons. Thus the denial of such payment or services for the reasons stated by the trial judge was harmless error. (We reiterate that he was properly bound by <em>Stockling, </em>and had no other choice).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">As alluded to earlier, the first prerequisite to receiving State-funded services, whether legal or expert, is indigency. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-1 states unequivocally that \u201c[i]t is ... the policy of this State to provide for constitutional guarantees of counsel in criminal cases for <em>indigent </em>defendants----\u201d [Emphasis added]. There is no case which holds that New Jersey is required to provide free expert services to a defendant who has not been adjudicated indigent.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The defendant bears the burden of proving his indigency, but in this case Manning did not do so, not because he could not, but because it was unnecessary. The trial court clearly ruled that simply because defendant was represented by private counsel, <em>Stockling </em>foreclosed such State-funded expert services. Had the trial court known of our decision today allowing both private counsel and State-funded experts for an indigent, the defense could have filed the requisite application for a declaration of indigency.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>As Manning was foreclosed from proving his indigency, we do not affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of expert services because he failed to prove his indigency. Rather, we affirm the denial because the court could and should have denied Manning expert services for two other recognized reasons: (1) there was no reasonable basis upon which to refute the State\u2019s experts, (2) the defendant did in fact call competent expert witnesses of his own. These factors are interrelated and persuade us that the decision to deny defendant State-funded expert witnesses was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Before the State will finance an indigent defendant\u2019s expert services, the facts of the case must \u201cwarrant\u201d the need for expert testimony. <em>State v. Green, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>13 (1969) (in a forgery case, where a pivotal question was whether the defendant signed the check, a supplemental handwriting expert was unnecessary), and <em>State v. Williams, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>427 (1966) (court authorized the use of a toxicologist in the defense of a charge of entering with intent to steal).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">On this appeal the defendant argues that he needed ballistics and trace evidence experts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Given that the defendant maintained throughout the trial that he had in fact shot the trooper, case law asserts that the expert testimony on ballistics would have been meaningless and the denial of funds for such testimony was not error. Whether Manning or Williams shot the trooper, Manning would be equally culpable in the charges for which he was convicted. <em>Cessor v. State, </em>282 <em>Ark. </em>330, 668 <em>S.W.</em>2d 525, 528 (1984), and <em>State v. Evans, </em>710 <em>S.W.2d </em>530, 534 (Tenn.Crim.App.1985) (defendants did not deny that they shot and killed the victims, so there was no error in withholding state funds for defendant\u2019s ballistics expert); <em>United States v. Walborn, </em>730 F.2d 192, 194 (5th Cir.1984), <em>cert. </em>den. 469 <em>U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>842, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>147, 88 L.Ed.2d 86 (1984) (where defendant admitted touching documents, no fingerprint expert was needed).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Additionally, the defendant did call four of his own expert witnesses. All but defendant\u2019s medical witness have little relevance to this appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s chief expert witness was Dr. Robert Wolf, whose testimony was noted earlier. At oral argument defendant maintained that had he been able to pay for additional experts, those experts would have bolstered defendant\u2019s testimony and refuted that of the State\u2019s witnesses. We see no foundation for such an assertion, and in any event a defendant is not entitled to State funding for the leading experts in a field, only for competent experts. <em>Cf. State v. Rinaldi, </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209, 214 (App.Div.1959), <em>cert. </em>den. 366 <em>U.S. </em>914, 81 <em>S.Ct. </em>1089, 6 L.Ed.2d 238 (1961), <em>cert. </em>den. 371 <em>U.S. </em>847, 83 <em>S.Ct </em>82, 9 L.Ed.2d 83 (1962); <em>State v. McCombs, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>161, 165 (App.Div.1979), aff\u2019d o.b. 81 <em>N.J. </em>373, 374 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Dr. Wolf testified that he had performed or assisted in more than 200 autopsies. Yet although he initially stated on direct that the trooper was probably in a crouched position when he was hit with the three bullets to his back (thus substantiating defendant\u2019s version of the incident), the witness directly contradicted himself oh cross-examination and acknowledged that the trooper was lying prone when the bullets entered his body. We cannot surmise that a different expert would be able to refute that testimony. The pathologist who conducted the autopsy stated that the trooper had been in a \u201cprone\u201d position. An impartial eyewitness saw the driver of the Nova shoot the trooper in the back. Furthermore, had the victim been other than prone, each shot would have moved his body somewhat, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>and each bullet\u2019s path would thus have been at a different angle; yet the physical evidence demonstrated parallel paths to the cluster of bullets in the trooper\u2019s back.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Any reasonable balancing of the defendant\u2019s right to call witnesses and the State\u2019s right not to waste its resources would have resulted in the denial of any additional State-funded expert on this issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The entire record in this case indicates that defense counsel, especially defendant\u2019s primary attorney, Kunstler, pursued a vigorous and knowledgeable cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses. There was no showing that the facts were subject to contrary interpretation by any available expert, whether within or beyond defendant\u2019s means.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">To summarize, we find that it was not necessary for defendant to have been afforded legal representation by the Public Defender\u2019s Office in order to receive expert services from the State. The right established by the Legislature depends upon the defendant\u2019s indigent status, not whether the Public Defender is the counsel of record. However, on the facts of this case, it was proper for the trial court to have denied defendant\u2019s request for funds for expert services, because it is unlikely, given the physical evidence and the eyewitness\u2019 testimony, that additional witnesses for the defendant would have been able to refute the State\u2019s evidence. Furthermore, the defendant effectively cross-examined the State\u2019s expert witnesses, and called adequate expert witnesses of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">[After a factual analysis, the court determined that defendant\u2019s second point was unavailing. There was no inherently inconsistent verdict; and any reference in the indictment to the codefendant having fired the fatal shot was surplusage].</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">[The court factually determined that defendant\u2019s third point was unavailing. There was no basis for a claim of a discriminatory use of the State\u2019s peremptory challenges].</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">In its cross-appeal, the State contends that the judge mistakenly merged defendant\u2019s conviction for escape, and thus the matter should be remanded for resentencing. The State\u2019s cross-appeal has merit. Defendant was convicted of two counts of felony murder, one based on the escape, and the other on the robbery of the gun. As there was only one death, there could be only one conviction for felony murder. Yet the other underlying felony conviction, absent its accompanying murder charge, need not be disregarded for sentencing purposes. While there might have been a dispute concerning whether the robbery or escape would be the charge to be encompassed within the surviving felony murder conviction, the State is willing to accept the lesser of the two additional convictions, escape, as the surviving conviction. We therefore remand for resentencing for the escape conviction. The trial court should also determine whether the additional separate sentence should be made concurrent or consecutive, pursuant to the guidelines of <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 643-644 (1985), <em>cert. </em>den. 475 <em>U.S. </em>1014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1193, 89 L.Ed.2d 308 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">As the State acknowledges in its brief, and the defendant in his reply brief understandably agrees, the defendant\u2019s period of parole ineligibility on the felony murder conviction should be reduced from 30 years, as ordered by the trial judge, to 25 years, the maximum allowable at the time of the crime. It was not until 1982 that the Legislature amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3b to require 30 years without parole. <em>L. </em>1982, <em>c. </em>111. <em>See also State v. Rodriguez, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>263, 274, n. 4 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">We therefore remand this case so the trial court can impose a sentence for the additional escape conviction, and also resentence Manning to a maximum of 25 years parole ineligibility for the felony murder conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-10\"> The first witness, Hamilton, did not testify about the number of people at the scene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\"> New Jersey\u2019s Public Defender Act satisfies the <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 <em>U.S. </em>335, 343-344, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>792, 795-796, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, 804 (1963), right to counsel required by the United States Constitution (states are obligated to provide counsel to \"any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer\u201d), <em>Stockling, supra, </em>160 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 489. <em>Gideon </em>does not require a state to provide a lawyer for someone who is not too poor to hire a lawyer, nor does it instruct the states on how to provide such counsel. As recently as 1985 the Supreme Court confirmed that the way in which states provide legal counsel for the poor is left to the states. <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 <em>U.S. </em>68, 83, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>1087, 1096, 84 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>53, 66 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">New Jersey provided legal counsel for indigents even before the United States Supreme Court required it. <em>State v. Horton, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>518 (1961). Until 1967 we used the assigned counsel system, in which a particular judge would designate a member of the local bar to represent the defendant. <em>Horton </em>at 524. But there were criticisms of this system, primarily because it did not provide timely and thorough representation <em>(Horton, supra, </em>at 526, n. 4), and because the cost of defending indigents fell on the \"members of the bar.\u201d <em>State v. Rush, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>399, 415 (1966). After the <em>Gideon </em>decision, and after considering that the then-current New Jersey system needed to be reviewed, the State Supreme Court wrote that \"[t]he Legislature should have an opportunity to decide whether this obligation of the State should be met by the present system of assignment in individual cases, or by a public defender, or some combination of both.\u201d <em>Rush, </em>at 415. In 1967, by the adoption of the Public Defender Act, the Legislature decided that the public defender system best met this problem. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Judge Antell in his concurring opinion persuasively argues that the result we reach is also supported on constitutional grounds. We fully subscribe to his analysis on this point. But we are enjoined not to reach a constitutional issue when a matter can be otherwise determined. <em>Donadio v. Cunningham, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>309, 325-326 (1971); <em>State v. Salerno, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>289, 296 (1958), <em>Grant v. Wright, 222 N.J.Super. </em>191, 197-198 (App.Div.1988), certif. den. 111 <em>N.J. </em>562 (1988). We have therefore chosen to rely upon our construction of the statute, even appreciating the difference of opinion between our concurring colleague on this point of statutory construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b186-11\"> The statute was revised in 1987, but the revisions do not change the meaning of the portions of the statute relevant to this case. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-2, <em>L. </em>1987, <em>c. </em>170 \u00a7 1. According to the Senate Judiciary Committee Statement accompanying the revised Bill, the earlier act, in effect at the time of the <em>Manning </em>proceedings, was based upon a defendant\u2019s need. Further:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">The appointment of counsel to an indigent defendant is made in consideration of \u2018the financial ability of the defendant to engage and compensate competent private counsel and to provide all other necessary expenses of representation.'

His specialty was firearm and toolmark identification, and he testified \u201cas an examiner\u201d of shell casings. Det. Fred Tavener, a New Jersey State Trooper, testified to a search and seizure issue regarding the defendant\u2019s driver's license. He put into question the credibility of one of the State\u2019s previous witnesses.

I write, however, to express my disagreement with its conclusion that the Public Defender Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-5, entitled defendant to the cost of expert witnesses where he refused to accept legal representation by the Public Defender. Although I endorse the logic of the majority\u2019s view that such services should be financed by the State for indigent defendants who are privately represented, this is a policy decision which the Legislature has not made and which lies beyond our competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The only statutory authority for the allowance of expert services to indigent defendants is contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-5, which specifies that these must be provided by the Public Defender as part of that office\u2019s \u201clegal representation of any indigent defendant who is formally charged with the commission of an indictable offense.\u201d The fact that there may be, as the majority perceives, \u201cgood reasons\u201d to provide for the payment of services to privately represented indigent defendants cannot operate to enlarge the plain meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">The majority distinguishes our decision in <em>In re State v. Stockling, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486 (App.Div.1978), in part upon the ground that we there failed to \u201cperceive any good reason why the State should be required to provide for the payment of services other than legal representation when an indigent defendant chooses not to be represented by the Public Defender,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 489, whereas here we do perceive such good reason. But the phrase \u201cgood reason\u201d was not intended in <em>Stockling </em>to refer to the absence of any good policy reason. What was alluded to was the absence of any sound statutory basis on which to grant the application. This is clear from the language immediately following that quoted above in which we noted, as a \u201csole exception,\u201d the statutory authority to provide a free transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">To the extent that <em>Stockling </em>speaks to the issue here addressed, I adhere to the conclusion therein reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Notwithstanding the view hereinabove stated, I nevertheless agree that the mere fact of defendant\u2019s representation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>private counsel did not preclude Ms eligiMlity to receive the financial assistance necessary to pay the cost of expert witnesses. In my judgment, the State was obliged to furnish such assistance on constitutional grounds. <em>See Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 <em>U.S. </em>68, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>1087, 84 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>53 (1985); <em>State v. R.G.D., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>1, <em>18 </em>(1987); <em>State v. Green, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>13, <em>18 </em>(1969). This view is in no respect inconsistent with <em>Stockling, </em>which gave no consideration to constitutional implications. However, I agree with the majority that a factual analysis of the evidence leaves no doubt that additional expert testimony could not have altered the outcome of the trial and that the trial court\u2019s refusal to provide the requested assistance was harmless. In all other respects I also concur with the opinion of the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
