In 1983, OCUA permanently financed construction of its wastewater treatment plant in Ocean County and issued long-term \u201cWastewater Revenue Bonds,\u201d totalling more than $207,-000,000. After notice and a public hearing, OCUA then raised its rates to $1,800 effective January 1, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In Count One of its complaint, Manasquan sought damages equal to the difference between the $850 rate originally charged at the time the 1981 agreement was entered into, and the $1,800 rate which became effective January 1984. Manasquan alleged that prior to the execution of the agreement, OCUA misrepresented to Manasquan, and to state and federal regulatory and funding agencies, information about flow projections and projected user charges on which Manasquan and the agencies relied. In particular, Manasquan charged OCUA misrepresented to it and to the federal and state agencies that the $850 rate would remain constant through 1984, when OCUA knew the rate would likely be increased in 1984. Manasquan claimed that as a result of OCUA\u2019s \u201cmisleading and inaccurate data,\u201d the state and federal agencies ordered Manasquan to abandon its plan to construct its own treatment facility and to transmit its wastewater to the facility operated by OCUA.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In Count Two of Manasquan\u2019s complaint, it alleged that OCUA failed to establish rates during its construction and start-up years that were sufficient to pay the debt service and cost of operation of the facility. Manasquan alleged that instead, OCUA \u201ccontinually borrowed money to finance all of its obligations ... and thereby maintained an artificially low rate for its participants.\u201d Manasquan alleged that the $1,800 rate results \u201cin an unlawful imposition of costs attributable solely to current and prior users ...\u201d which should not be borne by Manasquan and future users. Manasquan therefore demanded that OCUA charge Manasquan and other \u201cfuture users\u201d a rate reflecting only \u201coriginal capital cost factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>We affirm the order for summary judgment substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Rieciardi in his comprehensive letter opinion dated November 21,1986. We agree that any statements made by QCXJA officials to Manasquan and the public agencies as to future rates were approximate projections and not material misrepresentations of actual fact. As Judge Rieciardi found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">It is not a representation of fact. It is simply a projection. It cannot reasonably be understood by anyone knowledgeable in matters of this nature to constitute an unalterable fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">During negotiations, [Manasquan] had the right to investigate to the fullest extent. Indeed, [Manasquan] conducted its own studies. There was equal access to information on both sides. OCUA did not prevent [Manasquan] from making any investigation that [Manasquan] deemed necessary. [Manasquan] chose to rely on OCUA\u2019s estimate as to the projected rates. However, both parties understood these figures were predictions and not warranties. In the oral arguments, [Manasquan] conceded that it anticipated that the rates might rise above the estimated $850.00 PMG within the four years between 1981 and 1985. [Manasquan\u2019s] objection is that these rates went higher than it anticipated. Such a claim, however, is not meritorious under the circumstances of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The judge\u2019s conclusion is legally sound and supportable by the undisputed facts presented at the summary judgment motion. <em>See Middlesex County Sewer. Auth. v. Bor. of Middlesex, </em>74 <em>N.J.Super. </em>591, 605 (Law Div.1962), aff\u2019d o.b. 79 <em>NJ.Super. </em>24 (App.Div.), certif. den. 40 <em>NJ. </em>501 (1963); <em>Beverly Sewerage Auth. v.

Amland Contractors, Inc., </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>70, 75-76 (App.Div.1986), nor is there a legal basis for a cause of action predicated on the doctrine of promissory estoppel, <em>see Royal Associates v. Concannon, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>84, 91-92 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>We also agree that Manasquan has no claim for a downward adjustment of its rate on the basis that OCUA allegedly undercharged rates to participants during its early years of operation. Manasquan and its experts had access to OCUA\u2019s records before it contracted with OCUA. Several reports were prepared and were available to Manasquan, as were OCUA\u2019s books and records of its debt service and operating costs. If OCUA charged rates during construction and start-up years which were inadequate to pay for the cost of debt service and operation, Manasquan could have made that determination and demanded that it be charged at a lower rate. Instead, it agreed that its rate would not be more favorable than the rate charged other participants who have contracted with OCUA for the disposal of wastewater.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The order for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
