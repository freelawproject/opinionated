We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">The salient facts are not in dispute and are essentially a matter of public record. On August 18, 1978, the BPU issued its formal opinion in <em>In the Matter of the Petition of Twin County Disposal, Inc. for Approval of Stock Transfer, </em>Docket No. 782-138 (BPU August 18, 1978 <em>{Twin County), </em>holding that only utility stock transfers which result in the vesting of a majority interest in one person or entity requires prior Board approval under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>JSiS-lO.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The BPU\u2019s decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>without reference to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:3-7(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-10.-13.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Approximately eight years later, on April 25, 1986, the BPU rendered its opinion in <em>Matter of Inter County Refuse Serv., </em>Docket No. 3312-114, <em>(Inter </em>County) where it held that transfers of utility stock to one or more shareholders which result in a change in majority interest require Board approval under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:3-7(a), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:3-10, and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-10.13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">On February 5,1987, appellants filed a petition with the BPU requesting a declaratory ruling that <em>Inter County\u2019s </em>requirement of prior Board approval could not be applied retroactively. Although ambiguously phrased, appellants also sought a ruling that <em>Inter </em>County\u2019s change of policy concerning the need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Board approval could be effectuated only by rule-making consistent with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act <em>{N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-1 <em>et seq.). </em>Because the BPU\u2019s determination in <em>Inter County </em>was pending appeal, appellants\u2019 petition was placed on the inactive list.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">On January 21, 1988, we upheld the BPU\u2019s opinion in <em>Inter County. Matter of Inter County Refuse Serv., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>258 (App.Div.1988), app. dism. 114 <em>N.J. </em>485 (1989). There, we held that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:3-7(a) and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-10.13(a) require prior Board approval as a prerequisite to the transfer of a majority interest in a utility even where the shares \u00e1re distributed to more than one person or entity. 222 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 264. While we found that <em>N.J.A. C. </em>14:3-10.13(a) was consistent with and statutorily authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:3-7, -9 and -10, 222 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 267, we declined to decide whether <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:3-10, standing alone, required Board approval in such a case. 222 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 268. In the course of our opinion, we specifically considered and rejected the proposition that the BPU could not depart from its holding in the <em>Twin County </em>case. 222 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 264. We noted that an administrative interpretation of a statute or rule was entitled to respect, but was \u201cnot binding on us.\u201d 222 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 265. Following our opinion, the Supreme Court granted certification. Ill <em>N.J. </em>618 (1988). However, the appeal was subsequently dismissed at the request of the parties. 114 <em>N.J, </em>485 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">After reinstating appellants\u2019 petition on active status, the BPU rendered its declaratory ruling on May 12, 1988. Citing our opinion in <em>Matter of Inter County Refuse Serv., supra, </em>and a similar unpublished Appellate Division decision, <em>Piccini Sanitation, Inc. v. New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, </em>A-227-86T6 (June 24, 1987), the BPU found \u201cno bar to enforcement of ... statutory and regulatory requirements [of Board approval] pertaining to utility stock transfers.\u201d However, the BPU recognized that \u201cparticular circumstances may present mitigating factors which will temper ... enforcement actions.\u201d Because no specific facts were alleged, the BPU deemed it \u201cinappropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ate to address hypothetical situations\u201d but instead \u201creserve[d] the right to [consider] each case on its own merits as it arises.\u201d On July 13, 1988, the BPU denied appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">It is argued on appeal that the BPU\u2019s decision in <em>Inter County </em>should be applied prospectively, because numerous utilities reasonably relied upon the prior determination in <em>Twin County </em>which, as we have noted, held that prior Board approval was unnecessary with respect to the transfer of a majority interest to more than one person or entity. Citing <em>Rutherford Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Educ., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>8 (1985); <em>Kelly v. Gwinnett, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>538 (1984); <em>Jersey Shore, Etc. v. Estate of Baum, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>137 (1980); <em>Darrow v. Hanover Tp., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>410 (1971) and <em>Oxford Consumer Dis. of N. Phila. v. Stefanelli, </em>104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>512 (App.Div.1969), appellants assert that it would be unreasonable to apply the new interpretation of the statutes and rule announced in <em>Inter County </em>to parties who placed reliance on <em>Twin </em>County\u2019s prior inconsistent view of the need to obtain Board approval. They also claim that retroactive application of <em>Inter County </em>can be effectuated only by administrative rule-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">We find no merit in these contentions. Initially, we point out that the BPU\u2019s determination in <em>Twin County </em>rested solely on its interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:3-10. No reference was made to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:3-7(a), or <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-10.13(a). Whatever doubts one might harbor with respect to the parameters of regulatory jurisdiction conferred by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:3-10, the provisions of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>48:3-7(a), and more importantly certainly those of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-10.13(a), rather clearly say that a transfer of a majority interest to one or more persons or entities requires prior Board approval. <em>See Matter of Inter County Refuse Serv., supra, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 268-269.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Nevertheless, we agree with appellants that the BPU\u2019s determination in <em>Twin County </em>plainly sent the wrong signal to utilities pertaining to whether prior Board approval was neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>sary. If the BPU were to blindly apply its later inconsistent decision in <em>Inter County </em>in blanket fashion to all those who reasonably relied upon <em>Twin County\u2019s </em>erroneous interpretation, thereby causing a major disruption of service and wholesale destruction of the regulated community\u2019s legitimate expectations, judicial intervention of some sort would perhaps be warranted. However, the simple and overriding fact is that the BPU has not in any sense taken that position. While recognizing that it has no right to nullify a legislative policy embodied in a statute or to administratively render nugatory an opinion of this court, the BPU has stated in clear and explicit terms that its enforcement policy will be tempered by whatever mitigating factors are presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Subsequent administrative developments have disclosed that the BPU\u2019s expression that mitigating circumstances will be considered was not an idle gesture. In its recent decision in <em>In the Matter of the Petition of Modern Disposal Service, Inc. for Authority, Nunc Pro Tunc to Transfer Ownership of its Common Stock Upon its Books and Records, </em>Docket No. SM85050574 (BPU December 8, 1988) (Modern Disposal), the BPU stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">In <em>Zajac Disposal </em>(Docket No. SO 87020114), this Board determined that it would decide on a case by case basis whether to temper its enforcement actions based upon mitigating circumstances in cases involving utility stock transfers undertaken without prior Board approval. In this case the petitioner acted in good faith to ascertain the applicable law concerning proposed stock transfers before signing the stock purchase agreement and relied on this Board\u2019s prior decision in <em>Twin County Disposal </em>(Docket No. 782-138) in doing so. Moreover, petitioner filed the petition promptly after realizing that its original understanding of the understanding of the law was inconsistent with this Board\u2019s current policy. Under these circumstances and in the absence of evidence of efforts to avoid Board enforcement such as occurred in <em>Inter County Defuse Service, Inc. </em>(Docket No. 10134-83) <em>aff'd </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>258 (App.Div.1988), or other aggravating circumstances, waiver of penalties would be appropriate. Therefore, the Board HEREBY WAIVES penalties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Against this backdrop, it is clear that the BPU has, and will continue, to consider a party\u2019s reliance on <em>Twin County </em>as a mitigating factor tempering its enforcement policy. Moreover, any uncertainty as to the validity of a prior transfer can easily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>be alleviated by the avenue suggested in the BPU\u2019s decision in <em>Modem Disposal. </em>Specifically, the BPU\u2019s approval can be sought by filing a petition for a transfer <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>In our view, the policy expressed by the BPU in its declaratory ruling, as augmented in its decision in <em>Modem Disposal, </em>represents a fair reconciliation of the competing interests involved. We thus perceive no sound basis for judicial intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Equally without merit is appellants\u2019 argument that the BPU\u2019s enforcement policy can be effectuated only by way of the administrative rule-making process. The operative standards for determining whether rule-making requirements apply to or govern an agency decision or particular agency action were exhaustively reviewed by our Supreme Court in <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313 (1984). More recent decisions by the Supreme Court, <em>see Woodland Private Study Group v. State, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>62, 67 (1987); <em>In the Matter of the Request for Solid Waste Utility Customer Lists, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>508, 517-518 (1987), and by this court, <em>see American Cyanamid v. Dep. Envir. Prot., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>292, 305-306 (App.Div.1989); <em>Board of Education v. Cooperman, </em>209 <em>N.J. Super. </em>174 (App.Div.1986), aff\u2019d 105 <em>N.J. </em>587 (1987); <em>Radiological Society v. N.J. State Dept. of Health, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 558-560 (App.Div.1986), have amplified the appropriate criteria. We thus perceive no need to retread upon ground so recently and thoroughly covered in these cases. Suffice it to say, we can well understand why determinations relating to reasonable reliance and other mitigating factors inherent in the BPU\u2019s enforcement policy can best be considered through the administrative adjudicative process. Administrative agencies must possess the ability to be flexible and responsive to the particular needs of the public and those of the regulated community. <em>Texter v. Human Services Dep\u2019t., </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>376, 385 (1982). This flexibility \u201cincludes the [discretion] to select those procedures most appropriate to enable the agency to implement legislative policy.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>While this discretion is not unlimited, we defer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>to the choice made so long as the selection is responsive to the purpose and function of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Accordingly, the declaratory ruling of the BPU rendered on May 12, 1988 and its subsequent decision denying reconsideration are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-11\"> That section reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">No public utility incorporated under the laws of this State shall sell, nor shall any such public utility make or permit to be made upon its books any transfer of any share or shares of its capital stock, to any other public utility, unless authorized to do so by the board.
