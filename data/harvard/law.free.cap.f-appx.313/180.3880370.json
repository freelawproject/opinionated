Alvarado-Mojica argues that the district court clearly erred by denying \u201csafety-valve\u201d relief, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(9) and 5C1.2(a) (2006), because he provided a complete and truthful statement concerning his involvement in and knowledge of the offense, which he reiterated in his testimony during the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-22\">For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-23\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>the Sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>tencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory. 543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Although the Guidelines are merely advisory, a district court must calculate the advisory sentencing range correctly, and must consider it when determining a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005). <em>Booker </em>does not alter our previously established standards of review of the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s factual determinations and subsequent denial of \u2018safety valve\u2019 relief for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Camacho, </em>261 F.3d 1071, 1073 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997)). The district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1274 (11th Cir.2005). The defendant has the burden of proving his eligibility for relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level reduction in the offense level for certain drug-related crimes if the defendant meets five criteria as set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(9) (2006). The defendant must show: (1) he does not have more than one criminal history point; (2) he did not use violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon during the offense; (3) death or serious bodily injury did not occur to any person as a result of the offense; (4) he was not an \u201corganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense\u201d and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise; and (5) he truthfully provided the government with all information and evidence he has concerning the offense. 18 U.S.C. 3553(f); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a). In addition to a two-level reduction in the offense level, a defendant who meets the above criteria must be sentenced \u201cwithout regard to any statutory minimum sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a). The record supports and the parties do not dispute that Alvarado-Moji-ca meets the first four criteria. The point of contention lies with the fifth factor under \u00a7 5C1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The fifth factor of the \u201csafety-valve\u201d is a \u201ctell-all\u201d provision: \u201cthe defendant has an affirmative responsibility to \u2018truthfully disclose to the government all information and evidence that he has about the offense and all relevant conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>United States v. Yate, </em>176 F.3d 1309, 1310 (11th Cir.1999)). However, it is the responsibility of the district court to determine the truthfulness of the information the defendant provided to the government. <em>United States v. Espinosa, </em>172 F.3d 795, 796 (11th Cir.1999). \u201c[I]t is the offense for which the defendant is convicted that determines the scope of information which the defendant must disclose.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>375 F.3d at 1302. In <em>Cruz, </em>we held that the defendant, who was convicted of a drug-related conspiracy, was obligated to disclose \u201call the information that he possesses about his involvement in the offense, including information relating to the involvement of others and to the chain of the narcotics distribution.\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Here, the record indicates that the offense involved 20 kilograms of cocaine. The record also indicates that Alvarado-Mojica was living, at least part-time, in the same house with a codefendant and had unlimited access to that house. The record further indicates that Alvarado-Mojica knew that he was delivering a container full of drugs to that house, which also was found to contain $45,000 in cash along with drug packaging supplies. Despite his connection to the codefendant, Alvarado-Moji-ca failed to provide the government or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>court with any information about her or her boyfriend, but instead claimed that he did not know the codefendant\u2019s boyfriend and had agreed to deliver the drugs to the house for her boyfriend as a one-time favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">We have indicated that, where an offense involves a large quantity of drugs, it is reasonable to infer that those drugs will be distributed and thus, reasonable to infer that the defendant will have knowledge of additional information concerning the intended distribution of those drugs. <em>See Johnson, </em>375 F.3d at 1302-03. Here, the district court made specific findings that, based on the large quantity of cocaine involved in the offense, Alvarado-Mojica\u2019s residence in and access to the house he shared with a eodefendant, and the fact that a large amount of cash and drug packaging supplies were found inside that house, Alvarado-Mojica\u2019s explanation that he engaged in the offense as a one-time favor was not credible. \u201cWhen a defendant argues that the district court made erroneous findings of fact and as a consequence applied the sentencing guidelines incorrectly, the appellate court shall give due regard to the opportunity of the sentencing court to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and shall accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Glinton, </em>154 F.3d 1245, 1258-59 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation and alteration omitted). Because, in light of the evidence in the record, it was reasonable to infer that Alvarado-Mojica would have knowledge of additional information concerning the distribution of the cocaine and the involvement of the codefendant and her boyfriend, the district court did not clearly err by finding that Alvarado-Mojica failed to provide a complete and truthful disclosure sufficient to qualify for \u201csafety-valve\u201d relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In light of the foregoing, Alvarado-Moji-ca\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
