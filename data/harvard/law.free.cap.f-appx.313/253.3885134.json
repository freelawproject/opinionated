Hernandez appeals his 135-month sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), and 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-26\">On appeal, Hernandez argues for the first time that the government violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), at sentencing by failing to provide him with a law enforcement agent\u2019s prior testimony in which the agent testified that a codefendant, Ricardo Enrique Perlaza, received $500 per box of cocaine. Hernandez contends that the testimony would have impeached other witnesses, who testified at his sentencing hearing that Perlaza received less than $500 per box of cocaine and that Hernandez received compensation for Perlaza\u2019s participation in the conspiracy. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>asserts that the district court erred by-imposing a two-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c), based on a finding that he managed Perlaza, and, thereby, disqualifying him from a safety-valve reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We review a <em>Brady </em>claim not presented to the district court for plain error. <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). To satisfy plain error review, an appellant must show there was an error that was plain that affected the appellant\u2019s substantial rights and affected the fairness and integrity of the proceeding. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In order to establish constitutional error in violation of <em>Brady, </em>a defendant must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">(1) that the Government possessed evidence favorable to the defendant (including impeachment evidence); (2) that the defendant did not possess the evidence nor could he have obtained it himself with any reasonable diligence; (3) that the prosecution suppressed the favorable evidence; and (4) that had the evidence been revealed to the defense, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\"><em>United States v. Newton, </em>44 F.3d 913, 918 (11th Cir.1994). The government is not required to furnish a defendant with exculpatory evidence that is fully available through the exercise of due diligence. <em>Wright v. Hopper, </em>169 F.3d 695, 702 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error in this respect. Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that <em>Brady </em>applies at sentencing and protects a defendant who, like Hernandez, pled guilty, we still conclude that the government did not violate <em>Brady </em>by failing to provide the evidence. First, the statement was not necessarily favorable to Hernandez because Perlaza testified that Hernandez paid him $250 to $500 per parcel of cocaine. Second, there was no evidence that the government suppressed the information, as the sentencing transcript containing the statement was filed with the district court two days before the conclusion of Hernandez\u2019s sentencing hearing. Third, the evidence was not material because the testimony did nothing to indicate that Hernandez did not recruit Perlaza or that he did not organize a relationship in the conspiracy with Perlaza. <em>See Wright, </em>169 F.3d at 702 (finding that where testimony was neither suppressed nor material there was no <em>Brady </em>violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">A district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error; however, the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to its factual findings is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 847 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level if he was \u201can organizer, leader, or supervisor in any criminal activity....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c). \u201c[T]he assertion of control or influence over only one individual is enough to support a \u00a7 3Bl.l(e) enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1251 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, n. 2 (\u201cTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d). Factors to consider in determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the defendant qualifies for the \u00a7 3B 1.1(c) role enhancement include: (1) the exercise of decision making authority; (2) the nature of participation in the commission of the offense; (3) the recruitment of accomplices; (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime; (5) the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense; (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity; and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised of others. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The safety-valve provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 implements 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(1), and allows a court to sentence a defendant without regard to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence if the defendant meets five criteria. <em>United States v. Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2000). To be eligible for a safety-valve reduction, the defendant must show that: (1) he does not have more than one criminal history point; (2) he did not use violence or threats of violence or possess a firearm in connection with offense; (3) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury; (4) he was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of the offense \u201cas determined under the sentencing guidelines\u201d and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise; and (5) he truthfully provided the government all information and evidence about the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1)-(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(1)-(5). The government bears the burden of proving a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement. <em>United States v. Lozano-Hernandez, </em>89 F.3d 785, 791 (11th Cir.1996). However, the defendant bears the burden of proving his eligibility for the safety-valve reduction. <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Here, the record shows that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Hernandez was an organizer-manager in the conspiracy under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), as witnesses testified that Hernandez recruited at least one accomplice and that he was compensated for Perlaza\u2019s participation in the conspiracy. Additionally, the government presented evidence that Hernandez was \u201chigh up in the organization,\u201d not only accepting drug parcels, but also delivering drug proceeds from Orlando to Puerto Rico. With Hernandez\u2019s categorization as a \u00a7 3B 1.1(c) manager, the court did not err in finding that he failed to meet the safety-valve requirements. Accordingly, we affirm Hernandez\u2019s 135-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
