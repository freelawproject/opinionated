In his appeal to the BIA, Quinteros challenged the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of his application for withholding of removal pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), and the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Here, he argues that the BIA erred because he established that if he is deported to El Salvador, he will be persecuted on account of his mem-' bership in a particular social group, former members of the El Salvadoran military who fought against the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), and due to his political opinion opposing the FMLN.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Quinteros does not challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that he was ineligible for asylum and for CAT relief. He has therefore abandoned these issues. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">This court uses the substantial evidence standard that is codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) to review the factual conclusion that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal. <em>Tamara-Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 343, 347 (5th Cir.2006). Quinteros has failed to establish that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude that there is a clear probability that if Quinteros is removed to El Salvador, he will be persecuted on account of his status as a former member of the El Salvadoran military who fought against the FMLN or due to his continued opposition to the FMLN. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1231(b)(3), 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1138-39 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b750-8\"> Pursuant to 5m Cik R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cut R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
