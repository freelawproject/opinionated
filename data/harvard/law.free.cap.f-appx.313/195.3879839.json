The charged conspiracy involved incidents where an indicted co-conspirator, Jerome Flowers, threw two different Molotov cocktails at the houses of two of Hill\u2019s neighbors. First, Hill argues on appeal that sufficient evidence did not support his conviction because the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal was inconsistent with its grant of the same motion by his co-defendant and alleged co-conspirator, William Conner, Jr., on the same conspiracy charge. Second, he contends that he is entitled to a new trial due to the cumulative effect of errors committed by the district court during the trial. Specifically, he argues that the errors included a Bruton<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> error, a possible discovery violation, an improper statement by the court, and improper closing arguments by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">We review the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and accepting all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict. <em>United States v. Klopf, </em>423 F.3d 1228, 1236 (11th Cir.2005). The jury alone may make credibility determinations. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1325 (11th Cir.1997). The jury may choose to accept or reject a witness\u2019s testimony either in whole or in part. <em>See United States v. Habel, </em>613 F.2d 1321, 1324 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">Based on this record, we conclude that sufficient evidence supported Hill\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to make unregistered firearms. Flowers\u2019s testimony was sufficient to prove all the elements of the charged conspiracy, and other evidence at trial confirmed many of the details given by Flowers regarding the Molotov cocktail incidents. Moreover, the district court\u2019s grant of judgment of acquittal to Hill\u2019s co-defendant and alleged co-conspirator Conner does not render the evidence insufficient to support the jury verdict against Hill. The record does not demonstrate that the grant of Conner\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge was inconsistent with Hill\u2019s conviction. Therefore, the district court\u2019s denial of Hill\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">Hill next argues that cumulative errors during the trial mandate a reversal of his conviction. We reject this argument, finding that any errors that may have occurred were harmless in this case. First, any possible <em>Bruton </em>error at trial was harmless because other evidence, outside of the statement made by Hill\u2019s non-testifying co-defendant Conner, indicated Hill\u2019s full participation in the conspiracy. Second, any possible discovery error regarding the mid-trial disclosure of a videotape of Hill\u2019s July 25 statement to police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>also was harmless because it did not affect Hill\u2019s ability to present a defense, the video\u2019s influence on the jury was invited, and no reasonable probability exists that the late disclosure affected the outcome of the trial. Third, the district court did not plainly err in succinctly notifying the jury that it granted Conner\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. Finally, none of the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments constituted plain error because most of the challenged statements properly urged the jury to draw inferences from the evidence and correctly stated the law. To the extent that any of the prosecutor\u2019s statements went beyond the evidence, they did not prejudice Hill\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Accordingly, the district court did not commit any reversible errors during Hill\u2019s trial, and the cumulative effect of any harmless errors did not prejudice Hill\u2019s substantial rights. Therefore, Hill is not entitled to a new trial and we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-11\">. <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
