For the reasons set forth below, we dismiss the petition with respect to Panmesri\u2019s claim for asylum and deny the petition with respect to his claims for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Following the passage of the Real ID Act in 2005, this Court has jurisdiction to review a determination of the timeliness of an asylum application where the decision is based entirely on a constitutional or legal question. <em>Nakimbugwe v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 281, 284 (5th Cir.2007). However, where the timeliness determination is based on an \u201cassessment of facts and circumstances,\u201d it is not reviewable by this Court. <em>Id. </em>at 284 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1. The immigration judge\u2019s rejection of Panmesri\u2019s claim of changed circumstances was based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of his claim, not on a legal or constitutional question. Accordingly, this Court is without jurisdiction to consider Panmesri\u2019s claim that his asylum application should not have been pretermitted as untimely. <em>See Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 595-96 &amp; n. 31 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">On a petition for review of a BIA decision, this court reviews factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Zhu, </em>493 F.3d at 594. Under the substantial evidence standard, a petition for review will not be granted unless this Court decides \u201cnot only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but also that the evidence compels it.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotations and citation omitted). The underlying decision of the IJ is considered only to the extent that it has \u201csome impact upon the BIA\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 348 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-14\">To be eligible for the withholding of removal, an applicant must establish that there is a clear probability that he will be persecuted upon his return to his home country. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004). He must show that \u201cit is more likely than not that [his] life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of either his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The alien must also prove some nexus between the persecution and one of the five enumerated grounds. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-15\">Panmesri\u2019s assertion that he suffered past persecution due to his Esan ethnicity when he was \u201cdenied\u201d employment as an electrician in neighboring Laos by the Thai military is not supported by the record. Moreover, Panmesri did not offer any testimony which established a nexus between the border activity, or the seizure of his property, and his Esan ethnicity. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 482, 112 S.Ct. 812. Panmesri\u2019s assertions also do not compel the conclusion that there existed a nexus between his political activity and the alleged persecution. <em>See id. </em>Although Panmesri testified that he was beaten during a demonstration, his testimony did not reflect that the beating was in response to his political views. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Panmesri also acknowledged that he remained in Thailand for nearly 20 years following his political activities. Further, the incidents of persecution against Pan: mesri\u2019s cousins do not demonstrate past persecution because they do not show a pattern of persecution closely tied to Panmesri. <em>See Qoku v. Gonzales, </em>156 Fed.Appx. 703, 707-08 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">As Panmesri failed to make a showing of past persecution, he was not entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13. Similarly, the Government was not required to show changed circumstances which would allow him to return to Thailand without a fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1)(A). Nor does the Government bear the burden of showing that relocation within Thailand was not reasonable. <em>See Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Panmesri\u2019s argument that he is entitled to relief under the CAT borders on frivolous. A claim under the CAT requires more than a showing of persecution; it imposes \u201cthe higher bar of torture.\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002). Panmesri\u2019s bald assertion that he has experienced mental anguish is far below the required standard for a showing of mental torture. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1), (2), (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">PETITION. DENIED; ASYLUM CLAIM DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b749-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
