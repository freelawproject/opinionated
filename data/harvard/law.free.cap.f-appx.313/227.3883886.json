The decision denied the Kopalis\u2019 motions to reopen their removal proceedings, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-21\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision in this case because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that we review the BIA\u2019s decision; but \u201c[ijnsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And we review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gbaya v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1220 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cIn this particular area, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the BIA\u2019s discretion is quite broad.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted); 8 C.F.E. \u00a7 1008.2(a) (\u201cThe [BIA] has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has made out a prima facie case for relief.\u201d). Our review of a denial of a motion to reopen \u201cis limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the [manner] of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (internal quotation omitted). Motions to reopen generally are disfavored because \u201cevery delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">A party may file only one motion to reopen which \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B). A motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision; but this time limit does not apply if the motion is based on changed circumstances in the country of the movant\u2019s nationality. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), (3)(ii). To meet this exception, a movant must offer material evidence that \u201cwas not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The Kopalis originally filed separate applications for asylum and withholding of removal, claiming persecution based, in part, on their Christian religion. But the Kopalis withdrew these applications, and the IJ granted the Kopalis\u2019 applications for voluntary departure. The Kopal-is filed the instant motions to reopen over three years after the IJ granted their applications for voluntary departure, arguing that ineffective assistance of counsel and changed circumstances in Albania justified the reopening of their removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">The IJ denied the motions and noted that, on their ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the Kopalis had not complied with <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The BIA affirmed, noting that country conditions in Albania\u2014 specifically, the treatment of Christians\u2014 had changed since the Kopalis left in 2001, but that the changes were not significant enough to justify the reopening of their removal proceedings. About their ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the BIA concluded that the Kopalis had not complied with the <em>Lozada </em>requirements and had not shown actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">On appeal, the Kopalis argue that they were prejudiced by their counsel\u2019s failure to request a continuance in their removal proceedings based on Antoneta\u2019s breast cancer diagnosis and that their counsel failed to explain them available options at the removal hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An alien may move to reopen her removal order on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Dakane v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2005). But the BIA has discretion to deny a motion to reopen for ineffective assistance of counsel where the petitioners fail to comply with the procedural requirements of <em>Lozada. See Gbaya, </em>342 F.3d at 1223. Here, both the record and the Kopalis\u2019 own concession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>show that they did not comply with <em>Laza-</em>da; thus, we conclude that the BIA abused no discretion in denying their motions to reopen in this respect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The Kopalis also argue that they will face persecution if returned to Albania based on the change in relations between Christians and Muslims in Albania and that medical facilities in Albania are inadequate for Antoneta\u2019s breast cancer treatment. We conclude that the Kopalis did not justify the reopening of their removal proceedings under the changed country circumstances exception.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The evidence provided by the Kopalis in support of their motions to reopen was either immaterial or previously available during their removal proceedings. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). For example, the character references and medical reports about Antoneta\u2019s condition were not material because they did not show how it would be more likely that the Kopalis would suffer persecution upon returning to Albania.' Also, the Kopalis provided country reports about Albania from before the IJ\u2019s final removal order in June 2003 and several affidavits about events that happened to them before leaving Albania in 2001. And the country reports from after 2003 did not discuss Christian-Muslim relations or the availability of adequate medical care in Albania.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Because the Kopalis\u2019 motions to reopen were not supported by previously unavailable and material evidence about changed circumstances in Albania, the BIA\u2019s denial of the motions was not arbitrary or capricious, or otherwise an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-13\">. The Kopalis are sisters; though they filed separate motions to reopen, they filed a joint petition for review in this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-22\">. In addition, we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>briefs. <em>Lorisme v. INS, </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444 n. 3 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\">. We reject the government's jurisdictional argument that the Kopalis failed to exhaust their administrative remedies on this claim. The Kopalis raised the ineffective assistance of counsel issue in their notices of appeal to the BIA. <em>See Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1229 n. 3 (11th Cir.2008) (the jurisdictional bar only applies if petitioner fails to raise the \"core issue\u201d at the administrative level).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\">. The Kopalis argue that Antoneta\u2019s breast cancer diagnosis is an exceptional circumstance bearing on their ineffective assistance of counsel claim. But the \"exceptional circumstance\u201d standard applies to removal orders that are issued <em>in absentia, </em>which was not die case here. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). Thus, the Kopalis were required to comply with <em>Lozada </em>to obtain reopening of their removal proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b254-22\">. It appears that the BIA took administrative notice that country conditions had changed in Albania and excused the untimeliness of the Kopalis' motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
