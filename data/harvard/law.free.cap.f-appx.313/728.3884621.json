We remanded the case for resentencing. On remand, the district court sentenced Liendo to 48 months of imprisonment and a three-year term of non-reporting supervised release. Liendo now appeals that newly imposed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-16\">Liendo argues that the district court erred by imposing an eight-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Specifically, he argues that, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), his second conviction for simple possession of marijuana under Colorado law does not constitute an \u201caggravated felony\u201d warranting the eight-level increase. As Liendo concedes, his arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335-36 &amp; n. 11 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-17\">Liendo argues that the 48-month sentence imposed by the district court is unreasonable. The district court expressly considered the sentencing factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in selecting the sentence. The district court found this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>sentence appropriate in light of Liendo\u2019s personal and criminal histories, his likelihood of recidivism, the need to promote a respect for the law, and the need to provide a deterrent to future criminal behavior. We note that the district court expressed concern with these same factors at Liendo\u2019s original sentencing hearing. Neither the district court\u2019s variance from the advisory guidelines range nor the extent of the variance constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Liendo maintains that, by analyzing and applying pertinent caselaw and statutes in responding to Liendo\u2019s objections to the presentence report, the probation officer violated Texas law by engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. He asserts that the probation officer\u2019s actions violated his right to due process and undermined the fairness of the sentencing proceeding. The probation officer\u2019s analysis was made during the course of performing the duties assigned to her by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3603, by Fed.R.CrimP. 32, and by the district court. Liendo has not alleged or shown that he was prevented from presenting arguments or testimony in support of his objections to the presen-tence report. Nor has he shown that the district court deviated from the requirements of Rule 32. Liendo has not shown a due process violation or that his sentencing proceeding was unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Liendo challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is, as Liendo concedes, foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. --, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b753-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
