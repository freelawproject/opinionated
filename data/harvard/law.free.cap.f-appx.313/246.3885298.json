(\u201cPerdue\u201d) for failure to prosecute, pursuant to Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. After review, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">On 7 June 2007, W. Carl Reynolds and Katherine L. McArthur of the law firm Reynolds, McArthur &amp; Horne, counsel of record for Calloway, filed a complaint in state court against Perdue alleging that Calloway, an employee of the United States Department of Agriculture, suffered injuries as a result of Perdue\u2019s negligent inspection and maintenance of its poultry processing plant in Perry, Georgia. Rl-1 at 5-7. Perdue answered the complaint on 27 June 2007, and the case was removed on diversity grounds to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia on 11 July 2007. R 1-1 at 1; R 1-2. On 10 August 2007, the parties filed a joint preliminary report and discovery plan, and Perdue served its initial disclosures on Calloway. Rl-9; Rl-10. On 28 August 2007 Perdue served interrogatories and document production requests on Cal-loway. Rl-12. That same day, Bradley J. Survant of Reynolds, Horne <em>&amp; </em>Survant, formerly known as Reynolds, McArthur &amp; Horne, filed a motion to withdraw from representation. Rl-14. He advised the court that Calloway was still represented by McArthur and attached to the motion Calloway\u2019s signed consent. <em>Id. </em>Survant filed an additional motion to withdraw on 28 August 2007 on behalf of Reynolds, Horne &amp; Survant, which also indicated that McArthur continued to represent Cal-loway. Rl-15. The district judge granted the motions on 1 September 2007. Rl-16. On 17 September 2007, the district judge granted Perdue\u2019s motion for change of venue, filed on 28 August 2007, and the case was transferred to the Middle District of Georgia. Rl-13,17.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">On 8 October 2007, defense counsel sent a letter to McArthur inquiring as to the status of Calloway\u2019s initial disclosures and responses to Perdue\u2019s interrogatories and document requests. Rl-23, Exh. A. Mc-Arthur informed defense counsel that she never was retained by Calloway and that Calloway\u2019s employment contract was with Carl Reynolds, P.C. <em>Id., </em>Exh. B. McAr-thur thereafter filed a notice of withdrawal as counsel with the district court on 17 October 2007. Rl-21. She indicated that she no longer was affiliated with Reynolds, McArthur &amp; Horne and that it was her understanding that Carl Reynolds and the law firm of Reynolds, Horne <em>&amp; </em>Survant remained lead counsel in Calloway\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>Upon receiving McArthur\u2019s 17 October 2007 notice of withdrawal, defense counsel faxed a letter to Survant asking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>him to clarify whether his law firm represented Calloway or whether Calloway was proceeding <em>pro se. </em>Rl-23, Exh. C. In response, Survant sent defense counsel a copy of the 1 September 2007 order, issued by the district judge in the Northern District of Georgia, permitting his firm\u2019s withdrawal as counsel in the case. <em>Id., </em>Exh. D.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">On 31 October 2007, defense counsel sent Calloway a letter, along with copies of Perdue\u2019s interrogatories and document requests, asking that Calloway respond to discovery within ten days. <em>Id., </em>Exh. E. After receiving no response, Perdue advised Calloway in a second letter, sent via certified mail on 26 November 2007, that it would seek sanctions if he did not respond by 12 December 2007. <em>Id., </em>Exh. F. Callo-way telephoned defense counsel on 28 November 2007 and informed defense counsel that he was scheduled to undergo hip replacement surgery the next week and was in the process of finding another attorney to represent him. <em>Id. </em>at 4. Defense counsel agreed to an extension of time for responding to discovery and prepared a joint motion to modify the discovery plan and scheduling order, which he sent to Calloway via certified mail. <em>Id. </em>at 4-5, Exh. G. Defense counsel requested that Calloway sign and return the motion, as well as enclosed authorizations allowing defense counsel to obtain Calloway\u2019s medical and employment records. <em>Id., </em>Exh. G. Although Calloway received defense counsel\u2019s correspondence on 30 November 2007, he never signed and returned the joint motion nor did he answer Perdue\u2019s interrogatories and document production requests. <em>Id. </em>at 5, Exh. G at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">On 13 February 2008, Perdue filed the instant motion to dismiss on the grounds that Calloway never responded to discovery and thus failed to prosecute his case diligently. Rl-22, 23. On 15 May 2008, the district judge issued a show cause order, which was served on both Calloway personally and on McArthur as counsel of record, directing Calloway to show cause within twenty days why his claims should not be dismissed. Rl-25 at 1. Although the judge found that McArthur\u2019s notice of withdrawal did not comply with the court\u2019s local rules and that she therefore remained counsel of record, he noted that there was some confusion as to Calloway\u2019s representation and that, as of the date McArthur filed her notice of withdrawal, defense counsel treated Calloway as if he were <em>pro se. Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>McArthur thereafter filed another motion to withdraw, which the district court granted on 19 August 2008. Rl-27, 28. In its order granting McArthur\u2019s motion, the court gave Calloway twenty days to obtain counsel and respond to Perdue\u2019s motion to dismiss. Rl-28. The court warned Calloway that if no response was received within the prescribed time, his case would be dismissed with prejudice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Although Calloway\u2019s current attorney entered an appearance as counsel on 26 August 2008, Calloway never responded to either the show cause order or Perdue\u2019s motion. Rl-29. On 12 September 2008, the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice after finding that Calloway \u201cha[d] done nothing to prosecute his case since November 28, 2007,\u201d even though \u201c[t]he Court ha[d] given him three opportunities to explain his failure to [] go forward with his case, more than sufficient opportunity to deal with any problems caused by the withdrawal of his counsel.\u201d Rl-30 at 2. Calloway filed a motion to reconsider, arguing that the delay was attributable to his attorneys, which the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>trict court denied. Rl-32 at 3; Rl-34. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice under Rule 41(b) for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Goforth v. Owens, </em>766 F.2d 1533, 1535 (11th Cir.1985). Under this standard of review, we will not disturb the district court\u2019s decision unless it amounts to a clear error of judgment. <em>See McMahan v. Toto, </em>256 F.3d 1120, 1128 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Rule 41(b) authorizes the district court, on defendant\u2019s motion, to dismiss an action for failure to prosecute or comply with the rules of the court. Fed.R.Civ.P.41(b); <em>see Goforth, </em>766 F.2d at 1535. We have stated repeatedly that dismissal with prejudice is an \u201cextreme sanction\u201d and \u201cis plainly improper unless and until the district court finds a clear record of delay or willful conduct and that lesser sanctions are inadequate to correct such conduct.\u201d <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V MONADA, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2005). The district court must make findings satisfying both prongs of this standard before dismissal as a sanction under Rule 41(b) is appropriate. <em>See Mingo v. Sugar Cane Growers Co-op. of Fla., </em>864 F.2d 101, 102-03 (11th Cir.1989) (per curiam); <em>see also Betty K Agencies, </em>432 F.3d at 1339 (\u201cWe rigidly require the district courts to make these findings precisely because the sanction of dismissal with prejudice is so unsparing.\u201d (quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted)). With respect to the first prong, we have held that simple negligence is not sufficient to warrant dismissal. <em>See McKelvey v. AT &amp; T Techs., Inc., </em>789 F.2d 1518, 1520 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam). With respect to the second prong, while the district court must consider the appropriateness of lesser sanctions, such consideration need not be explicit. <em>See Betty K Agencies, </em>432 F.3d at 1341; <em>see also Gratton v. Great Am. Commc\u2019ns, </em>178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cDismissal under Rule 41(b) is appropriate where there is ... an implicit or explicit finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">It is apparent from district court\u2019s order that it found a clear pattern of delay, and the record supports this finding. Despite having been given numerous opportunities, Calloway repeatedly failed to submit discovery, respond to Perdue\u2019s motion, or comply with the court\u2019s show cause orders, even though he knew he was not represented by counsel \u2014 as evidenced by the fact that he contacted defense counsel directly, asked for an extension of time, and told defense counsel that he was in the process of seeking representation \u2014 and that the onus was therefore on him to prosecute his case. <em>See Betty K Agencies, </em>432 F.3d at 1338 (noting that \u201cthe harsh sanction of dismissal with prejudice is ... more appropriate in a case where a party, as distinct from counsel, is culpable\u201d). The record thus demonstrates that Callo-way\u2019s non-compliance was willful and not merely the result of mistake or negligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">The record also supports the district court\u2019s implicit finding, based on Cal-loway\u2019s \u201cfailure] to take advantage of [the court\u2019s] generosity\u201d and avail himself of the multiple chances he was given to go forward with his case, that lesser sanctions would not have \u201cspur[red] this litigation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>its just completion.\" <em>Mingo, </em>864 F.2d at 103; R1-30 at 2. In light of the fact that Calloway was warned that his failure to respond to Perdue\u2019s motion would result in dismissal of his complaint with prejudice, yet still refused to pursue his case, the district court\u2019s determination that lesser sanctions would be futile was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Calloway appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint with prejudice. We conclude from the record that the court acted within the bounds of its disere-, tion, particularly given that Calloway was personally responsible for the delays in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-6\">. On 19 June 2008, the district court issued a second, identical show cause order after discovering that the original order never \u25a0 was served upon McArthur. Rl-26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\">. We find no merit to Calloway's contention on appeal that it was not he, \u201cbut the confusion as to who exactly represented [him] that was the cause of the delays.\u201d Appellant's Brief at 10. While the record'indicates that the attorneys were confused as to Calloway's representation, Calloway himself was aware that he was not represented by counsel, and acted in a manner consistent with a litigant proceeding <em>pro se.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
