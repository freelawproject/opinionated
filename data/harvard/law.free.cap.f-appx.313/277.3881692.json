Our recent decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009), is dispositive. Because the district court did not err, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">I.BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In 2005, Amandalo D. Means pleaded guilty to three counts of distributing five or more grams of cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(iii). At sentencing, the district court calculated a base offense level of 32 and then awarded Means a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility for his offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Based on Means\u2019s total offense level of 29 and his criminal history category III designation, the Sentencing Guidelines provided an advisory sentencing range of 108 to 135 months of imprisonment. The district court sentenced Means to 108 months of imprisonment, the low end of the range, for each count, with the sentences to be served concurrently. Means\u2019s direct appeal was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In March 2008, Means filed a motion to reduce his sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendments 706 and 711 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which retroactively reduced the base offense level for certain crack cocaine offenses. Means also sought an additional two-step reduction in his sentence due to the financial hardship of his family. Means argued that the district court had discretion to reduce his sentence below the amended range under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Based on Amendment 706, the district court recalculated Means\u2019s sentencing range as 87 to 108 months of imprisonment and reduced his sentence to 87 months in prison for each count to be served concurrently. The district court denied Means\u2019s request for an additional reduction below the amended range. The court concluded that <em>Booker </em>did not apply to resentencing proceedings under section 3582(c)(2) and it lacked the authority to further reduce Means\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">II.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">\u201c[W]e review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, 305 F.3d </em>1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">III.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">Under section 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce an original sentence following an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines if the reduction complies with policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). According to the policy statements, the district court \u201cshall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) to the guidelines ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced\u201d and then may grant a reduction to the original sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). In reducing a sentence, \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined under\u201d section lB1.10(b)(l) of the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A). Because Means\u2019s amended sentencing range is 87 to 108 months of imprisonment, the policy statement prohibits the district court from reducing Means\u2019s sentence to less than 87 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">Means argues that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), render the Sentencing Guidelines advisory in resentencing proceedings and the district court erred when it concluded that it lacked the authority to grant a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>reduction below the amended Guidelines range. We disagree. Our recent decision in <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009), forecloses this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In <em>Melvin, </em>we ruled that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>apply to original sentencing proceedings and do \u201cnot address motions to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1193-94. The district court correctly concluded that it lacked authority to reduce Means\u2019s sentence below the amended guideline range under section 3582(c)(2). <em>See id. </em>at 1193-94. The applicable policy statement prohibits the district court from reducing Means\u2019s sentence below 87 months, and the refusal of the district court to grant a further reduction was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Means\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
