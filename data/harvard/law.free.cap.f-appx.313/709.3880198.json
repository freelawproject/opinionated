Kelly alleging that Kelly perpetrated a scheme that defrauded investors of $450 million through the sale of \u201cuniversal leases.\u201d One week later, IP Fund 1, Inc. \u2014 a corporation formed by Appellant Ernest Bustos for the purpose of representing investors against and recovering lost investments from Kelly, and of which Bustos is sole shareholder \u2014 sued Kelly in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>the Northern District of Texas. The suit requested the district court to appoint as temporary receiver Resorts Management Group LLC, a corporation also formed by Bustos and of which he is the registered agent, principal, chairman, and secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The SEC sought to intervene. On December 6, 2007 the district court granted the SEC\u2019s motion to intervene, declined IP Fund l\u2019s request to appoint RMG LLC as temporary receiver, and allowed the SEC limited discovery to investigate Bustos\u2019 role in selling universal lease investments, in forming IP Fund 1 and RMG LLC, and in requesting that RMG be appointed as temporary receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">On December 26, 2007 Bustos filed in his own name a \u201cmotion to stay,\u201d seeking to vacate the December 6 order. In a March 7, 2008 order, the district court found that Bustos lacked standing to contest the order because he was not a party to the case and struck his motion. Bustos requested reconsideration and on June 19, 2008 the district court struck Bustos\u2019 motion for reconsideration. Bustos now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The SEC argues and we agree that we lack jurisdiction over Bustos\u2019 appeal. Under 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1291 the orders striking Bustos\u2019 motion to stay and motion for reconsideration were not \u201cfinal.\u201d Bustos may seek to intervene under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24. Bustos may also challenge any discovery directed at him when he is subpoenaed. Bustos argues that we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). But the district court made no finding that \u201can immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation\u201d from which we could exercise our discretion to permit appeal. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b733-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
