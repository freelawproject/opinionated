In his complaint, he alleged that he was strip searched in the presence of female prison employees in violation of his right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-26\">The district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to exhaust is reviewed de novo. <em>Powe v. Ennis, </em>177 F.3d 393, 394 (5th Cir.1999). Exhaustion is mandatory, and since \u00a7 1997e was amended, this court has \u201ctaken a strict approach to the exhaustion requirement.\u201d <em>Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 866 (5th Cir.2003), <em>overruled by implication on other grounds by Jones v. Bock, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Affording Johnson\u2019s argument the requisite liberal construction, the district court did not err in finding that Johnson failed to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). Although \u201cavailable administrative remedies\u201d may be deemed exhausted when \u201cthe time limits for the prison\u2019s response set forth in the prison Grievance Procedures have expired\u201d or when prison officials ignore or interfere with a prisoner\u2019s pursuit of grievance relief, because Johnson never filed a Step 2 grievance complaining of the strip search, he never \u201cpursue[d] the grievance remedy to conclusion\u201d as he is required to do. <em>See Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir.1998), <em>overruled by implication on other grounds by Jones, </em>549 U.S. at 199, 127 S.Ct. 910; <em>Holloway v. Gunnell, </em>685 F.2d 150, 154 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Wright v. Hollingsworth, </em>260 F.3d 357, 358 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Wendell v. Asher, </em>162 F.3d 887, 891 (5th Cir.1998), <em>overruled by implication on other grounds by Jones, </em>549 U.S. at 199, 127 S.Ct. 910. Johnson\u2019s failure to pursue his grievance remedy to conclusion constitutes a failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Wright, </em>260 F.3d at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Johnson argues for the first time on appeal that his case should be reinstated because following the dismissal of his complaint, he filed another Step 1 grievance \u201cin order to comply with the district court\u2019s order to exhaust.\u201d This court does not consider factual allegations and new legal theories raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999); <em>see also Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>185 F.3d 477, 491 n. 26 (5th Cir.1999). The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b756-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
