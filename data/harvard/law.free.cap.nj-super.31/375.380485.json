J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AOu\">Defendants appeal' from a judgment entered by the Chancery Division, on the ground that it is not in conformity with our mandate in this cause. 29 <em>N. J. Super. </em>361 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954), reversing 25 <em>N. J. Super. </em>591 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1953). Certification granted 15 <em>N. J. </em>379 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">The first matter to be considered (though it should be noticed that neither party raises the point) is whether <em>R. R. </em>1:10-6(5) requires us to stay this appeal. That rule clearly did not stay the trial court from entering its judgment on our mandate here; <em>R. R. </em>1 :A-6 and 1:4r-7 set forth the procedure to secure such a stay, and no such stay has been granted. . This appeal has to do merely with the form of the trial court\u2019s judgment and hence does not come within the aim of <em>R. R. </em>1:10-6(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">We find the appeal here unpersuasive, and are of the view that the judgment assailed adequately expresses our con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>elusions. It sufficiently complies with the provisions of <em>R. R. </em>4:67-5 that an injunctive order should be specific in terms and describe in reasonable detail the acts to be restrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Finally, defendants ask us to stay the judgment so as to complete work in progress. To do this is not in our province. Not only has a petition for certification been filed, <em>R. R. </em>1:4-7, but certification has been granted. Application for the stay should be made to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
