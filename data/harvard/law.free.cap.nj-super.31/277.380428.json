J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aav\">This matter comes before us on a reargument of the case reported-in 27 <em>N. J. Super. </em>359 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953). Leave to reargue was granted in <em>Original R. &amp; B. Empire Pickle Works v. G. Arrigoni &amp; C. Societa Per </em>Azioni, 28 <em>N. J. Super. </em>405, 408 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953), certification denied <em>Original R. &amp; R. Pickle Works v. Prodotti Alimentari, G. Arrigoni &amp; G., Societa Per Azioni, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>352 (1954). There are two attachment actions involving these parties, as stated in 28 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>407 and 408. Defendant has entered a general appearance in the later action, and so, for practical purposes, the questions raised here in the earlier action are of no consequence, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>plaintiff is liable for costs and damages on an attachment bond it posted in that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We need deal with bnt one issue, namely, whether the writ of attachment issued in the earlier action was properly quashed. See 27 <em>N. J. Super. </em>359, <em>supra. </em>That in turn raises the question whether the affidavit supporting the writ of attachment was sufficient. Defendant\u2019s argument, in the main, rests on two points. First, it says that this affidavit failed to show a meeting of minds on the contract on which plaintiff\u2019s claim rests. The argument here is that plaintiff made an offer to buy some merchandise from defendant in Italy, attaching a condition to the offer; but defendant, when it accepted the offer, rejected the condition. From the affidavit, however, it appears that after defendant had refused to accept this condition, plaintiff gave instructions from time to time to defendant to make shipments pursuant to the contract. This sufficiently shows that plaintiff had acceded to defendant\u2019s terms. <em>Restatement of Contracts </em>\u00a7 21; 1 <em>Willis ton on Contracts (rev. ed.), </em>\u00a7 90. As stated in the affidavit, defendant complied with those instructions of plaintiff, shipping to plaintiff a large quantity of merchandise, nearly a third of that ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The second point urged is that defendant accepted the plaintiff\u2019s offer upon a condition, namely, \u201cprovided crop.\u201d This condition was met; the crop was sufficient to meet plaintiff\u2019s order. As appears in the affidavit (in two places), defendant\u2019s general manager orally assured plaintiff that \u201cit had on hand\u201d the merchandise \u201crequired to fill the contract.\u201d Besides, defendant\u2019s letter of August 14 is quoted in the affidavit: \u201cWe are of course keeping the quantities you ordered reserved for you.\u201d We dealt with this in 28 A. <em>J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>410.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\"> Buttressing our conclusions upon both these points is the subsequent statement of defendant\u2019s general manager (also set forth in the affidavit) admitting \u201cthat defendant was obligated under its contract with plaintiff\u201d to deliver the remaining two-thirds of the merchandise \u201ccontracted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>for.\u201d The affidavit makes out a <em>prima facie </em>case. Plenary proof is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">We do not, therefore, reach the question whether the trial court erred in refusing to permit additional affidavits to be filed. We may say, however, that the provisions of <em>R. R. </em>4:77-3 with respect to the filing of additional affidavits were designed to get away from a highly technical practice which once obtained. See <em>Corbit v. Corbit, </em>50 <em>N. J. L. </em>363 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1888); <em>McGrew v. </em>Steiner, <em>77 N. J. L. </em>377 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1909); <em>Garrison v. Seckendorff, </em>79 <em>N. J. L. </em>203 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1909), affirmed 80 <em>N. J. L. </em>463 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
