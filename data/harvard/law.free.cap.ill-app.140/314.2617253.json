In the Municipal Court the plaintiff recovered a judgment against the defendant for $59.86, as damages for the breach of an alleged contract for the sale of paper by the defendant to the plaintiff, to reverse which judgment the defendant prosecutes this writ of error. The defendant was a manufacturer of paper at Cheboygan, Michigan, had as its sales agent in Chicago F. K. Moody, and plaintiff was a dealer in paper in Chicago. February 25, 1907, plaintiff sent to Moody, by mail, the following order addressed to defendant:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-5\" pgmap=\"333\">\u2018 \u2018 Gertlemer:\u2014</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\" pgmap=\"333\">Please enter our order as follows:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-7\" pgmap=\"333\">365 reams yellow print paper, per sample attached. 43x56-82.

In the second place, they are not certain when they will be able to get their supplies in sufficient quantities to complete orders which are already entered and should have been filled weeks ago. This condition of affairs developed seriously within the past week, and they request me to notify you to this effect, and give you the following state of facts. If it was possible for them to get it out in time, they would be glad to do so, or if they could name any date when they would get out of their present condition, they would be glad to enter the order.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\" pgmap=\"334\">Very truly yours,</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-6\" pgmap=\"334\">F.

But if the first sentence of the letter, standing alone, could be held an acceptance of assent to the order, the entire letter cannot be so held because of the second sentence. \u201cA mere proposal by one man obviously constitutes no bargain of itself. It must be accepted by another, and this acceptance must be unconditional. If a condition be affixed by the party to whom the offer is made, or any modification or change in the offer he requested, this constitutes in law a rejection of the offer, and a new proposal, equally ineffectual to complete the contract until assented to by the first proposer.\u201d Benjamin on Sales, Sec. 39. Here the offer was to buy \u201cpaper to be in Chicago on or before March 20.\u201d Moody in reply wrote: \u201cIt may be possible to get it here on the date specified, but everything coming in at the present time is taken in turn and will be filled just as quickly as the orders now placed with the mill are out of the way.\u201d The answer changed the time of delivery stated in the offer, and for that reason was not an unconditional acceptance of the offer, and consequently no contract was by such letter and answer effected. Johnson v. Stevenson, 26 Mich. 62.</p> <p id=\"b335-4\" pgmap=\"335\">In the opinion of the majority of the court, the evidence fails to prove that any contract of sale was made between the parties and the judgment will therefore be reversed with a finding of facts and the cause will not be remanded.</p> <p id=\"b335-5\" pgmap=\"335\">Reversed, with finding of facts.</p> <p id=\"b335-6\" pgmap=\"335\">Mr. Justice Smith dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
