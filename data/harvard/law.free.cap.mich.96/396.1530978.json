Fowling, </em>of counsel), for appellants, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-5\">1. The court erred in directing a verdict for the plaintiff on the ground that the decree in the Lafferty case was a bar to the defense in this suit; citing <em>Nims v. Vaughn, </em>40 Mich. 356; <em>Gamble v. East Saginaw, </em>43 Id. 367; <em>Blake v. Hubbard, </em>45 Id. 1.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-7\">2. In the Lafferty case six questions were decided:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-8\">a \u2014 That the statute gives an equitable lien to creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-9\">b \u2014 That the will of the testator gave a testamentary lien to creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-10\">e \u2014 That the filing of a residuary legatee\u2019s bond did not render nugatory the statutory and testamentary liens.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-11\">d \u2014 That the bond of a residuary legatee is merely intended as additional security for creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-12\">e \u2014 That the testator, by the terms of his will, excluded his residuary legatee from taking anything until there should be a residue after the payment of his debts, and, as the debts exceeded the whole value of the estate, there was nothing for the residuary legatee to take.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-13\">f \u2014 That the giving of a residuary legatee\u2019s bond does not close the estate; it merely excuses the executor from returning an inventory, and confers upon him the right to dispose of both the real and personal estate without being licensed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-14\">The Court will notice that all of the above questions bear directly upon the validity of Mrs. Lafferty\u2019s title, while, in the present case, all of the questions raised relate exclusively to the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s title, and none of these questions were decided in the Lafferty case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-15\">3. The plaintiff will undoubtedly claim that the decision in the Lafferty case affirms its title. But this is not so. On page 60 the Court say: \u201c Under the facts disclosed by this record, the complainant\u2019s claim constitutes a cloud upon the title of the purchaser at the administrator\u2019s sale.\u201d This is mere <em>dictum. </em>The Court did not pass upon the validity of plaintiff\u2019s title at all. Besides, it was held in the case of <em>Vroman v. Thompson, </em>51 Mich. 461, that a decree on bill, answer, and evidence, in the absence of a cross-bill, where the bill is filed to set aside cloud on title, and the bill is dismissed, cannot affirm defendant's title.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-17\"><em>G. J. O\u2019Flynn, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Grant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACi0\">The issues in this case are the same as those in <em>Lafferty v. People\u2019s Savings </em>Bank, 76 Mich. 35. The defendants in this case are the grantees of Martha Lafferty, the complainant in that suit, and are therefore her privies. After that case was decided, the plaintiff brought this action of ejectment against the defendants, who were in possession. In the present case each relies upon the same conveyances, the same proceedings, and the same facts as were those in the former suit. The issues and facts will be found fully stated in that opinion, and it is unnecessary to restate them now. That suit was planted upon the theory that Martha Lafferty had a good and valid title to the land in controversy, and that the title claimed by the People\u2019s Savings Bank, obtained under a sale authorized by the probate court, was void, and created a cloud upon her title. The title of the bank was there held valid, and Martha Lafferty\u2019s alleged title was held to constitute a cloud upon the title of the bank. The question is therefore <em>res judicata. </em>It is the well-settled rule that courts will not review former decisions made by the same court in the same cause, and on the same \u2022 facts. <em>Hickox v. Railway Co., </em>94 Mich. 237, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
