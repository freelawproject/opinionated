The arrangement was carried out, except as to the discharge of the mortgage and the settlement of the estate. The receipt was filed in probate court, and no assignment of the claim of the legatee was asked for or taken. The executor, kept the note for nearly two years, and then returned it under cover, and, as executor, commenced a statutory foreclosure of the mortgage, claiming that he was mistaken as to the solvency of the son when the note was given, and had the right to surrender it, and sue on his original obligation to pay the legacy. And in a suit brought by the son to enjoin the foreclosure it is held that the agreement of the executor to discharge the mortgage entered into the consideration for the note, and that he cannot be allowed to revive the mortgage, nor can he use his office as executor to enforce the payment of the note.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-9\">Appeal from Eaton.

Defendant was named, appointed, and qualified as executor. Complainant had, in 1888, paid the funeral expenses and debts, and had erected the monument. \u25a0 Woodworth had a personal claim against the husband of Mrs. Bursons of $457, for which he held Bursons\u2019 notes. He regarded this claim of little value, and considered complainant as solvent. In November, 1888, he made an arrangement with Mrs. Bur-sons by which he was to surrender her husband\u2019s notes, take her receipt in full for the legacy, and take complainant\u2019s note for $400, and look to him for that amount. This arrangement was carried out. Bursons\u2019 notes were surrendered, Mrs. Bursons gave her receipt <em>\u201c </em>in full of the legacy,\u201d and complainant gave his note to Woodworth for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>$400, payable one year after date. The receipt given by Mrs. Bursons was filed in the probate court. No assignment of Mrs. Bursons\u2019 claim was asked for or taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Defendant\u2019s version of the transaction is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">'' <em>Q. </em>Did you at the time agree with Hannah Bursons and her husband to take the note or obligation of Abraham De Coo for $400, in payment of her legacy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, that was the agreement upon which the notes were surrendered. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">\" <em>Q. </em>Soon after your return home, did you see Abram De Coo, Jr., in relation to this matter, state to him the arrangement that you had made with Hannah Bursons and her husband, and request him to give you his note of $400?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, it was, I think, in May. I went down to C-rand Ledge, and I stayed with Abram over night, and I told him there that I had made this arrangement; and he gave me a note, at my request, for $420, in paymen't of this legacy and some other business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Complainant testifies that when he gave the note to defendant the latter \u25a0 agreed to close up the estate and discharge the mortgage. Defendant does not deny this. His testimony is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\"><em>\u201c Q. </em>To refresh your recollection, at the time Mr. De Coo gave you the $400 note, did you not state to him, in the presence of his wife, that everything was fixed up satisfactorily? 'Come up, and we will go to Charlotte and discharge the mortgage?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">\"A. I did not; not in them words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-12\">\" <em>Q. </em>Did you say so in substance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-13\">\"A. I will state what I said: I stated then that we would come out sometime, and straighten the business all up, and I would get my discharge and the discharge of \u25a0the bondsman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-14\">\" <em>Q. </em>And you meant, of course, that that included the discharge of the mortgage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-15\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, of course; all of the business. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-16\"><em>\u2018\u2018Q. </em>Was there anything said, at the time you took the note, that you took it in payment of the legacy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I think there was. Well, nothing in particular said, more than this. Abe and I settled up, and added $20 that he also owed me, and put -it all in one note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>\u201cQ. </em>What was said about your taking that note in payment of the legacy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, we was to meet at Charlotte, and settle up the business. ********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You say this was after he had given you the note?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes. Now, this was not the talk, but it was my supposition, \u2014 that he would come out, and the whole thing, would be settled up, so that I could get my discharge; and that would include the discharge of the mortgage. This I said to Abe; that some time we would go out to Charlotte, and we would settle the whole matter up, so that I could get my discharge. After this note was signed, I went and saw Abe, and wanted him to go to Charlotte and fix this matter up, so that I could get the release of Mr. Hudson, who was on my bond. There was a day set, and on that day I came down here. I came for the purpose of making a final settlement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">He says further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">\"I never asked him to pay the note but once, and that was about six months after it became due. At the time I took the note, I considered him perfectly solvent. If I had known his financial condition, I would not have taken this note. I never expected to get my pay on the Bursons notes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Defendant kept the note for 1 year and 10 months, then returned it under cover, and, as executor, commenced a statutory foreclosure of the mortgage. His theory now is that he was mistaken in regard to complainant\u2019s solvency at the time that the note was given, and that he had. a right to surrender the note, and sue on the original obligation. But the original obligation was due to Mrs. Bur-sons. Complainant was released from that obligation, and assumed another, \u2014 the indebtedness of Bursons. Mrs. Bursons receipted in full for the legacy, Woodworth filed that receipt in the probate court, complainant gave his personal obligation to Woodworth, and both parties agreed that the mortgage should be discharged, the estate closed, and Woodworth\u2019s bondsman released. Complainant owes defendant $400, but, in consideration of his assumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the promise to Woodworth, the latter agreed to discharge the mortgage and close np the estate. The very security which he claims the right of succession to he agreed to discharge, and that agreement entered into the consideration for the note. He cannot now be allowed to revive the mortgage, nor can he be permitted to use his office as executor to enforce payment of an obligation running to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"ADq\">The decree below is reversed, and a decree entered here for complainant, with costs of both courts.</p>\n<judges id=\"b422-5\">Long and Montgomery, JJ., concurred with McGrath, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b422-6\">Grant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajt\">(dissenting). In 1876, complainant purchased from his father certain land, a part of which is involved in this suit. The purchase price was $3,200, and he executed to his father a mortgage for $2,200 to secure the unpaid purchase price. The father died testate, devising to complainant this mortgage, charged with the payment of a legacy of $400 to his daughter, Mrs. Bursons, a sister of complainant, his just debts and funeral expenses, and the erection of a gravestone. Defendant was appointed executor of the will. Defendant commenced a foreclosure of this mortgage by advertisement, and complainant filed the bill in this cause to restrain the foreclosure proceedings, upon the ground that he had paid the debts, funeral expenses, the legacy to his sister, and had erected a suitable gravestone or monument. There were no debts to pay, and it is conceded that complainant paid the funeral expenses and erected the monument; but it is denied that he paid .the legacy to his sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Mrs. Bursons\u2019 husband was indebted to defendant in the sum of $457, borrowed money. It was arranged between complainant, defendant, Mrs. Bursons, and her husband that the $400 bequeathed to Mrs. Bursons. might be applied on the debt due from Mr. Bursons to defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>and that complainant would pay the amount of the legacy to defendant. The arrangement was carried out, and defendant credited Mr. Bursons with the $400, and took a receipt from Mrs. Bursons, acknowledging the receipt of the legacy. The receipt read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\">\u201cReceived of John Woodworth, executor of the estate of Abraham De Ooo, deceased, the sum of $400, being payment in full of my legacy in said will, and as heir at law of said deceased.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Thereupon complainant gave his note to defendant for $420, which included the amount of the legacy, and $20 which complainant owed defendant. The note was due one year from date. Complainant did not pay the note when it became due, whereupon defendant returned the note to him, and commenced the foreclosure proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Complainant has no equities. He has not paid the legacy, \u25a0or any part thereof. The executor paid it for him, and under an agreement with him. He has not come into court with clean hands. He has not complied with the rule-that \u201che who asks equity must do equity.\u201d Under the arrangement, defendant succeeded to the rights of Mrs. Bursons, and had the same right to foreclose the mortgage for the payment of the legacy as he would have had if Mrs. Bursons had received nothing. The note by complainant to defendant was not given and received in payment. The mortgage was not discharged, and complainant was not entitled to a discharge until he himself had paid the legacy. Complainant having failed to pay the note, the defendant had the legal right to return the note, and resort to his rights under the mortgage. Since the note was not received in payment, its only effect was to extend the time of payment. Complainant can relieve his land from the lien of the mortgage by paying the $400, with interest from November 12, 1888, the time when defendant paid it for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The decree should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-8\">Hooker, C.
