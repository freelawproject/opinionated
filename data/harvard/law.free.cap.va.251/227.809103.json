On October 23, 1991, the Fairfax County Department of Human Development (the County) filed a petition in the Fairfax County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court, alleging that Felicia L. Donald \u201cabused and/or neglected\u201d her two minor children. Following an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, the district court, by order entered November 18, 1991, dismissed the petition with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">On December 20, 1991, the County appealed the case to the Circuit Court of Fairfax County for a <em>de novo </em>hearing. Following an extensive trial, the circuit court, by order entered July 8, 1993, ruled that the County\u2019s appeal was untimely and dismissed the petition. By the same order, the circuit court also denied Donald\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees, reasoning that an award of fees was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">Donald appealed the denial of attorney\u2019s fees to the Court of Appeals, and, on August 23, 1994, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals, by memorandum opinion, affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment. The Court of Appeals granted a rehearing <em>en banc </em>and, thereafter, reversed the circuit court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case to the circuit court \u201cfor a determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>reasonable attorney fees to be fixed together with costs.\u201d <em>Donald </em>v. <em>Fairfax County, </em>20 Va. App. 155, 162, 455 S.E.2d 740, 744 (1995). We awarded the County an appeal, having determined that the decision of the Court of Appeals involves matters of significant precedential value. Code \u00a7 17-116.07(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\">The jurisdiction, practice, and procedure of juvenile and domestic relations district courts are wholly statutory and are set forth in Title 16.1, Chapter 11 of the Code (Code \u00a7 16.1-226 <em>et seq.). Walker </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Welfare, </em>223 Va. 557, 562, 290 S.E.2d 887, 890 (1982). An appeal from a district court to a circuit court may be taken within ten days from the entry of a final judgment or order of the district court, Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-132 and -296, and shall be heard <em>de novo </em>in the circuit court, Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-136 and -296. The circuit court, in all such cases on appeal, shall have all the powers and authority granted by Chapter 11 to the district court. Code \u00a7 16.1-296.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">In 1991, the General Assembly specifically addressed district courts\u2019 authority to award attorney\u2019s fees. Acts 1991, c. 534. Code \u00a7 16.1-278.19 provides that, \u201c[i]n any matter properly before the [district] court, the court may award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs on behalf of any party as the court deems appropriate based on the relative financial ability of the parties.\u201d This Code section is the sole authority granted to district courts for awarding attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Circuit courts have those powers and authority that are granted to district courts, but district courts are empowered to award attorney\u2019s fees only in matters \u201cproperly before [them].\u201d We read the statutes to apply the same jurisdictional prerequisite to a circuit court\u2019s authority to award attorney\u2019s fees as applies to a district court\u2019s authority to award fees. A matter may not be properly before a circuit court, and thus ineligible for an award of attorney\u2019s fees, even though it originally was properly before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In the present case, the appeal was not taken within ten days from the district court\u2019s final order; therefore, the circuit court was without jurisdiction, and the matter was not \u201cproperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>before\u201d the circuit court. Thus, the circuit court lacked authority to award attorney\u2019s fees. Consequently, we hold that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the circuit court\u2019s judgment and in remanding the case to the circuit court for an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and enter final judgment in favor of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\"> Donald relies on Code \u00a7 16.1-296 as authority for awarding attorney\u2019s fees. That section states that \u201c[c]osts, taxes and fees on appealed cases shall be assessed only in those cases in which a trial fee could have been assessed in juvenile and domestic relations court and shall be collected in the circuit court.\u201d Donald\u2019s reliance is misplaced because Code \u00a7 16.1-296 does not relate to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\"><em> </em>In view of the decision we reach, we express no opinion with respect to the circuit court\u2019s reliance upon the doctrine of sovereign immunity for its refusal to award attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
