See <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>19 Va. App. 436, 451 S.E.2d 421 (1994). The Court of Appeals, sitting <em>en banc, </em>affirmed without opinion by an equally divided court a judgment entered on January 22, 1992 by the Circuit Court of Prince William County and withdrew an opinion rendered on April 26, 1994 by a panel of the Court of Appeals. See <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>18 Va. App. 254, 443 S.E.2d 428 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"AOY\">The central issue is whether the circuit court erred by allowing testimony in this drug distribution case regarding facts surrounding an arrest of defendant for a drug offense that occurred eight months after the arrest in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"ATW\">The record discloses that defense counsel, during cross-examination of a prosecution witness, both by a statement made in the jury\u2019s presence and by questioning of the witness, voluntarily and with the apparent purpose of improving defendant\u2019s standing before the jury, put in issue defendant\u2019s alleged innocence of other drug transactions to create an impression in defendant\u2019s favor, which the prosecution was justified in rebutting. <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 722, 726-28, 62 S.E.2d 902, 903-04 (1951); <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>149 Va. 447, 451-52, 141 S.E. 118, 120 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>(1928); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>129 Va. 751, 753-54, 105 S.E. 541, 542 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"AWh\">Accordingly, the judgment from which this appeal is taken is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A4O\">Justice Koontz took no part in the consideration of this case. This order shall be certified to the Court of Appeals and to the said circuit court, and shall be published in the Virginia Reports.</p>\n<p id=\"AEn\">[[Image here]]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
