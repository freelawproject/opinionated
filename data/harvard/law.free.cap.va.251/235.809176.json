Parker Enterprises, Inc. (Parker), seeking damages for injuries sustained in a boating accident and allegedly caused by the negligence of a Parker employee. Parker denied that its employee was negligent. Following a jury trial, a verdict was returned in favor of Temple-ton in the amount of $11,000. The trial court denied Parker\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict and entered judgment on the verdict. Parker appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Parker is in the business of renting \u201cjet skis\u201d for short-term use. On July 25, 1993, Templeton rented a jet ski from Parker at Virginia Beach. Thereafter, Templeton and other patrons were transported from the oceanfront to deeper water in a 25-foot boat owned by Parker and operated by its employee, Michael R. Benzel. The boat was equipped with a 200-horsepower, outboard motor, and Parker used the boat to supervise and to assist its patrons while skiing.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">After the boat reached its destination, Templeton began operating the jet ski. While riding it, Templeton lost his balance and fell into the ocean. When Templeton was unable to get back onto the jet ski, Benzel maneuvered the boat toward him in an effort to assist him. While Benzel was rendering assistance, Templeton was injured by the boat\u2019s propeller.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">At trial, Templeton testified that the propeller was rotating when it struck him, implying the engine was in gear. Benzel testified, however, that the boat was drifting and that the boat\u2019s engine was in neutral and not in gear when the boat was close to Templeton.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Templeton offered expert medical testimony of two physicians who had treated him for his injuries. Dr. James O. Carleo, a specialist in emergency medicine, saw Templeton in the emergency room of the Virginia Beach General Hospital shortly after the accident. Dr. Arthur W. Wardell, an orthopedic surgeon, examined Templeton on August 4, 1993. Both doctors described Templeton\u2019s injuries, consisting primarily of four lacerations on Templeton\u2019s left thigh and two lacerations on his right knee. Dr. Wardell described the wounds as a \u201cslice type injury.\u201d Over Parker\u2019s objection, the trial court permitted Dr. Carleo to opine that Templeton\u2019s wounds were caused by \u201ca rotating prop[eller]\u201d and Dr. Wardell to opine that Templeton\u2019s injuries were caused by \u201ca propeller [that was] in motion.\u201d This testimony supported Templeton\u2019s theory that Benzel was negligent in maneuvering the boat close to Templeton while the boat\u2019s engine was in gear.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Parker contends that the trial court erred in permitting Templeton\u2019s doctors to testify that, based on the lacerations they observed on Templeton\u2019s legs, the boat\u2019s propeller was rotating at the time of the accident. Parker asserts that the testimony invaded the province of the jury on the principal issue in the case; that is, whether the boat\u2019s propeller was rotating in gear at the time of the accident. Templeton, on the other hand, contends that the doctors\u2019 opinions were admissible because they assisted the jury in determining whether the propeller was rotating in gear when he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">An expert\u2019s opinion is admissible in evidence if it will assist the fact finder about a matter that is not within the range of common knowledge. <em>Lyle, Siegel </em>v. <em>Tidewater Capital Corp., </em>249 Va. 426, 436, 457 S.E.2d 28, 34 (1995). An expert\u2019s opinion is inadmissible, however, if it relates to matters about which the fact finder is equally as capable as the expert of reaching an intelligent and informed opinion. <em>Kendrick </em>v. <em>Vaz, Inc., </em>244 Va. 380, 384, 421 S.E.2d 447, 449 (1992); <em>Grasty </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>206 Va. 723, 726, 146 S.E.2d 252, 254 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In the present case, it was appropriate for the doctors to testify that Templeton\u2019s wounds were inflicted by a sharp object because evidence about the type of injuries Templeton sustained was relevant and probative. However, the evidence was in sharp conflict about whether the propeller was rotating in gear when Templeton was injured, and the doctors\u2019 opinion that the boat\u2019s propeller was so rotating clearly invaded the province of the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>on this vital issue because the jury was equally as capable as were the doctors of reaching an intelligent and informed opinion and of drawing its own conclusion from the facts and circumstances of the case. Moreover, the testimony was highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">We hold, therefore, that the trial court erred in allowing the doctors to opine whether the propeller was rotating in gear when Templeton was injured. Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b258-6\">JUSTICE KEENAN,</author>\n<p id=\"ADd\">with whom JUSTICE LACY joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">I dissent and would affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment. The testimony of Dr. Wardell and Dr. Carleo was not within the range of common knowledge, did not invade the province of the jury, and was admissible .evidence under Code \u00a7 8.01-401.3(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Expert testimony is admissible if it will aid the trier of fact in understanding a subject that is outside the scope of common knowledge. <em>Lyle, </em>Siegel, 249 Va. at 436, 457 S.E.2d at 34. Such testimony may be used to assist the fact finder in understanding the evidence or in determining a fact in issue. Code \u00a7 8.01-401.3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Here, Dr. Wardell testified that Templeton\u2019s injuries were \u201cslice type\u201d injuries. Dr. Carleo testified that the wounds on Templeton\u2019s knee were parallel, narrow, clean, and deep. He stated that the wounds had an \u201carcus\u201d shape, consisting of initially shallow cuts, then deeper cuts, followed by more shallow cuts. Both physicians testified that, due to the spacing and nature of lacerations on Templeton\u2019s legs, the wounds were caused by a moving propeller. In addition to their examination of Templeton\u2019s wounds, these physicians based their conclusions on their previous experience in treating lacerations, including some lacerations caused by propellers. This testimony falls outside the range of common knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">These expert opinions were admissible under Code \u00a78.01-401.3(B), which provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[n]o expert . . . witness while testifying in a civil proceeding shall be prohibited from expressing an otherwise admissible opinion or conclusion as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>to a matter of fact solely because that fact is the ultimate issue or critical to the resolution of the case.\u201d Thus, although the question whether the propeller was in motion and the engine was in gear was the ultimate factual issue to be decided in this negligence action, the physicians\u2019 testimony that Templeton\u2019s wounds were caused by a moving propeller was admissible under this provision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
