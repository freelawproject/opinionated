All lots in the subdivision are subject to restrictive covenants that were recorded on June 10, 1975. One of those covenants provides that an owner of real property in the subdivision may not \u201coccupy or use his Lot . . . for any purpose other than as a private single-family residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The Virginia Society for Mentally Retarded Children, Inc. (the Society) purchased a vacant lot in the subdivision and executed a contract to purchase another lot with an existing house in the subdivision. The Society intends to use the existing house as a group home for six unrelated mentally retarded young adults, with a paid employee staff of two with one or more present at all times. The Society plans to construct a house on the vacant lot and use it for the same purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Sussex filed a bill of complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the Society\u2019s proposed use of the two lots violated the restrictive covenant limiting the use of lots in the subdivision to single-family dwellings. The Society responded that the restrictive covenant was subject to Code \u00a7 36-96.6(C) which provides that group homes such as those proposed by the Society are considered \u201cresidential occupancy by a single family\u201d when construing a restrictive covenant limiting occupancy to members of a single family. Following a hearing and argument of counsel, the trial court concluded that Code \u00a7 36-96.6(C) applied to the restrictive covenant and entered an order holding that the covenant could not be enforced against the Society. We awarded Sussex an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In its appeal, Sussex asserts that the current version of Code \u00a7 36-96.6(C), as amended in 1991, cannot be applied to covenants recorded in 1975. Sussex bases its position on the principle that statutes are generally presumed to be prospective in their application unless the General Assembly has manifested its clear intent to apply the statute retroactively. <em>Gloucester Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Guthrie, </em>182 Va. 869, 875, 30 S.E.2d 686, 688-89 (1944). In this case, Sussex asserts, there is no manifestation of such a legislative intent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>We begin our analysis of the issue presented by Sussex with an examination of the express language of Code \u00a7 36-96.6(C):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">A family care home, foster home, or group home in which physically handicapped, mentally ill, mentally retarded, or developmentally disabled persons reside, with one or more resident counselors or other staff persons, shall be considered for all purposes residential occupancy by a single family when construing any restrictive covenant which purports to restrict occupancy or ownership of real or leasehold property to members of a single family or to residential use or structure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The language of the section makes it applicable to \u201cany restrictive covenant\u201d restricting occupancy to members of a single family. Therefore, construction of the word \u201cany,\u201d added by the 1991 amendment, is pivotal in determining the intended application of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The word \u201cany,\u201d like other unrestrictive modifiers such as \u201can\u201d and \u201call,\u201d is generally considered to apply without limitation. We have held that the phrase \u201cany action\u201d includes actions filed both before and after the passage of the statute in which the phrase was used. <em>Town of Danville </em>v. Pace, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 1, 4 (1874). We have said that a provision including the phrase \u201call condominiums\u201d was consistent with an intent that the provision applies to all condominiums existing at the time the legislation was enacted. <em>Harbour Gate Owners\u2019 Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Berg, </em>232 Va. 98, 103, 348 S.E.2d 252, 255 (1986). Similarly in the context of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-100 through -1310, we have held that the phrase \u201can award\u201d is all-inclusive, applying to awards made both before and after statutory amendment. <em>Buenson Div. v. McCauley, </em>221 Va. 430, 433, 270 S.E.2d 734, 736 (1980); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Mottley Constr. Co., </em>160 Va. 875, 889-90, 170 S.E. 412, 417 (1933). In <em>Allen, </em>we noted that in order to apply the statute prospectively only, it would be necessary to judicially amend the statute, \u201csupply[ing] words not found in the statute,\u201d so that the phrase would read <em>\u201cany </em>award <em>hereafter made.\u201d </em>160 Va. at 889, 170 S.E. at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The analysis used in <em>Allen </em>has continued to be a \u201c \u2018decisive\u2019 example of a situation where retrospective intent is expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>in legislative language.\u201d <em>Buenson Div. v. McCauley, </em>221 Va. at 435, 270 S.E.2d at 737 (citing <em>Duffy </em>v. <em>Hartsock, </em>187 Va. 406, 417-19, 46 S.E.2d 570, 575-76 (1948)). Our conclusion in <em>Allen, </em>that nothing in the phrase \u201can award\u201d \u201cconfines its operations to either past or future awards, but both are included,\u201d 160 Va. at 890, 170 S.E. at 417, is equally applicable to the phrase \u201cany covenant\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 36-96.6(C). The plain meaning of the phrase \u201cany covenant\u201d encompasses all covenants of the type described in the statute without limitation, whether recorded before or after 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The conclusion we reach with regard to the meaning of the plain language of the statute is reinforced by its legislative history. As originally enacted in 1986, subsection C specifically applied only to restrictive covenants executed after July 1, 1986.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1989, the General Assembly established a joint subcommittee to study site selection issues relating to residential facilities for the mentally disabled. In its 1990 report, the joint subcommittee identified restrictive covenants as a barrier to securing housing for mentally disabled persons. <em>Report of the Joint Subcommittee Studying Site Selection of Residential Facilities For Mentally Disabled To The Governor and General Assembly of Virginia, </em>Senate Document No. 36, at 3 (1990). Because Code \u00a7 36-96.6(C) as it then existed did not apply to pre-July 1, 1986 covenants, the committee concluded that a segment of the available housing was excluded from consideration for group home residential facilities. <em>Id. </em>The joint subcommittee recommended that subsection C be repealed \u201cbecause it appears to passively encourage discrimination and does not apply to covenants executed prior to July 1, 1986.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In 1991, the General Assembly deleted language restricting the application of the section to restrictive covenants executed after July 1, 1986 and added the word \u201cany.\u201d These amendments manifest a clear intent of the General Assembly to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>apply subsection C to restrictive covenants recorded both before and after July 1, 1986. To conclude otherwise and find that current subsection C applies only to post-1986 restrictive covenants, as Sussex argues, would render the 1991 amendments to the subsection meaningless. That result would be contrary to the principle that statutory amendments are presumed purposeful and not unnecessary or vain. <em>Cape Henry Towers, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Gypsum Co., </em>229 Va. 596, 600, 331 S.E.2d 476, 479 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\">It is true, as Sussex points out, that the General Assembly often uses the phrase \u201cheretofore or hereafter\u201d to indicate that a statute is to be applied both prospectively and retrospectively. Indeed that phrase is used in subsection A of Code \u00a7 36-96.6. As demonstrated in the cases discussed above, however, we have never imposed a requirement that any specific word or phrase be used in order to support a finding of clear legislative intent of retroactive application. <em>See Hagen v. Hagen, </em>205 Va. 791, 796, 139 S.E.2d 821, 824 (1965). The failure of the General Assembly to include this specific phrase in subsection C does not override the unambiguous meaning of the word \u201cany\u201d as used in the subsection and the clear import of the 1991 amendments to the subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\"> In oral argument Sussex specifically stated that it is not challenging the ability of the General Assembly to apply Code \u00a7 36-96.6(C) retroactively, and that issue is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\"> Code \u00a7 36-91(c), the predecessor to Code \u00a7 36-96.6(C), provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcU\">Notwithstanding any restrictive covenant executed after July 1, 1986, which restricts occupancy or ownership of real or leasehold property to members of a single family or to residential use or structure, a family care home, foster home or group home in which no more than six physically handicapped, mentally ill, mentally retarded or developmentally disabled persons reside, with one or more resident counselors or other staff persons, shall be considered for all purposes residential occupancy by a single family.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b265-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE CARRICO,</author>\n<p id=\"AVO\">with whom JUSTICE COMPTON and JUSTICE STEPHENSON join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">I must concede that, in a previous case, this court has given the word \u201cany\u201d the retrospective effect the majority opinion gives it in today\u2019s decision. But it does not follow that the word should always be given such effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">As the Society points out on brief, this is the issue in the present case: \u201cDid the General Assembly intend that section 36-96.6 [C] apply to all restrictive covenants, or only to those executed after its passage?\u201d We ascertain legislative intent from the language actually used, considering not only each word that is employed but also how it is utilized in the context of the whole statutory enactment. When the word \u201cany\u201d is considered in this context, it becomes clear, in my opinion, that the General Assem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>bly did not intend that \u201cany\u201d should have the retrospective effect the majority gives it today.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The word \u201cany\u201d is used not once but twice in \u00a7 36-96.6. It appears in both subsections A and C. Subsection A reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\"><em>Any </em>restrictive covenant purporting to restrict occupancy or ownership of property on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, elderliness, familial status, or handicap, whether <em>heretofore or hereafter </em>included in an instrument affecting the title to real or leasehold property, is declared to be void and contrary to the public policy of this Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">Subsection C reads as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">A family care home, foster home, or group home in which physically handicapped, mentally ill, mentally retarded, or developmentally disabled persons reside, with one or more resident counselors or other staff persons, shall be considered for all purposes residential occupancy by a single family when construing <em>any </em>restrictive covenant which purports to restrict occupancy or ownership of real or leasehold property to members of a single family or to residential use or structure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">If, in the enactment of \u00a7 36-96.6, it was intended that the word \u201cany,\u201d standing alone, should have retrospective effect, the General Assembly need only have used that discrete word at the beginning of subsection A. Yet, the General Assembly found it necessary to state expressly that the provisions of the subsection would apply to \u201c[a]ny restrictive covenant . . . <em>heretofore or hereafter </em>included in an instrument affecting the title to real or leasehold property.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">It is obvious to me the General Assembly did not intend that the word \u201cany,\u201d standing alone in subsection A, should have retrospective effect. It strains credulity, therefore, after its careful use of \u201cheretofore or hereafter\u201d in subsection A, to say the General Assembly intended by its mere use of the word \u201cany\u201d in subsection C, that the provisions of subsection C should also be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>retrospective effect. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter final judgment here in favor of Sussex.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
