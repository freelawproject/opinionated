The question arises in the context of the following factual and procedural scenarios:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\"><em>Stenrich </em>v. <em>Jemmott</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">On August 1, 1989, Claudia H. Jemmott (Jemmott) began working for The Stenrich Group, Inc. (Stenrich), a Richmond advertising concern, as a copy editor/proofreader, later becoming a senior copy editor/proofreader. She spent between five and six hours of each workday using a pen and a \u201cslant board\u201d in the performance of her duties, with her hands moving repetitively \u201cback and forth and downward\u201d as she read and corrected written material.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">On March 13, 1992, Jemmott experienced \u201can intense burning sensation\u201d in her right hand. Thereafter, she tended to rely more upon her left hand, but it also began to cause her discomfort. In August 1992, she came under the care of Dr. Bruce M. Stelmack. He diagnosed her as suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands, which he attributed to the repetitive motions involved in her work. These motions, the doctor stated in a deposition submitted to the Commission, caused Jemmott \u201cmicro trauma,\u201d meaning \u201ca small amount of injury in a repetitive motion to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>same area . . . occur [ring] in patients [who] flex their wrist and impinge the nerve as it courses through the carpal tunnel.\u201d The doctor opined that carpal tunnel syndrome is \u201ca disease process\u201d as distinguished from \u201ca simple injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Deputy Commissioner Lee entered an award of compensation in favor of Jemmott. Affirming the award, the full Commission wrote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">Dr. Stelmack testified convincingly that [Jemmott] has a disease, which he distinguishes from an injury. Dr. Stelmack stated that repetitive use of [Jemmott\u2019s] hands resulted in repetitive trauma but he also stated that this repetitive use resulted in a disease process. We find, therefore, that [Jemmott\u2019s] carpal tunnel syndrome is a disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-6\"><em>Perdue Farms </em>v. <em>Martin</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">On June 12, 1990, Linda Kay Martin (Martin) began working for Perdue Farms, Inc. (Perdue) as a sanitation worker at its chicken processing plant in Bridgewater. For approximately <em>5Vi </em>hours each day, Martin used a high-pressure water gun to clean production machinery. She operated the gun by pulling a trigger with all the fingers of one hand at the same time. She used her right hand until it began to trouble her, then switched to the left. Eventually, she also experienced trouble with her left hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">In October 1992, the plant nurse arranged an appointment for Martin with Dr. G. Edward Chappell, Jr., an orthopedic surgeon. On October 19, 1992, the doctor diagnosed Martin as suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands, a consequence, he stated, of \u201cdoing repetitive work on the poultry line at Perdue.\u201d In his final report, the doctor opined that Martin\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome \u201cis a disease caused by her employment at Perdue \u2014 specifically on a poultry line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Deputy Commissioner Herring held that Martin had \u201cfailed to meet her burden of proof that she suffers from a disease\u201d and that \u201cno award shall enter.\u201d The full Commission reversed and awarded compensation to Martin, holding that Dr. Chappell had \u201cidentified her condition as a disease\u201d and that the Commission had \u201cconsistently held that a disease caused by repetitive motion or trauma is compensable as an occupational disease when supported, as here, by the medical record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>Wampler-Longacre </em>v. <em>Biller</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Shirley A. Biller (Biller) began working for Wampler-Longacre Chicken, Inc. (Wampler-Longacre) on February 3, 1993, in the \u201cRehang\u201d department of its processing plant in Broadway. Her job required her to use both hands to take chickens from a rotating belt and place them on \u201cshackles\u201d above her. In this process, her thumbs were \u201cin an upward position.\u201d On average, she handled between 25 and 30 birds each minute during an eight-hour shift, with two one-half hour breaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">On November 29, 1993, Biller reported to Dr. Galen G. Craun, Jr., a Harrisonburg physician, who found that her thumbs were \u201clocked in extension.\u201d The doctor told Biller she had \u201ctrigger thumbs,\u201d and he diagnosed her as suffering from tenosynovitis. He testified in a deposition submitted to the Commission that while there \u00e1re a number of causes of \u201ctrigger thumb,\u201d he was of opinion that Biller\u2019s tenosynovitis was \u201cthe accumulation or the product of many repetitious minor injuries to a joint, in the case here of the thumbs.\u201d The doctor also said that he considered \u201ctrigger thumb a disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Deputy Commissioner Herring held that Biller had \u201cfailed to meet her burden of proof that she suffers from a compensable disease\u201d and that \u201cno award shall issue.\u201d The full Commission reversed, pointing out that subsequent to the time the deputy commissioner decided the matter, the Commission had held in another case that \u201c \u2018cumulative trauma which causes or results in a disease <em>may </em>be compensable.\u2019 \u201d The Commission awarded compensation to Biller, citing Dr. Craun\u2019s opinion that Biller\u2019s \u201ctrigger thumb\u201d was a disease and that it was \u201ccaused by work repetition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In an unpublished opinion issued in each case, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Commission\u2019s action, holding that the impairment suffered by the particular employee constituted an occupational disease. Finding that the cases involve matters of significant precedential value, Code \u00a7 17-116.07(A)(2) and (B), we awarded appeals to Stenrich, Perdue, and Wampler-Longacre.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">In reviewing the cases, the Court of Appeals treated as findings of fact the Commission\u2019s holdings that the impairments suffered by the three employees were diseases within the contemplation of the Act. The court then undertook a limited appellate review, inquiring only whether the findings were supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>credible evidence. Finding there was such support, the Court of Appeals upheld the Commission\u2019s awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">We disagree with the Court of Appeals. Admittedly, an award of the Commission is \u201cconclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A); <em>see City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Braxton, </em>230 Va. 161, 163, 335 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1985). However, we think the issue whether a worker has suffered an impairment that constitutes a compensable disease is a mixed question of law and fact and, hence, a Commission finding on the question is not conclusive and binding upon this Court but is properly subject to judicial review. <em>See Braxton, </em>230 Va. at 163-64, 335 S.E.2d at 261 (mixed question of law and fact, properly reviewable, whether injury arose out of and in the course of employment); <em>see also Nichols </em>v. <em>VVKR, Inc., </em>241 Va. 516, 519, 403 S.E.2d 698, 700 (1991) (mixed question of law and fact whether worker\u2019s actions constituted part of owner\u2019s trade, business, or occupation); <em>VEPCO v. Kremposky, </em>227 Va. 265, 270, 315 S.E.2d 231, 234 (1984) (mixed question of law and fact whether safety rule strictly enforced); <em>Derby </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>188 Va. 336, 344, 49 S.E.2d 417, 421 (1948) (mixed question of law and fact whether worker suffered an accident).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Here, the factual part of the mixed question is whether the three claimants involved have suffered impairments, and there can be no doubt that they have; the evidence conclusively establishes that Jemmott and Martin suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome and that Biller suffers from \u201ctrigger thumbs.\u201d The legal part of the mixed question is whether these impairments, which all parties agree were gradually incurred, constitute diseases within the contemplation of the Act. In resolving this part of the question, the crucial inquiry is whether the Commission correctly applied the law to the established facts. <em>See Cinnamon v. International Business Machs. Corp., </em>238 Va. 471, 474, 384 S.E.2d 618, 619 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">As first enacted in 1918, what is now the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provided compensation only for injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment. Compensation for disease \u201cin any form\u201d was excluded except \u201cwhere it results naturally and unavoidably from the accident.\u201d Acts 1918, c. 400, \u00a7 2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">We first dealt with the question of a gradually incurred injury in <em>Aistrop v. Blue Diamond Coal Co., </em>181 Va. 287, 24 S.E.2d 546 (1943). In <em>Aistrop, </em>we said that \u201c \u2018injury of gradual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>growth, . . . caused by the cumulative effect of many acts done or many exposures to conditions prevalent in the work, no one of which can be identified as the cause of the harm, is definitely excluded from compensation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293, 24 S.E.2d at 548 (quoting Francis H. Bohlen, <em>A Problem in the Drafting of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts, </em>25 Harv. L. Rev. 328, 343 (1912)).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The year after our decision in <em>Aistrop, </em>the General Assembly added \u201ca carefully limited coverage for occupational diseases.\u201d <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. 578, 584, 385 S.E.2d 858, 862 (1989); Acts 1944, c. 77, \u00a7 2-f. Present Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-101 and -400 reflect the additional coverage provided by the 1944 legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00a7 65.2-101. Definitions.\u2014 As used in this title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">\u201cInjury\u201d means only injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment or occupational disease as defined in [\u00a7\u00a7 65.2-400 to -407] of this title and does not include a disease in any form, except when it results naturally and unavoidably from either of the foregoing causes.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">\u00a7 65.2-400. \u201cOccupational Disease\u201d defined.\u2014 A. As used in this title, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term \u201coccupational disease\u201d means a disease arising out of and in the course of employment, but not an ordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">B. A disease shall be deemed to arise out of the employment only if there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">1. A direct causal connection between the conditions under which work is performed and the occupational disease;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>2.

It can be fairly traced to the employment as the proximate cause;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">4. It is neither a disease to which an employee may have had substantial exposure outside of the employment, nor any condition of the neck, back or spinal column;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">5. It is incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of employer and employee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">6. It had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and flowed from that source as a natural consequence, though it need not have been foreseen or expected before its contraction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Despite our holding in <em>Aistrop </em>that gradually incurred injuries are not compensable and notwithstanding the coverage added in 1944 for occupational diseases, claims coming before this Court for gradually incurred impairments continued for many years to be asserted only upon the injury-by-accident basis for compensation. Then, in <em>Holly Farms </em>v. <em>Yancey, </em>228 Va. 337, 321 S.E.2d 298 (1984), we were presented the question \u201cwhether a lumbosacral strain of gradual development is an occupational disease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 321 S.E.2d at 299. Reversing an award of compensation in favor of the claimant based upon a finding by the Commission that the claimant suffered from an occupational disease, we noted that this Court consistently had held that a back strain is an injury, not a disease. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 321 S.E.2d at 300. Yet, we said, the claimant \u201curges us to adopt a broad definition of disease which would encompass virtually anything that goes wrong with the body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Noting that compensation is allowed \u201cwhere there has either been an accidental injury or an occupational disease,\u201d <em>id., </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">A definition of either \u201cinjury\u201d or \u201cdisease\u201d that is so broad as to encompass any bodily ailment of whatever origin is too broad because it would make unnecessary and meaningless the two categories specifically set forth in the Act. For more than 50 years, back pains such as those complained of by [the claimant] have been treated in our cases as injuries, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>as diseases. If this distinction is to be done away with, the legislature must do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">228 Va. at 340-41, 321 S.E.2d at 300.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\"><em>Holly Farms </em>was followed by <em>Western Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Gilliam, </em>229 Va. 245, 329 S.E.2d 13 (1985). There, the claimant was diagnosed by her physician as suffering from tenosynovitis in both hands, \u201c \u2018due to an overuse type of syndrome . . . related to the repetitive motions involved in her job.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246, 329 S.E.2d at 14. The Commission awarded the claimant compensation for an occupational disease. While accepting the Commission\u2019s finding that tenosynovitis is a disease, this Court reversed, holding that the claimant suffered from an ordinary disease of life that did not fall within one of the two exceptions then contained in Code \u00a7 65.1-46 (now part of \u00a7 65.2-401) and, hence, was not compensable. <em>Id. </em>at 247, 329 S.E.2d at 14.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">We also said in <em>Western Electric </em>that our decision was based, \u201cas it was in <em>Holly Farms, </em>upon our interpretation of legislative intent as reflected in the totality of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act <em>as it exists today.\" Id. </em>We then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">Some contend that any disability arising out of and during the course of employment, <em>including disabilities resulting from both injuries and diseases caused gradually by repeated trauma, </em>should be made compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. But such a consequential decision, impacting as it must a broad spectrum of economic and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>social values, is a matter of public policy reserved to the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the General Assembly, and we will not trespass upon its domain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 247-48, 329 S.E.2d at 14-15 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">We next considered a gradually incurred impairment in <em>Merillat Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>246 Va. 429, 436 S.E.2d 600 (1993). There, the Commission awarded the claimant compensation based upon a finding of occupational disease for a torn rotator cuff muscle caused by repetitive overhead lifting and manipulation of the left arm. The Court of Appeals upheld the award. <em>Merillat Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>15 Va. App. 44, 53, 421 S.E.2d 867, 872 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals and entering final judgment for the employer, we said that Code \u00a7 65.1-46 (now \u00a7 65.2-400), relating to occupational diseases, \u201crequires that the condition for which compensation is sought as an occupational disease must first qualify as a disease.\u201d 246 Va. at 432, 436 S.E.2d at 601. However, we said, neither the Commission nor the Court of Appeals determined whether the claimant\u2019s rotator cuff tear was a disease but, rather, found the tear compensable as an occupational disease because there was a causal connection between the tear and the work place by applying the six factors listed in Code \u00a7 65.1-46 (now \u00a7 65.2-400). This causality analysis, standing alone, we stated, does not comply with the requirements of the Act for determining compensability of an impairment and, furthermore, would permit the allowance of compensation for <em>any </em>ailment as an occupational disease \u201cas long as it is shown to be causally connected to the work place by meeting the six factors set out in \u00a7 65.1-46 [now \u00a7 65.2-400].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">As we had done in previous cases, we pointed out that the categories of compensable impairments created by the legislature \u2014 accidental injury and occupational disease \u2014 \u201care separate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>meaningful categories.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 421 S.E.2d at 602. We repeated the <em>Holly Farms </em>admonition that a definition of either injury or disease that is so broad that it would encompass <em>any </em>bodily ailment of whatever origin \u201c \u2018is too broad because it would make unnecessary and meaningless the two categories specifically set forth in the Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>And we reasserted our position that \u201c *[i]f this distinction is to be done away with, the legislature must do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Finally, we noted that \u201c[t]he General Assembly still has not altered the categories of injuries and diseases nor has it substituted a single test of causality,\u201d and we stated that \u201c[w]e again decline to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, because the claimant had failed to first qualify her impairment as a disease, we held that the rotator cuff tear suffered by the claimant \u201cmust be classified as an injury, not a disease.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">On the same day we decided <em>Merillat, </em>we also decided, by an order published at 438 S.E.2d 768, the case of <em>TAD Technical Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Fletcher. </em>In our order, we said that for the reasons stated in Merillat, \u201cthe Court of Appeals erred in holding that a torn rotator cuff muscle is compensable as an occupational disease,\u201d and we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals and entered final judgment in favor of the employer. <em>Id. </em>at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">We thought we had made it plain in <em>Holly Farms </em>and <em>Merillat </em>that any definition of the words \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201cdisease\u201d that is so broad as to encompass any bodily ailment of whatever origin is too broad. Yet, hardly had the ink dried on the <em>Merillat </em>opinion before the Court of Appeals decided <em>Piedmont Manufacturing Co. v. East, </em>17 Va. App. 499, 438 S.E.2d 769 (1993). There, the claimant suffered from tenosynovitis, causing severe pain in her left hand. Her work involved the repetitive use of her left hand to inspect and handle small components. Claimant sought compensation for an occupational disease. Her doctor described her condition as \u201c \u2018secondary to overuse syndrome or repetitive trauma syndrome.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502, 438 S.E.2d at 771. The Commission awarded the claimant compensation for an occupational disease, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. In deciding that the claimant suffered from an occupational disease, the Court of Appeals adopted the following definition of the word \u201cdisease,\u201d taken from <em>The Sloane-Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary </em>209 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>[A]ny deviation from or interruption of the normal structure or function of any part, organ, or system (or combination thereof) of the body that is manifested by a characteristic set of symptoms and signs whose etiology, pathology, and prognosis may be known or unknown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">17 Va. App. at 503, 438 S.E.2d at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In each of the present cases, the Court of Appeals held that because the physician stated the particular impairment involved was a \u201cdisease,\u201d the statement satisfied the definition of \u201cdisease\u201d enunciated in <em>Piedmont. </em>But just because a doctor opines that a particular impairment is a disease does not necessarily make it so. As indicated earlier in this opinion, whether a claimant suffers from a disease within the contemplation of the Act is a mixed question of law and fact, and whether a proper definition has been used to test the authenticity of a doctor\u2019s opinion is strictly a legal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Clearly, the <em>Piedmont </em>definition \u201cis contrary to the mandate of Merillat,\u201d <em>Perdue Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>McCutchan, </em>21 Va. App. 65, 77, 461 S.E.2d 431, 437 (1995) (Koontz, J., dissenting), because it \u201c \u2018is so broad as to encompass any bodily ailment of whatever origin [and] would make unnecessary and meaningless the two categories specifically set forth in the Act,\u2019 \u201d <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 433, 436 S.E.2d at 602 (quoting <em>Holly Farms, </em>228 Va. at 340, 321 S.E.2d at 300).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">While the doctors involved in these cases opined that the particular impairments suffered by the claimants were diseases, they also said that the impairments resulted from cumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion. Because an improper definition of disease was used for testing the authenticity of the medical opinions, the opinions can provide no support for the finding of the Commission and the Court of Appeals that the present claimants suffered from diseases. Therefore, with respect to each claimant, we are left with an impairment resulting from cumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion, an impairment which must be classified as an injury, not a disease, and which, under <em>Merillat, </em>is not compensable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Appellee Jemmott argues, however, that we did not hold in <em>Merillat </em>that a \u201ccondition such as a torn rotator cuff which is clearly caused by cumulative trauma cannot be compensable.\u201d Jemmott points to a statement in the <em>Merillat </em>opinion that \u201cfor a rotator cuff tear to be compensable under the Act as an occupational disease, the record must support a finding that the tear is a disease.\u201d 246 Va. at 433, 436 S.E.2d at 602. Jemmott also points to a statement that \u201c[b]ased on this record, the rotator cuff tear suffered by Parks must be classified as an injury, not a disease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Jemmott then states as follows: \u201cThis Court merely stated in <em>Merillat </em>that in <em>that </em>case, with <em>that </em>record, where there was no medical evidence to support a finding that the rotator cuff tear was a disease and not an injury, the claimant\u2019s rotator cuff tear was . . . not compensable.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">However, Jemmott\u2019s analysis of the extent of our holding in <em>Merillat </em>overlooks the fact that the opinion represents a clear refusal \u201cto broaden the scope of the Act to include job-related impairments arising from repetitive motion or cumulative trauma.\u201d 246 Va. at 433, 436 S.E.2d at 601-02. Jemmott\u2019s analysis also overlooks the statement in the opinion that \u201c[i]n <em>Morris, </em>we held that gradually incurred traumatic injuries or cumulative trauma <em>conditions </em>were not compensable under the existing injury by accident-occupational disease dichotomy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 436 S.E.2d at 602. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Jemmott is mistaken about the effect of the statements to which she points in the <em>Merillat </em>opinion. The statements were made merely to demonstrate the failure of the record to show satisfaction of the requirement that \u201cthe condition for which compensation is sought as an occupational disease must first qualify as a disease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 436 S.E.2d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">But if there lingers any doubt about this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Merillat, </em>we now remove the doubt by saying that job-related impairments resulting from cumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion, however labeled or however defined, are, as a matter of law, not compensable under the present provisions of the Act. Accordingly, we will reverse each of the judgments under review, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>dismiss each claim for benefits, and enter final judgment in favor of each employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\n<em>Record No. 950829 - Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ACA\">\n<em>Record No. 951050 - Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A9u\">\n<em>Record No. 951072 - Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-11\"> Appellee Martin argues that the language of \u00a7 65.2-101 which states that \u201c \u2018[ijnjury\u2019 . . . does not include a disease in any form, except when it results naturally and unavoidably from either of the foregoing causes\u201d means that \u201ca disease <em>in any form </em>is compensable as an \u2018injury\u2019 when it results naturally and unavoidably from either an injury by accident or an occupational disease.\u201d However, the language, \u201c \u2018[ijnjury\u2019 . . . does not include a disease in any form,\u201d as used in the statute, is language of limitation, and to give it the meaning Martin proposes would turn it on its head.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\"> Appellee Martin states that after this Court decided <em>Holly Farms, </em>the General Assembly \u201ccodified the Court\u2019s judicially created exclusion of back strains from consideration as a disease\u201d by amending Code \u00a7 65.2-400(B)(4) to exclude from the definition of occupational diseases \u201cany condition of the neck, back or spinal column.\u201d Martin then argues that the General Assembly knew that this Court uses the rule <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>in construing statutes and that \u201cby excluding any condition of the neck, back, or spinal column, the General Assembly <em>knowingly </em>included all other diseases.\u201d But the exclusion is contained in the portion of \u00a7 65.2-400 which lists the six factors necessary to establish causal connection between disease and work place, not in the portion relating to coverage. With this placement, the General Assembly could not possibly have intended the amendment to have the sweeping effect Martin would have us give it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-11\"> At the time <em>Holly Farms </em>was decided, \u00a7 65.1-46 (now part of \u00a7 65.2-401) provided coverage for an ordinary disease of life provided (1) it followed \u201cas an incident of occupational disease as defined in [Title 65.1],\u201d or (2) it was \u201can infectious or contagious disease contracted in the course of [one\u2019s] employment\u201d in certain health-related occupations. A third proviso was added in 1986. <em>See </em>note 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b216-9\"><em> </em>Appellee Martin argues that \u201cin answer to the obstacle to compensation found in <em>Western Electric, </em>[the General Assembly added a] third class of ordinary diseases of life that are compensable if... \u2018characteristic of the employment and ... caused by conditions peculiar to such employment.\u2019\u201d Code \u00a765.1-46.1(3) (now Code \u00a765.2-401(3)).
