The purpose of Chapter 17 is \u201cto protect, subject to certain limitations, policyowners, insureds, beneficiaries, annuitants, payees, and assignees of life insurance policies, accident and sickness insurance policies, annuity contracts, and supplemental contracts against failure to fulfill contractual obligations due to the impairment or insolvency of the insurers issuing those policies or contracts.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-1700(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">To provide this protection, the General Assembly designated the Virginia Life, Accident and Sickness Insurance Guaranty Association (the Association), composed of all insurers licensed to transact the business of insurance in this Commonwealth, \u201cto enable the guaranty of payment of benefits and of continuation of coverages.\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-1700(A), -1702(A). Members of the Association are \u201csubject to assessments to provide funds to carry out the purpose of [Chapter 17].\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-1700(A). In the case of an insolvent insurer, the Association shall \u201c[guarantee, assume, or reinsure or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, or reinsured the covered policies of the insolvent insurer,\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-1704(B)(1), and shall \u201c[a]ssure payment of the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer,\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-1704(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">However, not all such policies or contracts are entitled to protection. As pertinent here, Code \u00a7 38.2-1700(C)(5) provides that Chapter 17 shall not apply to \u201c[a]ny contract or certificate which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>is not issued to and owned by an individual, except to the extent of . . . any annuity benefits guaranteed to an individual by an insurer under such contract or certificate.\u201d This provision is at the core of the controversy in the present case, and it was brought into focus when, on December 22, 1994, David H. Bennet and L. John Fleischmann, Trustees for the Dynamic Systems, Inc. Savings Enhancement Plan (the Plan), and Roger Nicholas, a participant in the Plan (collectively, the Plan Trustees), filed a petition for declaratory relief with the State Corporation Commission (the Commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The petition alleged that Dynamic Systems, Inc. (Dynamic) is a firm engaged in the business of providing engineering and management services; that Dynamic maintains the Plan for the benefit of its employees, who number \u201c94 or more\u201d; and that the Plan and the trust implementing it qualify under \u00a7 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and include a qualified cash or deferment arrangement under \u00a7 401(k). The petition alleged further that the Plan had purchased certain Guaranteed Interest Contracts (GICs) from InterAmerican Insurance Company of Illinois (InterAmerican); that InterAmerican was licensed to transact insurance business in Virginia and, consequently, was a member of the Association; and that InterAmerican had become insolvent as that term is defined in Code \u00a7 38.2-1701. Finally, the petition alleged that demand had been made upon the Association to extend coverage to the GICs but that the Association had refused the demand and the Commissioner of Insurance for Virginia had ruled that the GICs were not covered by Chapter 17 of Title 38.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The petition prayed for a declaration that the GICs were \u201cannuity contracts\u201d entitled to coverage under Code \u00a7 38.2-1700(A) and that the Association was required to guarantee the contracts. The petition also prayed for an order requiring the Association to pay the Plan Trustees approximately $1.6 million, representing the \u201cContract Value [of the GICs] as of 12/23/91,\u201d the date InterAmerican became insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The Association moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that the GICs were excluded from coverage by the terms of Code \u00a7 38.2-1700(C)(5). The Commission sustained the Association\u2019s motion and dismissed the petition, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">From the documents filed by the parties, including the actual text of the GICs themselves, it is obvious that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>products are not owned by and issued to individuals, nor do they provide any annuity benefits to individuals. Thus, there is no basis under which these investments can be guaranteed by [the Association].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The Plan Trustees are here upon an appeal of right. Va. Const, art. IX, \u00a7 4; Code \u00a7 12.1-39. They argue that the statute in question is remedial in nature and, hence, should be construed liberally to promote the underlying policy of providing protection to innocent victims of insurer insolvency. The Plan Trustees maintain that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 38.2-1700(C)(5) is both unduly restrictive and inconsistent with the spirit and fundamental purposes of the statute in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The Plan Trustees argue further that, although the Plan and the trustees hold legal title to the GICs, the Plan participants \u201care in every sense the equitable and beneficial owners of the . . . GICs.\u201d These investments, the Plan Trustees say, \u201cwere purchased by the Plan at the express direction of individual Plan participants using individually identifiable participant contributions to pay the premiums,\u201d the interest of each participant \u201cwas separately accounted for, and individual Plan participants received periodic statements identifying their specific interests in the . . . GICs.\u201d Furthermore, the Plan Trustees point out, each participant \u201cdirected the application of funds\u201d and had \u201cindividual rights to withdraw money under the GICs in accordance with the terms of the Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We will assume, without deciding, that the Plan Trustees are correct in saying the statute in question should be liberally construed. Even so, we do not think the statute can be stretched to provide coverage for the claims advanced by the Plan Trustees. Accordingly, we find that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 38.2-1700(C)(5) is neither unduly restrictive nor inconsistent with the spirit and fundamental purposes of the statute in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Code \u00a7 38.2-1700(C)(5) excludes from coverage any contract or certificate which is not both <em>issued to </em>and <em>owned by </em>an individual, and nothing in the statutory language permits an interpretation that a mere beneficial or equitable owner can satisfy the \u201cissued to\u201d and the \u201cowned by\u201d requirements. Indeed, such an interpretation is impermissible even under the GICs themselves. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The GICs were issued to the Plan, not the individual participants, and \u00a7 4.10 of the Plan provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">4.10 <em>Trust as Single Fund'. </em>The creation of separate Accounts for accounting and bookkeeping purposes shall not restrict the Trustee in operating the Trust as a single Fund. Allocations to the Accounts of Participants in accordance with this Article IV shall not vest any right or title to any part of the assets of the Fund in such Participants ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In addition, the GICs are issued to the Plan as the \u201cContractholder,\u201d and \u00a7 6.7 of the GICs provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">6.7 Ownership</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">The Contractholder (and not the Participant, beneficiary or contingent annuitant) is the sole owner of all payments, rights, options and privileges granted or made to any Participant, beneficiary or contingent annuitant under the provisions of this Contract and is entitled, without the consent or participation of any Participant, beneficiary or contingent annuitant, to exercise such rights, options and privileges and to receive all such payments at the time payable under the Plan to the Participant, beneficiary or contingent annuitant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Hence, the conclusion is inescapable that the GICs involved in this case are neither issued to nor owned by individuals. The petitioners can succeed, therefore, only if the GICs guarantee \u201cannuity benefits . . . to an individual,\u201d within the meaning of the exception to Code \u00a7 38.2-1700(C)(5). In a footnote to their brief, the Plan Trustees state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">The . . . GICs are themselves annuity contracts because they are agreements to make periodic or lump-sum payments and fixed-dollar amounts to the Plan participants through the Plan. <em>See </em>Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 38.2-106(1993). As annuity contracts, the . . . GICs clearly guaranteed annuity benefits to the Plan participants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">As the Association points out, however, Code \u00a7 38.2-106 defines an annuity as an agreement \u201cto make periodic payments in fixed dollar amounts pursuant to the terms of a contract for a stated period of time or for the life of the person or persons speci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>fied in the contract,\u201d and the GICs involved in this case simply do not satisfy that definition; they neither provide for periodic payments nor fix a dollar amount to be paid. Rather, the GICs provide only for the accumulation of value at a specified rate of interest and for the withdrawal of the accumulated value upon certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Moreover, while one of the options provided by the GICs permits withdrawal of accumulated value for the purchase of an annuity, the withdrawal must be made by the Contractholder, <em>i.e., </em>the Plan, not an individual participant. Section 4.1 of the GICs states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">4.1 Notice of Benefits</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">Written notice shall be given to the Insurance Company by the Contractholder whenever any withdrawal is to be made from the Accumulated Value for the purpose of providing benefits under the Plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Furthermore, the undertaking assumed by the Contractholder according to the terms of the GICs is to purchase annuities for participants, upon request. Section 4.2 of the GICs provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">4.2 Withdrawal to Purchase an Income Annuity</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">Upon receipt of a notice from the Contractholder to purchase an annuity under this Contract for a person in accordance with the Plan, the Insurance Company will effect the purchase of such annuity by withdrawing from the Accumulated Value the full consideration therefor, plus the amount of state premium tax, if any ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">An undertaking to purchase an annuity in the future is not a present guarantee of annuity benefits. Hence, the conclusion is inescapable that the GICs involved in this case do not guarantee \u201cany annuity benefits ... to an individual,\u201d within the contemplation of the exception to Code \u00a7 38.2-1700(C)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\"><em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Life &amp; Health Insurance Guaranty Corp., </em>642 A.2d 856 (Md. 1994), cited by the Plan Trustees, is inapposite. At the time of that decision, the Maryland guaranty statute had no exclusion similar to Virginia\u2019s Code \u00a7 38.2-1700(C)(5). And we are not persuaded by the opinions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>insurance commissioners of three sister states, cited by the Plan Trustees in support of their position.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Two subsidiary questions remain, (1) whether the Commission erred in refusing to consider \u201ccertain binding representations [InterAmerican made] to the Plan participants regarding the GICs in promotional materials,\u201d and (2) whether the Commission erred in dismissing the petition for declaratory relief filed by the Plan Trustees without leave to amend. We refuse to consider these questions. No objection was preserved before the Commission with respect to either point and no assignment of error touches either point. Rule 5:21(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Finding no error in the proceedings below, we will affirm the judgment of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
