While in Jidda, the Hoangs lived in a house with their four children.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">No further education was available to the Hoang children in Saudi Arabia after the ninth grade. Accordingly, the parents sent their two oldest children, Paul and George, to live with Mrs. Hoang\u2019s mother, Thaun Tuk Jones, in Centreville, Fairfax County, Virginia to continue their education.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">George, who was 15 at the time, came to Centreville in the summer of 1990. In March 1992, Michelle Jones, Mrs. Hoang\u2019s half-sister, also came to live in the Centreville single family house with her mother, Paul, George, and two of her mother\u2019s other children.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">George ate, slept, and kept his belongings at his grandmother\u2019s house, and he spent all but one of his vacations there. While living in his grandmother\u2019s house, George assisted around the house by running errands, cleaning parts of the house, mowing the lawn, and cooking. He worked in the Centreville area during the summer of 1992, using his grandmother\u2019s address for employment and tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Excluding the 1991-92 school year, when his parents sent him to a military academy in Front Royal, and a vacation to various cities in the United States with his parents in 1992, George lived continuously in his grandmother\u2019s house. He never visited his parents in Saudi Arabia after he came to Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">George talked on the telephone frequently and corresponded infrequently with his parents in Saudi Arabia while he was living in Virginia. Mrs. Hoang returned from Saudi Arabia to her mother\u2019s house several times a year for visits of several days each to oversee her two sons\u2019 activities. She and her husband continued to support George and pay his educational expenses while he was in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">In July 1992, Mrs. Hoang contacted representatives of USAA Casualty Insurance Company (USAA)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> seeking automobile lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>bility coverage on a Volvo automobile she had recently purchased in Virginia, primarily for use by Paul and George. Based on information furnished by Mrs. Hoang, USAA listed her on the policy as the named insured, and listed her, her husband, Paul, and George as the operators of the insured vehicle. Additionally, Mrs. Hoang advised USAA that the insured vehicle was to be principally garaged at Mrs. Jones\u2019s house and that each operator had a Virginia driver\u2019s license. Shortly after buying the Volvo and the USAA insurance, Mrs. Hoang traded the Volvo for an Oldsmobile automobile, and USAA transferred coverage to the Oldsmobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">In November 1992, Michelle asked George to take her Porsche automobile (covered by a separate USAA liability policy issued to Michelle) to a filling station to be refueled. While driving the Porsche to the filling station, George collided with a car driven by Michael Steven Hensley.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Hensley was injured in the collision and brought a personal injury action against George. Hensley also brought this declaratory judgment action against USAA, Mrs. Hoang, Michelle, and George to obtain a declaration that the USAA policy on Mrs. Hoang\u2019s Oldsmobile provided additional liability coverage to George in the personal injury action beyond the coverage provided by the USAA policy on the Porsche.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Upon attaining the age of 18 and after the accident, George registered to vote in Virginia and applied for admission to a state university, where he was accepted as an in-state student and charged the reduced tuition rate for Virginia residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">After hearing evidence <em>ore terms </em>and considering the depositions of additional witnesses, the trial court entered a declaratory judgment in conformity with Hensley\u2019s request. USAA appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">We resolve the issue in this appeal by considering the pertinent language in the USAA policy on the Oldsmobile. Liability coverage for the operation of a non-owned automobile is provided to the named insured or \u201cany relative\u201d of the named insured. And a \u201crelative\u201d is defined in the policy as \u201ca relative of the named insured <em>who is a resident of the same </em>household.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">USAA argues that, because George was a resident of his grandmother\u2019s household in Centreville, he was not a resident of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>the same household as his mother. Thus, USAA argues that George was not a relative as defined in the policy. On the other hand, the other parties successfully contended in the trial court, and contend on this appeal, that George qualified as a relative under the policy definition because he was a resident of his mother\u2019s household in Saudi Arabia. We agree with USAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">We have considered similar policy language in a number of other cases. In doing so, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">The meaning of \u201cresident\u201d or \u201cresidence\u201d, a prolific source of litigation, depends upon the context in which it is used. . . . Here, we must interpret the meaning of \u201cresident\u201d, when followed by \u201cof the same household\u201d. The word \u201chousehold\u201d, . . . connotes a settled status; a more settled or permanent status is indicated by \u201cresident of the same household\u201d than would be indicated by \u201cresident of the same house or apartment\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\"><em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>231 Va. 358, 361, 344 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1986)(quoting <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>206 Va. 280, 285, 142 S.E.2d 562, 565-66 (1965)). Continuing, we also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">Whether the term \u201chousehold\u201d or \u201cfamily\u201d is used, the term embraces a collection of persons as a single group, with one head, living together, a unit of permanent and domestic character, under one roof; a \u201ccollective body of persons living together within one curtilage, subsisting in common and directing their attention to a common object, the promotion of their mutual interests and social happiness\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-9\"><em>Patterson, </em>231 Va. at 362, 344 S.E.2d at 892 (quoting <em>Smith, </em>206 Va. at 285 n.6, 142 S.E.2d at 565-66 n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">And, as we noted in <em>Patterson, </em>a person\u2019s intent is important in determining whether he qualifies as a resident of a household. 231 Va. at 363, 344 S.E.2d at 893. However, since George was an unemancipated minor at the time of the accident, we must also consider his parents\u2019 intent in this determination. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-334 (unemancipated minor cannot establish his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>own residence); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-333 (parent must consent to minor\u2019s emancipation); <em>Brumfield </em>v. <em>Brumfield, </em>194 Va. 577, 581-82, 74 S.E.2d 170, 173-74 (1953) (intent of parent determines whether minor is emancipated), <em>overruled on other grounds by Smith </em>v. <em>Kauffman, </em>212 Va. 181, 183 S.E.2d 190 (1971). Here, there is no evidence of an intent on the part of George or his parents that he would return to Saudi Arabia to rejoin their household there. On the contrary, the evidence indicates that his parents intended that George become a part of his grandmother\u2019s household until they returned from Saudi Arabia. There is no evidence that George left any of his belongings in Saudi Arabia, that he maintained a room in his former residence there, that he ever returned to visit, or that he had anything more than telephone and mail contact with his parents while they were in Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\">After George came to live with his grandmother, his parents saw him only in Virginia and on their vacation in the summer of 1992. His parents supplied George with a car titled in Virginia and registered at his grandmother\u2019s address, and they permitted him to get a Virginia driver\u2019s license. Furthermore, George was allowed to spend his vacations in Virginia, work there during the summer, and apply for admission to a Virginia university as a Virginia resident. Additionally, George\u2019s parents must have known that George was more than a mere boarder at his grandmother\u2019s house, as evidenced by his activities in contributing to the common burdens associated with the operation of a household.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Even though George testified that his grandmother\u2019s house was not his \u201chome,\u201d the extended period of his residence there with no apparent intention on his or his parents\u2019 part for him to return to his parents\u2019 home in Saudi Arabia, as well as his activities at his grandmother\u2019s house, gainsay this conclusion. Instead, we think this evidence indicates that George was living with his relatives in a unit of permanent and domestic character, subsisting in common, in which each household member, including George, participated in the promotion of their mutual interests and social happiness. <em>See Patterson, </em>231 Va. at 362, 344 S.E.2d at 892. Under these facts and cir ^stances, we conclude that reasonable persons could not differ pncluding that, at the time of the collision, George was a mem f his grandmother\u2019s household in Virginia, and was no lonj a member of his mother\u2019s household in Saudi Arabia. Accor: ,ly, we think that the trial court erred in concluding that Mrs xoang\u2019s USAA policy on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Oldsmobile provided additional coverage against George\u2019s possible liability to Hensley.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Therefore, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and enter final judgment in this Court declaring that George was not covered by Mrs. Hoang\u2019s USAA policy when he operated his aunt\u2019s Porsche and collided with Hensley.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b199-10\"> Although Hensley described USAA as \u201cUnited States Automobile Association\u201d in the caption of his \u201cComplaint for Declaratory Judgment,\u201d the parties agree that the policy was issued by USAA Casualty Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of United Services Automobile Association.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
