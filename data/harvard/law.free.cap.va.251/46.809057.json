Cash was arrested and charged with driving a vehicle in the City of Buena Vista while under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. On the same day, defendant also was charged in a warrant under Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, a part of Virginia\u2019s implied consent law, with refusing to submit to a blood or breath test to determine the alcohol content of her blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Subsequently, defendant was tried on both charges in the local general district court. She was acquitted of DUI and convicted of the refusal charge. She appealed the conviction to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Pretrial, the circuit court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to exclude certain evidence proffered by the defendant on the reasonableness of her refusal to submit to the blood or breath test. The prosecutor asked the court to prohibit, for example, any evidence regarding defendant\u2019s sobriety at the time of arrest and evidence of the outcome of the DUI charge on the ground that such evidence is irrelevant to the charge of unreasonable refusal to submit to such test.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Following a jury trial, at which only the arresting police officer testified, defendant was found guilty of the refusal charge. She was sentenced to revocation of her driving privileges for one year, in accord with the verdict, and ordered to pay court costs. The defendant appeals from the January 1995 judgment order, which has been suspended during the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">The central question on appeal is whether the trial court erred in granting the prosecutor\u2019s pretrial motion limiting the evidence defendant could present to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">Initially, the relevant law should be reviewed. Under the implied consent law, any person who operates a motor vehicle upon a highway in the Commonwealth is deemed, as a condition of such operation, to have consented to have samples of blood, breath, or both, taken for a chemical test to determine alcohol content of the person\u2019s blood, if that person is arrested for DUI in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>violation of the applicable statutes or of a similar local ordinance. Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">A person so arrested must be advised by the arresting officer of the implied consent condition and that \u201cthe unreasonable refusal\u201d to submit to a test constitutes grounds for revocation of driving privileges. If the person refuses to permit the testing, the person shall be taken before a magistrate, who must advise the person again of the implied consent law\u2019s requirements. If the person declares the refusal in writing on a prescribed form, or refuses to so declare, then no samples shall be taken. Code \u00a7 18.2-268.3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Upon such refusal, the magistrate shall certify to such fact and that the person was advised of the law\u2019s requirements, and shall charge the person with a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 for refusing the test. Code \u00a7 18.2-268.3(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">At trial of the refusal charge, the declaration of refusal or the magistrate\u2019s certificate is prima facie evidence that the defendant refused to submit to the testing. \u201cHowever, this shall not prohibit the defendant from introducing on his behalf evidence of the basis for his refusal. The court shall determine the reasonableness of such refusal.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-268.3(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In construing the foregoing statutes and their predecessors, this Court has decided that operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs may give rise to two separate and distinct proceedings \u2014 one a criminal action for DUI and the other a civil, administrative proceeding on the refusal charge. \u201cEach action proceeds independently of the other and the outcome of one is of no consequence to the other.\u201d <em>Deaner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 285, 289, 170 S.E.2d 199, 201 (1969). <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rafferty, </em>241 Va. 319, 321-23, 402 S.E.2d 17, 18-19 (1991). <em>Cf. </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-268.4 (if defendant pleads guilty to DUI, court may dismiss refusal charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The consent to submit to a blood or breath test, granted when a person operates a motor vehicle upon the highways, \u201cis not a qualified consent and it is not a conditional consent, and therefore there can be no qualified refusal or conditional refusal to take the test.\u201d <em>Deaner, </em>210 Va. at 292, 170 S.E.2d at 204. The mere fact that under the statute \u201can accused is afforded an opportunity to establish the reasonableness of his refusal does not operate to dilute the consent previously given, or convert that consent into a qualified or conditional one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292-93, 170 S.E.2d at 204. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Illustrative of a refusal that would be deemed reasonable is when \u201ca person\u2019s health would be endangered by the withdrawal of blood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293, 170 S.E.2d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The Court has held that a person\u2019s unwillingness to take the test without prior consultation with counsel does not constitute a reasonable basis for the refusal. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 684, 685, 187 S.E.2d 172, 174 (1972); <em>Deaner, </em>210 Va. at. 293, 170 S.E.2d at 204. In another case, we held it was not reasonable to refuse a blood analysis solely because counsel advised the defendant against taking the test. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 130, 131, 207 S.E.2d 828, 829 (1974). There, the Court reiterated \u201cthere must be some reasonable factual basis for the refusal, for example, endangerment of the health of the accused by the withdrawal of blood.\u201d <em>Id., </em>207 S.E.2d at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Interpreting the implied consent law, our Court of Appeals has held \u201cthat a driver\u2019s subjective belief that he was not under the influence of alcohol is not a reasonable basis for refusing the test, nor is the fact that he could and did operate his vehicle in a proficient manner. Thus, evidence of his state of sobriety or proficiency in operating the vehicle is not admissible in a case involving refusal to take a blood or breath test.\u201d <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 9 </em>Va. App. 321, 324, 388 S.E.2d 268, 270 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Against this background, we examine defendant\u2019s proffer, submitted to the trial court by an informal oral statement of counsel, to determine whether any of the proffered evidence should have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">According to counsel, defendant\u2019s evidence \u201cwould be\u201d that she and her husband \u201cwent to a place ... in Buena Vista . . . shortly before eleven o\u2019clock that evening [and] that they\u2019d had nothing to drink before that.\u201d While at the \u201cplace,\u201d they consumed \u201cless than one beer . . . and at eleven-thirty [when] the last call was made. . . , there was one pitcher served at the table.\u201d Three persons \u201cwere at that table and each had less than one mug.\u201d Two witnesses would testify that defendant \u201cwas not under the influence, in any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">When defendant and her husband left \u201cthe place\u201d in a car, \u201cthere was no erratic operation of the vehicle\u201d by defendant. The police stopped the vehicle on a city street although defendant was \u201csober\u201d and \u201cshe had done absolutely nothing to justify the police to stop her.\u201d After the stop, the couple was \u201ctreated abusively\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the arresting officer, and both were \u201cordered to take field sobriety tests.\u201d Defendant \u201cdid well\u201d on the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Following defendant\u2019s refusal to take a blood or breath test, as the officer was taking defendant to a magistrate, she \u201ckept telling the officer\u201d that she wished to consult counsel; the officer made no response to the request. She told the officer and the magistrate \u201cshe was concerned that she was being framed,\u201d that any test \u201cwould be manipulated, and she wanted to consult counsel to see what she could do to protect her interest from being framed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Defendant\u2019s perception she was being \u201cframed\u201d stemmed from a separate criminal case in which she was not a party. She was scheduled to testify later in the day of her arrest in a criminal matter pending on a post-trial motion regarding juror misconduct. Defendant \u201cbelieved\u201d the police \u201cwere trying to harass her and frame her ... as punishment for her having volunteered to the defense in that case that she had information regarding the misconduct and bias of the jury.\u201d Defendant, a school bus driver, also proffered evidence of events relating to her job occurring later in the day of her arrest, which she asserted corroborated her \u201cframing\u201d charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Responding to defendant\u2019s \u201cframing\u201d allegation, the prosecutor represented to the trial court he was prepared to establish that the officers who were involved in defendant\u2019s arrest had no knowledge at the time that defendant was to be a witness, or otherwise involved, in any court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s granting of the prosecutor\u2019s pretrial motion prohibiting her \u201cfrom introducing evidence of her fear of being framed and excluding any evidence of the reason the police stopped her.\u201d In support of that assignment of error, defendant argues that the \u201creasonable fear of entrapment by the police coupled with the denial of an opportunity to consult counsel constitutes a factual basis for a reasonable refusal to submit to a blood or breath test.\u201d Additionally, she argues the Commonwealth had to prove the reasonableness of the stop at the time of arrest for DUI to support the charge of unreasonable refusal to submit to the testing. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">The precedent established in the cases we have just discussed dictates the result in the present case. Manifestly, the evidence about defendant\u2019s sobriety, about her driving proficiency, and about her subjective belief that she was not under the influ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>ence of alcohol, while admissible in the DUI trial, was utterly inadmissible in the refusal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Moreover, her desire to consult counsel \u201cto see what she could do to protect her interest from being framed\u201d furnishes no legal basis for refusal to submit to testing. As the trial judge observed, this contention \u201cjust puts a different spin\u201d on the facts in <em>Deaner </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">By operating a motor vehicle on the highways of the Commonwealth the night in question, defendant consented, as a condition of that operation, to have tests made to determine the alcohol content of her blood. The chemical analysis of one\u2019s blood provides a scientifically accurate method of determining whether a person is intoxicated; it protects one who may appear to be intoxicated when, in fact, the individual is sober. <em>Walton </em>v. <em>City of Roanoke, </em>204 Va. 678, 683, 133 S.E.2d 315, 319 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The defendant may not unilaterally abrogate that agreement or withdraw that consent by refusing the test unless there is a reasonable basis for the refusal. A fear of being \u201cframed\u201d is not such a basis; it is not \u201creasonable\u201d in the sense that evidence of endangerment of the health of the accused by withdrawal of blood furnishes a \u201creasonable\u201d basis for refusal. That type of evidence should have been offered in the trial of the DUI charge because it may relate to the question whether the police officer\u2019s stop of the accused was lawful; certainly such evidence is not probative in the trial of the refusal charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">We note, however, that we are not presented in this case with the effect on the refusal charge of a dismissal of the DUI charge on constitutional grounds. There is nothing in this record to suggest that the DUI charge was dismissed because defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were violated, and we will not presume such was the case in order to address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Consequently, we hold that the trial court correctly refused to permit defendant to present the proffered evidence. And, we reject other errors assigned by defendant dealing with the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the refusal charge and with denial of an instruction she offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Thus, the judgment of conviction will be</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
