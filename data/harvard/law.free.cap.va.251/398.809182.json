Vol. 1993), a part of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act. This controversy arose in September 1989. At that time, the Act was codified in \u00a7\u00a74-118.42 through -118.61 (Supp. 1989). The Act\u2019s provisions pertinent to this appeal are the same in both versions. Thus, for clarity we shall refer to the statutes in effect at the time of the May 1995 decision from which this appeal was taken, that is, the version found in the 1993 Replacement Volume of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">The Act is to be \u201cliberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies.\u201d Code \u00a74.1-400. One such purpose and policy is to \u201cpromote the interests of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>and the public in fair business relations between wine wholesalers and wineries, and in the continuation of wine wholesalerships on a fair basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Act defines \u201cwinery\u201d to include any corporation which enters into an agreement with any Virginia wholesale wine licensee and which \u201cmanufactures or sells any wine products, whether licensed in the Commonwealth or not.\u201d Code \u00a7 4.1-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">Other stated purposes and policies included in the Act are to \u201cpreserve and protect the existing three-tier system for the distribution of wine,\u201d Code \u00a7 4.1-400(2); to \u201cprohibit unfair treatment of wine wholesalers by wineries\u201d and to \u201cdefine certain rights and remedies of wineries in regard to cancellation of franchise agreements with wholesalers,\u201d <em>id. </em>at (3); and, to \u201cestablish conditions for creation and continuation of all wholesale wine distributorships\u201d consistent with all applicable laws, <em>id. </em>at (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The focus of this appeal is upon a winery\u2019s attempted cancellations unilaterally of agreements with certain Virginia wine wholesalers. As pertinent, the Act provides that \u201cno winery shall unilaterally amend, cancel, terminate or refuse to continue to renew any agreement\u201d unless the winery has given the required statutory notice and unless \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for such cancellation or termination. Code \u00a7 4.1-406.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The Act further provides, \u201cGood cause shall include, but is not limited to\u201d certain enumerated circumstances. <em>Id. </em>Among the circumstances is revocation of the wholesaler\u2019s license to do business in the Commonwealth; bankruptcy or receivership of the wholesaler; assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of the wholesaler\u2019s assets; and a wholesaler\u2019s failure to comply, without reasonable justification, with any written, material requirement imposed by the winery. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The Act also provides, \u201cGood cause shall not include the sale or purchase of a winery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the Act provides that, except for \u201cdiscontinuance of a brand or for good cause as provided in \u00a7 4.1-406, the purchaser of a winery shall become obligated to all of the terms and conditions of the selling winery\u2019s agreements with wholesalers in effect on the date of purchase.\u201d Code \u00a7 4.1-405(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">And, if a winery accomplishes termination or cancellation of an agreement without good cause, the Act provides a procedure for the wholesaler to receive from the winery reasonable compensation for the value of the agreement. Code \u00a7 4.1-409(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>This case has been litigated upon a stipulation of facts. Appellee Brown-Forman Corporation (the winery), with principal offices in Louisville, Kentucky, manufactures and sells wine products. Prior to September 27, 1989, the winery supplied its brands of wines to certain Virginia wholesalers for distribution in designated territories pursuant to written agreements. In the agreements, the parties expressly acknowledged the contracts were subject to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The winery, exercising its business judgment, determined that its brands could be more effectively marketed by fewer wholesalers over broader geographic areas. The winery\u2019s experience had been that consolidation of its brands into fewer wholesalers increases \u201cmarket penetration,\u201d sales of its products, and profits for both the winery and its wholesalers. Thus, by letters dated September 27, 1989, the winery notified Virginia wholesalers of its \u201cmajor reorganization of its sales organization\u201d and that it would terminate existing agreements. The winery planned to consolidate from 18 wholesalers in Virginia to four.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Eleven of the wholesalers are parties appellant. They are: Sims Wholesale Company, Inc.; House of Beverages, Inc.; James River Beverage Company; Holston Valley Distributing Co., Inc.; Circle Sales, Inc.; Roanoke Distributing Co., Inc., trading as J.P. Distributing; Shenandoah Valley Distributing Co., Inc., trading as Dixie Beverage Company; Service Distributing, Inc.; Lawrence and Nester Distributing Company; Eastern Shore Beverage Distributing, Inc.; and Virginia Imports, Ltd.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Shortly after receiving the termination notices, the wholesalers filed petitions with the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (the Board) seeking a determination that the winery had violated the Act, and asking that the notices of intent to terminate the agreements be declared null and void. Subsequently, the parties presented the cases to the Board on the stipulation with a single issue for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The following additional facts are included in the stipulation. The winery\u2019s termination notices did not allege any deficiencies on the part of the wholesalers. The winery\u2019s decision to market its brands through fewer wholesalers over broader geographic areas, when viewed from the winery\u2019s perspective, was in its economic self interest. The winery\u2019s decision that its own economic self interest is served by the consolidation, while erroneous from the wholesalers\u2019 perspective, is not clearly arbitrary, capricious, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>irrational from the winery\u2019s perspective. The winery\u2019s decision was made in good faith and constitutes a good faith exercise of business judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The parties stipulated that the sole issue presented is whether the good faith exercise of business judgment by the winery, absent any evidence of deficiencies in the wholesalers\u2019 performances, is \u201cgood cause\u201d pursuant to the Act for the winery to terminate unilaterally its agreements with the wholesalers without reasonable compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Following a hearing, a panel of the Board\u2019s hearing officers concluded in July 1991 that the Act \u201ccontains no language that permits a winery\u2019s unilateral cancellation of agreements with wholesalers in order to consolidate its distributors and to enhance its economic interests in the absence of wholesaler deficiency.\u201d On appeal, the Board adopted the panel\u2019s decision, ruling that the winery\u2019s reasons for terminating its agreements with the wholesalers do not constitute good cause within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The winery appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court of Fairfax County. Although not agreeing with all the Board\u2019s reasoning, the court (Judge Jane Marum Roush), in a January 1994 letter opinion, affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. The court determined \u201cthat the specific business judgment exercised by Brown-Forman in this case to streamline its operations, without more (and particularly without allegations of any deficiencies on the part of the wholesalers), is not sufficient \u2018good cause\u2019 under the statute.\u201d The court noted that, contrary to the winery\u2019s argument, the winery \u201cis not shackled to the wholesalers until it is forced by the economic inefficiencies of the agreements to go out of business .... Instead, it must continue its agreements with the wholesalers or pay them reasonable compensation for the value of the agreements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The winery appealed the circuit court\u2019s decision. Subsequently, a panel of the Court of Appeals ruled unanimously in favor of the winery. <em>Brown-Forman Corp. </em>v. <em>Sims Wholesale Co., </em>20 Va. App. 423, 457 S.E.2d 426 (1995). The court determined that the term \u201cgood cause,\u201d as it relates to termination of a distribution agreement under the Act, is unambiguous. \u201cConsidered together and in proper context, the words simply mean a \u2018well-founded\u2019 \u2018reason.\u2019 \u201d 20 Va. App. at 431, 457 S.E.2d at 430. Accordingly, the appellate court agreed with the trial court that the Board erroneously restricted statutory \u201cgood cause\u201d to instances of wholesaler defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ciency, and remanded the proceeding to the Board for reconsideration of the issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Determining that the decision of the Court of Appeals involves a matter of significant precedential value, Code \u00a7 17-116.07(B), we awarded the wholesalers and the Board separate appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Initially, we shall dispose of an argument advanced by the Board, but not the wholesalers, that the Court of Appeals failed to give proper deference to the Board\u2019s decision. Pointing out that courts play a limited role in reviewing agency decisions under the pertinent provisions of the Administrative Process Act, Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17, the Attorney General argues \u201cthe judiciary should not substitute its judgment for that of the Board concerning how the Act should be implemented\u201d when, as here, the Board interprets the Act consistent with legislative guidelines. The Attorney General contends the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision violates that principle. We do not agree the Board\u2019s decision in this case should be accorded the great deference urged by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The sole issue involves a question of statutory interpretation. The issue does not involve \u201cthe substantiality of the evidential support for findings of fact,\u201d <em>id. </em>at (iv), which requires great deference because of the specialized competence of the agency. Instead, when, as here, the question involves a statutory interpretation issue, \u201clittle deference is required to be accorded the agency decision\u201d because the issue falls outside the agency\u2019s specialized competence. <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Kenley, </em>6 Va. App. 231, 246, 369 S.E.2d 1, 9 (1988). In sum, pure statutory interpretation is the prerogative of the judiciary. <em>See Hampton Roads Sanitation Dist. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>City of Chesapeake, </em>218 Va. 696, 702, 240 S.E.2d 819, 823 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Thus, we turn to the question of law presented, the crux of the issue being to determine the meaning of \u201cgood cause\u201d as used in the Act. The wholesalers and the Board, contending the term as employed in Code \u00a7 4.1-406 is ambiguous, argue \u201cgood cause\u201d does not exist unless there are wholesaler deficiencies. The winery, contending the Court of Appeals correctly ruled the term to be unambiguous, argues that \u201cgood cause\u201d under \u00a7 4.1-406 is always satisfied when a winery terminates a wholesale agreement unilaterally in the good faith exercise of its business judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">In order to decide the precise issue presented by these stipulated facts, there is no necessity for us to rule on the question whether the term \u201cgood cause\u201d is clear or vague. We will agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>with the Court of Appeals and assume without deciding that the term as used in \u00a7 4.1-406 is unambiguous. Nonetheless, we disagree with the Court of Appeals that \u00a7 4.1-406 \u201cgood cause\u201d merely means \u201ca \u2018well-founded\u2019 \u2018reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown-Forman Corp., </em>20 Va. App. at 431, 457 S.E.2d at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Like the circuit court, we decline to adopt either argument made by the opposing parties. We reject the position of the wholesalers and the Board that \u201cgood cause\u201d under the statute as it existed in September 1989 requires in every instance establishment of wholesaler deficiency. Were that the case, the legislature performed a meaningless act by including in the statute an example of what is not \u201cgood cause,\u201d that is, the term \u201cshall not include the sale or purchase of a winery.\u201d Every part of a statute is presumed to have some effect and no part will be treated as meaningless unless absolutely necessary. <em>Raven Red Ash Coal Corp. </em>v. <em>Absher, </em>153 Va. 332, 335, 149 S.E. 541, 542 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We also reject the position of the winery, implicitly endorsed by the Court of Appeals, that \u201cgood cause\u201d always exists when a winery unilaterally cancels a wholesaler agreement in the good faith exercise of its business judgment. Under such an approach, potentially any decision of a winery, not made in bad faith or arbitrarily, to so terminate existing agreements could be viewed as a good faith exercise of business judgment. If such a decision were sufficient to establish \u201cgood cause,\u201d the Act\u2019s statutory protections also would be meaningless. <em>See Wright-Moore Corp. </em>v. <em>Ricoh Corp., </em>908 F.2d 128, 137 (7th Cir. 1990) (franchisor\u2019s nonrenewal of distributorship agreement for internal economic reasons, though not shown to be in bad faith, was not for good cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">An examination of the winery\u2019s specific business decision made in this case requires the unavoidable conclusion that the winery has not established sufficient \u201cgood cause\u201d under the statute. According to the stipulation, the winery\u2019s \u201cbasis for the terminations was its desire to consolidate its brands into fewer wholesalers over broader geographic areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">To determine whether \u201cconsolidation\u201d or so-called \u201cdownsizing\u201d amounts to statutory \u201cgood cause,\u201d we examine other portions of the Act, specifically portions dealing with the sale of a winery. Code \u00a7 4.1-406, as we have noted, provides that \u201cgood cause\u201d shall not include the sale or purchase of a winery. Code \u00a74.1-405(A) provides that, except for discontinuance of a brand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>or for \u00a7 4.1-406 \u201cgood cause,\u201d the purchaser of a winery is obligated to all the terms and conditions of the seller\u2019s agreements with wholesalers in effect on the purchase date. Code \u00a74.1-405(B)(1) provides that if the surviving winery distributes in Virginia brands of the nonsurviving winery, which that winery marketed prior to the purchase, those brands shall be distributed through any wholesalers who were distributors in Virginia for the nonsurviving winery.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">As the circuit court observed, the purchase and sale of a winery likely may lead to some duplication in the pre-sale distribution network of the two wineries thus requiring \u201csome streamlining or other internal reorganization\u201d by the surviving winery. In other words, when one winery purchases another, thus inheriting a duplicative network of Virginia distributors, efforts to consolidate become probable. Yet the statute specifically provides that the sale or purchase of a winery is not \u201cgood cause\u201d for termination of wholesaler agreements. If the General Assembly had meant that a winery\u2019s consolidation of its distributorships to streamline operations would amount to \u201cgood cause,\u201d it would have so provided in the situation of a sale or purchase of a winery.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Thus, we hold, under the stipulated facts, that the winery\u2019s good faith exercise of business judgment, there being no evidence of deficiencies in the wholesalers\u2019 performances, is not \u201cgood cause\u201d under the Act for the winery to terminate unilaterally its agreements with the wholesalers without reasonable compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Before concluding, we shall mention a contention made by the wholesalers, but not the Attorney General, during oral argument at the bar of this Court on February 29, 1996. Two days prior to the argument, counsel for the wholesalers notified the Court of an enactment passed by the General Assembly and signed into law by the Governor as emergency legislation effective February 26, 1996. This enactment amended \u00a7 4.1-406 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">In essence, the amendment provides that \u201cgood cause\u201d shall not be construed to exist without a finding of a material deficiency for which the wholesaler is responsible. According to its provisions, the amendment applies in any case in which \u201cgood cause\u201d is alleged to exist based on circumstances not specifically set forth in the subdivisions of the statute that enumerate certain examples of wholesaler deficiencies. The enactment also provides: \u201cThat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>provisions of this act are declaratory of existing law.\u201d Acts 1996, ch. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">At the bar, counsel for the wholesalers contended that, in the amendment, the General Assembly made \u201ca legislative interpretation of the original Act.\u201d Counsel said, however, that the amendment is \u201cnot binding on this Court,\u201d that it is \u201cpersuasive\u201d only, and that the Court can \u201cweigh\u201d the amendment \u201chowever you see fit.\u201d Counsel for the winery contended <em>inter alia </em>that the amendment, enacted while the very issue it addresses was being considered by the Court, is unconstitutional because it violates the separation of powers doctrine set forth in Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution of Virginia (\u201cthe legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the Commonwealth should be separate and distinct\u201d). Counsel for the winery also argued that the amendment is retroactive legislation impairing the obligation of its contracts in violation of Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of Virginia, citing <em>Heublein, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Alcoholic Beverage Con</em>trol, 237 Va. 192, 196-97, 376 S.E.2d 77, 78-79 (1989) (pre-1989 version of the Act declared unconstitutional in its entirety).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">We shall not rule on the effect, if any, of the enactment on the issue presented in this case because we have confined our analysis of the Act to the provisions that were in place in September 1989 when this controversy arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals will be reversed and final judgment will be entered here reinstating that portion of the Board\u2019s \u201cFinal Decision and Order\u201d dated November 22, 1991, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">\u201cIt is ordered that the notices of intent dated September 27, 1989 to terminate the agreements between the respondent[] and the petitioners be, and hereby are declared null and void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">\u201cIt is further ordered that respondent Brown-Forman be, and hereby, is, ordered to (i) continue its agreements with the petitioners for the distribution of its wines within the petitioners\u2019 primary areas of responsibility or (ii) in the alternative, pay the petitioners reasonable compensation for the value of the agreements pursuant to Section 4-118.50 [now \u00a7 4.1-409] of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
