PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b348-16\">Juvenile petitions were issued against Roach, who was 17 years old at the time of these offenses, charging him with capital murder, use of a firearm in the commission of murder, and robbery. The Commonwealth gave notice of intent to try Roach as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>adult and a transfer hearing was conducted in the Greene County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (the juvenile court). Finding probable cause to believe that Roach committed the crimes, the juvenile court advised the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney that he could seek indictments against Roach before a grand jury. The circuit court then reviewed the transfer order under Code \u00a7 16.1-269 and found probable cause to believe that Roach committed all three offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Roach was tried as an adult on indictments charging (1) capital murder of Mary Ann Hughes in the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-31(4); (2) use of a firearm in the commission of murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1; and (3) robbery by violence to the person of Mary Ann Hughes, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58. At the first stage of a bifurcated jury trial conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3 and -264.4(A), Roach was found guilty as charged in all three indictments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">At the penalty phase of the capital murder trial, the court struck the evidence as to the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate of a capital sentence, but submitted the case to the jury upon the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate. The jury found that the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate was satisfied and unanimously fixed Roach\u2019s punishment at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Upon review of victim impact statements and a probation officer\u2019s report, and after conducting a sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced Roach in accord with the jury verdict on the capital murder conviction. Further, the court sentenced Roach to three years imprisonment for the use of a firearm in the commission of a murder and to life imprisonment for robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">II. THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"A-I\">\n<em>Guilt Phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">We will review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below. <em>Cheng </em>v. <em>Common</em>wealth,, 240 Va. 26, 42, 393 S.E.2d 599, 608 (1990). On the evening of December 3, 1993, Mary Ann Hughes was shot and killed in her home about five miles west of Stanardsville. Hughes was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>standing at her open front door when she was shot. Her body was discovered the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The cause of death was a single shotgun wound to the chest, which caused injury to an artery, the chest wall, and the right lung. Dr. Deborah Kay, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Hughes, recovered shotgun pellets and wadding from Hughes\u2019s chest. The pellets and wadding were identified as number eight shot from a 12 gauge Remington shot shell case.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The day before the killing, Roach brought a 12 gauge shotgun to a neighbor\u2019s house, and he and two friends engaged in shooting the gun in the back yard using number eight shot. The police later recovered from the neighbor\u2019s back yard number eight shot that was consistent with a 12 gauge Remington shell case.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Roach and Hughes were also neighbors. Roach helped Hughes with household chores and also spent a great deal of time visiting her. The evidence showed that Roach was familiar with Hughes\u2019s habits, and that Hughes customarily deposited her social security check in the bank within the first few days of each month.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">On the night she was killed, Hughes\u2019s purse, containing a Discover credit card and approximately sixty dollars in cash, was taken from her home. Hughes owned a 1981 Buick Regal, which also was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In the early morning hours of December 4, 1993, Gregory Lee Giuriceo, Jr., a deputy sheriff for Nottoway County, noticed a Buick Regal parked in a parking lot of a shopping center in Blackstone. Roach was identified by Giuriceo as the operator of the car. After leaving the parking lot, Giuriceo determined that the automobile was registered to Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Later in the morning of December 4, 1993, Roach attempted to use Hughes\u2019s Discover bank card at an automated teller machine in Louisburg, North Carolina. A video tape from the machine showed Roach attempting to withdraw cash from Hughes\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">On December 5, 1993, Trooper David F. Chavis of the South Carolina Highway Patrol observed a 1981 Buick Regal automobile with Virginia plates which was being driven at 69 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone. He activated the lights on his patrol car and proceeded behind the Buick. The driver of the Buick drove the automobile over to the left shoulder of the road, got out of the car, ran into the woods at the side of the road, and escaped. The driver was wearing clothes which matched the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>description of the clothes Roach had been seen wearing for the previous two days.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Trooper Chavis impounded the vehicle and traced its ownership to Hughes. Items retrieved from the automobile included Hughes\u2019s purse, a blue jacket, a number eight load shotgun shell, and a plastic bag from a Winn-Dixie grocery store. Mahlon Jones, a fingerprint expert employed by the Commonwealth\u2019s Division of Forensic Science, identified a latent palm print from the plastic bag as matching Roach\u2019s left palm print. In addition, latent fingerprints were recovered from the automobile which matched Roach\u2019s fingerprints.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Roach made several telephone calls to his aunt, Annie Betty Dean, while he was in North Carolina and South Carolina. During those telephone conversations, she asked him to \u201ccome home and give [himself] up.\u201d On December 6, 1993, Roach contacted Sheriff William L. Morris and arranged to come that day with his father to the Sheriff\u2019s Department for questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">At the Sheriff\u2019s Department, Morris advised Roach of his <em>Miranda </em>rights in the presence of Roach\u2019s father. Roach waived his rights, and both he and his father signed the waiver form. Sheriff Morris then questioned Roach out of his father\u2019s presence. Clarence Roberts, an acquaintance of the Roach family and an employee of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, was present with Morris during the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">At first, Roach told Morris that he and a friend, Scott Shifflett, went to Hughes\u2019s house on the evening of December 3, 1993. Roach said that Shifflett left the 12 gauge shotgun at the door, and that they entered the house and played Yahtzee with Hughes. Roach recounted that Shifflett then took the keys to the Buick Regal and the two began to leave the house. Roach said that, after he left, Shifflett ran back to the front door, fired one shot, and ran back to the Buick with Hughes\u2019s purse. According to Roach, Shifflett said that he had \u201cfired through the roof to scare her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Roach stated that Shifflett then jumped into the driver\u2019s seat of the Buick and they drove to North Carolina. He said that Shifflett must have tried to use Hughes\u2019s Discover credit card while Roach was in a Winn-Dixie store making some purchases. Roach also stated that he and Shifflett abandoned Hughes\u2019s vehicle in North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>During the questioning, Morris related to Roach certain evidence that had already been discovered, stating, \u201c[W]ith all these discrepancies in the story, . . . I\u2019m finding it really a little difficult to believe some of the things you\u2019re telling me.\u201d Roberts then told Roach that he knew Roach was lying and that \u201cthis is a heavy burden to carry on your shoulders for the rest of your life, if you committed this act you need to tell Sheriff Morris and you need to unburden yourself.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">Roach then told Morris,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">I went over there and saw her counting the money and as I was leaving, I had the shotgun laying at the door and I shot her, took the money, the car and left, went to North Carolina. And I cashed \u2014 I tried to use \u2014 use the credit card but \u2014 about four times [,] but it wouldn\u2019t work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">When asked where he shot Hughes, he answered, \u201cIn the chest.\u201d At trial, Roach offered evidence that there was no gunshot residue on his hands or clothes when he was arrested. He also presented evidence that no footprints at the scene of the crime matched the shoes he was wearing on December 3, 1993. In addition, Barbara Llewellyn, an expert employed by the Division of Forensic Science in the analysis of blood and body fluid, testified that, when Roach was arrested, he had no blood on his clothing, except a \u201cvery light stain\u201d on his shirt, despite the fact that the fatal wound perforated one of Hughes\u2019s arteries and the pattern of blood splatters indicated that the person who had fired the gun was standing within five feet of Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\n<em>Penalty Phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">During the penalty phase of the trial, the Commonwealth put on evidence of Roach\u2019s prior juvenile convictions. Roach had been convicted twice of grand larceny of an automobile. He committed the first larceny in May 1993 and the second in August 1993. In connection with the first automobile larceny, Roach was convicted of reckless driving and failure to stop for a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">In June 1993, Roach was convicted of breaking and entering a residential dwelling and of grand larceny arising out of the burglary. Roach gained entry to the home by breaking a window. He then ransacked the house and stole a .357 magnum pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>In August 1993, Roach was sentenced to supervised probation and house arrest under the supervision of his parents at all times. He violated the conditions of this probation when he left the family home and carried a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">When Roach was placed on probation in August 1993, a psychological evaluation was ordered. The psychologist recommended that Roach and his family attend family counseling and that Roach increase his level of academic attainment. Roach had stopped attending school in 1991 when he was 14 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">According to John T. Frey, Roach\u2019s probation officer, Roach and his family attended counseling sessions at the regional counseling center prior to December 1993. Roach also enrolled in G.E.D. classes in the adult education program offered by Greene County.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Shirley Ann Roach, Roach\u2019s mother, testified that she and Roach\u2019s father had separated and reconciled their marriage four times during Roach\u2019s childhood. She testified that she and her husband requested that Roach be released from compulsory education at age 14 because he was needed around the house to do chores and to care for his brothers. She also stated that she did not realize that possessing a weapon violated the terms of Roach\u2019s probation because the probation papers did not explicitly state this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">John Roach, Roach\u2019s father, testified that he was frequently absent from home. He also suffered from significant health problems. When Steve Roach was six years old, John Roach sustained a shotgun injury which required him to remain in the hospital for six months. While being treated for the gunshot wound, he contracted Hepatitis C from a blood transfusion. The medication he received for this condition caused mood changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">John Roach testified that, when his wife left him, life \u201cgot worse\u201d for his children. He began drinking heavily and brought young girls into the home in order to make his wife jealous. He stated that the children were present when this occurred and that they did not receive parental supervision. He also stated that Steve Roach had free access to all the guns in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Several family friends and relatives testified on Steve Roach\u2019s behalf. Clarence Roberts testified that Roach had performed numerous \u201codd jobs\u201d for him, and that Roach was \u201can excellent employee.\u201d Tammy Estes, Roach\u2019s half sister, stated that Roach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>often helped his neighbors, including Hughes, cut firewood, cook, and clean their laundry.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Wendell Lamb, the pastor of Roach\u2019s church, testified that Roach volunteered his time to help paint and remodel the church and to work at a camp for children in the George Washington National Forest. Lamb conceded that, while Roach was doing volunteer work for the church, he was accused of stealing a watch. Roach and the owner of the watch resolved the dispute privately.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Roach testified on his own behalf. He stated that, shortly after 9:00 p.m. on December 3, 1993, he walked to Hughes\u2019s house with his shotgun. When she opened the door, he fired once, walked past her body, and took her purse and the keys to her car. He stated that he then drove to North Carolina and attempted to use her Discover credit card to get cash. Roach testified that he did not know Hughes had died until he spoke by telephone with his aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Roach also testified that, when he went to Hughes\u2019s house, he knew she had just received her social security check, knew the location of her purse, and intended to steal both items. However, he stated that he did not intend to hurt her, and that he could not explain \u201cwhat went . . . through [his] mind.\u201d He also testified that he was sorry he had killed Hughes, stating, \u201cI wish I could bring her back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Dr. Gary Lee Hawk, a forensic psychologist appointed by the court, testified concerning his evaluation of Roach. Hawk met with Roach on six different occasions and spoke with Roach\u2019s parents and other family members. Hawk determined that Roach was of average intelligence and had mild depressive symptoms. Hawk found no indication that Roach had suffered any brain injury. He also found no evidence that Roach suffered from any serious mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Hawk testified that Roach lied to him about a number of things and gave him four different versions of what happened on December 3, 1993. He also stated that Roach was \u201cparticularly immature\u201d for his age. Hawk concluded that Roach had poor \u201cimpulse control\u201d and \u201cdid not show very good ability in many situations to control his emotions or behavior like seventeen-year-old or eighteen-year-old individuals should do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Hawk related Roach\u2019s immaturity to the fact that he did not get the guidance and the structure that children need to mature. Hawk further stated that Roach\u2019s probation violation for carrying a weapon was a result of this lack of structure and supervision. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>also testified that there was no pattern of violent behavior in Roach\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Hawk stated that, in psychological terms, Roach\u2019s act of killing a friend arose from the fact that \u201c[a]dolescents in conflict, adolescents in turmoil frequently express extremely strong and angry emotions with very little provocation ... If it\u2019s an immature adolescent, that sort of reaction is more extreme.\u201d Hawk stated that \u201cdisplacement of emotion\u201d occurs when one person or situation makes a person angry, but the feelings and anger are expressed toward someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Hawk stated, \u201cKnowing that this was a woman that [Roach] was close to, and knowing that there was not an existing pattern of this sort of violent offending, and considering what he told me, it\u2019s dynamics like that [which] would explain [the murder] in psychological terms.\u201d In addition, Hawk testified that, \u201c[i]n terms of normal development,\u201d impulsiveness diminishes and \u201cdoesn\u2019t cause problems for the person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">III. ARGUMENTS WAIVED</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Because Roach did not address in his briefs assignments of error 15(c), 16(f), and 16(h), he is deemed to have waived them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rule 5:27. Also, since Roach did not ask the trial court to strike certain prospective jurors for cause, after they heard another prospective juror state a belief that Roach was guilty, he has waived this objection to the empanelment of those jurors. Rule 5:25.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>IV. ISSUES PREVIOUSLY DECIDED</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Roach has advanced a number of arguments that we have rejected in previous decisions. Finding no reason to modify our previously expressed views, we will reaffirm our earlier decisions and reject the following contentions:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">A. The denial of a jury instruction that Roach would be required to serve a minimum of twenty-five years before becoming eligible for parole. In <em>Joseph </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 78, 84, 452 S.E.2d 862, 866, <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 204 (1995), we held that such an instruction is not available to defendants who will be eligible for parole at a future date.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">B. The trial court\u2019s refusal to limit evidence of juvenile and unadjudicated crimes as background evidence at sentencing. Rejected in <em>Beaver v. Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 521, 528-29, 352 S.E.2d 342, 346-47, <em>cert. denied, </em>483 U.S. 1033 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">C. The Virginia transfer statute does not provide individualized consideration of a juvenile\u2019s moral culpability and maturity. Rejected in <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>245 Va. 177, 182-83, 427 S.E.2d 379, 383-84 (1993), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>- U.S. _, 114 S.Ct. 2701 (1994), <em>aff'd, </em>248 Va. 485, 450 S.E.2d 361 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>_ U.S. _, 115 S.Ct. 1800 (1995); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 1, 7, 419 S.E.2d 606, 609, <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 958 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">D. The sentencing verdict form prescribed by Code \u00a7 19.2-264(D) renders the jury\u2019s option of imposing a life sentence unconstitutionally vague and obscures mitigation evidence. We rejected these contentions in <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 192, 215, 402 S.E.2d 196, 209, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 902 (1991), and in <em>LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 594-95, 304 S.E.2d 644, 661 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984). Thus, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to substitute Roach\u2019s proposed verdict form for the statutory sentencing verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-16\">E. The death penalty statutes do not give meaningful guidance to jurors that they may impose a death sentence only if they determine beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating ones. Rejected in <em>Breard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 68, 74, 445 S.E.2d 670, 674-75, <em>cert. denied, </em>_ U.S. _, 115 S.Ct. 442 (1994); <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 490-91, 331 S.E.2d 422, 438 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>F. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C) violates the defendant\u2019s rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution because the jury may find future dangerousness based upon unadjudicated crimes. Rejected in <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 766, 770, 284 S.E.2d 816, 817-18 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1038 (1982); <em>see also Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 341, 352, 385 S.E.2d 50, 56 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S. 1074 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">G. The capital murder and death penalty statutes as administered are unconstitutional for every reason cited by the majority in <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238 (1972). In <em>Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 615, 635-36, 292 S.E.2d 798, 810 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1228 (1983), we held that the Virginia capital murder statutes eliminated the constitutional violations identified in <em>Furman. </em>Further, in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 201, 212, 257 S.E.2d 784, 791 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1049 (1980), we rejected the argument that the Virginia death penalty sentencing statutes violated the restrictions of the <em>Furman </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">H. The death penalty statutes deny defendants meaningful appellate review and deny defendants equal protection of the law and due process of law because of the single tier of appellate review of death sentences. Rejected in <em>Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 460, 473-74, 357 S.E.2d 500, 508, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 933 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">V. PRETRIAL MATTERS</p>\n<p id=\"A2I\">A. Juvenile Court Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Roach contends that the statutes defining the authority of juvenile court intake officers violate the separation of powers clauses of the Virginia Constitution, Art. I, \u00a7 5 and Art. Ill, \u00a7 1. He asserts that, since intake officers are employees of the Department of Youth and Family Services, an executive agency, they are constitutionally prohibited from exercising the judicial powers of determining probable cause, issuing petitions or criminal warrants, or issuing detention orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Initially, we note that statutes are presumed to comply with the Virginia and United States Constitutions and will be declared unconstitutional only when their provisions plainly violate either document. <em>Etheridge v. Medical Ctr. Hosp., </em>237 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>87, 94, 376 S.E.2d 525, 528 (1989). In <em>Winchester &amp; Strasburg R.R. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>106 Va. 264, 55 S.E. 692 (1906), we stated that the separation of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government is \u201cindispensable to public liberty.\u201d However, we emphasized that the separation required by the Virginia Constitution is not an absolute separation. We held that the branches of government need not \u201cbe kept wholly and entirely separate and distinct, and have no common link or dependence . . . The true meaning is that the whole power of one of these departments should not be exercised by the same hands which possess the whole power of either of the other departments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 55 S.E. at 694 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The juvenile and domestic relations district court judges share appointment, assignment, and discharge powers over the intake officers with the Department of Youth and Family Services. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-233 and -235. In filing a petition to initiate a criminal case, the intake officer makes a determination that there is probable cause to believe that a juvenile has committed a criminal offense. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-260. However, the juvenile and domestic relations district court, not the Department of Youth and Family Services, has original jurisdiction over matters involving the delinquent juvenile. Code \u00a7 16.1-241. Further, the failure of an intake officer to file a petition does not divest the juvenile and domestic relations district court of jurisdiction over the juvenile. Code \u00a7 16.1-26Q(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Thus, juvenile intake officers do not exercise the whole power of the judiciary. Because such officers exercise only a limited judicial function, and the juvenile and domestic relations district court retains actual control over the juveniles, we conclude that the intake officer\u2019s authority to issue criminal petitions does not violate the separation of powers guaranteed by the Virginia Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Next, Roach argues that the circuit court acquired jurisdiction to try him only for the lesser included offense of first degree murder. He asserts that, since the juvenile court did not render a probable cause determination concerning the presence of aggravating circumstances supporting imposition of the death penalty, the circuit court did not acquire jurisdiction to impose the death penalty. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Before Roach could be transferred to the circuit court for trial as an adult, the juvenile court was required by former Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>\u00a7 16.1-269 (now \u00a7 16.1-269.1) to determine whether there was probable cause to believe that he committed an offense which would be a felony had it been committed by an adult. The aggravating circumstances required for imposition of the death penalty are not elements of the crime of capital murder. They relate only to the punishment authorized after conviction of the offense. Therefore, the juvenile court was not required to make a probable cause determination of the sufficiency of the evidence in support of the statutory predicates for imposition of the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">B. Bill of Particulars</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Roach filed a motion for a bill of particulars.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court granted the motion with respect to paragraph (f) involving unadjudicated allegations of misconduct and \u201cany circumstances of the offense [the Commonwealth] contends are relevant to proof of the [future dangerousness] factor.\u201d The court denied the bal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>anee of the motion. Roach argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of the remaining parts of the motion constitutes error based on the gravity of the penalty sought. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">A defendant is not entitled to a bill of particulars as a matter of right. Code \u00a7 19.2-230 provides that a court \u201cmay direct the filing of a bill of particulars.\u201d Thus, the trial court has discretion whether to require the Commonwealth to file a bill of particulars. <em>Quesinberry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 364, 372, 402 S.E.2d 218, 223, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 834 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">If the indictment gives a defendant sufficient \u201cnotice of the nature and character of the offense charged so he can make his defense,\u201d no bill of particulars is required.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Wilder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 145, 147, 225 S.E.2d 411, 413 (1976). The indictment in this case met that standard. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the balance of Roach\u2019s motion. <em>See Strickler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 482, 490, 404 S.E.2d 227, 233, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 944 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">C. Voluntariness of Roach\u2019s Confession</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Roach argues that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress his confession as being involuntary \u201cfor purposes of exposing him to the death penalty.\u201d Roach asserts that his waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was \u201cquestionable,\u201d and that he made his statements based on the mistaken belief that he would receive the benefit of a lesser penalty in exchange for admitting that he had shot Hughes. He contends that the statements were induced by Sheriff Morris\u2019s allegedly misleading remarks such as \u201cthe truth is so very, very important to you, to us and to yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">In assessing the voluntariness of Roach\u2019s statement, we apply a well-established standard of review. In <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 356 S.E.2d 157, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 873 (1987), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">A defendant\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights is valid only if the waiver is made knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 475. Whether a statement is voluntary is ultimately a legal rather than factual question. <em>See Miller </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 110, 106 S.Ct. 445, 450 (1985). Subsidiary factual questions, however, are entitled to a presumption of correctness. <em>Id. </em>at 112, 106 S.Ct. at 451. The test to be applied in determining voluntariness is whether the statement is the \u201cproduct of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker,\u201d or whether the maker\u2019s will \u201chas been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225 (1973). In determining whether a defendant\u2019s will has been overborne, courts look to \u201cthe totality of all the surrounding circumstances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 226, including the defendant\u2019s background and experience and the conduct of the police, <em>Correll v. Commonwealth, 232 </em>Va. 454, 464, 352 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1987); <em>Stockton, </em>227 Va. at 140, 314 S.E.2d at 381.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 324, 356 S.E.2d at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The record shows that Roach was of average intelligence, and that he telephoned Sheriff Morris to initiate the questioning. Prior to the interrogation, Morris advised Roach and Roach\u2019s father of Roach\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. Although John Roach was not present during the interrogation, both he and Steve Roach indicated that they understood the <em>Miranda </em>rights and they signed the waiver forms. During the interrogation, there was no mention of the death penalty at any time. Roach stated to Morris that he was making the statements of his own free will, without pressure of threats or promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">We also consider the factual findings made by the trial court. The trial court found that Roach \u201cwas not intoxicated [and] understood his surroundings and the questions asked of him.\u201d The court found that the interrogation atmosphere was not coercive and that Roach had not been threatened in any way. The court found that the entreaties to Roach to tell the truth did not overbear Roach\u2019s will. Because these factual findings are supported by the record, we accord them substantial weight in our determination whether Roach\u2019s statements were voluntary. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 112 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Based on the above evidence and findings, we hold that Roach\u2019s statements were voluntary. No threats or promises were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>made to induce the confession and there is no evidence indicating that the confession was coerced. Instead, the evidence demonstrates that the statements were the product of Roach\u2019s free and unconstrained choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">D. Venue</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Roach filed a motion for a change of venue on the basis that the crime, a \u201chigh profile\u201d murder in a rural setting, rendered the trial court unable to empanel an impartial jury. The trial court took the motion under advisement and, after the jury was empaneled, overruled the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Roach argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a change of venue because the pretrial publicity was widespread and prejudicial. He notes that over 50 percent of the jury pool was familiar with Roach, the victim, members of her family, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, or witnesses. The trial court observed, however, that although 31 jurors were stricken for cause, \u201ca large number of those were stricken because of their view concerning the death penalty and not because of any evidence of bias for or against the accused or the prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">A presumption exists that a defendant can receive a fair trial in the jurisdiction in which the offense occurred. <em>Stockton, </em>227 Va. at 137, 314 S.E.2d at 380. In order to overcome this presumption, a defendant must demonstrate that the citizens of the jurisdiction feel such prejudice against the defendant as is reasonably certain to prevent a fair trial. <em>Id. </em>Further, the decision whether to grant a change of venue lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>George </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 264, 274, 411 S.E.2d 12, 18, <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 973 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The fact that there have been media reports about the accused and the crime does not necessarily require a change of venue. <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 389, 407, 384 S.E.2d 757, 767-68 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1063 (1990). Another significant factor the trial court must consider is \u201cthe difficulty encountered in selecting a jury.\u201d <em>Mueller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 386, 398, 422 S.E.2d 380, 388 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 1043 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Roach did not overcome the presumption that he could receive a fair trial in Greene County. He concedes that only six members of the jury pool were so prejudiced by media coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>that they could not give him a fair trial. Given the relative ease with which the jury was selected, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Roach\u2019s motion for a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">E. Jury Selection</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Roach next argues that the trial court erred in refusing to strike for cause juror Breeden. During voir dire, juror Breeden testified that Daniel Bouton, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, formerly had represented him in a legal matter. Although Bouton was not representing Breeden in any matter at the time of trial, Breeden stated that he would regard Bouton as his personal attorney. Breeden also testified that his former connection with Bouton would not affect his ability to be impartial. Roach argues that this relationship presented an inherent conflict, and that Breeden was more likely to be influenced by Bouton\u2019s closing argument because he was accustomed to looking to Bouton for legal guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The trial court\u2019s decision whether to strike a juror for cause is a matter submitted to its discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the refusal constitutes manifest error. <em>Stockton, </em>241 Va. at 200, 402 S.E.2d at 200. Further, in <em>Calhoun </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 256, 263, 307 S.E.2d 896, 900 (1983), we refused to adopt a per se rule disqualifying a juror solely because the juror had been represented by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney at some time in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In the present case, the trial court had the opportunity to observe Breeden\u2019s demeanor when evaluating his statement that his ability to be impartial would not be affected by his former association with Bouton. Nothing in the record suggests that the trial court abused its discretion in accepting Breeden\u2019s statement that he could be impartial in the trial of the case. Thus, we find no merit in Roach\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">VI. GUILT PHASE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Roach argues that the trial court erred in refusing to set aside the verdict of capital murder based on the alleged absence of evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>dence corroborating his confession that he was the \u201ctriggerman.\u201d Roach asserts that his confession was inadequate as a matter of law to establish that he was the immediate perpetrator of the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In addition, Roach argues that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that the \u201ctriggerman\u201d portion of his confession had to be corroborated before he could be convicted of capital murder. He also assigns as error the court\u2019s refusal of an instruction defining a principal in the second degree, as well as its refusal of an instruction that only the immediate perpetrator of a killing can be convicted of capital murder. We disagree with the above assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The Commonwealth need not corroborate an entire confession, but it must corroborate the elements of the <em>corpus delicti. Watkins, </em>238 Va. at 348, 385 S.E.2d at 54. In the present case, the Commonwealth met its burden of corroborating the <em>corpus delicti </em>of capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The <em>corpus delicti </em>of a homicide consists of \u201cproof of the victim\u2019s death from the criminal act or agency of another person.\u201d <em>Swann </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 222, 236, 441 S.E.2d 195, 205, <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 234 (1994). The testimony of Dr. Kay, the medical examiner, established that Hughes died from a shotgun wound to the chest. There was no evidence that the wound was self-inflicted. Further, the Commonwealth produced evidence which tended to corroborate that Roach was the \u201ctriggerman\u201d in the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">The Commonwealth showed that Roach owned a 12 gauge shotgun and that he had shot number eight shot from it the day before the murder. The shot and wadding retrieved from Hughes\u2019s chest were consistent with the type used in Roach\u2019s weapon. The Commonwealth also produced evidence taken from Hughes\u2019s car including a number eight shot shell casing, as well as latent fingerprints which matched Roach\u2019s fingerprints.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">The <em>corpus delicti </em>of robbery, the predicate offense of this capital murder charge, was also corroborated by evidence independent of Roach\u2019s confession. The autopsy report revealed evidence of violent force used on Hughes, and the videotape from the automatic teller machine showed Roach attempting to use Hughes\u2019s credit card. Further, as stated above, latent fingerprints matching Roach\u2019s fingerprints were found in Hughes\u2019s vehicle, which was taken from the murder scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Since the Commonwealth sufficiently corroborated the <em>corpus delicti </em>of capital murder, the trial court did not err in denying Roach\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict. Likewise, the court did not err in failing to instruct the jury that Roach\u2019s confession that he was the \u201ctriggerman\u201d must be corroborated since the court had already correctly determined, as a matter of law, that the confession was sufficiently corroborated to go to the jury. <em>See Watkins, </em>238 Va. at 350-51, 385 S.E.2d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Finally, there was no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a jury instruction that only the immediate perpetrator of the killing can be found guilty of capital murder. There was no evidence that Roach acted with an accomplice other than the first version of his confession, which he later recanted. Also, since his theory that another person was the triggerman was unsupported by the evidence, Roach was not entitled to an instruction defining a principal in the second degree. <em>See Eaton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 255, 397 S.E.2d 385, 397 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 824 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">VII. PENALTY PHASE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"AAG\">\n<em>Juror Question</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Roach contends that the jury prematurely began deliberations during the penalty phase of the trial. In support of his claim, he notes that, after the jury had been instructed but before it began deliberating, one juror asked the trial court, \u201cDoes life in prison mean with no chance of parole or truly life in prison, or is he eligible for parole?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">At this point, Roach\u2019s counsel informed the trial court that \u201cunless the possibility can be excluded that this question originated solely with one juror, the defense would respectfully move for a mistrial.\u201d The trial court declined to question the jury on the matter, but gave the jury an additional instruction stating, \u201cHaving found the defendant guilty, you should impose such punishment as you feel is just under the evidence and within the instructions of the Court. You are not to concern yourself with what may happen afterwards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">We find no merit in Roach\u2019s claim. The question posed by the individual juror does not indicate that the jury had begun deliberating Roach\u2019s penalty. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the mistrial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Roach argues that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the meaning of the word \u201cprobability,\u201d in the context of the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d provision of Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. We disagree. In <em>Mickens </em>v. Commonwealth, 247 Va. 395, 403, 442 S.E.2d 678, 684, <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>513 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 307 (1994), we held that the word \u201cprobability,\u201d as it appears in the statutory context of the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate, is not ambiguous. Therefore, Roach was not entitled to a jury instruction defining that word. <em>See Lovisi v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 848, 850, 188 S.E.2d 206, 207, 208 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Roach next asserts that he was denied his Fourteenth Amendment right of equal protection, because he was refused an instruction informing the jury that, if he received a life sentence on the capital murder charge, he would not be eligible for parole for 25 years. In contrast, Roach argues, certain \u201cadjudicated recidivists\u201d are entitled to an instruction informing the jury that they would be ineligible for parole if given a life sentence for the same offense. <em>See Simmons </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>512 U.S. _, 114 S.Ct. 2187 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">As stated above, in applying the rule of <em>Simmons, </em>this Court has held that a defendant charged with capital murder is entitled to an instruction regarding parole eligibility only when (1) the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness is in issue, and (2) the defendant is <em>ineligible </em>for parole at the time he is sentenced on the capital murder charge. <em>Wright, </em>248 Va. at 487, 450 S.E.2d at 362. Since Roach does not contend that he was ineligible for parole when he was sentenced, he was not entitled to an instruction regarding parole eligibility. Moreover, Roach has not suffered a denial of equal protection from the refusal of such an instruction, because a non-suspect classification is involved here and that classification \u201crationally advances a reasonable and identifiable governmental objective.\u201d <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>450 U.S. 221, 235 (1981); <em>see Evans, </em>228 Va. at 481, 323 S.E.2d at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">When a \u201crecidivist\u201d is ineligible for parole at the time of sentencing on a capital murder charge, this fact is relevant to the issue whether \u201cthere is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d See Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2(1). In contrast, the fact that Roach would be eligible for parole in 25 years is not probative of this issue. This fact could do nothing more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>invite the jury to speculate on the effect incarceration might have on Roach. The elimination of such improper speculation provides a rational basis supporting the denial of the requested instruction. Thus, Roach\u2019s equal protection claim fails. See <em>Schweiker </em>at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\n<em>Standard of Proof for Future Dangerousness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Roach argues that, because this Court has never reversed a death sentence based on insufficiency of evidence of \u201cfuture dangerousness,\u201d \u201cVirginia cases articulate no standards to confine the reach of\u2019 that sentencing factor. Roach contends that such standards must be articulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">We disagree, because the conclusion Roach urges ignores the central purpose of Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2, that of individualized consideration of the defendant and the crime committed. Under the direction of Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2, the trier of fact may not impose the death penalty unless it finds \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt, upon consideration of all relevant evidence of the defendant\u2019s background, as well as the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced. This individualized consideration necessarily precludes the articulation of precise requirements for a finding of \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d Moreover, a defendant is protected from an unsupported finding of \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d by the right to appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence in support of that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\n<em>Sufficiency of Evidence of \u201cFuture Dangerousness\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Under Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2, the death penalty may not be imposed unless the trier of fact shall find one or both of two aggravating factors we have referred to as \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d and \u201cvileness.\u201d <em>Yeatts </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 121, 139, 410 S.E.2d 254, 265 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 946 (1992). In the present case, the jury found \u201cfuture dangerousness,\u201d meaning \u201cthere is a probability that [Roach] would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Roach argues that the Commonwealth failed to produce sufficient proof of his \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d He first emphasizes that the only expert psychological testimony at the penalty phase was given by Dr. Hawk, who stated that there was no pattern of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>violent behavior in Roach\u2019s life. Although he concedes that \u201c[a] 11 of [his] misconduct arguably involved potential for violence,\u201d Roach asserts that the Commonwealth never introduced evidence of any actual or threatened violence in his past behavior. He also notes that his misconduct occurred only during the period of his family\u2019s \u201cdisintegration.\u201d Further, given his difficult family background and the fact that he had only one probation violation prior to December 3, 1993, Roach asserts that the jury\u2019s finding of \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d is unsupported by the evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The evidence in the penalty phase showed that, within approximately a seven-month period prior to Roach\u2019s murder of Hughes, he had broken and entered a private residence, stolen a .357 Magnum pistol from that dwelling, committed two automobile larcenies, and violated a condition of his probation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">As this Court emphasized in <em>Yeatts,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">Burglary laws are based primarily upon a recognition of the dangers to personal safety created by the usual burglary situation - the danger that the intruder will harm the occupants in attempting to perpetrate the intended crime or to escape and the danger that the occupants will in anger or panic react violently to the invasion, thereby inviting more violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">242 Va. at 140, 410 S.E.2d at 266 (citations omitted). Thus, Roach\u2019s commission of burglary, and his theft of a .357 Magnum pistol during the burglary, were relevant evidence in determining his \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The jury also heard evidence from John Frey, Roach\u2019s probation officer, that Roach violated his probation in carrying a shotgun. Violent behavior arose from this probation violation when Roach used the shotgun to kill Mrs. Hughes. Therefore, both the fact of the violation and its particular nature were relevant evidence in the jury\u2019s determination of \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">Most significantly, this Court has recognized that the facts and circumstances surrounding the capital murder alone may be sufficient to support a finding of \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d <em>See Murphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 136, 145, 431 S.E.2d 48, 53, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>cert. </em>denied, 510 U.S._, 114 S.Ct. 336 (1993). Here, Roach killed a defenseless, 70-year-old neighbor because he wanted her money. He admitted that Mrs. Hughes had always been kind to him. Yet, after shooting her at point-blank range, he walked past her body, robbed her of her money and car keys, and left her lying on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">From this evidence, the jury was entitled to conclude that Roach placed little value on human life and was willing to kill even a defenseless friend in order not to be identified as the perpetrator of a robbery. Given Roach\u2019s escalating pattern of criminal behavior culminating in the murder of Mrs. Hughes, the jury had sufficient evidence from which to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was a probability that Roach would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Our conclusion in this regard is not altered by Dr. Hawk\u2019s testimony. Although he testified that Roach had no pattern of violent behavior in his life, the jury was entitled to weigh this opinion in conjunction with all the evidence of Roach\u2019s criminal behavior, including the facts and circumstances surrounding his robbery and murder of Mrs. Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Roach also argues that the \u201ctrial court erred [by] finding that no good cause had been shown to set aside the sentence of death and impose a sentence of imprisonment for life.\u201d In reviewing the record pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5, the trial court is vested with discretion, upon good cause shown, to set aside the sentence of death. Here, the record shows that the trial court reviewed all evidence presented in both mitigation and aggravation of the offense. Based on the evidence presented, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred in finding an absence of \u201cgood cause shown\u201d to set aside the jury verdict of death and to impose a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">VIII. SENTENCE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Under Code \u00a7 17-110.1 (C)(1) and (2), we are required to determine \u201c[w]hether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor\u201d and \u201c[w]hether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>A. Passion and Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Roach contends that the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor. In support of his argument, he restates several of the errors assigned above. Since we have found no error in the trial court\u2019s rulings, we reject this argument. <em>See Pope </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 114, 127, 360 S.E.2d 352, 360 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 1015 (1988); <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 322, 335, 337 S.E.2d 715, 723 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1112 (1986). Additionally, our independent review of the entire record fails to disclose that the jury\u2019s death sentence \u201cwas imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\u201d Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">B. Excessiveness and Proportionality</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Roach contends that the death sentence is excessive and disproportionate to those imposed in similar cases. He argues that comparable death sentence cases involve \u201cfact patterns more aggravated as to (1) surrounding circumstances of the offense, (2) age and background of the defendant and (3) unrebutted defense evidence offered in mitigation.\u201d With regard to evidence in mitigation, Roach relies primarily on Dr. Hawk\u2019s testimony and the other testimony concerning Roach\u2019s school, work, and family life.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">In conducting the proportionality review, we consider \u201cwhether other sentencing bodies in this jurisdiction generally impose the supreme penalty for comparable or similar crimes, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 445, 461, 423 S.E.2d 360, 371 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 1036 (1993). With this purpose in mind, we have compared the record in this case with the records in other capital murder cases to determine whether the death penalty imposed here is \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Here, the jury based its sentence of death only on the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate. Therefore, in making our proportionality determination we have given particular consideration to other capital murder cases in which robbery was the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>felony and the death penalty was based only on the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"AKd\">Those cases were compiled in <em>Yeatts, </em>242 Va. at 143, 410 S.E.2d at 267-68, and supplemented in <em>Chichester </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 311, 332-33, 448 S.E.2d 638, 652 (1994), <em>cert. </em>denied,_U.S. _, 115 S.Ct. 1134 (1995). The following additional cases involving robberies and findings of \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d were decided after <em>Chichester </em>and have been considered by us: <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 270, 455 S.E.2d 219, <em>cert. </em>denied,_U.S._, 116 S.Ct. 233 (1995); <em>Joseph, </em>249 Va. 78, 452 S.E.2d 862. We have also reviewed the records in capital murder cases in which robbery was the underlying offense and a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Based on this review, we conclude that, while there are exceptions, juries in this Commonwealth <em>generally </em>impose the death sentence for crimes comparable or similar to Roach\u2019s murder of Mrs. Hughes. Roach killed an elderly, defenseless friend with a shotgun at point blank range in the process of robbing her of a portion of her social security funds. This crime, like the other death sentence crimes we have reviewed, shows extreme cruelty and lack of respect for human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">In addition, although there was evidence in mitigation concerning Roach\u2019s status as a 17-year-old offender and his family background, the present case also involved significant evidence in aggravation of the offense. As stated above, Roach had been found guilty of four felonies in the seven-month period prior to the commission of this offense. Although he had been on supervised probation since August 1993, this rehabilitative measure did not deter Roach from carrying a weapon in violation of the terms of his probation. Moreover, his use of this weapon to kill Mrs. Hughes represented the ultimate failure of rehabilitative efforts on his behalf. Given this escalating pattern of criminal behavior, which culminated in the commission of the present offense, we conclude that the imposition of the death penalty in this case is neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in comparable cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">IX. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">We find no reversible error in the issues presented here. Having reviewed Roach\u2019s sentence of death pursuant to Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\u00a7 17-110.1, we decline to commute the sentence of death.
