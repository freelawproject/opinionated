Charles E. Smith Management, Inc. (CES) is a District of Columbia corporation with its principal place of business in Arlington County. Since 1990, CES has hangared and maintained an aircraft at National Airport. The purchase of the aircraft and all other transactions related thereto occurred outside the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">On March 4, 1991, the Department of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Virginia (the Department) assessed against CES an aircraft use tax of $300,000, a $75,000 penalty, and $34,084.93 in interest pursuant to Code \u00a7 58.1-1502. On March 20, 1991, exercising its right pursuant to Code \u00a7 58.1-1821, CES protested the assessment. On June 29, 1992, the Tax Commissioner ruled the assessment valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">Thereafter, under protest, CES paid the assessment, penalty, and accrued interest. On November 2, 1993, CES filed an \u201cApplication for Correction of Erroneous and Improper Assessments of State Taxes\u201d in the circuit court pursuant to Code \u00a7 58.1-1825 <em>et </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>seq. </em>CES asserted that the Commonwealth was without power to assess a use tax on aircraft hangared at National Airport and owned by nonresidents because the airport is a federal enclave ceded to the United States by the Commonwealth under the Act of Cession, Code \u00a7 7.1-10. Recognizing that subsequent enactments of the federal government had returned certain powers of sovereignty to the Commonwealth, CES further asserted that none of these powers permitted the assessment of the tax authorized by Code \u00a7 58.1-1502.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The Department filed a motion for summary judgment on August 16, 1994, and CES filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on September 1, 1994. The issues were briefed and the trial court heard oral argument. On November 21, 1994, the trial court granted the Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that aircraft hangared at National Airport are subject to licensure by the Commonwealth pursuant to Code \u00a7 5.1-5, and thus to assessment for taxation pursuant to Code \u00a7 58.1-1502. We awarded this appeal to review the action of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Code \u00a7 58.1-1502 levies a tax on \u201cthe use in the Commonwealth of any aircraft required to be licensed by the Department of Aviation pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 5.1-5.\u201d In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 5.1-5(a) requires that \u201cevery nonresident owning a civil aircraft based in this Commonwealth over sixty days during any twelvemonth period. . . shall, before the same is operated in this Commonwealth, obtain from the Department [of Aviation] an aircraft license for such aircraft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">CES apparently and appropriately recognizes that the Commonwealth has the power to enact a use tax on aircraft based at National Airport. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>United Airlines, Inc., </em>219 Va. 374, 387-92, 248 S.E.2d 124, 131-34 (1978) (holding that Commonwealth may assess use and sales taxes on personal property based at National Airport).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">However, since the Commonwealth conditioned such tax liability on an aircraft being \u201crequired to be licensed by the Department of Aviation pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 5.1-5,\u201d CES contends that it is not liable for the tax because the Commonwealth has no power to license aircraft based at National Airport. CES bases this contention on the claim that the power to license aircraft was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>not retroceded to the Commonwealth by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act of 1986 (the 1986 Act).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In response, the Department contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s right to require licensure of aircraft based at National Airport is a part of the police power that was retroceded to the Commonwealth in the 1986 Act. Thus, we must decide whether the Commonwealth\u2019s licensure of aircraft based at National Airport is a valid exercise of the police power retroceded to it in the 1986 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">To decide this issue, we consider the scope of the police power retroceded in the 1986 Act. Although CES claims that this power is limited to \u201cpublic safety, crime and law enforcement\u201d and \u201cincreasing safety and security,\u201d we did not so limit it in <em>Singleton </em>v. <em>International Ass\u2019n of Machinists, </em>240 Va. 403, 397 S.E.2d 856 (1990). There, we held that under its concurrent police power, Virginia courts could enforce Virginia\u2019s right-to-work laws as those laws pertain to private employment contracts at National Airport. <em>Id. </em>at 407, 397 S.E.2d at 859. And we think that the licensure of aircraft is clearly an exercise of the Commonwealth\u2019s police power. <em>See C.I.T. Corp. </em>v. <em>W.J. Crosby &amp; Co., </em>175 Va. 16, 21-22, 7 S.E.2d 107, 109-110 (1940) (licensure of nonresident\u2019s motor vehicle authorized under police power); <em>Board of Aeronautics </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>41 S.E.2d 506, 509 (W. Va. 1947) (regulation of aviation part of state\u2019s police power).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth, exercising its police power retroceded in the 1986 Act, could require aircraft hangared at National Airport to be licensed pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Code \u00a7 5.1-5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, CES\u2019s aircraft was taxable pursuant to Code \u00a7 58.1-1502.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">For these reasons, the judgment of the circuit court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\"> In pertinent part, the 1986 Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">The Commonwealth of Virginia shall have concurrent police power authority over the Metropolitan Washington Airports, and the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia may exercise jurisdiction over Washington National Airport.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Public L.

Nor do we agree that Code \u00a7 58.1-1502 \u201cmasquerade[s] as a police power regulation\u201d because a tax is assessed only on those airplanes subject to Code \u00a7 5.1-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
