That evidence appears in the following summary of their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">Ralph L. Anderson and Gladys C. Anderson, his wife, were close friends of Harvey LeRoy Dale, Jr., and Doris M. Dale, his wife, for a number of years before Mr. Dale\u2019s death in August 1990. The Dales had a daughter, Lynn Cheryl Dale Craver-Farrell, a resident of western Canada, from whom they were estranged.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">Six or seven months before his death, Mr. Dale asked Mr. Anderson to \u201clook out for [Mrs. Dale]\u201d after his death. Shortly after Mr. Dale\u2019s death following a lengthy illness, Mr. Anderson told Mrs. Dale that her husband had asked him \u201cto assist her as well as [he] could,\u201d and Mrs. Dale \u201cwas very well pleased about this situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Although the Andersons never gave Mrs. Dale any investment or financial advice, they provided substantial assistance to her for more than a year while Mrs. Dale was living at home following her husband\u2019s death. During this period, Mrs. Dale converted her four individual bank accounts and a bank certificate of deposit into multiple party accounts aggregating over $260,000 in her name and that of Mrs. Anderson, each of them being authorized signatories (the Dale-Anderson joint accounts). Mrs. Anderson testified that this was done to assist Mrs. Dale \u201cin whatever she wanted me to do.\u201d Although Mrs. Anderson filled out checks drawn on these accounts, Mrs. Dale signed each one. Later, Mrs. Dale added Mr. Anderson\u2019s name to one of the Dale-Anderson joint accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Mrs. Anderson testified that Mrs. Dale had repeatedly advised her that the money in the Dale-Anderson joint accounts was to be used for Mrs. Dale\u2019s benefit during her life, and that at Mrs. Dale\u2019s death, the funds \u201cwere to be used by my husband and myself, they were to go to us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Mrs. Dale fell and injured her leg in January 1992. Thereafter, Mrs. Dale was hospitalized or living in a nursing home until her death in December 1992. After Mrs. Dale was injured, Mrs. Anderson began filling out and signing all checks drawn on the Dale-Anderson joint accounts. The Andersons also took charge of Mrs. Dale\u2019s house and caused Mrs. Dale\u2019s mail to be sent to their house.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">From January 14 through May 4, 1992, Mrs. Anderson transferred the balances in four of the five Dale-Anderson joint accounts (the transferred Dale-Anderson joint accounts) to three joint bank accounts and one joint bank certificate of deposit, all solely in the Andersons\u2019 names (the Anderson joint accounts). Mrs. Anderson testified that Mrs. Dale had asked her to make these transfers \u201cbecause she figured there was still some way that [Craver-Farrell] could get her money and she wouldn\u2019t have any money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">There was no question in the Andersons\u2019 minds that these funds belonged to Mrs. Dale during her lifetime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Neither the funds, nor interest accumulating thereon, were used while Mrs. Dale was alive, either for the benefit of Mrs. Dale or the Ander<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>sons. Instead, the Andersons paid Mrs. Dale\u2019s expenses from the remaining Dale-Anderson joint account.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">On January 16, 1992, Mrs. Dale executed a general power of attorney naming Mrs. Anderson as her attorney in fact. On February 3, 1992, Mrs. Dale executed a will leaving all her property to Craver-Farrell and nominating Mrs. Anderson as executor of her estate. In both instruments, Mrs. Dale designated Mr. Anderson as Mrs. Anderson\u2019s successor.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Using the general power of attorney, the Andersons sold Mrs. Dale\u2019s car for $7,200 on August 31, 1992, and deposited the proceeds in one of the Anderson joint accounts. Claiming that Mrs. Dale had given her a number of articles of personal property, Mrs. Anderson removed items from Mrs. Dale\u2019s house both before and after her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Upon the Andersons\u2019 refusal to qualify as the executor or successor executor of Mrs. Dale\u2019s estate, Craver-Farrell qualified as administratrix c.t.a. of the estate. In that capacity, Craver-Farrell brought this action against the Andersons to recover the proceeds from the sale of Mrs. Dale\u2019s car, the items of personal property Mrs. Anderson had removed from Mrs. Dale\u2019s house, and the funds traceable to the transferred Dale-Anderson joint accounts and now held by the Andersons.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The Andersons filed an answer denying the substance of the plaintiffs claims and also filed a counterclaim seeking to recover the amounts of Mrs. Dale\u2019s funeral bill and other bills they had paid from the remaining Dale-Anderson joint account following Mrs. Dale\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">After hearing the evidence and argument of the parties in a bench trial, the trial court advised the parties that it would dismiss the counterclaim and require the Andersons to pay the plaintiff the proceeds from the sale of Mrs. Dale\u2019s car and to return certain items of the personal property Mrs. Anderson had removed from Mrs. Dale\u2019s house. After receiving briefs on the issue of the Dale-Anderson joint accounts, the trial court later entered judgment \u201cin favor of [the Andersons] on the Central Fidelity Bank account . . . , the Dominion Bank money market account . . . , the C\u00e9nit Bank certificate of deposit . . . , the Commerce Bank savings account . . . , and the Dominion Bank checking account. . . .\u201d These accounts are the transferred Dale-Anderson joint accounts and the Dale-Anderson joint account that remained on the date of Mrs. Dale\u2019s death. The plaintiff appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>that portion of the judgment dealing with the transferred Dale-Anderson joint accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Code \u00a7 6.1-125.5(A) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[s]ums <em>remaining on deposit at the death of a party to a joint account </em>belong to the surviving party ... as against the estate of the decedent unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intention at the time the account is created.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Since the transferred Dale-Anderson joint accounts had been closed prior to Mrs. Dale\u2019s death, the plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in applying the statutory presumption of survivorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">On the other hand, citing <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Bowdoin, </em>238 Va. 134, 140, 380 S.E.2d 904, 907-08 (1989), in which we applied the statutory presumption to an account subject to the statutory provisions, the Andersons claim that the trial court correctly applied Code 6.1-125.5(A). We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\"><em>Higgins </em>is inapplicable to this case because the amount in the <em>Higgins </em>joint account <em>remained </em>on deposit at the death of one party to the account. Instead, the principles of <em>Bennet </em>v. <em>First &amp; Merchants National Bank, </em>233 Va. 355, 360, 355 S.E.2d 888, 890-91 (1987), apply here. In <em>Bennet, </em>the contested funds no longer remained on deposit in a joint account subject to Code \u00a7 6.1-125.5(A) when one of the parties thereto died. For that reason, we refused to apply the statutory presumption in <em>Bennet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The Andersons assert that <em>Bennet </em>can be distinguished on its facts. First, they note the evidence in <em>Bennet </em>of the decedent\u2019s good relationships with the parties who would have received the funds if the statute did not apply. The Andersons then contrast that evidence with Mrs. Anderson\u2019s testimony of Mrs. Dale\u2019s estranged relationship with Craver-Farrell and of Mrs. Dale\u2019s intent that Craver-Farrell receive none of the funds traceable to the Dale-Anderson joint accounts on Mrs. Dale\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">We do not think that this distinction affects the question whether Code \u00a7 6.1-125.5(A) applies in this case. Our discussion of those relations in <em>Bennet </em>was material only in considering whether the survivor had sustained her burden of showing a gift of the joint investment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 361, 355 S.E.2d at 891-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Therefore, we conclude that the trial court erred in applying the presumption provided in Code \u00a7 6.1-125.5(A). Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment awarding the Andersons the principal amounts of the transferred Dale-Anderson joint accounts held by the Andersons at the time of Mrs. Dale\u2019s death. We will remand the case with instructions to determine the interest that has accrued on these amounts since Mrs. Dale\u2019s death and to enter a new order awarding judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the principal amounts and accrued interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\"> In the absence of clear and convincing evidence of Mrs. Dale\u2019s intent to give these funds to the Andersons <em>during Mrs. Dale\u2019s lifetime, </em>the funds would have belonged to Mrs. Dale during her lifetime under the provisions of Code \u00a7 6.1-125.3(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-10\"><em> </em>Without citation of any authority, the Andersons make a passing reference in their brief to Mrs. Dale\u2019s intention \u201cto make a gift of the funds' to Mr. and Mrs. Anderson.\u201d However, our review of the entire record fails to disclose a contention at trial by the Andersons that Mrs. Dale made an <em>inter vivos </em>gift of the funds traceable to the former Dale-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Anderson joint accounts. Accordingly, we will not address this contention, made for the first time on appeal. <em>Snyder-Falkinham </em>v. Stockburger, 249 Va. 376, 381, 457 S.E.2d 36, 39 (1995); <em>Eason </em>v.
