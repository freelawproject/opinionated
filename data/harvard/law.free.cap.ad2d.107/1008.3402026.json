Memorandum: In our view, the court\u2019s instruction on the issue of identification was sufficiently detailed to enable the jury to apply the correct rules of law. In any event, defendant did not properly take exception to the charge on identification (see <em>People v Whalen, </em>59 NY2d 273, 280). Moreover, the victim\u2019s identification of defendant was not the sole evidence connecting defendant with the commission of the crime but merely a part of the overwhelming case against him. (Appeal from judgment of Monroe County Court, Cornelius, J. \u2014 burglary, first degree, and other charges.) Present \u2014 Dillon, P. J., Callahan, Green and Schnepp, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
