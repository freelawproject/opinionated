ORS 163.225. A recitation of the facts would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public. It is sufficient to note that the trial court sentenced defendant as a dangerous offender, <em>see </em>ORS 161.725; ORS 161.737, to 280 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s sentence on Count 15 was legally erroneous because (1) the sentence did not include both a determinate and indeterminate term of incarceration and (2) the state\u2019s notice that it would be seeking a dangerous offender sentence was insufficient because the \u201cOregon Constitution requires that all essential or material elements of a crime be found by a grand jury and pleaded in an indictment.\u201d With regard to defendant\u2019s first contention, the state concedes that the trial court\u2019s \u201csentence is erroneous.\u201d We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>See State v. Isom, </em>201 Or App 687, 690, 120 P3d 912 (2005) (\u201c[A] correct sentence for a dangerous offender contains both a determinate mandatory minimum term of incarceration and an indeterminate maximum term, not to exceed 30 years.\u201d). With regard to defendant\u2019s second contention, we reject his constitutional arguments for the same reasons stated in <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>238 Or App 259, 242 P3d 692 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 655 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Reversed and remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
