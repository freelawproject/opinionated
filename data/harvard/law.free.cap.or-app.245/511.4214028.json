ORS 163.375; ORS 163.411; ORS 163.405; ORS 163.427. The victim of the crimes was a neighbor child who was approximately eight years old when the crimes occurred. On appeal, defendant raises numerous challenges to his convictions and sentences. We reject without discussion each of defendant\u2019s arguments except his argument that the trial court committed plain error by admitting into evidence expert medical testimony concerning a diagnosis of child sexual abuse. As explained below, because we conclude that any error in that respect is not apparent on the face of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Because defendant was convicted, we summarize the pertinent facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Gibson, </em>338 Or 560, 562, 113 P3d 423, <em>cert den, </em>546 US 1044 (2005). The victim, MH, regularly came to defendant\u2019s apartment to play with defendant\u2019s son when both children were approximately eight years old. Defendant and the victim\u2019s family became friends, and the victim was permitted to spend the night at defendant\u2019s apartment when his son was there. On several different occasions, defendant sexually assaulted the victim. The victim told her mother about the assaults, and the victim subsequently was interviewed and physically examined at The Children\u2019s Center, a private nonprofit organization that specializes in the assessment of child sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In her interview at The Children\u2019s Center, MH described the sexual abuse in a manner consistent with her later testimony at trial. After the interview was conducted, O\u2019Dell, a pediatric nurse practitioner employed by The Children\u2019s Center, examined the victim. She observed several irregularities in MH\u2019s hymen. In particular, she observed decreased hymenal tissue and what she described as \u201cangularities\u201d at several locations on the posterior of the hymen. O\u2019Dell testified that a person can be born with such irregularities on the anterior part of the hymen, but that irregularities on the posterior of the hymen can indicate a</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>penetrative injury caused by abuse or assault. Regarding the irregularities in MH\u2019s hymen, O\u2019Dell stated that \u201cjust looking at it by itself, yes, it would be significant to me.\u201d When asked if that type of finding \u201cis indicative of penetration,\u201d O\u2019Dell responded, \u201cYeah. It\u2019s suggestive of it, yes.\u201d She then explained that other types of injuries to a child\u2019s genital region, such as an injury caused by falling on a bicycle, would \u201cnot normally\u201d cause an injury to the posterior region of a child\u2019s hymen. O\u2019Dell explained that the physical findings were \u201csignificant\u201d because the victim\u2019s hymenal irregularities could have been caused by a penetrating injury. She testified that she made a diagnosis of child sexual abuse based on four factors: the history given to the Children\u2019s Center, the \u201cphysical examination findings,\u201d the existence of factors that may increase the risk of abuse, and MH\u2019s \u201cclear, detailed statements.\u201d On cross-examination, O\u2019Dell was asked if the irregularities in MH\u2019s hymen \u201ccould be a variation of normal\u201d or \u201ccould be something besides abuse,\u201d and she responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Defendant did not object to O\u2019Dell\u2019s testimony concerning her diagnosis. On appeal, he asserts that the admission into evidence of O\u2019Dell\u2019s diagnosis constituted plain error, citing <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 128, 218 P3d 104 (2009).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In <em>Southard, </em>the issue was whether expert medical testimony diagnosing a child with sexual abuse was admissible into evidence \u201cin the absence of any physical evidence of abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142. The alleged sexual offenses in <em>Southard </em>concerned oral sodomy; the medical examination of the victim \u201cdid not reveal any physical evidence of sexual abuse.\u201d Id. at 130-31. The physician who examined the child nonetheless diagnosed sexual abuse \u201cafter consulting with the social worker who had interviewed the boy[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132. As an initial matter, the court concluded that the medical diagnosis of sexual abuse was scientifically valid evidence, in light of the various factors set out in <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 687 P2d 751 (1984). <em>Southard, </em>347 Or at 133-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The court in <em>Southard </em>then turned to the question whether the evidence should nonetheless have been excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>as unduly prejudicial under OEC 403. The court determined that the medical diagnosis in that case did not tell the jury anything that it was not capable of determining for itself, because \u201cthe criteria that the staff used to decide whether to credit the boy\u2019s testimony are essentially the same criteria that we expect juries to use every day in courts across this state to decide whether witnesses are credible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140. On balance, the court assessed the risk of prejudice as great, because \u201cthe diagnosis came from a credentialed expert, surrounded with the hallmarks of the scientific method[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">\u201cOur holding today is narrow. The only question on review is whether a diagnosis of\u2018sexual <em>abuse\u2019 </em>\u2014 i.e., a statement from an expert that, in the expert\u2019s opinion, the child was sexually abused \u2014 is admissible in the absence of any physical evidence of abuse. We hold that where, as here, that diagnosis does not tell the jury anything that it could not have determined on its own, the diagnosis is not admissible under OEC 403.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Defendant relies on <em>Southard </em>and our subsequent decision in <em>State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 228 P3d 688 (2010), for the proposition that the admission of the medical diagnosis in the present case constituted plain error that obviates the necessity of preservation of the error before the trial court. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (an error is apparent on the face of the record if the error is one of law, the legal point is not reasonably in dispute, and the court need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it). In this case, we conclude that the legal point <em>is </em>reasonably in dispute, and, accordingly, we do not treat the unpreserved claim of error as error apparent on the face of the record. ORAP 5.45(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">As noted, <em>Southard </em>itself announced a rule that concerned an expert medical diagnosis of sexual abuse \u201cin the absence of any physical evidence of abuse,\u201d and it narrowly limited its holding to those circumstances. 347 Or at 142. The present case does not fall within the court\u2019s narrow holding. O\u2019Dell testified that her physical findings concerning MH\u2019s hymen were \u201csignificant.\u201d Indeed, she listed those findings as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>one of the four factors that contributed to her diagnosis of sexual abuse. Defendant remonstrates that our decision in <em>Lovern, </em>in which we held that admission of a medical diagnosis of sexual abuse qualified as \u201cplain error\u201d under <em>Southard, </em>supports his position. As explained below, we conclude that <em>Lovern </em>is materially distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">In <em>Lovern, </em>the defendant was convicted of multiple counts of first-degree sexual abuse, based on allegations that he had touched his 12-year-old daughter\u2019s vagina, breasts, and buttocks. <em>Id. </em>at 504. The victim was evaluated at a child-abuse assessment center, and a medical examination was conducted. The examining physician testified that the child\u2019s hymen was \u201cnon-specifically abnormal,\u201d explaining that there were notches in a part of the hymen, and that it \u201cwasn\u2019t perfectly normal but it wasn\u2019t specifically abnormal that I know for sure there\u2019s been an injury there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505. She described the condition as \u201cunusual\u201d but \u201cnot so specific that it indicates that there was clearly an injury there before.\u201d Id. Although the physician indicated that her diagnosis included consideration of the physical examination, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">\u201c[T]here is no relationship between the \u2018unusual appearance\u2019 of the complainant\u2019s hymen and the type of sexual abuse charged in this case; accordingly, [the physician\u2019s] general reference to the complainant\u2019s anal/genital examination cannot be understood to indicate reliance on that abnormality as corroborating the abuse alleged here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 506 n 2; <em>see also id. </em>at 511 n 6 (\u201cGiven the nature of the charged conduct, which did not involve penetration of the complainant\u2019s vagina, the results of the physical examination did not corroborate the alleged abuse.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">We concluded that there was \u201cno material legal distinction between the admissibility of the expert\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse in <em>Southard </em>and the admission of the diagnosis in this <em>case.\u201dLovern, </em>234 Or App at 510-ll. We noted that the expert herself had stated that she could not \u201creally tell one way or the other\u201d from the physical examination whether an injury had occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 511. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\u201cIn sum, as in <em>Southard, </em>the physician\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse in this case was based <em>solely </em>on the complainant\u2019s statements and history, without any physical evidence corroborative of the charged sexual abuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Defendant asserts that the challenged evidence in this case is comparable to the evidence at issue in <em>Lovern, </em>noting that both involved evidence of notches in the victims\u2019 hymens. We disagree. <em>Lovern </em>does not stand for the proposition that notches in a child\u2019s hymen can never be sufficiently corroborative of sexual abuse to cause a diagnosis to fall outside the \u201cnarrow\u201d rule of law announced in <em>Southard. </em>As noted, the alleged abuse at issue in <em>Lovern </em>was not the sort that would lead to penetrative injuries. The child in that case was 12 years old, and the expert certainly underplayed \u2014 if not rejected outright \u2014 any significance of the appearance of the child\u2019s hymen in making the diagnosis of sexual abuse. Here, by contrast, the child victim was younger, and the expert, O\u2019Dell, testified in great detail about the irregularities in the child\u2019s hymen and, indeed, she provided photographic evidence showing the exact nature of the irregularities that were significant to her diagnosis. She indicated that her findings were consistent with a penetrative injury to the vagina; as noted, the charged abuse in this case involved allegations of penetration of the victim\u2019s vagina. Moreover, and in marked contrast to the evidence at issue in <em>Lovern, </em>in this case, O\u2019Dell testified that \u201cjust looking at [the hymen] <em>hy itself, </em>yes, it would be significant to me.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although O\u2019Dell acknowledged on cross-examination that the irregularities <em>could have </em>been \u201ca variation of normal\u201d or caused by \u201csomething besides abuse,\u201d that caveat does not make this case comparable to <em>Southard </em>or <em>Lovern, </em>which, as noted, involved <em>no </em>\u201cphysical evidence corroborative of the charged sexual abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In sum, <em>Southard </em>left open the question of whether OEC 403 would require exclusion of medical testimony of child sexual abuse where physical evidence supports an expert\u2019s opinion. <em>Lovern, </em>likewise, left that question unanswered. We conclude that the legal point at issue here <em>is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201creasonably in dispute,\u201d <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355, and thus no error is apparent on the face of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\"> The trial in this case occurred before <em>Southard </em>was decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
