J.</author>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Defendant held his wife captive and then killed her as police were advancing. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of aggravated murder, ORS 163.095, first-degree burglary, ORS 164.225, and attempted coercion, ORS 163.275. He seeks reversal of those convictions, contending that the trial court erred in admitting several out-of-court statements of the victim as well as testimony regarding several statements that defendant made in e-mails to the victim. Defendant also asserts that the trial court improperly excluded testimony offered from a police procedure expert. We reject each of defendant\u2019s arguments,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The background facts in this case are undisputed. Defendant and the victim, Kelly Supanchick, met while both were serving in the armed forces. They married and later had a child, G, and eventually moved to Eugene, Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">After they had been married for approximately two years, the victim filed a petition under the Family Abuse Prevention Act (FAPA), ORS 107.700 to 107.735, for a restraining order against defendant. In the petition, the victim alleged that, in the previous month, defendant had threatened to beat her and also controlled what and when she ate. She further stated that a couple of years before defendant had threatened to \u201cslit [her] throat\u201d and that there were loaded guns in the house and she feared for her safety. The court issued the FAPA restraining order and, after being served with the order, defendant moved out of the family home and into his parents\u2019 house in Junction City.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">About a month after having been served with the restraining order, defendant went to the victim\u2019s house shortly after midnight. He dressed in military attire and brought with him a loaded shotgun, latex gloves, duct tape, and a large \u201cKa-Bar\u201d knife. Defendant used his keys to enter the house and, while still carrying the gun, entered the victim\u2019s bedroom, where he found the victim awake and reading in bed. He immediately bound the victim, putting socks (which he had also brought with him) over her hands and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>binding her hands together with duct tape. Defendant then offered the victim $1,000 and his car if she would leave the state after executing a document that would state that she was an unfit mother and had lied in the restraining order petition and that she would relinquish custody of G to defendant. Although defendant held the victim captive for several hours, she refused to agree to relinquish custody of G.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Defendant\u2019s parents eventually discovered that defendant was gone and had left G, who was visiting for the weekend, sleeping in the bedroom. After unsuccessfully trying to contact defendant and the victim on their cell phones, defendant\u2019s father and brother-in-law drove over to the victim\u2019s house to determine whether defendant was there. Although they knocked and shouted to the victim to come to the door, no one responded. Finally, defendant\u2019s father called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Defendant\u2019s father and brother-in-law informed the officers who arrived at the victim\u2019s house that they were concerned because they could not locate either defendant or the victim, and that the victim had a restraining order against defendant. The officers knocked on the doors and identified themselves as \u201cEugene police\u201d and also attempted to look in the windows. No one answered the door or responded. Eventually, an officer looking through the bedroom window saw the victim seated on the bed and called to her to come to the door. Looking \u201cterrified,\u201d the victim responded that she couldn\u2019t and that she needed help. The officer immediately went to the front door and began to attempt to kick the door in. As the officer tried to get into the house, defendant shot and killed the victim. Defendant was immediately arrested, and police later conducted a lengthy recorded interview of defendant regarding the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">During a search of the victim\u2019s house, police found several pages of the victim\u2019s handwritten notes. The notes stated, among other things, that defendant had controlled the victim\u2019s food intake and that on various occasions defendant had told the victim to \u201cbuy a wooden spoon so he could beat [her] with it,\u201d that \u201che\u2019d already dug the hole for [her] for when he \u2018got rid of [her],\u2019 \u201d and that he also threatened to \u201c \u2018slit [her] throat bilaterally.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Defendant was tried on charges of aggravated murder, first-degree burglary, and attempted coercion. He contended that he did not have the requisite mental state for murder and asserted that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). At trial, among other things, the recording and a transcript of the police interview of defendant after the killing, the victim\u2019s handwritten notes, and the restraining order petition and order were admitted in evidence, and both sides offered expert testimony. Ultimately the jury returned guilty verdicts, and the trial court entered a judgment convicting defendant on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">In his first, second, and third assignments of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting the victim\u2019s statements from her handwritten notes, a non-redacted copy of the restraining order petition, and a nonredacted copy of the FAPA restraining order. He asserts that the trial court erred in admitting those statements under the \u201cforfeiture\u201d exceptions to the hearsay rule. <em>See </em>OEC 804(3)(f) - (g). In his view, \u201cOEC 804(3)(f) (the murder forfeiture exception) is unconstitutional, and * * * under OEC 804(3)(g) [(the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception)], the state failed to sufficiently prove that defendant planned to murder [the victim] in order to prevent her from testifying.\u201d The state responds that the evidence was offered for non-hearsay purposes and that it was also properly admitted pursuant to OEC 804(3)(f) and (g). We conclude that the statements were properly admitted pursuant to OEC 804(3)(g) and decline to address defendant\u2019s contention that OEC 804(3)(f) is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The forfeiture by wrongdoing exception, codified as OEC 804(3)(g), provides that, if the declarant is unavailable as a witness, the following is not excluded as hearsay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">\u201cA statement offered against a party who engaged in, directed or otherwise participated in wrongful conduct that was intended to cause the declarant to be unavailable as a witness, and did cause the declarant to be unavailable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The trial court in this case evaluated the admission of the statements at issue pursuant to OEC 804(3)(g), which it understood to \u201crequire a foundation or a finding by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Court * * * that the defendant killed the victim with the purpose of eliminating her as a witness.\u201d The court found that such a purpose had been demonstrated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-4\">\u201c[T]he evidence so far suggests by a preponderance that that was a purpose. It\u2019s certainly unclear whether it was the primary purpose. I think that\u2019s very confusing as you read * * * the transcript and listen to the defendant\u2019s confession. He really is all over the board as to why this homicide was committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">\u201cBut I am satisfied that at least by a preponderance that was a reason for the * * * homicide and I think that that satisfies the requirement under * * * 804(3)(g). I don\u2019t think that that rule requires that it be the primary purpose. I think that it has to be a purpose, and I think that in all probability it is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Defendant challenges admission of the evidence under OEC 804(3)(g) on several grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">\u201c(1) the victim\u2019s statements did not qualify for admission under subsection (g), because the state failed to prove that the primary reason defendant murdered the victim was to prevent the declarant from testifying; (2) the admission of the statements violated defendant\u2019s right to confrontation under the Oregon constitution; and (3) in so far as subsection (g) is inconsistent with the federal rule or allows the introduction of the victim\u2019s statements without a proof [of] specific intent, then subsection (g) is also unconstitutional under <em>Giles[ v. California, </em>554 US 353, 128 S Ct 2678, 171 L Ed 2d 488 (2008)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Defendant also argues more generally that there is insufficient evidence that he \u201ccontrived his plan to murder the victim in order to prevent her from testifying.\u201d None of defendant\u2019s arguments is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">We first reject defendant\u2019s contention that, in order for OEC 804(3)(g) to apply, his wrongful conduct had to be planned with the primary objective of preventing the declar-ant from testifying. Under the statute\u2019s plain language, set forth above, the exception applies where a defendant (1) directed or participated in wrongful conduct; (2) intended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>by that conduct, to cause the declarant to be unavailable; and (3) did, in fact, cause the declarant to be unavailable. The text contains no requirement that the wrongful conduct be for the sole or primary purpose of causing a witness to be unavailable. Rather, the conduct need only be \u201cintended\u201d to cause that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">We likewise reject defendant\u2019s third contention, that unless the statute is read to include such a sole or primary purpose requirement, it violates the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as construed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Giles. </em>There, the Court considered \u201cwhether a defendant forfeits his Sixth Amendment right to confront a witness against him when a judge determines that a wrongful act by the defendant made the witness unavailable to testify at trial.\u201d 554 US at 355. The Court explained that the Sixth Amendment \u201ccontemplates that a witness who makes testimonial statements admitted against a defendant will ordinarily be present at trial for cross-examination, and that if the witness is unavailable, his prior testimony will be introduced only if the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him.\u201d 554 US at 358. The only exceptions to that confrontation right are those \u201c \u2018established at the time of the founding.\u2019 <em>\u201d Id. </em>(quoting <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 US 36, 54, 124 S Ct 1354, 158 L Ed 2d 177 (2004)). The common-law doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing constitutes such a founding-era exception to the confrontation right and permits \u201cthe introduction of statements of a witness who was detained or kept away by the means or procurement of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, to come within the exception, there must be a \u201cshowing that the defendant intended to prevent [the] witness from testifying.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361. The doctrine is essentially equitable in nature and is intended to remove the otherwise \u201cintolerable incentive for defendants to bribe, intimidate, or even kill witnesses against them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Thus, for the forfeiture rule to apply, it is not enough that a court find that a defendant\u2019s wrongful act made a witness unavailable to testify. Instead, the defendant must have engaged in wrongful conduct intended to prevent the witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>from testifying and, by such wrongful conduct, must have actually prevented such testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, however, the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Giles </em>does not suggest that his sole or even primary purpose in making the victim unavailable must have been to prevent the victim from reporting defendant to the authorities or testifying against him. Indeed, it would be \u201cillogical and inconsistent with the equitable nature of the doctrine to hold that a defendant who otherwise would forfeit confrontation rights by his wrongdoing (intent to dissuade a witness) suddenly retains those confrontation rights if he can demonstrate another evil motive for his conduct.\u201d <em>People v. Banos, </em>178 Cal App 4th 483, 504 (Cal Ct App 2009), <em>cert den, </em>560 US_, 130 S Ct 3289 (2010). Thus, we reject defendant\u2019s assertion that <em>Giles </em>requires us to read OEC 804(3)(g) to require that the sole or primary purpose of his wrongful act was to make the victim unavailable to cooperate with authorities or to testify in proceedings against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In addition, to the extent that defendant suggests that a defendant must somehow plan in advance his wrongful act with the intent to make the victim unavailable, we reject that contention as well. The Court in <em>Giles </em>explains at different points in the opinion that the wrongful conduct at issue must have been <em>\u201cdesigned </em>to prevent the witness from testifying,\u201d 554 US at 359 (emphasis in original), and that the defendant must have \u201cintended to prevent a witness from testifying,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 361. Both of those terms refer interchangeably to the specific intent that the court must find in order for a victim\u2019s statements to be admissible under the forfeiture exception. That is, where the court finds that a crime \u201cexpressed the intent\u201d to make the witness unavailable and thereby prevent the victim from \u201creporting [the defendant\u2019s conduct] to the authorities or cooperating with a criminal prosecution\u201d against the defendant, the victim\u2019s prior statements will be admissible under the forfeiture doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>In light of those conclusions, we also reject defendant\u2019s more general argument regarding the sufficiency of the evidence. As noted, the trial court found that one of defendant\u2019s purposes in killing the victim was to eliminate her as a witness \u2014 a finding that is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of OEC 804(3)(g) and the Sixth Amendment. We are bound by that finding of historical fact if there is evidence in the record to support it, <em>State v. Cook, </em>340 Or 530, 537, 135 P3d 260 (2006), and here the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Specifically, during an interview with detectives, defendant indicated that he had been concerned that the victim would call the police as a result of his violation of the FAPA restraining order. Further, when asked by detectives why he did not just let the victim go, defendant replied, \u201cBecause there had to be a better way, a better option than that. A better option because now I\u2019m gonna go to jail for whatever, for being \u2014 violating [the restraining order] and having a gun there.\u201d And in response to questioning as to why he had \u201cto shoot the gun,\u201d defendant responded that \u201cwalking out means going to jail and means my daughter goes to her[.]\u201d In light of those statements by defendant to police, we conclude that there is evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that one of the purposes behind defendant\u2019s wrongful act was to prevent the victim from participating in proceedings against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Defendant\u2019s final contention with respect to the admission of evidence under OEC 804(3)(g) is that the victim\u2019s statements \u201clacked reliability and were therefore inadmissible under Article I, section 11,\u201d of the Oregon Constitution. Article I, section 11, provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right * * * to meet the witnesses face to facet.]\u201d Out-of-court statements made by a declarant who is not testifying are admissible only if two requirements are met. \u201cFirst, the declarant must be unavailable, and, second, the declarant\u2019s statement must have \u2018adequate indicia of reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cook, </em>340 Or at 540 (quoting <em>State v. Campbell, </em>299 Or 633, 648, 705 P2d 694 (1985)). An out-of-court \u201cstatement is considered reliable when it falls within a \u2018firmly rooted hearsay exception\u2019 or when it is accompanied by \u2018particularized guarantees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Nielsen, </em>316 Or 611, 623, 853 P2d 256 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Defendant contends that the victim\u2019s statements \u201clacked particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d and that \u201cthe forfeiture by wrongdoing exception is not \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 and was only recently added to the evidence code in 2005.\u201d To the contrary, as we will explain, the exception is indeed \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d and, therefore, there need not be a showing of \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Accordingly admission of the victim\u2019s statements does not violate defendant\u2019s confrontation rights under Article I, section 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Defendant is correct that in 2005 the legislature adopted OEC 804(3)(g), thereby codifying the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception. Or Laws 2005, ch 458, \u00a7 1. However, as the Court detailed in <em>Giles, </em>the common-law \u201cdoctrine has roots in the 1666 decision in <em>Lord Morley\u2019s Case, </em>[6 How St Tr 769, 770-71 (HL 1666)], at which judges concluded that a witness\u2019s having been \u2018detained by the means or procurement of the prisoner\u2019 provided a basis to read testimony previously given at a coroner\u2019s inquest,\u201d 554 US at 359, and has been applied through the centuries following that case, <em>see id. </em>at 359-65 (discussing cases applying the doctrine in the 1700s and 1800s). Based on that history, the Court described the forfeiture doctrine \u2014 which, as noted, required the wrongful act to have been done with the intent to make the declarant unavailable \u2014 as an exception that was established at the time of the founding. <em>See State v. Page, </em>197 Or App 72, 80, 104 P3d 616 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 673 (2006) (recognizing the \u201clong-established exception to the Confrontation Clause known as the \u2018forfeiture by wrongdoing\u2019 rule\u201d); <em>see also Reynolds v. United States, </em>98 US 145, 158, 25 L Ed 244 (1878) (\u201cif a witness is absent by [a defendant\u2019s] own wrongful procurement, he cannot complain if competent evidence is admitted to supply the place of that which he has kept away\u201d); <em>State v. Kayfes, </em>213 Or App 543, 555, 162 P3d 308, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 690 (2007) (the \u201ccommon-law doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing rules bars a defendant from asserting the constitutional right to confront a declarant whom the defendant has caused to be absent from trial\u201d). Given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>centuries-long history of the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing, we conclude that the exception is \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d and, accordingly, admission of the victim\u2019s statements pursuant to the exception does not violate defendant\u2019s Article I, section 11, rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">We next turn to defendant\u2019s fourth assignment of error, in which he asserts that the trial court erred in allowing testimony regarding the content of e-mails he sent to the victim in which he called her a \u201cwhore\u201d and told her she was \u201cfat\u201d and \u201cdumb.\u201d That evidence was admitted during the state\u2019s cross-examination of defendant\u2019s psychological expert, Dr. Stanulis, who had reviewed the e-mails as part of his evaluation. According to the state, the e-mail evidence was properly admitted pursuant to OEC 705. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Defendant never asserted that he did not kill the victim; rather, his defense was that he had done so without the requisite mental state for murder. In support of that contention, he offered expert psychological testimony from Stanulis to establish that he suffered from PTSD.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As part of his extensive testimony, Stanulis testified that he diagnosed defendant as having PTSD and recounted the situations that had been sources of high stress or trauma for defendant, including circumstances he encountered in the military, the disintegration of his marriage following his discharge from the military, and being served with the FAPA restraining order shortly before the killing. According to Stanulis, PTSD played a prominent role in defendant\u2019s conduct on the day of the incident. As a result of feelings of helplessness, defendant \u201cretreated to what he knew best, his military training.\u201d Furthermore, defendant \u201cbelieved that [the victim] was not raising their daughter correctly\u201d and \u201cthat she was so disin-vested, he actually believed that the mother of his child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>would * * * give her up for $1,000 and a car.\u201d According to Stanulis, regression as a result of PTSD made defendant \u201cconfused, dazed\u201d and, in light of the perceived threat posed by the victim, he made \u201ca plan to rescue his daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">When asked about his view regarding what caused defendant to shoot the victim, Stanulis opined that defendant was \u201coverwhelmed by the noise and the stimuli,\u201d retreated to his military training, and shot the victim reflexively and without conscious thought. Stanulis believed that defendant, as a result of PTSD, shot the victim automatically and without any \u201cstate of mind.\u201d As part of his testimony, Stanulis described defendant as \u201cthe least likely person you would expect\u201d to kill the victim. His diagnosis of defendant was based in part on his conclusion that it made no sense for defendant to go to the victim\u2019s house in an attempt to pay her off in exchange for their daughter \u2014 \u201cthat it was a stretch of the imagination to imagine that, in fact, a mother would give up a child for $1,000 and a car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">On cross-examination, the state addressed Stanulis\u2019s view that defendant\u2019s plan to obtain custody of his daughter made no sense and was part of his PTSD. The state sought to have Stanulis discuss some statements made in \u201cnasty\u201d e-mails defendant had sent the victim, which Stanulis had reviewed as part of his evaluation. Earlier in the trial, the state had sought to introduce a packet consisting primarily of e-mails between the victim and defendant. The court analyzed them \u201con the probative value versus prejudice, consideration under OEC 403[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]\u201d and concluded that, \u201ctaken as a whole, these emails include a lot of material which are of dubious relevance, dubious probative value, even on the issues of state of mind of either party and certainly contain a lot of items that are * * * inflammatory and therefore very prejudicial.\u201d Therefore, the court ruled, \u201clooking at the documents as a whole, that the prejudice outweighs any probative value that they may have[.]\u201d However, it noted that, \u201cif the State wishes to identify specific portions which are more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>directly relevant to\u201d the issues presented, then it would reconsider its ruling as to those specific portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">When the state then sought to have Stanulis discuss several of defendant\u2019s statements in the e-mails as part of its cross-examination of the expert, the court permitted questioning in which the state sought to undermine and discredit Stanulis\u2019s testimony by exploring whether defendant\u2019s plan on the night of the murder was consistent with his opinion of the victim, expressed in e-mails months prior to the crime. Because the evidence consisted of \u201cstatements of the defendant upon which the witness has, in part, based his opinion\u201d and the state \u201cwas allowed to cross-examine within reason[,]\u201d the court allowed the inquiry, concluding that the probative value of that limited inquiry outweighed the prejudice. The inquiry went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">\u201cQ. And isn\u2019t it true that in your review of the emails, for a significant period of time the defendant evidenced his opinion of [the victim]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">\u201cQ. Okay. He would refer to her as a whore. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-9\">\u201cQ. Okay. That she was fat. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-11\">\u201cQ. Okay. And that she was dumb or unintelligent in some fashion or another?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-12\">\u201cA. Something to that effect. I don\u2019t recall the exact words, but that would be the tone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-13\">\u201cQ. Okay. And that was well before the restraining order.

If that is really how he believed about her, why isn\u2019t it a good plan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>\u201cA.

Even though she was a fat, dumb whore?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">\u201cA. And he also says he\u2019s going to come back and make it work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">\u201cq * * * j asked you if that\u2019s truly how he believed about her- \u2014 okay? If that\u2019s truly how he believed about her, then it\u2019s not a bad plan, is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">\u201cA. Well, obviously he believed it in the night. I\u2019m just telling you my reflection that I thought it didn\u2019t reflect the reality and I perceived the name calling as further evidence of the stresses and strains and the disintegration of the marriage, because he also came back and tried to make the marriage work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">According to defendant, the testimony was improper because he did not \u201copen the door\u201d to it and because the evidence was unfairly prejudicial and, therefore, its admission violated OEC 403. The state responds that, whether or not the expert was asked about the e-mails during direct examination, under OEC 705 the state was entitled to cross-examine the expert regarding that evidence. It also asserts that the evidence was not unfairly prejudicial. The issue, then, is whether the evidence was properly admitted on cross-examination in light of the fact that it was reviewed by the expert in evaluating defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Under OEC 705, an expert \u201cmay testify in terms of opinion or inference and give reasons therefor without prior disclosure of the underlying facts or data [on which the expert relied], unless the court requires otherwise. The expert may in any event be required to disclose the underlying facts or data on cross-examination.\u201d Under that rule, \u201c[a]fter the [expert] witness has offered an opinion, the opposing party may then seek to elicit the underlying facts or data on which the opinion is based and attempt to rebut or discredit the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>State v. Bigej, </em>77 Or App 18, 21, 711 P2d 189 (1985), <em>rev den, </em>302 Or 36 (1986). \u201cThe effect of Rule 705 is to allow the cross-examiner to bring out data upon which the expert relied, even if such information was not brought out or permitted to be brought out on direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>examination.\u201d Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Oregon Evidence </em>\u00a7 705.03, 640 (5th ed 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">In this case, there is no question that the e-mail evidence at issue was one part of the materials on which Stanulis relied in reaching his conclusions. Defendant\u2019s decision not to discuss the evidence with him on direct examination did not prevent the state from inquiring about that evidence under OEC 705. Instead, under the rule, the state could draw out information on which the expert relied in an attempt to rebut the expert\u2019s conclusion that, on the night of the killing, defendant\u2019s actions were a result of PTSD. That is what the state did here; it challenged Stanulis\u2019s conclusions about defendant\u2019s plan and state of mind with evidence about the defendant\u2019s attitude toward the victim many months before the crime. Under the particular facts and circumstances of this case, that was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Furthermore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the testimony at issue was not unfairly prejudicial under OEC 403. <em>See State v. Sparks, </em>336 Or 298, 308, 83 P3d 304, <em>cert den, </em>543 US 893 (2004) (the appellate court reviews \u201ca trial court\u2019s decision under OEC 403 for an abuse of discretion\u201d). \u201cUnder OEC 403, evidence introduced over a defendant\u2019s objection is not unfairly prejudicial simply because it is harmful to the defense.\u201d <em>State v. Shaw, </em>338 Or 586, 614, 113 P3d 898 (2005). Rather, \u201cthe critical inquiry is whether the evidence improperly \u2018appeals to the preferences of the trier of fact for reasons that are unrelated to the power of the evidence to establish a material fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Barone, </em>328 Or 68, 87, 969 P2d 1013 (1998), <em>cert den, </em>548 US 1135 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Here, as described above, the central issue was not whether defendant killed the victim; instead, it was whether defendant acted with the requisite intent for murder. Defendant\u2019s state of mind toward the victim and the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion regarding his mental state related to that central issue in the case. The trial court carefully weighed the competing considerations under OEC 403 and limited the state\u2019s inquiry regarding the e-mail evidence to a small number of statements that related to the expert\u2019s discussion of defendant\u2019s reasons for going to the victim\u2019s house on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>night of the killing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In light of the circumstances presented, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence in question.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Finally, in his fifth and sixth assignments of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in excluding testimony from Howard Webb \u2014 an expert in police procedure \u2014 \u201cthat the detectives who interviewed defendant after the shooting employed the \u2018Reid technique\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cit was his opinion that the responding officer\u2019s actions could have [had] an influence on defendant\u2019s mental state.\u201d We conclude that the court did not err in excluding that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">One part of the proposed testimony from Webb related to whether the police acted properly in attempting to break into the victim\u2019s residence after learning that she needed help. Webb would have testified that \u201centry in these circumstances * * * should be a last resort and under extreme circumstances.\u201d Furthermore, the testimony would have been as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">\u201cQ. * * * [According to accepted principles of police science, does breaking into the residence pose a threat of danger to the officer who himself breaks in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">\u201cA. Yes, absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-9\">\u201cQ. Does breaking into the residence pose a threat to the victim, the person who may be a hostage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-11\">\u201cQ. Does breaking into a residence pose a threat [to the safety of] the \u2014 to the hostage taker, the assailant or the suspect, whatever you may call it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\">\u201cQ. Is there a concern about whether breaking in the residence may have an effect or an impact on the state of mind of the hostage taker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">\u201cQ. What is that concern?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">\u201cA. Well, the concern is that you have someone who already is in, you know, fragile or unstable mindset, an emotional state. I mean that\u2019s \u2014 normal people don\u2019t arm themselves and go take people hostages, you know, unless they\u2019re caught in some kind of robbery situation. But in a domestic violence situation, you already have someone who\u2019s not thinking clearly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">\u201cQ. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">\u201cA. So any kind of action that could push this person over the edge, you know, forcing an entry when it was absolutely not necessary, could create substantial risk to everybody involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">After hearing argument by the parties regarding whether that testimony was admissible, the trial court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">\u201cNobody is denying that there was this protocol and that, for reasons that they explained, it wasn\u2019t used in this case. Getting into the reasoning behind the protocol would seem to be irrelevant and would go beyond \u2014 if you\u2019re trying to get to this specific defendant\u2019s state of mind, that is, did he act intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, I don\u2019t believe that witness can \u2014 your expert witness is qualified to testify to that. I think that requires a psychologist. Simply saying that it\u2019s a volatile situation and it might push somebody over the edge doesn\u2019t tell us a whole lot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">The court observed that the defense was \u201ctrying to show that the officers were somehow at fault in causing the death of the victim,\u201d and the defense agreed that it was: \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t done what they did, this case wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d The court explained, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-13\">\u201cthat\u2019s not an issue before the jury. The jury issue is: Did the defendant act \u2014 he\u2019s admitted that he did the shooting. So really the issue is did the defendant act with a reckless state of mind, did he act in order to further the burglary, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>he act intentionally, knowingly, and recklessly as the case may be if we get down to lesser included. I think going beyond and then asking this witness to comment on that goes beyond his expertise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Thus, the trial court did not allow the testimony to be presented to the jury. We review the trial court\u2019s relevance determination and its conclusion regarding the expert\u2019s qualifications as a matter of law. <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 315, 4 P3d 1261 (2000); <em>State v. Harberts, </em>198 Or App 546, 561, 108 P3d 1201 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 80 (2006). Based on that review, we agree with the trial court\u2019s reasoning and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Pursuant to OEC 401, relevant evidence is \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d As noted, there was no question in this case that defendant shot and killed the victim. The issue the jury had to decide was his mental state at the time of the killing; defendant argued that he did not kill the victim with the requisite mental state for murder. Webb\u2019s testimony was offered to show that the police might have been able to prevent the killing if they had proceeded differently or, as defendant put it, that, \u201c[i]f they hadn\u2019t done what they did, this case wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d However, that issue was not relevant to what the jury was called upon to decide \u2014 that is, it did not have any bearing on the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time he killed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Further, as the trial court noted, Webb was not qualified to testify regarding defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the killing. Under OEC 702, where \u201cscientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d Webb\u2019s training and experience was in police procedure; he had a bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice and was the director of a \u201cnonprofit law enforcement and public safety education training organization.\u201d He had been the director of a law enforcement academy, the director of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>training for a body armor manufacturer, and the \u201cuse-of-force expert and the chief defensive tactics and also survival expert for the State of Oregon.\u201d He had delivered extensive criminal justice instruction and also authored a large number of criminal justice programs. There is no question that he was qualified to testify regarding proper police procedures. However, Webb had no psychological or other education or experience that qualified him to render an opinion as to what defendant\u2019s state of mind was when he killed the victim. That was the issue before the jury. For those reasons, we conclude that the trial court properly excluded Webb\u2019s testimony regarding whether it was proper for police to attempt to enter the victim\u2019s residence under the circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Likewise, we conclude that the court properly excluded Webb\u2019s testimony regarding whether officers conducting the interview of defendant used the \u201cReid\u201d interview technique. According to defendant, that evidence should have been admitted because \u201c[wjhether the police employed a particular interview technique could be relevant to the voluntar-iness of defendant\u2019s statements.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) In particular, defense counsel asked Webb whether the detectives used the \u201cReid\u201d method when they interviewed defendant and Webb testified that there were differences in what detectives did in the interview and what the \u201cReid\u201d method would require, but that much of the interview \u201c[fell] in line with the Reid method of interrogation[.]\u201d The court excluded that testimony for a number of reasons: \u201cthe officer said he didn\u2019t use the Reid method[,]\u201d the \u201cexpert said [the officer] didn\u2019t use the Reid method,\u201d and,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">\u201cwe don\u2019t know what the Reid method is. We don\u2019t know why it\u2019s significant whether he used it or not. We have * * * the transcript and the * * * video of the interrogation. The jury can see what was done and what wasn\u2019t done. I don\u2019t understand whether * * * he used this method or that method, what difference it makes, unless there\u2019s some inherent showing that a particular method is unfair or * * * unprofessional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">The court further explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">\u201cthe evidence speaks for itself. You can say, Look, he asked these questions and that was designed to do this and fool <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>the defendant or confuse him or whatever. I mean that\u2019s before the jury. But it seems to me that this testimony about the Reid method without more- \u2014 which all we have now is the fact that the earlier officer said they didn\u2019t use it and [Webb] said he sort of did and sort of didn\u2019t \u2014 we still don\u2019t know anything about it, whether it\u2019s designed to do [something improper] or that it\u2019s just designed to get information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\">\u201cAt this point there\u2019s just no relevance shown to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">As set forth above, to be relevant, evidence must make some fact of consequence more or less likely than it would be without the evidence. In this case, defendant contends that the evidence was relevant to whether his statements to the police during the interview were voluntary. However, as the court noted, the testimony was simply that the officers did not fully follow the \u201cReid\u201d interview method, but that much of the interview was \u201cin line\u201d with the technique. The expert did not go through what the technique consisted of or explain why it might matter. He did not talk about what the \u201cReid\u201d technique is designed for or explain that there was something improper about it. Like the trial court, we conclude that the information offered would not make any fact of consequence more or less likely. Furthermore, we note that there was video and transcript evidence before the jury and that bare testimony that the interview was, in part, like the Reid method, without more, would not assist the jury in understanding that evidence or in determining the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\"> We reject without discussion all of the assignments of error raised in defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\"> The Court also discussed the application of the exception to abusive relationships, noting that, when such a relationship \u201cculminates in murder, the evidence may support a finding that the crime expressed the intent to isolate the victim and to stop her from reporting abuse to the authorities or cooperating with a criminal prosecution \u2014 rendering her prior statements admissible under the forfeiture doctrine.\u201d <em>Giles, </em>554 US at 377.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b685-6\"> Although defendant had not been in combat while in the military, Stanulis testified that defendant had been exposed to certain traumatic events. Specifically, defendant was assigned to work as a military tour guide in the Pentagon, and he held that job on September 11,2001. Although defendant was not present when the Pentagon was attacked that day, he arrived shortly after and thought \u201che might have died\u201d had he been present and also knew a person who was killed. Furthermore, according to Stanulis, defendant \u201cfaced repetitive, day-to-day exposure to a substance called anthrax that could have killed him\u201d because he had been assigned to test areas in the Pentagon and other government buildings for that substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b686-6\"> Pursuant to OEC 403, \u201c[ajlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b690-12\"> In addition, in response to an assertion from defendant that, \u201cif some of the emails become admissible, and specifically we\u2019re talking about the emails from [defendant] to [the victim], the emails from [the victim] to [defendant] should be admissible too,\u201d the court offered defendant the option of admitting the \u201cwhole batch\u201d if he so chose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b690-13\"><em> </em>With respect to balancing probative value with unfair prejudice, we also note that any prejudice from the evidence was limited given that, in his interview with police (which the jury had by video and transcript), defendant referred to the victim in a similar manner.
