J.</author>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction of three counts of violating a court\u2019s stalking protective order (SPO), ORS 163.750. Defendant assigns error to the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on Count 3 and the failure to give a requested jury instruction on Counts 2 and 4. Because the statement at issue did not constitute an unequivocal threat that would instill a fear of imminent, serious violence, we reverse as to Count 3. We affirm as to Counts 2 and 4 because defendant was not entitled to the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Defendant was charged in this case with four counts of violating an SPO.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The two SPOs at issue protected defendant\u2019s cousin, Chris Bae, and his uncle, Yoon Shin. The charges arise from a single incident in which defendant, while on his way into a courtroom for a second day of a trial for earlier violations of the same SPOs, contacted Bae and Shin. Count 3 alleged that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and recklessly engage in conduct prohibited by the order by speaking with * * * Bae, the said conduct having created reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of * * * Bae.\u201d Count 2 alleged that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and recklessly engage in conduct prohibited by the [SPO] by coming into the visual and physical presence of * * * Shin with the intent to intimidate * * * Shin,\u201d and Count 4 alleged that defendant engaged in the same conduct toward Bae.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We begin with defendant\u2019s challenge to the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on Count 3. In reviewing the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Hall, </em>327 Or 568, 570, 966 P2d 208 (1998). In that light, the facts pertinent to Count 3 are these. Shin, Bae, and Mintier, a Sheriffs deputy, were sitting in the hallway outside the courtroom before the second day of defendant\u2019s trial on previous SPO violations when defendant and his brother entered the hallway. Defendant, who was representing himself at the trial, looked over and, from a distance of about 40 feet, said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for grill session No. 2.\u201d He then walked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>past Shin, Bae, and Mintier. When defendant and his brother were near the courtroom door, about five feet from Bae, defendant turned and pointed at Bae. Using a harsh, angry tone and very stiff body language, defendant said, \u201cYou\u2019re going down today,\u201d and said that he would prove that Bae and Shin were the real criminals. Mintier was concerned that defendant was going to attack Bae and Shin, and another police officer who happened to be present believed that a fight was imminent. Bae also thought that defendant might engage in physical violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">On appeal, defendant contends that his words did not amount to an unequivocal threat that instilled a reasonable fear of imminent and serious personal violence and that was objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts. While disagreeing with the decisions, the state acknowledges that, under <em>State v. Ryan, </em>237 Or App 317, 239 P3d 1016 (2010), <em>rev allowed, </em>350 Or 130 (2011), and <em>State v. Nguyen, </em>238 Or App 715, 243 P3d 820 (2010), statements that are alleged to constitute a violation of an SPO must constitute unequivocal threats that instill a fear of imminent, serious violence. The state argues that \u201cdefendant\u2019s communicative conduct here constituted an \u2018unequivocal threat.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The state\u2019s argument about defendant\u2019s \u201ccommunicative conduct,\u201d however, is inconsistent with the way that Count 3 was alleged. As noted above, defendant was charged, based on a single incident, with violating the Bae SPO by \u201cspeaking with\u201d Bae (Count 3) and by coming into Bae\u2019s visual and physical presence with the intent to intimidate Bae (Count 4). The relevant question as to Count 3, therefore, is whether defendant violated the SPO \u201cby speaking,\u201d not whether some other aspect of defendant\u2019s conduct in conjunction with his speech, was sufficient to violate the SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Here, the words spoken by defendant were not the sort of unequivocal threat required to support a conviction for violating a SPO. We decline the state\u2019s invitation to revisit our decisions in <em>Ryan </em>and <em>Nguyen, </em>and we conclude that, in this case, defendant\u2019s statements did not constitute an \u201cunequivocal threat of the sort that makes it objectively reasonable for the victim to believe that he or she is being threatened with imminent and serious physical harm.\u201d <em>Ryan, </em>237 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Or App at 325. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">In defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred in declining to give his requested \u201cchoice of evils\u201d instruction as to Counts 2 and 4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant contends that he entered the visual and physical presence of Shin and Bae, as alleged in Counts 2 and 4, because he had to do so to avoid committing the felony of failure to appear in court. The state responds that, because Counts 2 and 4 charged that defendant came into Bae\u2019s and Shin\u2019s physical presence \u201cwith the intent to intimidate\u201d the victims, proving the intent alleged in those counts effectively negated a choice-of-evils defense. In the state\u2019s view, the jury found that defendant came into the victims\u2019 presence with the purpose to intimidate and thus found that his conduct was not justified. We need not reach the state\u2019s argument, because we conclude that the trial court correctly refused to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the requested jury instruction for legal error and review the evidence supporting the instruction in the light most favorable to defendant, who requested the instruction. <em>State v. Marsh, </em>186 Or App 612, 614, 64 P3d 1141, <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 655 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In the light most favorable to defendant, the incident occurred as follows. When defendant arrived for the second day of his trial, Bae and Shin were sitting with Deputy Mintier one foot away from the door to the courtroom. It was not possible for defendant to enter the courtroom without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>coming into the presence of Bae and Shin, although it was possible to enter without stopping and communicating with them. In defendant\u2019s version of events, as he and his brother were walking into the courtroom, defendant stopped very briefly to speak to Shin and Bae, asserting, \u201cYou guys robbed millions.\u201d Defendant\u2019s brother said, \u201cHaven\u2019t you ruined our lives enough?\u201d Defendant had no intent to intimidate. He did not point at Bae, and he was not aggressive or rigid in his stance. Defendant testified, \u201cI admit I screwed up when I made that comment, when I should have gone straight to court, but I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal because it was not a threat and the deputy was sitting there and there were other officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Defendant excepted to the failure to give the choice-of-evils instruction. The trial court had earlier explained, in the course of denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on Counts 2 and 4 on the basis of a choice-of-evils defense, that defendant had gone beyond the scope of conduct necessary to appear in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The choice-of evils instruction arises under ORS 161.200, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201c(1) Unless inconsistent with other provisions of chapter 743, Oregon Laws 1971, defining justifiable use of physical force, or with some other provision of law, conduct which would otherwise constitute an offense is justifiable and not criminal when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">\u201c(a) That conduct is necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">\u201c(b) The threatened injury is of such gravity that, according to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, the desirability and urgency of avoiding the injury clearly outweigh the desirability of avoiding the injury sought to be prevented by the statute defining the offense in issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">\u201c(2) The necessity and justifiability of conduct under subsection (1) of this section shall not rest upon considerations pertaining only to the morality and advisability of the statute, either in its general application or with respect to its application to a particular class of cases arising thereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>To assert that defense, a defendant must present evidence that \u201c \u2018(1) [his] conduct was necessary to avoid a threatened injury; (2) the threatened injury was imminent; and (3) it was reasonable for the defendant to believe that the threatened injury was greater than the potential injury of his illegal actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Miles, </em>197 Or App 86, 92-93, 104 P3d 604, <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 488 (2005) (quoting <em>State v. Seamons, </em>170 Or App 582, 586, 13 P3d 573 (2000); brackets in <em>Miles). </em>For conduct to be \u201cnecessary\u201d to avoid a threatened injury, the defendant must show that he did not have another available course of action. <em>Miles, </em>197 Or App at 93 (concluding that the defendant\u2019s act of possessing marijuana without a medical marijuana card was not necessary where the defendant had the alternative of obtaining a card); <em>see also Teague v. MVD, </em>124 Or App 25, 860 P2d 905 (1993) (deciding that the choice-of-evils defense to suspension of driver\u2019s license for driving while intoxicated was unavailable where it was possible to avoid the threatened injury by walking away rather than driving).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Here, defendant\u2019s admission that he could have entered the courtroom without stopping \u2014 thereby coming into the victims\u2019 presence for a more limited period of tim e\u2014 precludes any finding that defendant lacked an alternative to the \u201cevil\u201d at issue. Assuming without deciding that the other requirements for a choice-of-evils instruction were met, defendant exceeded the scope of the conduct necessary to avoid a failure to appear charge when he stopped to engage the victims. His conduct thus was not necessary to avoid the evil of failure to appear, and the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a choice of evils instruction was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Conviction on Count 3 reversed; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-7\"> Defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal was granted as to Count 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\"> Defendant requested Uniform Criminal Jury Instruction 1103, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">\u201cThe defense of choice of evils has been raised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">\u201cConduct that would otherwise constitute an offense is justifiable and not criminal when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">\u201c(1) The defendant\u2019s conduct is necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent injury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">\u201c(2) The threatened injury is of such gravity that, according to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, the desirability and urgency of the defendant\u2019s avoiding the injury clearly outweigh the desirability of avoiding the injury sought to be prevented by the law that makes <em>[insert charged </em>crime] a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-12\">\u201cThe burden of proof is on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this defense does not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
