In reliance on our opinion in <em>State v. Machuca, </em>231 Or App 232, 218 P3d 145 (2009), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>347 Or 644, 227 P3d 729 (2010), the trial court held that defendant had not voluntarily consented to the test and that there were no exigent circumstances that would justify a warrantless seizure of defendant\u2019s breath sample. We agree with the state that in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion reversing this court in <em>Machuca </em>and this court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Allen, </em>234 Or App 363, 228 P3d 606 (2010), the trial court erred in excluding the breath test results and the order suppressing the evidence must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Officer Kirk stopped defendant for the offense of reckless driving, and it is undisputed on appeal that he immediately thereafter developed probable cause to believe that defendant had committed the offense of DUII. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Machuca, </em>when an officer has probable cause to arrest a person for a crime involving the blood alcohol content of the suspect, \u201cthe evanescent nature of a suspect\u2019s blood alcohol content is an exigent circumstances that will ordinarily permit a warrantless blood draw[.]\u201d 347 Or at 657. In <em>Allen, </em>we applied the holding of <em>Machuca </em>to a breath test. 234 Or App at 364. We conclude for that reason that the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
