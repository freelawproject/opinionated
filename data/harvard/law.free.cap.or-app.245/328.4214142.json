J.</author>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Respondent in proceedings under the Family Abuse Prevention Act (FAPA) appeals, challenging the trial court\u2019s continuance of a FAPA restraining order pursuant to ORS 107.718. On appeal, as before the trial court, respondent invokes <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Dompeling, </em>171 Or App 692, 17 P3d 535 (2000), and contends that the evidence is insufficient under the standard of imminence that we endorsed in <em>Dompeling </em>to establish that respondent had \u201cabuse[d]\u201d petitioner within 180 days of the filing of her petition for a restraining order, ORS 107.718(1), by \u201c[intentionally, knowingly or recklessly placing [petitioner] in fear of imminent bodily injury,\u201d ORS 107.705(l)(b). We disagree and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The notice of appeal in this matter was filed after June 4,2009; consequently, and in the absence of any request pursuant to ORAP 5.40(8)(a) that we exercise our discretion to review this matter <em>de novo, </em>we decline to exercise our discretion to engage in such review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 19.415(3)(b). Rather, we review to determine whether \u201cany evidence\u201d establishes the requisites for the issuance of the FAPA restraining order. <em>See State v. B. B., </em>240 Or App 75, 77, 245 P3d 697 (2010) (reasoning, in the context of a mental commitment case, that, \u201c[p]ursuant to ORS 19.415(3), unless we exercise our discretion to review the matter <em>de novo, </em>we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact that are supported by any evidence in the record; we further review the court\u2019s dispositional conclusions, predicated on those findings, for errors of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Viewed consistently with that standard of review, the record discloses the following: Petitioner and respondent lived together for roughly eight years and have two children, who were ages three and four at the time the FAPA petition was filed in late May 2009. The parties\u2019 relationship was volatile long before the events that precipitated the filing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>FAPA petition. Petitioner recounted two incidents that antedated the 180-day period preceding the filing of the petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">\u201cWell, one night he pulled a gun while I was holding [one of the children] in my arms, put it in my hand and held it to his head and told me if I had any balls I would shoot him in the head. * * * The cops came out one night, he got on the phone with his buddy and said, \u2018We\u2019ll just throw her in the wood chipper.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In late March or early April 2009, approximately two months before the FAPA petition was filed, petitioner moved out of the family home in Sweet Home and began living in an apartment in Albany. The parties\u2019 children remained with respondent after petitioner moved to Albany. Respondent told petitioner that, \u201cif I ever take my kids from him that I would not be able to hide, that he would find me and he would kill me.\u201d Indeed, in the six months preceding the filing of the petition for a FAPA restraining order, respondent told petitioner a \u201cnumerous amount[ ] of times that he was going to kill me if I took my children and left.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The question of custody of the children became acutely contentious in late April. Respondent learned that petitioner had been dating another man, White; that White had pending sexual abuse charges against him in Linn County; and that White had been present when the parties\u2019 children had spent a night at petitioner\u2019s residence. Respondent filed a petition for custody of the parties\u2019 children on April 29, and petitioner was served with notice of the custody proceedings on May 2. Over the following two-week period, respondent sent petitioner several text messages that petitioner understood to threaten her with physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In particular, on May 4, respondent sent text messages to petitioner that read, \u2018You fucked up bad this time, I won\u2019t rest and neither will my resources,\u201d and \u201cLet the games begin, it\u2019s all over.\u201d Also on May 4, respondent drove by petitioner\u2019s residence and threatened White\u2019s cousin and, in petitioner\u2019s recounting, said, \u201c[I]f he helped us out in any way, he was gonna kill him and his family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>On May 12, respondent sent petitioner another text message that read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">\u201cOne chance to set it right. No guy friends, no Wal-Mart, no cell phone, no old friends. Think hard if you want your life back and what you\u2019re willing to sacrifice for it. No more games. Last shot or it\u2019s all over and not just us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Petitioner understood that message to convey a threat.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">On May 27, petitioner filed for, and the court issued, an <em>ex parte </em>FAPA restraining order. Respondent requested a hearing. At the conclusion of the testimony at the FAPA hearing, respondent\u2019s counsel argued that the evidence was insufficient to establish that respondent had \u201cabused\u201d petitioner within 180 days of the filing of the petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">\u201c[S]he needs to show that there was a threat to cause imminent bodily injury, and I do not get that out of the text messages, not any of the ones that she\u2019s alleged. And I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any statutory basis to issue the order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">In that connection, respondent\u2019s counsel explicitly and exclusively invoked <em>Dompeling </em>\u201cfor the proposition that imminent means immediate or close at hand.\u201d The trial court disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">\u201cI think that there! 1 [are] veiled threats in there. Based upon her testimony, which I believe, about violence in the past, I think those threats are legitimate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Accordingly, the trial court continued the FAPA restraining order, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">ORS 107.718(1) provides that a court may issue a FAPA restraining order on a showing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">\u201c[(1)] <em>that the petitioner has been the victim of abuse committed by the respondent within 180 days preceding the filing of the petition, </em>[(2)] that there is an imminent danger of further abuse to the petitioner!,] and [(3)] that the respondent represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner or the petitioner\u2019s child!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>(Emphasis added.) \u201cAbuse\u201d is defined, in turn, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">\u201cthe occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">\u201c(a) Attempting to cause or intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causing bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">\u201c(b) <em>Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly placing another in fear of imminent bodily injury.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">\u201c(c) Causing another to engage in involuntary sexual relations by force or threat of force.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">ORS 107.705(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">On appeal, respondent reiterates his contention before the trial court that the evidence was legally (and factually) insufficient to establish the requisite \u201cimminent\u201d threat constituting \u201cabuse\u201d within the meaning of ORS 107.705(l)(b). Respondent\u2019s argument in that regard reads, in its entirety, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">\u201cThere was certainly no evidence at all of any communication from [respondent] that could conceivably place [petitioner] in \u2018fear of imminent bodily injury.\u2019 There were some text messages that clearly related to the tensions raised by a prospective custody fight. The context and timing of the text messages were such that any reasonable person would understand them as showing frustration over the ending of a relationship and the beginning of a custody fight. This is especially true in light of the testimony concerning [petitioner\u2019s] post move out visits to [respondent\u2019s] house. It is also true in light of the fact [respondent] was concerned that [petitioner] was living with a person charged with a sex abuse crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">\u201c[Respondent] cited the case of [Dompeling] to the trial court. The court construed the word \u2018imminent\u2019 in this case. It found it to mean a threatened injury that is \u2018near at hand, impending or menacingly near.\u2019 171 Or App at 695. Again, there are no facts in this case that can be said to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that [respondent] committed abuse by placing [petitioner] in fear of imminent injury.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">(Record citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Thus, as before the trial court, respondent relies exclusively on the majority opinion in <em>Dompeling. </em>Respondent does not offer any analysis as to the content and construction of \u201cimminent\u201d beyond invoking and embracing <em>Dompeling. </em>Much less does respondent suggest that <em>Dompeling, </em>on which his position is predicated, was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In <em>Dompeling </em>\u2014 a juvenile delinquency case, which did not involve the issuance of a FAPA order \u2014 we construed the meaning of \u201cimminent\u201d for purposes of the crime of menacing. ORS 163.190. Specifically, we addressed whether the evidence there established that the youth had \u201cby word or conduct * * * intentionally attempted] to place [her mother] in fear of imminent serious physical injury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The facts in <em>Dompeling </em>were simple: The youth lived with her mother and became very upset after her mother unplugged the telephone to keep her from using it. 171 Or App at 694. In an escalating confrontation, the youth became more and more angry and told her mother, \u201cI wish you were dead, I um, I could stab you right now.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). A minute later \u2014 apparently after briefly disengaging \u2014 the youth returned and said to her mother, \u201cI thought about doing it while you were in your sleep.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The youth was subsequently adjudicated for engaging in conduct that would have constituted menacing if she had been an adult. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">On appeal, the youth\u2019s only argument was that her words did not embody or express the statutorily requisite threat of \u201cimminent serious physical injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695. As we explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">\u201c[y]outh reasons that she did not threaten to stab her mother immediately. Rather, youth argues that she only \u2018threatened to get a weapon and return, some hours later, and attack her mother after the mother had gone to bed.\u2019 Youth concludes that!,] because \u2018the threatened harm was not imminent,\u2019 the state failed to prove its case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">In <em>Dompeling, </em>we began by construing the pivotal statutory term \u201cimminent\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u201cWe look initially to the common understanding of the word. <em>See PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). Imminent is defined as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\">\u201c \u2018ready to take place: near at hand: impending &lt;our ~ departure\u00bb; usu : hanging threateningly over one\u2019s head: menacingly near &lt;in - jeopardy\u00bb &lt;this ~ danger\u00bb.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\"><em>\u201cWebster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary, </em>1130 (unabridged ed 1993) (capitalization omitted). Understood in its usual sense, the word does not require that the state prove a threat of immediate injury. It is sufficient if the threatened injury is \u2018near at hand,\u2019 \u2018impending,\u2019 or \u2018menacingly near.\u2019 Nothing in the remainder of the statute suggests that the word is not used in its usual sense, and youth does not argue that the constitution requires a more restrictive interpretation. <em>See State v. Garcias, </em>296 Or 688, 698, 679 P2d 1354 (1984).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">171 Or App at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Applying that definition, we determined that both of the youth\u2019s statements threatened the requisite \u201cimminent\u201d injury. <em>Id. </em>at 695-96. In that regard, we noted, in part, that \u201c[t]he threat of being stabbed within the next few hours is sufficiently near at hand to be imminent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>Dompeling </em>is not, of course, a FAPA case. Nor have we ever cited its construction of \u201cimminent,\u201d for purposes of criminal menacing, in the context of a FAPA appeal. However \u2014 and whatever the propriety or validity of the crosscutting linkage of concepts of \u201cimminent\u201d in the criminal menacing context with those in the FAPA context \u2014 it is apparent that in our FAPA precedents we have endorsed an understanding of \u201cimminent\u201d akin to that expressed in <em>Dompeling. See, e.g., Lefebvre v. Lefebvre, </em>165 Or App 297, 301-02, 996 P2d 518 (2000) (affirming issuance of FAPA restraining order where the respondent, who had engaged in no actual or overtly threatening physical violence, had, <em>inter alia, </em>engaged in volatile and \u201cobsessive\u201d conduct toward his estranged wife, including screaming obscenities at her in the presence of the parties\u2019 child, rummaging through her drawers and her garbage, making frequent hang-up calls to her house, calling her late at night and describing accurately what she was wearing to bed, and tapping at her window at 1:30 a.m.); <em>see also Cottongim </em>v. Woods, 145 Or App 40, 44, 928 P2d 361 (1996) (affirming issuance of FAPA restraining order where the respondent\u2019s conduct included telling the petitioner, his former girlfriend, that \u201che could not live without her and, if he were going to die, she should too\u201d and that \u201che would do anything he could to make [her] life hell\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\">Applying that construct to this case, and viewing the evidence and reasonable attendant inferences as we must\u2014 that is, in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s disposition \u2014 we conclude that the trial court did not err in issuing the FAPA restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Consistently with the trial court\u2019s disposition and its explicit finding that wife was credible in her testimony \u201cabout violence in the past,\u201d the record discloses the following salient circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>First </em>\u2014 as informative context of the parties\u2019 relationship \u2014 respondent had threatened to kill petitioner on numerous occasions antedating the 180-day statutory \u201cwindow.\u201d In one instance, respondent had told a friend that \u201c[w]e\u2019ll just throw her in the wood chipper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><em>Second, </em>within the 180-day period, including after petitioner had left respondent and begun dating another man (White), respondent repeatedly told petitioner that, if she ever tried to take their children, he would find and kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\"><em>Third, </em>again as context, after petitioner began dating White, and as respondent\u2019s preoccupation and animosity about that relationship heightened, on May 4, 2009, respondent threatened to kill one of White\u2019s relatives and his family if the relative supported petitioner and White in their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\"><em>Fourth, </em>also on May 4, respondent sent petitioner text messages saying, \u201cI won\u2019t rest and neither will my resources,\u201d and \u201cLet the games begin, it\u2019s all over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\"><em>Fifth, </em>and finally, on May 12, 2009, and in the totality of the foregoing circumstances, respondent sent petitioner the following text message:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">\u201cOne chance to set it right. No guy friends, no Wal-Mart, no cell phone, no old friends. Think hard if you want your life back and what you\u2019re willing to sacrifice for it. No more games. Last shot <em>or it\u2019s all over and not just us.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">Consistently with our prior FAPA decisions addressing and applying the \u201cimminent\u201d requirement \u2014 and with <em>Dompeling </em>to the extent that its construction is (as respondent urges) transferable to the FAPA context \u2014 those circumstances were legally sufficient to establish that respondent \u201cplac[ed] [petitioner] in fear of imminent bodily injury.\u201d ORS 107.705(l)(b). Specifically, regardless of whether respondent\u2019s conduct toward petitioner antedating the May 12 text message was sufficient, the trial court could properly determine that, in the totality of the circumstances, including respondent\u2019s repeated death threats, that message \u2014 and especially its final phrase (\u201cit\u2019s all over and not just us\u201d)\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>evinced the requisite imminence. <em>See, e.g., Lefebvre, </em>165 Or App at 301-02 (assessing the respondent\u2019s obsessive conduct in context of the petitioner\u2019s familiarity with the respondent\u2019s protracted obsession nine years before with killing his former employer); <em>cf. Dompeling, </em>171 Or App at 695 (for purposes of ORS 163.190, state need not \u201cprove a threat of immediate injury. It is sufficient if the threatened injury is \u2018near at hand,\u2019 \u2018impending,\u2019 or \u2018menacingly near.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">To be sure, under our former regimen of <em>de novo </em>review, we could have determined the matter differently. That is not because we would have, or could have, employed a different construct of \u201cimminent.\u201d Rather, it is because we could have drawn different reasonable inferences from the ominous, arguably ambiguous, final phrase of the May 12 text message.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But that is not the point: Rather, subject to limited exceptions not invoked here, we are no longer in the business of <em>de novo </em>review. Accordingly, we are not free to substitute our inferential assessment of the facts for the trial court\u2019s differing, but nevertheless reasonable, assessment. Thus, we affirm the issuance of the FAPA order.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We do so without addressing the substance of the dissent for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">First, the dissent bears no relationship to respondent\u2019s arguments before the trial court and on appeal. Respectfully, and with due appreciation for what is so clearly the product of careful thought by an esteemed colleague, the dissent is entirely a freelance exercise by the author. Its only point of even fleeting contact with respondent\u2019s arguments is <em>Dompeling </em>\u2014 which respondent embraces, and the dissent argues must be overruled. <em>See </em>245 Or App at 354, 361-62 (Armstrong, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">We fully acknowledge the dictates of <em>Stull v. Hoke, </em>326 Or 72, 77, 948 P2d 722 (1997), in matters of statutory construction. But <em>Stull </em>does not confer, much less mandate, a roving commission to reexamine our precedents that have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>construed and applied statutory language when no party has disputed those precedents. We recently reiterated that essential principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\">\u201cWe understand that, under <em>[Stull], </em>we are \u2018responsible for identifying the correct interpretation [of a statute], whether or not asserted by the parties.\u2019 That responsibility arises, however, only when the parties have put the issue of statutory interpretation before us by disagreeing as to what a statute means; in such situations, we are not limited to choosing the better of two erroneous interpretations. Here, the factual and procedural predicates for statutory interpretation simply have not arisen. Defendant loses, not because a correct interpretation of ORS 137.101(1) compels that outcome, but because she has not adequately preserved the argument that would have put the meaning of the statute at issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><em>State v. Shepherd, </em>236 Or App 157, 163, 236 P3d 738 (2010) (second brackets in <em>Shepherd). </em>So too here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Second, prudential principles of <em>stare decisis </em>compellingly militate against adopting the dissent\u2019s putative approach as the law of this court. That is so regardless of any abstract merit of the dissent\u2019s deconstruction of the provenance and linkage of common-law assault, the crime of menacing, and the FAPA statutes \u2014 matters, again, on which we imply no view. Rather, our transcendent prudential concern arises from the coincidence of three circumstances: (1) The dissent is, necessarily, predicated on its construction of \u201cimminent\u201d as used in the criminal menacing statute, ORS 163.190 \u2014 which, in turn, necessitates <em>overrulingDompeling; </em>(2) the state is not a party to this appeal; and (3) petitioner has never appeared on appeal. The upshot is that, if we were to adopt the dissent, we would be overruling our construction of ORS 163.190 in a case in which the state is not a party and cannot seek reconsideration or Supreme Court review \u2014 and, indeed, in which no reconsideration or review is ever possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>because petitioner has not appeared before us. There may be cases in which, even within the strictures of <em>stare decisis, Dompeling </em>might be revisited \u2014 but this is not one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Finally, we offer a practical observation that may, in its own way, partake of <em>stare decisis. </em>Over the years, as evidenced by our case law, trial courts have employed FAPA orders to defuse volatile, sometimes potentially lethal, domestic disputes. There is always the risk \u2014 which the present respondent emphasizes \u2014 of manipulation of that process, especially in the context of custody disputes. But the protective utility of FAPA orders, albeit imperfect, is patent. If the dissent were adopted, an estranged spouse could tell another, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you tomorrow,\u201d or \u201cIf you get custody, you\u2019re dead\u201d \u2014 and no FAPA order could issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">That would, presumably, be surprising \u2014 more likely, shocking \u2014 to the trial court judges and attorneys, including family law specialists, who litigate and adjudicate FAPA matters every day in Oregon courtrooms.

As I will explain, it errs in doing that because our cases have applied an erroneous understanding of the FAPA provision at issue here, ORS 107.705(l)(b), and should be disavowed. Based on a correct understanding of the applicable provision, the trial court erred in continuing the FAPA restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Petitioner and respondent lived together for roughly eight years and were the parents of two children, who were ages three and four at the time of the FAPA hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Petitioner moved out of the family home in Sweet Home and began living in an apartment in Albany two months before the court issued the restraining order. The parties\u2019 children remained with respondent after petitioner moved to Albany. According to one witness, who had lived in the family home during the six months before issuance of the restraining order, petitioner and respondent had interacted amicably for some time after petitioner had moved out, with petitioner periodically returning to the family home to visit the children and to have respondent fix her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Things changed when respondent learned that petitioner had begun dating another man, White. In particular, tensions escalated when respondent learned at the end of April 2009 that White had pending sexual abuse charges against him in Linn County and that White had been present when the parties\u2019 children had spent a night at petitioner\u2019s residence. Respondent filed a petition for custody of the parties\u2019 children on April 29, and petitioner was served with notice of the custody proceedings on May 2. Over the following two-week period, respondent sent petitioner several text messages that petitioner understood to threaten her with physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">On May 4, respondent sent text messages to petitioner that read, \u201cYou fucked up bad this time. I won\u2019t rest and neither will my resources[,]\u201d and \u201cLet the games begin, it\u2019s all over.\u201d Another text message stated, \u201cNice mole on right side of [White\u2019s] chin. Whore in Albany. No license. You can sure pick them.\u201d Because White has a mole on the right side of his chin, the text message led petitioner to believe that respondent was following her. However, a mutual friend of the parties subsequently testified that she had received a photograph of White as an attachment to a text message from petitioner and had forwarded the photograph to respondent. Petitioner further testified that respondent had driven by her residence on May 4 and \u201cthreatened [White\u2019s] cousin and said if he helped us out in any way, he was gonna kill him and his family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Petitioner and respondent had another conversation on May 12. Petitioner testified: \u201cOn May 12th[, respondent] had wanted me to come over and talk with him, that was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>only way I could see my children.\u201d That conversation included a text message from respondent to petitioner that read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\">\u201cOne chance to set it right. No guy friends, no Wal-Mart, no cell phone, no old friends. Think hard if you want your life back and what you\u2019re willing to sacrifice for it. No more games. Last shot or it\u2019s all over and not just us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Petitioner also testified that respondent had told her many times over the preceding six months that, if petitioner ever tried to take the children from him, he would find her and kill her. She also described the following events that had occurred roughly three years earlier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">\u201cWell, one night he pulled a gun while I was holding my three year old in my arms, put it in my hand and held it to his head and told me if I had any balls I would shoot him in the head. He has threatened to kill me [on] numerous [occasions]. The cops came out one night, he got on the phone with his buddy and said, We\u2019ll just throw her in the wood chipper.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">When asked by the court if respondent had caused petitioner any physical injury within the past six months, she responded, \u201cHe\u2019s gotten close to, but told me he didn\u2019t want to leave bruises on me as evidence.\u201d However, she did testify that, approximately five or six years earlier, respondent had \u201cgrabbed [petitioner\u2019s] head and was gonna slam it into\u201d some object.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court was \u201cmore convinced than not\u201d that there was \u201creason for the restraining order.\u201d Respondent objected that the text messages had not threatened petitioner with physical injury and, even if they had, that the threatened injury was not imminent, as that term is used in the FAPA statute. He further noted that petitioner had filed her petition for the FAPA restraining order only after having been served with notice of the custody proceedings for the children, in essence arguing that petitioner had sought the restraining order as a way to obtain custody of the children. The court disagreed, finding that there were \u201cveiled threats\u201d in the messages and that it believed petitioner\u2019s testimony \u201cabout violence in the past.\u201d The court entered an order continuing the restraining order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>for its full one-year duration, ORS 107.716(6), and also granting petitioner custody of the parties\u2019 children.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">After holding a hearing, a court may continue a previously issued FAPA restraining order if it finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">\u201c[(1)] the petitioner has been the victim of abuse committed by the respondent within 180 days preceding the filing of the petition, [(2)] that there is an imminent danger of further abuse to the petitioner[,] and [(3)] that the respondent represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner or the petitioner\u2019s child[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">ORS 107.718(1). Abuse is defined, in turn, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">\u201cthe occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">\u201c(a) Attempting to cause or intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causing bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">\u201c(b) <em>Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly placing another in fear of imminent bodily injury.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">\u201c(c) Causing another to engage in involuntary sexual relations by force or threat of force.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">ORS 107.705(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">Thus, for a FAPA restraining order to be continued in a case such as this one \u2014 involving infliction of fear of bodily injury rather than infliction or attempted infliction of such injury \u2014 the record must contain, among other things, evidence to support a finding that, within 180 days before the FAPA petition was filed, the respondent had engaged in conduct that had placed the petitioner in \u201cfear of imminent bodily injury.\u201d ORS 107.705(l)(b); ORS 107.718(1). In order to determine whether the record supports such a finding in this case, we must determine the conduct that the legislature intended ORS 107.705(l)(b) to cover. As I will explain, the development and legislative history of the FAPA statutes establishes that ORS 107.705(l)(b) applies to conduct akin to that proscribed in the crime of menacing, ORS 163.190, that is, conduct that occurs in a face-to-face confrontation that places the victim in fear of being promptly physically injured by the actor.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The Oregon legislature enacted the original FAPA statutes in 1977. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1977, ch 845, \u00a7\u00a7 3-8 (codified at ORS 107.700 -107.720 (1977)). The statutes were enacted as one part of a two-part effort to address domestic violence. The principal thrust of the effort was to alter the response of police officers to calls involving episodes of domestic violence. Typically, when responding to such calls, police officers would not arrest people \u2014 who most often were men \u2014 who had physically abused or were in the midst of abusing their domestic partners. Rather, they would try to defuse the conflict and offer help to victims, such as driving them to a motel or shelter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The solution on which the legislature settled to address that problem was to enact a provision that required police officers to arrest the abuser unless the abuser\u2019s domestic partner objected. The provision that the legislature enacted was added as subsection (2) to ORS 133.055 (1977), the statute that authorizes police officers to issue criminal citations to people accused of committing misdemeanors (or felonies that are subject to misdemeanor treatment) rather than arresting them. As originally enacted, subsection (2) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of [ORS 133.055 (1977) on issuing a citation in lieu of arrest], when a peace officer is at the scene of a domestic disturbance and he has probable cause to believe that an assault has occurred between spouses, former spouses or persons of opposite sex residing together or who formerly resided together, or to believe that one such person has placed the other in fear of imminent serious bodily injury, and unless the victim objects, he shall arrest and take into custody the alleged assailant or potential assailant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Or Laws 1977, ch 845, \u00a7 1 (codified at ORS 133.055(2) (1977)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The provision identifies two misdemeanors, assault and menacing, that would typically be committed during an episode of domestic violence and that, but for the provision, would not be crimes for which officers would be required to arrest the person committing them. One of the two crimes, assault, was identified by its name;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the other, menacing, was identified by its operative terms. <em>Compare </em>ORS 133.055(2), <em>with </em>ORS 163.190(1). The identification of the two crimes was an essential feature of the provision because the authority to arrest depends on the commission of a crime by the person to be arrested, so the statute had to identify crimes for which abusers could be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The second part of the two-part effort was to establish a procedure by which people who had been subjected to domestic abuse could protect themselves against further abuse by obtaining a court order imposing restraints on those who had committed the abuse. Athough it has since been modified, the procedure that the legislature established is the procedure by which a person obtains a FAPA restraining order. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1977, ch 845, \u00a7\u00a7 3-8 (codified at ORS 107.700 -107.720 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Critically, the 1977 legislature defined abuse for purposes of FAPA in terms of the crimes that it had identified in the provision that became subsection (2) of ORS 133.055 <em>(1977) </em>\u2014 viz., assault and menacing \u2014 together with the crime of attempted assault. As enacted, abuse was defined to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">\u201cthe occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">\u201c(a) Attempting to cause or intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causing bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201c(b) Placing another in fear of imminent serious bodily injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Or Laws 1977, ch 845, \u00a7 5(1) (codified at ORS 107.705(1) (1977)). <em>Compare id., with </em>ORS 163.160(l)(a) (fourth-degree assault), ORS 163.190(1) (menacing), <em>and </em>ORS 161.405(1) (attempt).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The linkage between the crimes identified in subsection (2) of ORS 133.055 (1977) and the conduct defined as abuse for purposes of FAPA was deliberate, as confirmed by the legislative history of the bill. As originally introduced, the bill that the legislature enacted to establish FAPA, House Bill (HB) 2438 (1977), identified \u201cassault or battery\u201d as the crimes that would give rise to an arrest under ORS 133.055 by police officers who arrived at the scene of a domestic disturbance. HB 2438, \u00a7 1 (1977). It did not include menacing as one of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The definition of abuse, in turn, included as conduct constituting abuse \u201c[p]lacing another in fear of imminent bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5. That definition tracks the conduct that constitutes the crime of menacing, except for the omission of the word \u201cserious\u201d between \u201cimminent\u201d and \u201cbodily.\u201d <em>Compare id., with </em>ORS 163.190(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">At a May 2,1977, work session on the bill, the House Judiciary Committee amended the language identifying the crimes in ORS 133.055 for which officers would be required to arrest people by removing the reference to \u201cbattery\u201d and replacing it with conduct constituting the crime of menacing. <em>See </em>Minutes, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 2438, May 2, 1977, at 2-5, 9; <em>id. </em>Exs 1 &amp; 2. <em>Compare </em>HB 2438, \u00a7 1 (1977), <em>with id. </em>(A-Engrossed). It also amended the definition of abuse to insert the word \u201cserious\u201d between \u201cimminent\u201d and \u201cbodily,\u201d thereby making the definition on placing a person in fear of bodily injury conform to the definition of the crime of menacing. <em>See </em>Minutes, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 2438, May 2, 1977, at 6. As reflected in the minutes of the hearing, the legal counsel for the committee, Dennis Bromka, confirmed to the committee the purpose of the amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">\u201cThe next amendment Mr. Bromka mentioned would insert \u2018serious\u2019 after the word \u2018imminent\u2019 on page 3, line 13 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>printed bill \u2014 to conform with the definition of the crime of \u2018menacing.\u2019 Rep. Myers moved for adoption and committee members present unanimously approved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><em>Id.-, see </em>HB 2438, \u00a7 5 (1977). The enacted version of the bill included those amendments to ORS 133.055 and to the definition of abuse. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1977, ch 845, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The evolution of HB 2438 confirms that the legislature sought to protect victims of domestic violence in two ways. First, it identified two misdemeanors, assault and menacing, that might occur during an episode of domestic violence and amended ORS 133.055 to require police officers who arrive at the scene of a domestic disturbance to arrest people who have committed those crimes during the disturbance. Second, it defined domestic abuse in terms of assault and menacing, together with the crime of attempted assault, and created a process by which people whose domestic partners have subjected them to domestic abuse could obtain a FAPA restraining order to protect them against further abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Since 1977, the legislature has amended the definition of abuse in two ways that are relevant to the understanding of that term. However, because the legislature originally defined the type of abuse at issue in this case in terms of the crime of menacing, it is necessary to identify the conduct that constitutes that crime before turning to the later amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The crime of menacing, ORS 163.190, was enacted as part of the 1971 revision of the Oregon Criminal Code. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1971, ch 743, \u00a7 95. Because the crime was derived from Oregon\u2019s criminal assault statutes, the evolution of those statutes provides important context for the menacing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Before 1971, Oregon\u2019s criminal assault statutes had remained essentially unchanged since their enactment in 1843. <em>E.g., State v. Garcias, </em>296 Or 688, 692, 679 P2d 1354 (1984). \u201cAt early common law, assault encompassed two separate concepts, the crime of attempted battery and the civil action for intentionally placing another in apprehension of an immediate battery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing R. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>117 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>(2d ed 1969)). By 1971, it was understood that the tort concept of assault \u2014 that is, conduct causing apprehension of an immediate battery \u2014 had been incorporated into the crime of assault in Oregon so that criminal assault included both \u201can act which reasonably puts one in fear of corporal injury\u201d and \u201can act intended to cause corporal injury by one who has the present ability to carry out such intent.\u201d Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 94, at 95 (July 1970) (hereinafter Commentary to Proposed Oregon Criminal Code).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The 1971 revision of the criminal code separated those two concepts. It did that by reorienting Oregon law to limit criminal assault to the infliction of physical injury. Under that approach, the crime of attempted battery \u2014 one of the two concepts embodied in common-law criminal assault \u2014 became the crime of attempted assault. <em>See id. </em>at 94-95. In turn, \u201cthe tort law derived concept of \u2018intentional creation of the apprehension of receiving a battery\u2019 [that] exist[ed] in * * * Oregon case law\u201d in 1971 became the crime of menacing. <em>Id. </em>at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The commission characterized the proposed crime of menacing as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201ca compromise between codes which equate an attempted battery with a tortious assault (Model Penal Code, 111., Minn., La.) and those codes which recognize no crime unless the actor intended to inflict a battery (Wise.). As an example: <em>X </em>with intent to frighten <em>Y, </em>points a gun at <em>Y </em>which <em>Y </em>thinks is loaded but which in fact is not loaded. Under the Model Penal Code such conduct would constitute a simple assault. ([Model Penal Code] 211.1 (1) (c)). Under the proposed draft and the New York and Michigan codes such conduct would constitute the lesser crime of menacing. The conduct would not constitute either assault or attempted assault since physical injury was neither inflicted nor intended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Commentary to Proposed Oregon Criminal Code \u00a7 95, at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The commentary went on to explain that the new menacing statute was \u201cintended to cover not only menacing physical acts but also threatening words unaccompanied by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>physical movement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For example, according to the commission, \u201c[t]he following conduct would be considered menacing: <em>X </em>stands with his right hand in his coat pocket and threatens to shoot <em>Y.\u201d Id. </em>Furthermore, the commission distinguished the crime of menacing from \u201c[conditional threats of violence made to coerce another to engage or refrain from engaging in conduct,\u201d because the latter conduct was \u201ccovered by the [proposed criminal code] section on coercion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Finally, the commission described the relationship of the proposed menacing statute to existing law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">\u201cOregon case law in defining assault includes the element of apprehension in its definition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">\u201c \u2018An intentional, unlawful offer of corporal injury to another by force, or force unlawfully directed toward the person of another, under such circumstances as create a well-founded fear of imminent peril, coupled with the apparent present ability to effectuate the attempt, if not prevented, constitutes an assault.\u2019 <em>State v. Linville, 127 </em>Or 565, 572, 273 P 338 (1928).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u201cBut as pointed out in <em>State v. </em>Wilson, 218 Or [575], 346 P2d 115 (1959) the act of placing one in apprehension of receiving a battery is not assault unless there is also the intent to inflict injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">\u201c \u2018... apprehension of injury on the part of the victim need not be shown to make out the crime. Further, it seems clear that an act done with the intention to <em>place one </em>in <em>apprehension </em>of <em>injury only </em>and <em>not </em>to <em>inflict corporal injury </em>would not constitute the crime of assault in this state. And too, according to the definition, an act done with the intention to inflict corporal injury but where the actor did not have the present ability to inflict corporal injury would not be a criminal assault.\u2019 <em>[Id. </em>at] 584.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">\u201cThe proposed draft, therefore, creates a new offense of menacing to cover the situation where the actor places or attempts to place another person in fear of imminent serious bodily harm and where serious injury is neither intended nor inflicted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Commentary to Proposed Oregon Criminal Code \u00a7 95, at 96-97 (emphasis in original). In other words, menacing is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>intended to cover assaultive conduct of the type described in <em>Linville, </em>that is, conduct creating \u201ca well-founded fear of imminent peril, coupled with the apparent present ability to effectuate the attempt,\u201d 127 Or at 572, but it does not require the actor to intend to cause physical injury, as required in <em>Wilson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">From that commentary and the provenance of the crime of menacing, it is apparent that the legislature intended ORS 163.190(1) to prohibit a person involved in the type of confrontation encompassed by common-law assault from putting another person in fear of imminent physical injury, whether by actions or words.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, ORS 163.190(1) requires that the person who is threatening another person with physical injury be engaged in a direct confrontation with the other person that puts the other person in fear that the confrontation will promptly culminate in a physical injury that the actor appears to have the present ability to inflict. It follows that the menacing statute\u2019s requirement of \u201cimminent\u201d physical injury was meant to capture a very short period of time \u2014 that is, the time that it would take a person who is engaged in a confrontation with another person to promptly follow through on an implied or expressed threat of violence made during the confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">That understanding of \u201cimminent\u201d is consistent with the imminency that was embodied in the civil tort of assault \u2014 from which the menacing statute was derived\u2014 when ORS 163.190(1) was adopted in 1971. In particular, that understanding of imminency in ORS 163.190(1) tracks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the treatment of the tort of assault in the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts. </em>Section 29 of the <em>Restatement </em>is entitled \u201cApprehension of Imminent and Future Contact,\u201d and it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">\u201c(1) To make the actor liable for an assault he must put the other in apprehension of an imminent contact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">\u201c(2) An act intended by the actor as a step toward the infliction of a future contact, which is so recognized by the other, does not make the actor liable for an assault[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 29 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The commentary to and illustrations for section 29 elaborate on the meaning of \u201cimminent\u201d in the tort of assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201cComment on Subsection (1):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">\u201cb. <em>The apprehension created must be one of imminent contact, as distinguished from any contact in the future. </em>\u2018Imminent\u2019 does not mean immediate, in the sense of instantaneous contact, as where the other sees the actor\u2019s fist about to strike his nose. <em>It means rather that there will be no significant delay. </em>It is not necessary that one shall be within striking distance of the other, or that a weapon pointed at the other shall be in a condition for instant discharge. <em>It is enough that one is so close to striking distance that he can reach the other almost at once, or that he can make the weapon ready for discharge in a very short interval of time.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">\u201cIllustrations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-11\">\u201c1.

That comports with my understanding of the imminency requirement in the crime of menacing. And, given that the crime of menacing was derived directly from the tort concept of assault, I am further persuaded that the word \u201cimminent\u201d in ORS 163.190(1) was meant to capture a victim\u2019s fear that, during a face-to-face confrontation with another person, the other person will promptly physically injure the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">I recognize that we applied a different understanding of ORS 163.190(1) in <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Dompeling, </em>171 Or App 692, 17 P3d 535 (2000). In <em>Dompeling, </em>a youth was found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for conduct constituting the crime of menacing, based on threatening statements that she had made to her mother after</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u201cher mother had unplugged the telephone to keep youth from using it. When asked what [had] occurred that evening, mother testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">\u201c Well, she came into the bathroom and said that she wanted to use the phone. And when I said no, she got more angry, and more angry, and she finally just came in and said, \u201cI wish you were dead, I um, I could stab you right now.\u201d And then she came back a minute later, and said, \u201cI thought about doing it while you were in your sleep.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 694. The youth contended on appeal that neither of her threats constituted a threat of \u201cimminent injury\u201d under the menacing statute and, hence, that the juvenile court had erred in finding her to be within its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">To resolve the issue, we looked to the common understanding of the word \u201cimminent\u201d and concluded, based on dictionary definitions, that a threatened injury is imminent if it is \u201c \u2018near at hand,\u2019 \u2018impending,\u2019 or \u2018menacingly near.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695. Based on that understanding, we considered whether either of the two statements that the youth had made to her mother had threatened her mother with imminent serious physical injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">\u201cShe stated initially, T could stab you right now.\u2019 Youth does not dispute that she intended to place her mother in fear of serious physical harm, and her use of the words \u2018right now\u2019 makes the threatened injury imminent. The fact that youth did not have a knife in her hand when she made that statement does not cause us to reach a different conclusion. Youth\u2019s second statement also threatened imminent injury. It was approximately eight o\u2019clock in the evening when youth told her mother that she could stab her in her sleep. The threat of being stabbed within the next few hours is sufficiently near at hand to be imminent. The trial court correctly held that youth [had] attempted to put her mother in fear of imminent serious physical injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 695-96 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">As that discussion indicates, we interpreted the menacing statute without considering the history behind it and the commentary of the Criminal Law Commission that explained the statute\u2019s derivation from, and relationship to, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>common-law assault. In light of those sources, it is evident that we erred in <em>Dompeling </em>in relying on dictionary definitions of \u201cimminent\u201d to determine the reach of the menacing statute, because it led us to apply the statute to conduct that is not covered by <em>it </em>\u2014 viz., the statements made by the youth in the case. The fact that the youth did not have a knife with her in the bathroom means that she could not have promptly acted on her first threat to stab her mother, because she did not have the \u201capparent present ability\u201d to do that. The youth\u2019s second statement to her mother \u2014 that the youth had thought about stabbing her after she had gone to sleep, that is, several hours after the youth made the statement \u2014 also did not constitute menacing, both because the youth did not have a knife and because of the several-hour interval between the statement and the threatened action. The youth\u2019s statements might be understood to have threatened her mother with physical injury if she did not allow the youth to use the telephone and, hence, to have constituted attempted coercion,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but they did not constitute menacing.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">We do not overrule a case \u201c \u2018unless error is plainly shown to exist.\u2019 \u201d <em>Newell v. Weston, </em>156 Or App 371, 380, 965 P2d 1039 (1998), <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 318 (1999) (quoting <em>Multnomah County v. Sliker, </em>10 Or 65, 66 (1881)). That standard is met here because it is plain that we erred in our interpretation of ORS 163.190(1) in Dompeling.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We should correct our error by overruling <em>Dompeling </em>in this case because a correct understanding of the FAPA provision at issue depends on a correct understanding of the menacing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>In light of a correct understanding of the menacing statute, ORS 163.190(1), and the 1977 Legislative Assembly\u2019s decision to base the definition of abuse in ORS 107.705(l)(b) on the crime of menacing, it follows that, in order to commit abuse under ORS 107.705(l)(b), the actor must place the victim in fear that, during a direct interaction between the actor and the victim, the actor will promptly physically injure the victim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">As noted earlier, the legislature has amended the definition of abuse in ORS 107.705(l)(b) in two respects since 1977. Neither of those amendments affects my understanding of the statute for purposes of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The first change was made in 1981 to add the mental states \u201cintentionally, knowingly or recklessly\u201d to the definition of abuse in ORS 107.705(l)(b). The impetus for that change came from Judge Albin Norblad, who testified about several bills pending before the 1981 legislature, including House Bill (HB) 2104, and expressed his concern about the mental state that a petitioner had to prove in order to prove abuse under ORS 107.705(l)(b). He explained that the Marion County Circuit Court had relied on the crime of menacing to require FAPA petitioners alleging abuse under ORS 107.705(l)(b) to include an allegation that the alleged abuser had \u201cintentionally\u201d placed the petitioner in fear of imminent serious physical injury. <em>See </em>Minutes, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 2104, Feb 27, 1979, at 3 (statement of Judge Albin Norblad). He questioned whether that was the appropriate mental state to use under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The House Judiciary Committee responded to the question raised by Judge Norblad by amending HB 2104 to insert into ORS 107.705(l)(b) the same mental states listed for assault in the FAPA definition of abuse in ORS 107.705(l)(a), <em>viz., </em>\u201cintentionally, knowingly or recklessly.\u201d <em>Compare </em>HB 2104 (1981), <em>with </em>Or Laws 1979, ch 161. In making that change, nothing suggests that the 1981 legislature intended to alter the core feature of abuse under ORS <em>107.705(l)(b) </em>\u2014 viz., that the person placing another person in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>fear of imminent physical injury has done so in a direct confrontation that puts the other person in fear that the confrontation 'will promptly culminate in a physical injury that the actor appears to have the present ability to inflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The second change was made in 1999 through Senate Bill (SB) 318 to remove the word \u201cserious\u201d from the definition of abuse in ORS 107.705(l)(b). The impetus for that change came from Judge Stephen Herrell of the Multnomah County Circuit Court, who noted that the definition of serious physical injury in the criminal code, which is the definition applicable to the crime of menacing, required an injury that \u201c \u2018creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious and * * * protracted impairment of health or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ.\u2019 \u201d Testimony, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Civil Law, SB 318, May 12, 1999, Ex A (statement of Judge Stephen Herrell) (quoting ORS 161.015(8)). He said that that standard seemed to him \u201cto be a ridiculously high standard for [a] petitioner to have to meet.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The legislature agreed with Judge Herrell and amended ORS 107.705(l)(b) to remove the word \u201cserious\u201d from the definition of abuse. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1999, ch 1052, \u00a7 12. That change altered the extent of the threatened physical injury that constitutes abuse under FAPA, but not the circumstances in which the threat of injury must occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Finally, the meaning of \u201cimminent\u201d in ORS 107.705(l)(b) is not affected by the different meaning of \u201cimminent\u201d in two other FAPA statutes, ORS 107.710(1) and ORS 107.718. As I -will explain, the use of \u201cimminent\u201d in the latter statutes was intended by the 1999 legislature \u2014 which used that term in amending those statutes \u2014 to mean an interval of time that is different from the interval embodied in the definition of abuse in ORS 107.705(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">ORS 107.710(1) provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\u201cAny person who has been the victim of abuse within the preceding 180 days may petition the circuit court for relief under ORS 107.700 to 107.735, if the person is in <em>imminent danger </em>of <em>further </em>abuse from the abuser. The person may seek relief by filing a petition with the circuit court alleging that the person is in <em>imminent danger </em>of abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>from the respondent, that the person has been the victim of abuse committed by the respondent within the 180 days preceding the filing of the petition and particularly describing the nature of the abuse and the dates thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">(Emphasis added.) In turn, ORS 107.718 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">\u201c(1) * * * Upon a showing [(1)] that the petitioner has been the victim of abuse committed by the respondent within 180 days preceding the filing of the petition, [(2)] that there is an <em>imminent danger </em>of <em>further </em>abuse to the petitioner[,] and [(3)] that the respondent represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner or the petitioner\u2019s child, the court shall [issue a FAPA restraining order.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">\u201c(5) <em>Imminent danger </em>under [ORS 107.718] includes but is not limited to situations in which the respondent has recently threatened petitioner with <em>additional </em>bodily harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">The phrase \u201cimminent danger,\u201d where italicized in the above quotations, was added to ORS 107.710(1) and ORS 107.718 by the 1999 Legislative Assembly to replace the phrase \u201cimmediate and present danger\u201d in the prior version of the statutes. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1999, ch 1052, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 13. Those changes were made in response to another proposal by Judge Herrell that the legislature \u201csoften the standard [requiring] the petitioner [to] show \u2018immediate and present danger of [further] abuse\u2019 \u201d in order to obtain a FAPA restraining order. Testimony, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Civil Law, SB 318, May 12, 1999, Ex A (statement of Judge Stephen Herrell). Judge Herrell provided the following explanation of the need for the amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">\u201cFor example[,] at present, the Court cannot issue a FAPA restraining order in a situation whereby [a] petitioner [who has previously been abused] has just received a telephone threat from the abuser who happens to live in another town or another state but is threatening to come to harm the petitioner sometime in the imminent future. The same would be true if the abuser is incarcerated but the abuser\u2019s release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>date is imminent but not immediate. There are, of course, many such examples.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">\u201cThe usual response we get from petitioners in these cases is: T guess I have to wait until something bad actually happens to me.\u2019 Frankly, I have to agree, but it certainly seems like the wrong approach to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">\u201cPerhaps the solution would be to replace the words \u2018immediate and present danger\u2019 in ORS 107.710 [and ORS 107.718] with the words \u2018imminent danger.\u2019 This would conform to ORS 107.705(l)(b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Although Judge Herrell may have erroneously equated the meaning of \u201cimminent\u201d in ORS 107.705(l)(b) with the intended meaning of \u201cimminent\u201d in ORS 107.710(1) and ORS 107.718, it is evident that the 1999 legislature intended the word \u201cimminent\u201d to have a different meaning in ORS 107.710(1) and ORS 107.718 than it has in ORS 107.705(l)(b). Generally, when the legislature uses the same word or phrase in related statutory provisions, we will assume that it meant the word or phrase to have the same meaning. <em>See, e.g., Tharp v. PSRB, </em>338 Or 413, 422, 110 P3d 103 (2005). However, that assumption must give way to more persuasive indications of the legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Here, the 1999 amendments to ORS 107.710(1) and ORS 107.718 were enacted 22 years after the legislature adopted the original FAPA statutes, including ORS 107.705(l)(b), and, thus, the amendments provide no insight into what the 1977 legislature intended the word \u201cimminent\u201d to mean in ORS 107.705(l)(b). Second, as demonstrated by the text and relationship of ORS 107.705(l)(b), ORS 107.710(1), and ORS 107.718(1), the word \u201cimminent\u201d is used to address two distinct circumstances, and the respective meanings of \u201cimminent\u201d in those statutes differ accordingly. ORS 107.705(l)(b) defines conduct by which a person commits abuse. As the legislative history makes clear, the legislature intended \u201cimminent,\u201d as used in ORS 107.705(l)(b), to describe the same period of time as the term describes in the crime of menacing \u2014 that is, the very short period associated with common-law assault. <em>See </em>245 Or App at 344-52 (Armstrong, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>In contrast, ORS 107.710(1) requires a petitioner who has been abused to allege, and ORS 107.718(1) requires the trial court to determine, that the petitioner is in \u201cimminent danger of further abuse\u201d in order for the court to issue or continue a FAPA restraining order. As Judge Herrell\u2019s testimony in support of SB 318 suggests, the legislature intended \u201cimminent\u201d in those statutes to refer to a period of time extending to several days. Imminent is a word that can convey that meaning. Its use in ORS 107.710(1) and ORS 107.718 to describe <em>that </em>length of time does not alter or affect the intended meaning of imminent in ORS 107.705(l)(b), which describes a much shorter period of time. In light of the distinct purposes and legislative histories of ORS 107.705(l)(b), ORS 107.710(1), and ORS 107.718, it is evident that the meaning of imminent in ORS 107.705(l)(b) is not the same as the meaning of imminent in ORS 107.710(1) and ORS 107.718.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">As with our interpretation of the menacing statute in <em>Dompeling, </em>we have applied ORS 107.705(l)(b) of the FAPA statute in several cases without considering the evolution and legislative history of it. For example, in <em>Lefebvre v. Lefehvre, </em>165 Or App 297, 996 P2d 518 (2000), we upheld a FAPA restraining order that was based on abuse under ORS 107.705(l)(b) for conduct that does not meet the standard that the statute imposes. <em>See also, e.g., Fielder v. Fielder, </em>211 Or App 688, 157 P3d 220 (2007); <em>Cottongim v. Woods, </em>145 Or App 40, 928 P2d 361 (1996). To the extent that our earlier cases applied an implicit understanding of ORS 107.705(l)(b) that differs from the correct understanding of it, we should disavow those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">With the proper understanding of ORS 107.705(l)(b) in mind, I turn to whether petitioner established that respondent had subjected her to abuse within 180 days before she filed her petition for a FAPA restraining order. As the following discussion explains, the record in this case is insufficient to support a finding by the trial court that, within that period, respondent had abused petitioner by intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly placing her in fear of imminent bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>I begin with petitioner\u2019s testimony about respondent\u2019s repeated threats to find and kill petitioner if she tried to take the parties\u2019 children. Respondent\u2019s threats to do that do not come within the definition of abuse in ORS 107.705(l)(b) because they are conditional and future oriented. They describe what respondent would do if an event occurs in the future, one that depends on a sequence of events in which petitioner would act to take the children from respondent. While certainly meant to intimidate and coerce petitioner, respondent\u2019s threats to kill her if she did that are not the type of threat that communicates that petitioner is in danger of promptly being physically injured by respondent. The legislative history of ORS 163.190(1) demonstrates that the statutory prohibition on \u201cplacing] another person in fear of imminent serious physical injury\u201d was specifically not meant to address \u201c[conditional threats of violence made to coerce another to engage or refrain from engaging in conduct,\u201d because threats of that kind were intended to be \u201ccovered by the [proposed criminal code] section on coercion.\u201d Commentary to Proposed Oregon Criminal Code \u00a7 95, at 96. And, as discussed above, that understanding of the requirement of imminency in the crime of menacing was intended by the legislature to also apply to the definition of abuse under ORS 107.705(l)(b). Accordingly, the conditional threats by respondent, which were meant to prevent petitioner from taking the parties\u2019 children from respondent, are insufficient to establish that respondent intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly placed petitioner in fear of imminent bodily injury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The text messages that respondent sent to petitioner also are insufficient to support a finding of abuse. Respondent sent petitioner those messages soon after he had filed his custody petition and petitioner had been served with it. Undoubtedly, the text messages conveyed the anger that respondent felt toward petitioner and were meant to intimidate her. However, none of the messages occurred in a context in which petitioner and respondent were engaged in a direct and proximate interaction that could place petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>in fear that respondent would promptly physically injure her, as required by ORS 107.705(l)(b). It follows that the trial court erred in concluding that respondent had abused petitioner within 180 days of petitioner filing her petition for a FAPA restraining order and, thus, concomitantly erred in issuing an order continuing petitioner\u2019s FAPA restraining order against respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The majority offers two reasons for its decision to affirm the court\u2019s order in this case without resolving the correct meaning of ORS 107.705(l)(b). It first asserts that respondent failed to raise an issue at trial or on appeal about the meaning of the statute. The majority is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Respondent argued at trial and argues on appeal that the text messages that he sent could not constitute abuse under ORS 107.705(l)(b) because, to the extent that they placed petitioner in fear that respondent would injure her physically, the threatened injury was not imminent, as that term is used in the statute. That argument squarely presents for our decision the meaning of \u201cimminent\u201d in the statute. And, consistently with <em>Stull v. Hoke, </em>326 Or 72, 77, 948 P2d 722 (1997), that means that we must determine the correct meaning of the term without regard to the parties\u2019 understanding of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">According to the majority, however, respondent\u2019s reliance on <em>Dompeling </em>as support for his understanding of the meaning of \u201cimminent\u201d in ORS 107.705(l)(b) makes the <em>Stull </em>interpretive principle inapposite. It does not. The fact that the correct understanding of \u201cimminent\u201d in ORS 107.705(l)(b) conflicts with the meaning that we gave that term in interpreting the menacing statute in <em>Dompeling </em>does not affect our obligation to correctly interpret ORS 107.705(l)(b). In other words, <em>Dompeling </em>simply represents authority on which respondent relies to support an incorrect understanding of ORS 107.705(l)(b), <em>viz., </em>an understanding that <em>Stull </em>requires us to reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">To be sure, as my examination of the legislative history of FAPA and the menacing statute makes clear, the meaning of \u201cimminent\u201d in ORS 107.705(l)(b) and the menacing statute is intertwined in such a way as to require us to overrule <em>Dompeling </em>in the course of correctly interpreting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ORS 107.705(l)(b), because the correct interpretation of ORS 107.705(l)(b) depends on the correct interpretation of the menacing statute. However, our need to do that does not alter our obligation under <em>Stull </em>to interpret ORS 107.705(l)(b) correctly.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The majority also relies on <em>dicta </em>in <em>State v. Shepherd, </em>236 Or App 157, 163, 236 P3d 738 (2010), as support for its decision not to apply <em>Stull </em>in this case. <em>Shepherd </em>is readily distinguishable from this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\"><em>Shepherd </em>involved a challenge to the imposition of a compensatory fine against the defendant in favor of the victim whose automobile the defendant had used without authorization and wrecked. The defendant argued at trial that the court could not impose such a fine because a requirement of the compensatory fine statute, ORS <em>137.101(1) </em>\u2014 viz., that the victim to whom the fine is awarded be a person who \u201chas a remedy by civil action\u201d against the defendant for injuries suffered by the victim as a result of the criminal act for which the defendant was convicted \u2014 had not been proven. On appeal, the defendant made an altogether different argu<em>ment </em>\u2014 viz., that the state had not proven a requirement of an entirely different statute, ORS 31.710, that the victim be someone who had suffered \u201cobjectively verifiable monetary losses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">As we explained, under those circumstances,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">\u201cthe factual and procedural predicates for statutory interpretation simply [had] not arisen. Defendant loses, not because a correct interpretation of ORS 137.101(1) compels that outcome, but because she has not adequately preserved the argument that would have put the meaning of [that] statute at issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">236 Or App at 163. That principle has no application to this case. The statute that we must interpret, ORS 107.705(l)(b), is the statute to which respondent\u2019s argument at trial and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>appeal is directed. It happens to be inextricably intertwined with the menacing statute, but, as explained above, that does not alter our obligation under <em>Stull </em>to interpret it correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">In summary, respondent preserved an argument about the meaning and application of ORS 107.705(l)(b) in this case. The majority errs in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The second reason that the majority advances for its refusal to resolve the meaning of ORS 107.705(l)(b) in this case is a prudential one, based on</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">\u201cthe coincidence of three circumstances: (1) The dissent is, necessarily, predicated on its construction of \u2018imminent\u2019 as used in the criminal menacing statute, ORS 163.190\u2014 which, in turn, necessitates overruling Dompeling; (2) the state is not a party to this appeal; and (3) petitioner has never appeared on appeal. The upshot is that, if we were to adopt the dissent, we would be overruling our construction of ORS 163.190 in a case in which the state is not a party and cannot seek reconsideration or Supreme Court review \u2014 and, indeed, in which no reconsideration or review is ever possible because petitioner has not appeared before us. There may be cases in which, even within the strictures of <em>stare decisis, Dompeling </em>might be revisited- \u2014 -but this is not one of them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">245 Or App at 339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">I appreciate those considerations. However, respondent is entitled to have us decide <em>his </em>case correctly. To the extent that the majority believes it to be inappropriate for us to overrule <em>Dompeling </em>without giving the state the opportunity to present arguments against our doing that, we can ask the state to submit its arguments in this case. It makes no sense to me for us to say to respondent and others against whom FAPA restraining orders are entered under ORS 107.705(l)(b) that we cannot decide their cases correctly and must, instead, wait until we are presented with an appeal in a menacing case in which the state can defend the meaning that we gave the menacing statute in <em>Dompeling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">As for the fact that petitioner did not appear on appeal in this case, that is a common occurrence in FAPA cases. A review of our reported cases indicates that petitioners appear on appeal to defend FAPA restraining orders in</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>fewer than a quarter of our cases. That is not surprising, given that FAPA restraining orders expire within a year of their entry, ORS 107.716(6), which means that the great majority of them expire before we could consider an appeal of them. In that light, this case is typical. The upshot is that, as the majority says, a decision in this or similar cases to correctly resolve the meaning of ORS 107.705(l)(b) will not be subject to Supreme Court review. That cannot excuse us, however, from correctly deciding this case. If this were the first case that required us to interpret ORS 107.705(l)(b) and the menacing statute, we could not decline to do that even though our decision would not be subject to Supreme Court review. That this case is not the first case should not affect our approach to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Finally, the majority suggests that adoption of the understanding of ORS 107.705(l)(b) that I have presented\u2014 an understanding that I believe that I have established to be the correct understanding \u2014 could leave some people at risk of injury or death because they could not obtain FAPA restraining orders under ORS 107.705(l)(b) that would have been available to them under the superseded understanding of the statute. Our task is to interpret the statute in accordance with the legislature\u2019s intended meaning for it. I have done that in my dissent. To the extent that people are dissatisfied with the policy chosen by the legislature to protect people from domestic violence, the solution lies with the legislature. Our policy views have no legitimate bearing on our decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\"> A witness who testified before the legislature in support of the 1977 legislation provided a particularly arresting account of that phenomenon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">\u201cI spoke with a woman about two weeks ago. Her husband assaulted her with a hammer. The husband refused to vacate the premises. The woman had no money and no way to get to her family. When the police volunteered her accommodations in the local drunk-tank, the woman gratefully accepted the invitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Testimony, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 2438, Apr 6, 1977, Ex K (statement of Kalei Luyben).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b367-9\"> The legislature later amended the statute to eliminate the provision that required police officers to leave an alleged abuser with the victim if the victim objected to the officers arresting the abuser. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1981, ch 779, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b367-10\"> The assault to which the statute refers is fourth-degree assault, ORS 163.160, because that is the only assault crime that is a misdemeanor. The counterpart PAPA definition of abuse, ORS 107.705(l)(a), confirms that understanding, because it defines abuse in terms of fourth-degree assault. <em>Compare id., with </em>ORS 163.160.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b372-6\"> The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>State v. Garcias </em>bolsters that conclusion. In <em>Garcias, </em>the defendants challenged the constitutionality of ORS 163.190, arguing, in part, that the menacing statute violated Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution. The court rejected that challenge by tying the interpretation of the statute to common-law assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201cWe interpret the menacing statute with reference to its common law assault origins. Common law assault could only occur in a face to face confrontation in which the harm threatened would be caused by the threatener.
