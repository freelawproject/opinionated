ORS 657.176(2)(c). She raises several assignments of error, all but one of which we reject without discussion. We write only to address claimant\u2019s eighth assignment of error in which she contends that EAB\u2019s determination that she did not have good cause to resign from her employment lacks substantial evidence and substantial reason. ORS 183.482(8)(c). Because we agree with claimant that the decision is not supported by substantial reason, we reverse and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We summarize the facts from EAB\u2019s findings and the undisputed evidence in the record that is not inconsistent with those findings. Claimant was the director of fiscal services for the Willamette Educational Service District (WESD)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from July 1, 2007, until she resigned effective December 1, 2009. Claimant reported directly to WESD\u2019s superintendent; she was responsible for advising the superintendent on all fiscal matters, preparing budget documents, and overseeing the budget process. Her position also required her to authorize expenditures, and, as the EAB found, she \u201cwas responsible for their \u2018good judgment\u2019 and lawfulness,\u2019 as provided in the Oregon Accounting Manual (OAM) 10.40.00 PO.\u201d During her employment, claimant held a \u201ccertificate of school business management.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In October 2008, claimant began voicing concerns about financial improprieties and mismanagement at WESD. One of her concerns centered around the issuance of contracts that claimant contended were in violation of Internal Revenue Service rules and Oregon statutes. She was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>also concerned that school district funds were being improperly commingled with other funds and not properly reported to the board or in the annual audit. Claimant was disturbed that the superintendent had ordered an increase in the rate that school districts would be charged for WESD\u2019s services, even though the superintendent had been told that the increase was not needed because the amounts collected in the prior year had not yet been spent. The superintendent stated that a less than three percent increase would \u201clook funny\u201d and cause the districts to ask questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Claimant expressed her concerns to the superintendent on several occasions but was told that she did not understand how things work in an educational service district and was \u201cangrily\u201d rebuffed. Over the course of the next several months, she also reported her concerns to the deputy superintendent, WESD\u2019s auditors, the board chair, and, eventually, legal counsel for WESD. Claimant was assured by the board chair that her concerns would be addressed and that she need not worry about retaliation; she was also informed that he had initiated an investigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">On May 5, 2009, after claimant had met with school district representatives in April, claimant told the board chair that she \u201ccould not take it anymore, she was at the end of what she could take, and she felt like she was being forced to meet with the school districts and not tell them the truth.\u201d The chair asked her to \u201chang in there a little longer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">In late May 2009, claimant was preparing a presentation for the board on WESD\u2019s budget for the following year. Claimant told the deputy superintendant that \u201cshe was not comfortable reviewing the budget presentation with [the superintendent]\u201d and \u201cwas being forced into sacrificing her values and morals.\u201d The day before the presentation, claimant was told that she could not present the parts of her presentation that would disclose the improper commingling and reporting of funds. Claimant met with WESD\u2019s legal counsel and told them that she was uncomfortable making the budget presentation without that information. She was told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>to make the presentation as directed by the board chair. The deputy superintendent indicated to claimant that her concerns were being \u201cswep[t] * * * under the rug.\u201d Claimant went out on medical leave that afternoon and did not make the presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">From June 2, 2009 to September 21, 2009, claimant was away from work on medical leave. On June 18, she filed notice of a tort claim against WESD pursuant to ORS 30.275. After claimant returned from leave, she discovered that she had been dropped from two e-mail management lists, causing her to miss important information and meetings; she was also told that, unlike other directors, she would need to notify the deputy superintendent of any planned absences, and some of her work duties were taken away.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">On November 25, 2009, claimant and the deputy superintendent met with WESD\u2019s human resources director. During the meeting, claimant brought up several concerns about the misuse of funds. She also told the deputy that they were violating independent contractor rules and that \u201cthey should not be issuing a bad contract today if they know they are violating the rules.\u201d The deputy indicated that \u201cthey did not have to fix the contracting situation yet, the Secretary of State\u2019s office would give him 4-6 weeks.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Claimant said that it was \u201cvery difficult for her to do her job\u201d and that she felt that \u201cshe was being retaliated against and intimidated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Claimant resigned on December 1, 2009, as EAB described it, \u201cbecause she believed her concerns were being ignored and that she would be \u2018forced to continue doing . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>improper things\u2019 that put her school business manager certification at risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Claimant subsequently sought unemployment benefits and was denied. She requested and received a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ); the ALJ affirmed the denial of benefits on the basis that claimant \u201cvoluntarily quit work without good cause.\u201d Claimant sought review by EAB, and it agreed with the decision of the ALJ that claimant lacked good cause to leave work and, therefore, was disqualified from receiving benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">EAB reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">\u201cclaimant did not assert or show that her stress was so great, or her authority so undermined, that she could not have continued to work for WESD until she could secure a position in a different organization. Nor did claimant show that continuing her employment with WESD, assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>its improper financial practices also continued, would put her \u2018license\u2019 at risk. We assume the \u2018license\u2019 to which claimant refers in her written argument is her certificate of school business management. Such a certificate is, as far as we are aware in the absence of any record evidence, a type of academic credential, representing 10 to 12 months of academic study. Claimant did not assert or show how such an academic credential would be jeopardized by the improper financial practices of her employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201cFinally, claimant failed to show that continuing to work for WESD meant she would be \u2018forced to continue doing . . . improper things.\u2019 It is true that claimant was in a subordinate position; the board and the superintendent, not she, were responsible for WESD\u2019s governance and management, and she was expected to follow the instructions of her superiors. However, by claimant\u2019s own admission, no one from WESD told claimant she would be discharged or asked to resign if she refused to follow instructions. <em>Rather than leave work voluntarily, claimant had the option to continue working and, if asked to do anything improper, refuse. A reasonable and prudent person, exercising ordinary common sense, would have continued working for WESD to maintain a source of income while looking for a position in an organization that was responsibly governed, well managed, and open to concerns raised by staff.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">(Footnote and record citations omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>We review EAB\u2019s decision according to the standard provided in ORS 183.482(8)(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThat standard requires that the board\u2019s findings of fact be supported by substantial evidence and that its conclusions be supported by substantial reason, <em>i.e., </em>its conclusions must reasonably follow from the facts found.\u201d <em>Simpson v. Board of Parole, </em>237 Or App 661, 663, 241 P3d 347 (2010). We agree with claimant that EAB\u2019s order in this case does not comport with substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">An individual who \u201c[v]oluntarily left work without good cause\u201d is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. ORS 657.176(2)(c). Under OAR 471-030-0038(4), \u201c[g]ood cause for voluntarily leaving work under ORS 657.176(2)(c) is such that a reasonable and prudent person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would leave work.\u201d Further, \u201cthe reason must be of such gravity that the individual has no reasonable alternative but to leave work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the Supreme Court recently explained, good cause is thus \u201can objective standard that asks whether a \u2018reasonable and prudent person\u2019 would consider the situation so grave that he or she had no reasonable alternative to quitting.\u201d <em>McDowell v. Employment Dept. </em>348 Or 605, 612, 236 P3d 722 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In <em>McDowell, </em>the claimant, a teacher, resigned from his position after the school district\u2019s personnel director informed him that the district was recommending his discharge and he was advised by a union attorney that there was \u201c \u2018absolutely no chance\u2019 \u201d that the school board would overrule that recommendation and that he should therefore resign before he was discharged. In deciding whether the claimant left work with good cause, the court emphasized the objective nature of the standard to be applied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\u201cWhen, as here, an employee is facing a prospective discharge, whether resigning in lieu of that prospective discharge is for \u2018good cause\u2019 depends not on a hindsight determination of whether, in fact, claimant would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>discharged by the school board. The issue depends, instead, on whether a reasonable person facing that prospect of discharge would consider the prospect so grave a circumstance that resigning was the only reasonable option. That objective inquiry depends on what claimant in fact knew and reasonably should have known when he made his decision, not on an assessment of how events in fact would have played out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">348 Or at 619 (footnote omitted). Based on the facts found by the board, and the record supporting those facts \u2014 including the claimant\u2019s reasonable belief that the consequences of a discharge on his future employment prospects were serious, that the school board would follow the discharge recommendation of the personnel director, and that the claimant\u2019s ability to legally contest his discharge was narrowly circumscribed and not available predismissal \u2014 the court concluded that <em>\u201ca </em>reasonable and prudent person, of normal sensitivity and exercising ordinary common sense[ would] believe that leaving work was the only reasonable course for him to take.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under those circumstances, the claimant was entitled to a determination that he had good cause for resigning.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Here, EAB concluded that \u201cclaimant had the option to continue working and, if asked to do anything improper, refuse.\u201d However, as in <em>McDowell, </em>that conclusion does not follow from EAB\u2019s factual findings and the evidence in the record supporting those findings. EAB found, and the evidence in the record supports, that claimant attempted to do just what EAB suggests, but was unsuccessful. As EAB\u2019s factual findings reflect, claimant tried on more than one occasion to refrain from participating in the financial improprieties that were occurring at WESD \u2014 she told her superiors that \u201cshe felt like she was being forced to meet with the school districts and not tell them the truth,\u201d that she \u201cwas being forced into sacrificing her values and morals,\u201d and that she was uncomfortable making a budget presentation that did not disclose the improper commingling and reporting of funds. In a meeting with the deputy superintendent and the director of human resources immediately before she resigned, claimant repeated to the deputy superintendent that they were violating independent contractor rules but was told \u201cthey [were] going to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The fact that, as EAB found, \u201cno one from WESD told claimant she would be discharged or asked to resign if she refused to follow instructions\u201d is not dispositive. EAB found that claimant was in a \u201csubordinate position\u201d and that \u201cshe was expected to follow the instructions of her superiors.\u201d In light of those circumstances, it was objectively reasonable for claimant to believe that continuing to refuse to perform her work as instructed would constitute insubordination, subjecting her to possible discharge for misconduct \u2014 a situation that EAB fails to confront. Thus, EAB\u2019s conclusion that claimant had a reasonable alternative to leaving work\u2014 namely, refusing to \u201cdo anything improper\u201d \u2014 and, therefore, that claimant lacked good cause for quitting, does not reasonably follow from the facts found by EAB.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In sum, EAB\u2019s conclusion is not supported by substantial reason, and we reverse and remand on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\"> WESD is an educational school district that serves 21 school districts in Marion, Polk, and Yamhill counties, as well as other districts; it is governed by a nine-member board of directors. The legislature established educational school districts \u201cto assist school districts and the Department of Education in achieving Oregon\u2019s educational goals by providing equitable, high quality, cost-effective and locally responsive educational services at a regional level.\u201d ORS 334.005(1). They are funded through a combination of state school funds, local revenues, state and federal grants, and contracts with local districts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\"> WESD also hired an audit firm to investigate certain allegations of financial impropriety. In October 2009, after the investigative and audit reports were issued, the board terminated its contract with WESD\u2019s superintendent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b599-7\"> At the time, the Secretary of State\u2019s office was conducting an independent review of WESD\u2019s financial practices at the request of the legislature, the Oregon Superintendent of Public Instruction, and WESD\u2019s board. Apparently, the deputy superintendent was aware that the audit report would find that the contracts were being improperly executed, but the report had not yet issued. That report issued in January 2010, after claimant had resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The audit report summarized the audit\u2019s findings, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">\u201cOur audit identified extensive and obvious weaknesses at WESD that would not persist in an organization that is responsibly governed, well managed, and open to concerns raised by staff. Documentation was missing or inadequate, funds were comingled, accounting transactions were overly complicated, appropriate controls were lacking, expenditures were questionable, services were not procured with proper contracts, management ignored or hid problems, and staff proposals for improvement were not finalized.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\"> ORS 183.482(8)(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">\u201cThe court shall set aside or remand the order if the court finds that the order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Substantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b603-5\"> To the extent EAB\u2019s reasoning is also predicated on the theory that claimant was required to seek other work before resigning in order to establish \u201cgood cause\u201d under the rule, that theory has been squarely rejected. <em>See, e.g., Warhentin v. Employment Dept. </em>245 Or App 128, 134-35, 261 P3d 72 (2011). Further, on remand, EAB can consider whether <em>McDowell </em>\u2014 which was decided after EAB issued its decision in this case \u2014 has any bearing on claimant\u2019s contention that her continued participation in improper conduct at WESD would have jeopardized her certification and affected her ability to find work as a certified school business manager.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
