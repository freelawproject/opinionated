J.</author>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Claimant seeks judicial review of an Employment Appeals Board (EAB) order disqualifying him from the receipt of unemployment insurance benefits. He contends that, contrary to the EAB\u2019s conclusion, he was not fired for misconduct; rather, he argues, he was fired for refusing to obey an unreasonable employer policy \u2014 in particular, a policy that required him to perform work-related tasks without compensation \u2014 or, in the alternative, for conduct that was merely a good faith error. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The relevant legal standards are not in dispute. An employee is disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation benefits if he or she \u201c[h]as been discharged for misconduct connected with work[.]\u201d ORS 657.176(2)(a). \u201cMisconduct\u201d is \u201ca willful or wantonly negligent violation of the standards of behavior which an employer has the right to expect of an employee * * *. An act or series of actions that amount to a willful or wantonly negligent disregard of an employer\u2019s interest is misconduct.\u201d OAR 471-030-0038(3)(a). There are, however, two exceptions to this rule that are relevant to this case: \u201c[G]ood faith errors * * * are not misconduct[,]\u201d OAR 471-030-0038(3)(b), nor is \u201c[a] conscious decision not to comply with an unreasonable employer policy[,]\u201d OAR 471-030-0038(l)(d)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The EAB found the following facts, which, because claimant does not dispute them on judicial review, we adopt. <em>Meltebeke v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>322 Or 132, 134, 903 P2d 351 (1995).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">\u201c(1) ACS Commercial Solutions employed claimant as a telephone customer service representative from May 30, 2008 to November 24, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">\u201c(2) The employer had a policy requiring its telephone service representatives to log into the employer\u2019s telephone system and begin taking calls no more than five minutes after <em>logging </em>into the employer\u2019s payroll timekeeping system. Claimant was aware of the employer\u2019s policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">\u201c(3) Prior to July 2009, claimant\u2019s supervisors allowed him to log into the telephone system up to fifteen minutes after logging into the timekeeping system to allow claimant time to perform other tasks before he began taking calls. In</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>July 2009, claimant\u2019s new supervisor informed him he now was expected to comply with the employer\u2019s policy and log into the telephone system within five minutes after logging into the timekeeping system. The supervisor instructed claimant to perform the other tasks in between calls. Claimant understood the employer\u2019s expectations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\">\u201c(4) Claimant did not make a serious attempt to comply with the employer\u2019s expectations because he did not believe that he had time to complete his other tasks in between calls. Claimant continued to perform the tasks after logging into the timekeeping system, and often took more than five minutes to log into the telephone system. Claimant also sometimes logged into the telephone system as unavailable to allow himself more than five minutes to complete the other tasks before taking calls. Claimant understood that his conduct violated the employer\u2019s expectations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">\u201c(5) The employer warned claimant several times that he was expected to comply with the employer\u2019s policy, and that he was prohibited from logging into the telephone system as unavailable in order to allow himself more than five minutes to complete other tasks. Claimant did not change his behavior, even after the employer gave him a final written warning on November 17, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">\u201c(6) On November 21,2009, claimant again did not log into the telephone system within five minutes of logging into the timekeeping system, to allow himself more time to complete other tasks. Claimant\u2019s supervisor ordered claimant to log into the telephone system immediately and begin taking calls. Claimant logged into the telephone system, but did so as unavailable to allow himself more time to complete other tasks before taking calls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">\u201c(7) On November 23, 2009, claimant notified the employer in writing that he would not comply with the employer\u2019s policy of requiring him to log into the telephone system and begin taking calls within five minutes of logging into the timekeeping system. The employer discharged claimant for refusing to comply with the policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Claimant applied for unemployment compensation benefits, and the Employment Department allowed them. Employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>appealed and, after a contested case hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) set aside the department\u2019s decision, concluding that claimant was, in fact, fired for misconduct. Claimant appealed to the EAB, which affirmed the ALJ on the ground that \u201cemployer discharged claimant for refusing to comply with its policy requiring telephone service representatives to log into the telephone system and begin taking calls no more than five minutes after logging into the timekeeping system.\u201d The EAB did not rule on whether employer\u2019s policy was unreasonable; instead, it ruled that, \u201ceven assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the employer\u2019s policy was unreasonable the employer nevertheless had a right to expect claimant to attempt to comply with the policy to the best of his ability.\u201d The EAB also rejected claimant\u2019s arguments that his refusal was a \u201cgood faith error.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Claimant then filed a petition for judicial review and, in due course, an opening brief focusing on the argument that an employee has no obligation to attempt to comply with an unreasonable employer policy; the exception from the definition of misconduct for such refusal, claimant argued, is absolute. The same day that the opening brief was filed, the EAB withdrew its original order pursuant to ORS 183.482(6) and ORAP 4.35. It subsequently issued a modified order on reconsideration, reaching the same result \u2014 denial of benefits \u2014 but concluding that the policy that claimant chose to disobey was <em>not </em>unreasonable. Claimant elected not to file an amended petition for review; instead, he elected to proceed with judicial review, relying on his original brief. ORAP 4.35(4)(a)(i). The Employment Department and employer both elected not to file answering briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Claimant\u2019s first argument rests on the assertion that bis discharge resulted from his conscious decision not to comply with an unreasonable employer policy, in particular, with employer\u2019s demand that he work without pay. That assertion, in turn, rests on the assertion that employer required him to complete tasks that could not be done during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>working day and therefore had to be completed \u201coff the clock.\u201d However, in its order on reconsideration, the EAB stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">\u201cAt hearing, claimant testified that he did not have time to complete his other tasks before logging in to the employer\u2019s telephone system or in between calls, and that he therefore would have had to complete them \u2018off the clock\u2019 during lunch or other breaks. However, the employer\u2019s policy did not require customer service representatives to complete their other tasks before logging in to the telephone system, or during lunch or other breaks. Claimant admitted that he did not make a serious attempt to comply with the employer\u2019s policy, and the record fails to show that he or any of the employer\u2019s other customer service representatives were unable to complete their tasks in between calls. Absent evidence to support claimant\u2019s assertion that the employer\u2019s policy required customer service representatives to work off the clock, we find that the policy was reasonable[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">As noted, claimant did not submit an amended notice of appeal or amended brief in order to respond to the EAB\u2019s order on reconsideration. Further, the facts in that order are supported by substantial evidence. That being the case, we agree with the EAB that employer presented substantial evidence that the policy did not require working off the clock, in that other employees managed to meet their obligations during their paid shifts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore reject claimant\u2019s argument based on the supposed unreasonableness of employer\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Claimant fares no better with respect to his argument that his refusal to comply with the policy was a good faith error. He bases that argument on language from <em>Goin v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>Employment Dept., </em>203 Or App 758, 765-66, 126 P3d 734 (2006):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">\u201cA \u2018good faith error\u2019 logically involves some sort of mistake made with the honest belief that one is acting rightly. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>978 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining \u2018good faith\u2019 as \u2018a state of mind indicating honesty and lawfulness of purpose: belief in one\u2019s legal title or right: belief that one\u2019s conduct is not unconscionable or that known circumstances do not require further investigation : absence of fraud, deceit, collusion, or gross negligence\u2019). Here, EAB found that claimant, with some reason, made an incorrect assumption. It did not find that she acted with a lack of honesty or belief in the rightness of her actions * * *. It follows that EAB\u2019s conclusion that claimant\u2019s conduct was not a good faith error lacks substantial reason.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Claimant appears to argue that, because he honestly believed that he was acting with the sincerely held belief that employer\u2019s policy was unjust or unreasonable, he made a \u201cgood faith error\u201d and could not be discharged on that basis. Claimant misreads the phrase \u201cbelief in the rightness of her actions.\u201d We did not hold in <em>Goin </em>that the EAB erred because the claimant sincerely believed that the employer\u2019s policy was unjust, immoral, or ill conceived; the board erred because it did not account for the fact that the claimant, \u201cmistakenly believing that [her] employer would obtain information directly from her doctor, * * * failed to provide [her] employer with documentation of her need for additional medical leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 760. The \u201cerror\u201d in OAR 471-030-0038(3)(b) refers to a mistake of fact or action deriving from a mistake in fact. Claimant cites no case, and we have found none, that could support the conclusion that OAR 471-030-0038(3)(b) creates an exception for conscientious objectors to employer policies, that is, an exception for an employee who knowingly refuses to comply with an employer\u2019s policy because the employee holds an honest belief that an employer\u2019s policy is misguided, illegal, stupid, or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">It is possible that claimant\u2019s argument regarding good faith error is that he sincerely believed that employer\u2019s policy required him to work off the clock. That argument cannot be sustained in light of claimant\u2019s candid testimony (and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the EAB\u2019s uncontested finding) that he \u201cdid not make a serious attempt to comply\u201d with the policy. Thus, he may have had the belief that compliance was impossible, but we cannot call that a belief that he held in good faith; good faith would have required some effort to determine if, in fact, compliance was impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The EAB did not err in denying claimant unemployment compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\"> Claimant also argued that he was discharged for an isolated instance of misconduct. The EAB rejected that argument and we do as well; it is undisputed that claimant repeatedly failed to begin taking calls within five minutes of logging in.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\"> In general, the employer has the burden of proving misconduct, <em>Babcock v. Employ merit Div., 25 </em>Or App 661, 664, 550 P2d 1233 (1976), while the claimant has the burden of proving that he or she had \"good cause\u201d to leave work, <em>Brotherton v. Morgan, </em>17 Or App 435, 438-39, 522 P2d 1210 (1974). Proving the unreasonableness of an employer\u2019s policy with which an employee did not comply appears analogous to proving good cause for leaving work. However, we have never been confronted with the need to determine who has the burden of establishing the reasonableness of such a policy. This case does not present that need; if the burden was claimant\u2019s, he failed to meet it because he put on no evidence of unreasonableness, and if the burden was on employer, it did meet it by presenting testimony that other employees managed to complete their tasks during work time for which they were paid.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
