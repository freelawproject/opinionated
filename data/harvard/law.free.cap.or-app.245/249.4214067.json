Plaintiffs assign error to, among other things, the trial court\u2019s summary imposition of a contempt sanction against Teri for violating a \u201cgag order\u201d by posting certain trial-related comments to a website.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs argue that (1) the comments did not fall within the court\u2019s order prohibiting contact with the \u201cpress,\u201d (2) Teri did not act willfully, as is required for a finding of contempt, and (3) in any event, the trial court did not follow the statutory procedures for imposing sanctions for contempt of court. <em>See </em>ORS 33.015 - 33.155 (establishing procedures governing the exercise of a court\u2019s contempt powers). We conclude that, because the trial court\u2019s order imposing a contempt sanction was not reduced to a judgment, it is not properly before us on appeal. Accordingly, we do not address the merits of the contempt sanction but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Plaintiffs brought suit against PeaceHealth after Dea experienced adverse medical effects from the use of a medication prescribed to alleviate diaper rash. Plaintiffs alleged claims for negligence and spoliation of medical records. The trial court granted partial summary judgment on the spoliation claim, but the negligence claims proceeded to trial. At the beginning of trial, in response to press coverage of the case, defense counsel raised concerns that \u201cit would be inappropriate for the parties to be contacting the press during the trial because of the risk of tainting the jury with something that\u2019s not being said here in the courtroom.\u201d Consequently, the trial court orally ordered the parties to abstain from communicating with the press: \u201c[Y]ou are not to have any contact or initiate any contact * * * during the course of this trial in order to ensure that the jury is able to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>decision based upon what occurs in this courtroom as opposed to what occurs outside of the courtroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Subsequently, during trial, defense counsel brought to the court\u2019s attention a possible violation of the order: Teri had, apparently, posted a comment to a blog in response to a third party\u2019s comment about the case. According to defendant, Teri\u2019s comment was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">\u201cI am the mother of the child this claim is about and as much as I would love to just spill all the facts out right here and now, I have been asked by the judge to not discuss it with anyone and so for now, that will be the case. However, the day this trial is over and we have either won or lost, you can count on the fact that I will show [the third party commenter] what an ass he has made out of himself for making these statements when he clearly doesn\u2019t know the facts but for now my lips are sealed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Defendant moved the court to take action in one of three ways: dismiss the case with prejudice, instruct the jury that plaintiffs had violated the court\u2019s order, or impose \u201can appropriate monetary sanction against Ms. Teri Ferguson herself personally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel argued that her client\u2019s comment did not constitute contact with \u201cthe media\u201d and that, in any event, she did not violate the court\u2019s order, \u201cat least not knowingly.\u201d The court nonetheless determined that Teri was \u201cin contempt of court for violating this clear and direct order not to discuss the case.\u201d The court declined to dismiss the case or instruct the jury on the matter, but summarily imposed a $1,000 fine as a sanction for \u201cthe contempt of court that was done in the court\u2019s presence, basically, since the court entered this order[.] * * * At this point, the court expects it to be paid before this case goes to the jury.\u201d The court then took a recess to allow Teri to pay the fine to the court clerk before proceeding, which she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendant and the court entered a general judgment on the verdict. The general judgment contained no reference to the contempt sanction; nor was a separate judgment of contempt entered. Plaintiffs, in an omnibus motion, sought a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial. Among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>things, they challenged the imposition of the contempt sanction. In addition to elaborating on their arguments from trial, plaintiffs argued that the trial court erred in imposing a punitive sanction without providing the procedural safeguards required by ORS 33.065. The motion was deemed denied by operation of law, <em>see </em>ORCP 63 D(l) (motion deemed denied if not ruled upon within 55 days), and plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">On appeal, plaintiffs renew their arguments from below. However, we do not reach plaintiffs\u2019 contentions about the contempt sanction in this case. An appeal from a sanction for contempt must be predicated upon a judgment of contempt. ORS 33.125(1) provides that the \u201cimposition of a sanction for contempt <em>shall be by a judgment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>See also </em>ORS 33.125(4) (contemplating separate appeal from a contempt judgment).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The contempt sanction was not included in the judgment under review. Consequently, the legality of that sanction is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Contempt sanctions are either remedial or punitive in character. <em>See </em>ORS 33.015(3) (defining \u201cpunitive sanction\u201d as \u201ca sanction imposed to punish a past contempt of court\u201d); ORS 33.015(4) (defining \u201cremedial sanction\u201d as \u201ca sanction imposed to terminate a continuing contempt of court or to compensate for injury, damage or costs resulting from a past or continuing contempt of court\u201d). <em>See also </em>ORS 33.045(3) (defining a fine imposed for contempt as \u201c[pjunitive if it is for a past contempt\u201d and as \u201cremedial\u201d if the fine \u201cis for continuing contempt and the fine accumulates until the defendant complies with the court\u2019s judgment or order or if the fine may be partially or entirely forgiven when the defendant complies with the court\u2019s judgment or order\u201d). In the case of a remedial sanction for contempt, the judgment of contempt may be made part of the judgment in the proceeding to which the contempt is related. <em>See </em>ORS 33.125(3) (so providing). That is because a proceeding for a remedial sanction may be initiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>by a motion filed in the related proceeding. <em>See </em>ORS 33.055 (procedure for imposition of remedial sanction).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In the case of a punitive sanction for contempt, on the other hand, the judgment of contempt is separate from the judgment in any related proceeding. That is because a proceeding for a punitive sanction is usually initiated by a separate accusatory instrument, filed by a neutral third party such as the city or district attorney. <em>See </em>ORS 33.065 (procedure for imposition of punitive sanctions).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Here, a punitive sanction was imposed against Teri for contempt of court. The trial court\u2019s order imposing that sanction was not reduced to a judgment. In the absence of a judgment, the issue is not properly before us. <em>Cf. State v. Burleson, </em>342 Or 697, 702, 160 P3d 624 (2007) (noting that contempt sanction is not appealable until judgment is entered). Consequently, we express no opinion on the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the contempt sanction. That challenge must await the entry of a judgment of contempt and any appeal therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-6\"> For ease of reference, we subsequently refer to individual plaintiffs by their first names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\"> We reject plaintiffs\u2019 remaining assignments of error without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\"> We note at the outset that, although a court\u2019s power to impose a sanction for contempt \u201cis an inherent judicial power,\u201d ORS 33.025, the legislature has imposed reasonable limitations on a court\u2019s exercise of that authority via ORS 33.015 to 33.155. <em>See State v. Walton, </em>215 Or App 628, 631, 170 P3d 1122 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 671 (2008) (noting that \u201cthe legislature can impose limitations on the court\u2019s contempt power\u201d (citing <em>State v. Moen, </em>86 Or App 87, 91, 738 P2d 228 (1987))).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\"> Under ORS 33.096, a court may \u201csummarily impose a sanction upon a person who commits a contempt of court in the immediate view and presence of the court. * ** * The provisions of ORS 33.055 and 33.065 do not apply to summary imposition of sanctions under this section.\u201d Thus, the procedures for imposing a punitive sanction under ORS 33.065 do not apply where the sanction is imposed summarily for a contempt committed in the immediate view and presence of the court. Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s statement to the contrary, the contempt in this case was committed outside of the presence of the court. We need not decide whether a summary contempt must be included in the related case judgment or in a separate judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
