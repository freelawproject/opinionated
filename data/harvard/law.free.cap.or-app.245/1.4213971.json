In Case Number 080331177 (\u201cthe APF case\u201d), defendant was found guilty of one count of identity theft; in Case Number 080431933 (\u201cthe BTS case\u201d), defendant was found guilty of six counts of identity theft.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, he argues that the trial court should have suppressed evidence of certain statements he made because they were the result of police interrogation conducted in violation of his right to counsel under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution. For the reasons explained below, we agree, and therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">We review the denial of a motion to suppress for legal error and defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact if there is sufficient evidence to support them. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). The pertinent underlying facts are not in dispute. On March 11, 2008, defendant\u2019s brother, Edward Lane, attempted to cash a forged check drawn on the account of BTS Container Services (BTS). Lane became nervous and fled the bank where he was attempting to cash the check, leaving the check, as well as his identification, behind.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">On March 12, 2008, defendant attempted to cash a forged check drawn on the account of Atlantic &amp; Pacific Freightways (APF). The teller believed that the check was fraudulent and called the police, who arrived and arrested defendant. Shortly thereafter, one of defendant\u2019s accomplices arrived at the same bank and attempted to cash another fraudulent APF check; he also was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">Detective Glass was assigned to investigate the crimes involving the fraudulent APF checks. Defendant was arraigned in the APF case on March 13, 2008, and counsel was appointed for him. He remained in custody on the APF case until March 27. Meanwhile, on March 26, Lane returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>to the first bank where he had attempted to cash the BTS check on March 11. Lane was arrested at the scene, and Detective Malanaphy questioned Lane while he was in custody. Lane told Malanaphy that defendant had created the fraudulent BTS check, using as a template a legitimate check that defendant had received from BTS. When Malanaphy went to defendant\u2019s home to arrest him, defendant\u2019s wife told him that defendant already was in custody. Malanaphy talked to defendant\u2019s wife \u201cabout defendant\u2019s activities,\u201d and she gave him a computer hard drive that had been hidden in a heating vent in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Malanaphy learned from police records about the pending charges in the APF case, and he contacted Detective Glass, who was stationed at a different precinct. Glass told Malanaphy that she had arrested defendant for identity theft, based on his creation of fraudulent APF checks using a computer. Glass\u2019s investigation had uncovered information concerning two additional counterfeit BTS checks, so she provided that information to Malanaphy for purposes of his investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">On March 27, Malanaphy and Glass went together to defendant\u2019s house and questioned defendant\u2019s wife about some of his accomplices. They found out that defendant was scheduled to be released from jail that day. Malanaphy returned alone to defendant\u2019s house again on March 28 and told defendant that he would like to talk to him. Before questioning defendant, Malanaphy gave him <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Malanaphy\u2019s specific questions related to the fraudulent BTS checks. Malanaphy did, however, encourage defendant to reveal the names of his accomplices in an effort to solve other possible crimes. Defendant acknowledged having used a computer to create fraudulent checks, and he also admitted giving one of those checks to Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Before trial, defendant moved pursuant to Article I, section 11, to suppress the statements that he had made to Malanaphy on March 28, arguing that, because he had invoked his right to counsel in the APF case, Malanaphy was required to contact defendant\u2019s attorney before attempting to interview him on a factually related matter. The prosecutor replied that, because the facts of the APF case and the BTS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>case were not \u201cinextricably intertwined,\u201d and Malanaphy had only questioned defendant about the BTS case, the evidence need not be suppressed. The court denied defendant\u2019s motion, stating \u201cthat they\u2019re not inextricably intertwined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">After a bench trial, the court convicted defendant of identity theft in both cases. On appeal, defendant reiterates his Article I, section 11, argument, to which the state responds that the trial court correctly denied the motion based on its findings that the facts underlying the two cases were not \u201cinextricably intertwined.\u201d We conclude that the state has misunderstood one of our prior cases and that the proper inquiry is not whether the cases are \u201cinextricably intertwined,\u201d but, rather, whether the cases are \u201cfactually unrelated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">In <em>State v. Sparklin, </em>296 Or 85, 672 P2d 1182 (1983), the defendant was arrested in Eugene for using a stolen credit card belonging to Mansell. After the defendant had been arraigned and provided with appointed counsel, Portland detectives interrogated him about an assault and robbery during which Mansell\u2019s credit cards were stolen. The detectives also questioned the defendant on \u201ca <em>factually unrelated </em>murder and robbery in Portland of a man named Davidson for which defendant was tried and convicted in this case.\u201d 296 Or at 87 (emphasis added). The defendant asserted that the information gleaned during the interview concerning the Davidson murder should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The court began with the basic proposition that Article I, section 11, provides that, \u201conce a person is charged with a crime he or she is entitled to the benefit of an attorney\u2019s presence, advice and expertise in any situation where the state may glean involuntary and incriminating evidence or statements for use in the prosecution of its case against defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93. Thus, after a person has been charged and afforded counsel, \u201cthere can be no interrogation of a defendant concerning <em>the events surrounding the crime </em>charged!\u201d without notification of the attorney. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">After discussing the origins of the Article I, section 11, right, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>\u201cIt is the fairness of the \u2018criminal prosecution\u2019 which counsel\u2019s presence helps to ensure. For this reason the [A]rticle I, section 11 right to an attorney is specific to the criminal episode in which the accused is charged. The prohibitions placed on the state\u2019s contact with a represented defendant do not extend to the investigation of <em>factually unrelated criminal </em>episodes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 95 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Before we turn to a discussion of what \u201cfactually unrelated\u201d means, we must briefly pause to examine the court\u2019s use of the term \u201ccriminal episode\u201d in the above-quoted material. \u201cCriminal episode\u201d is a term that, at this point in time, has been used in so many diverse statutory and constitutional contexts within the criminal law that its precise meaning in any given context, much less its origins, is not always clear. Suffice it to say that, at the time the court wrote <em>Sparklin, </em>the court had most often been grappling with the phrase in the context of statutory and constitutional former jeopardy. <em>See, e.g., State v. Hamilton, </em>291 Or 283, 291, 634 P2d 208 (1981) (discussing statutory former jeopardy and the definition of \u201ccriminal episode\u201d contained in ORS 131.505(4)); <em>State v. Brown, </em>262 Or 442, 457-58, 497 P2d 1191 (1972) (noting not-yet-enacted definition of \u201ccriminal episode\u201d later enacted as ORS 131.505(4), and concluding that, for purposes of former jeopardy provisions of Article I, section 12, multiple prosecutions are barred if \u201c(1) the charges arise out of the same act or transaction, and (2) the charges could have been tried in the same court, and (3) the prosecutor knew or reasonably should have known of the facts relevant to the second charge at the time of the original prosecution\u201d). But as the court explained in a different context, the \u201ccriminal episode\u201d and \u201csame act or transaction\u201d issue had arisen in numerous interrelated areas \u2014 not merely with regard to how many prosecutions may be brought, but also involving how many offenses may be separately charged and, if separately charged, whether verdicts must merge or sentences must be imposed concurrently. <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>286 Or 579, 584-85, 596 P2d 1278 (1979).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>With that background in mind, we return to the court\u2019s statement in <em>Sparklin. </em>As an initial matter, we note that we cannot simply take at face value the court\u2019s statement that the Article I, section 11, right \u201cis specific to the criminal episode in which the accused is charged\u201d to mean that the prosecutor\u2019s initial decision to bring the charges in two separate indictments (and, for example, later move to consolidate them for trial as the prosecutor did here) somehow defines or limits the scope of the Article I, section 11, right. <em>Sparklin, </em>296 Or at 85. Thus, the focus must be on whether the charges, regardless of how the case was initiated, pertain to <em>\u201cfactually unrelated </em>criminal episodes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">In <em>Sparklin, </em>the court examined persuasive authority from other states that had concluded, in general, that questioning about \u201cfactually related\u201d crimes was impermissible, but questioning about \u201cunrelated crimes\u201d was permissible. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 96 (citing <em>State v. Derrico, </em>181 Conn 151, 168, 434 A2d 356, 366 (1980) (questioning was permissible if the other matter \u201cwas genuinely unrelated and neither a sham nor a pretext for investigation\u201d of the charged crimes); <em>People v. Boyd, </em>86 Cal App 3d 54, 60, 150 Cal Rptr 34 (1978) (rule applies to charged crimes as well as to crimes that are related to those charged). Ultimately, the court concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-5\">\u201c[b]ecause defendant was represented by an attorney for the crimes against Steven Mansell, interrogation on this subject was improper and no waiver of this right can be given effect. However, with regard to the unrelated Davidson case, defendant\u2019s waiver is valid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-6\"><em>Sparklin, </em>296 Or at 98.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>We have decided several pertinent cases in the wake of <em>Sparklin. </em>In <em>State v. Staunton, </em>79 Or App 332, 334, 718 P2d 1379 (1986), the defendant initially was arrested for, and charged with, driving while intoxicated and possession of a stolen car. An officer who was investigating those crimes determined that the car had been stolen from Elling in a burglary, and he found evidence of other potential crimes. The officer questioned the defendant about the theft of the vehicle, and he also \u201casked if [the defendant] had been involved in other burglaries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335. The defendant made admissions about two other burglaries in addition to the Elling burglary. Applying <em>Sparklin, </em>we concluded that the questions about the burglary involving the car were impermissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-4\">\u201cThe burglary and the original charge of unauthorized use of the stolen Elling car arose out of the same \u2018concatenation of facts.\u2019 Accordingly, [the officer\u2019s] initiation of discussions about the Elling burglary were impermissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-5\"><em>Staunton, </em>79 Or App at 338 (citing <em>State v. Taylor, 56 </em>Or App 703, 643 P2d 379 (1982)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We did not, however, decide whether the two other burglaries were \u201cfactually related.\u201d Rather, we concluded that the questions about those burglaries were \u201ctainted\u201d by the unlawful questioning about the Elling burglary and that the defendant\u2019s answers to those questions must be derivatively suppressed. <em>Id. </em>at 338-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">In <em>State v. Hill, </em>142 Or App 189, 921 P2d 969 (1996), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 521 (1998), we applied <em>Sparklin </em>in the context of an aggravated murder sentencing. After the defendant had been arrested and arraigned on aggravated murder charges in Benton County, a Marion County police officer who had assisted in the Benton County investigation sought to interview the defendant about two crimes that were factually unrelated to the Benton County charges. The officer told the defendant that, \u201cbecause [the] defendant was in so much trouble in Benton County, those cases probably would not be prosecuted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192. The defendant then made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>incriminating admissions about those crimes and several other crimes. Although no charges were ever pursued concerning those crimes, the state offered evidence of the defendant\u2019s admissions at the sentencing hearing in the Benton County case. On appeal, we concluded that, although the questioning concerned matters that were \u201cfactually unrelated\u201d to the Benton County crimes, the evidence was nevertheless inadmissible in the Benton County case because the defendant\u2019s right to counsel under Article I, section 11, had attached. Because the defendant\u2019s participation in other crimes would be relevant and admissible at sentencing on the Benton County aggravated murder charges, the uncounseled questioning about those other crimes violated Article I, section 11. <em>Id. </em>at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">In <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. O\u2019Farrell, </em>191 Or App 627, 83 P3d 931 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005), a youth had been charged with animal abuse for killing a dog. <em>Id. </em>at 629. After the court appointed counsel for the youth, several police officers who were aware of the pending charges involving the dog questioned the youth about a factually unrelated matter involving the abuse of a cat. Before turning to the legal question presented in that case, we recited the following background:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">\u201cThe parties agree that the trial court correctly ruled that, because youth was represented by counsel regarding the dog case at the time of the interview, in discussing that case the detectives violated youth\u2019s right to counsel under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution * * *. <em>State v. Sparklin, </em>296 Or 85, 93, 672 P2d 1182 (1983) * * * They also agree that the detectives could lawfully question youth concerning the cat case because he had not been charged with that conduct and it was not inextricably intertwined with the dog case. <em>Sparklin, </em>296 Or at 95; <em>State v. Hill, </em>142 Or App 189, 195-96, 921 P2d 969 (1996), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 521 (1998). Finally, the parties agree that youth voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The parties frame the issues before this court as (1) whether the detectives exploited the unlawful discussion of the dog case to obtain youth\u2019s admissions in the cat case, and (2) whether the statements made by youth after the detectives mentioned the dog case were voluntary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>O\u2019Farrell, </em>191 Or App at 637. We made no reference to <em>Sparklin </em>apart from the foregoing observation that there was no <em>Sparklin </em>issue presented on appeal. The parties agreed that <em>Sparklin </em>was not implicated because the cat case \u201cwas not inextricably intertwined with the dog case.\u201d However, the parties\u2019 framing of the <em>Sparklin </em>test in <em>O\u2019Farrell </em>was not dis-positive in the latter case. Rather, the issues in <em>O\u2019Farrell </em>were (1) whether evidence of the factually unrelated matter should be derivatively suppressed because the police had exploited earlier information that they had unlawfully obtained, and (2) whether the youth\u2019s statements were voluntary. <em>Id. </em>at 631, 632-36. In short, neither <em>O\u2019Farrell </em>nor any other appellate decision supports the state\u2019s premise that, for matters to be \u201cfactually related\u201d under <em>Sparklin, </em>the facts must be \u201cinextricably intertwined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Our task, then, is to determine the meaning of the term \u201cfactually unrelated,\u201d for purposes of <em>Sparklin, </em>as it relates to the circumstances here. As can be seen from our previous decisions, we have not examined that question in depth. In <em>Staunton, </em>we noted that the stolen car provided the necessary factual link between the initial driving offenses and the burglary in which the car was stolen. 79 Or App at 338. That situation was comparable to the circumstances in <em>Sparklin, </em>where the credit cards provided the necessary factual link. The state makes much of the fact that, unlike the circumstances in <em>Sparklin </em>and <em>Staunton, </em>the physical evidence in the present cases, that is, the various checks, was not identical and, moreover, that the victims in the two cases were different. Although that is true, a number of countervailing factors preponderate in favor of the conclusion that the two matters were factually related.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">First, two detectives from different precincts in the same jurisdiction \u2014 Malanaphy and Glass \u2014 were investigating remarkably similar crimes, perpetrated within close temporal proximity, and involving the same suspect \u2014 defendant. Malanaphy contacted Glass because he learned about her investigation of charges that were similar to the crimes he was investigating. Glass, in turn, was able to provide Malanaphy with specific information about two additional counterfeit checks relating to his case. The detectives believed that the crimes were perpetrated by defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>using a home computer to create false checks. Both detectives went to defendant\u2019s home together to question his wife about defendant\u2019s accomplices. In short, they were working together to glean evidence relating to defendant, defendant\u2019s computer, and defendant\u2019s accomplices that might be relevant to either or both of their cases. Finally, although his specific questions related to the APF case, not the BTS case that Glass was investigating, Malanaphy encouraged defendant to reveal information about other crimes beyond the ones committed in the APF case. Indeed, in response to Malanaphy\u2019s questioning, defendant made admissions about using a computer to create fraudulent checks that were relevant to, and were used against him in, both of these consolidated cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">In sum, the crimes in the consolidated cases were remarkably similar, involved overlapping evidence, and were committed in the same jurisdiction within close temporal proximity to each other, and the detectives investigating both sets of crimes were working collaboratively. In such circumstances, and where defendant had been charged in one of the cases and counsel had been appointed for him in that case, defendant was \u201centitled to the benefit of an attorney\u2019s presence, advice and expertise in any situation where the state may glean involuntary and incriminating evidence or statements for use in the prosecution of its case against defendant.\u201d <em>Sparklin, </em>296 Or at 93. We conclude that the BTS case and the APF case were factually related, and as a consequence, Malanaphy was not entitled to question defendant concerning the BTS case without first contacting defendant\u2019s attorney. The trial court therefore erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the challenged evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-8\"> Before trial, the state moved to consolidate the two cases, asserting that the cases \u201care either of the same or similar character, are based on the same act or transaction, or are based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.\u201d The trial court granted the motion; that decision is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b28-6\"> We note in passing that <em>none </em>of the court\u2019s cases touching on \u201ccriminal episode,\u201d \u201csame act or transaction,\u201d or \u201cfactually unrelated\u201d makes use of the phrase \u201cinextricably intertwined.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b29-7\"> We note, somewhat ironically given the facts of the present case, that Justice Linde pointed out the following in a concurrence in <em>Sparklin:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">\u2018What makes the [\u2018factually unrelated\u2019] distinction appear plausible in this case is that a defendant jailed in one city on the charge on which he had legal counsel confessed to an apparently unrelated crime in another city, in response to questions by officers from that city. <em>But the distinction is likely to prove difficult to administer when * </em>* <em>* officers from the same or a closely associated jurisdiction question a suspect about activities related in time or place, * * * or by the repetition of similar unlawful acts.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 99 (Linde, J., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b30-7\"> Interestingly, <em>Taylor </em>involved the same facts as <em>Sparklin. </em>Both defendants were implicated in the same crimes in those cases. In <em>Taylor, </em>only a federal constitutional question concerning the Sixth Amendment was presented, and it concerned the then-applicable federal constitutional analysis, which has since been significantly altered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
