In particular, he asserts that, because the state failed to adduce sufficient evidence concerning whether a warrant could have been obtained, it did not demonstrate that the \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d exception to the warrant requirement was applicable. <em>State v. Machuca, </em>347 Or 644, 227 P3d 729 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The pertinent facts are undisputed. Defendant was pulled over by a police officer on suspicion of driving while intoxicated at approximately 8:00 p.m. At 8:24 p.m., after defendant had performed field sobriety tests, the officer arrested defendant. The arresting officer transported defendant to a local precinct where defendant consented to take a Breathalyzer test. After the requisite observation period, the arresting officer conducted the breath test at 9:22 p.m. The arresting officer testified at trial about the procedures that he would have needed to follow to get a warrant, and he estimated that it would have taken one and one-half to two hours to obtain a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Defendant argues that, under <em>Machuca, </em>there is no <em>per se </em>rule that exigent circumstances exist in cases involving alcohol dissipation, and that the state must prove that it could not have obtained a warrant within a \u201creasonable\u201d time.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">In <em>Machuca, </em>the court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">\u201cthe evanescent nature of a suspect\u2019s blood alcohol content is an exigent circumstance that will ordinarily permit a warrantless blood draw of the kind taken here. We do so, however, understanding that particular facts may show, in the rare case, that a warrant could have been obtained and executed <em>significantly </em>faster than the actual process otherwise used under the circumstances. We anticipate that only in those rare cases will a warrantless blood draw be unconstitutional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 657 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>This is not, as defendant contends, the type of \u201crare case\u201d posited in <em>Machuca. </em>Defendant was arrested for DUII after performing poorly on field sobriety tests and promptly transported to the precinct. The breath test was administered 58 minutes after the arrest. The undisputed testimony showed that obtaining a warrant would have taken an hour and one-half to two hours. Thus, the evidence did not establish that a warrant could have been obtained and executed faster, much less \u201csignificantly faster,\u201d than the actual process used in this case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
