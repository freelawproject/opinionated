The resolution of this case depends on whether the terms of a development agreement between the city and River\u2019s Edge allowed the city to impose system development charges (SDCs) on River\u2019s Edge for its construction of a convention facility. River\u2019s Edge contends that the agreement precluded such charges absent a triggering event that did not occur in this case. The city asserts that the agreement expressly allowed it to charge the SDCs. After cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court concluded that the agreement unambiguously precluded the city from assessing the SDCs at issue. The city appeals, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment to River\u2019s Edge and its denial of the city\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. Alternatively, the city maintains that the development agreement is ambiguous and the case should be remanded to the trial court for the consideration of extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent. We conclude that the development agreement unambiguously authorizes the SDCs charged by the city and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The underlying controversy between the parties involves River\u2019s Edge\u2019s planned unit development (PUD). River\u2019s Edge began developing the PUD in the early 1980s. The parties entered into the development agreement at issue in 2004; by that point, a portion of the PUD had been developed to include a hotel, golf course, and residences. By 2004, the development plan was revised on several occasions and those revisions required the city\u2019s approval. The revision and approval process led to disputes and litigation between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In an effort to resolve then-pending litigation and other issues related to River\u2019s Edge\u2019s planned construction of a convention facility in the PUD, the parties negotiated the development agreement at issue in this case. As required by statute, the city adopted an ordinance approving the development agreement. <em>See </em>ORS 94.508(2) (stating that the governing body must \u201capprove a development agreement * * * by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>adoption of an ordinance declaring approval\u201d)- Ordinance NS-1951 included over 160 pages of findings and conclusions related to the PUD and the development agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\">As to what happened next, the parties stipulated to the following facts for purposes of the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment. River\u2019s Edge constructed a convention facility within the scope of the development agreement. As a result, the city assessed SDCs in connection with that construction in the amount of $142,190. River\u2019s Edge, under protest, paid the SDCs. River\u2019s Edge filed suit against the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">As pertinent to this appeal, River\u2019s Edge brought a claim alleging that the city had breached the development agreement by imposing the SDCs. River\u2019s Edge also sought a declaration under ORS chapter 28 that it is not subject to any exactions in connection with the PUD except as provided in the development agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the trial court granted partial summary judgment to River\u2019s Edge and denied summary judgment to the city. Accordingly, the court entered judgment awarding damages in the amount of the SDCs paid\u2014 $142,190, plus interest. The city appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">We interpret contract provisions according to a three-step process. <em>Yogman v. Parrott, </em>325 Or 358, 361-64, 937 P2d 1019 (1997). First, we examine the text of the disputed provisions in the context of the document as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at 361. In doing so, we determine as a matter of law whether the provision is ambiguous. If the words or terms of a contract, in context, are susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, they are ambiguous. <em>Pacific First Bank v. New Morgan Park Corp., </em>319 Or 342, 348, 876 P2d 761 (1994). Put another way, a contract is unambiguous \u201cif its meaning is so clear as to preclude doubt by a reasonable <em>person.\u201d Deerfield Commodities v. Nerco, Inc., </em>72 Or App 305, 317, 696 P2d 1096, <em>rev den, </em>299 Or 314 (1985). If a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>contains provisions that are mutually inconsistent, the contract is ambiguous as to that subject unless the inconsistent provisions can be reconciled in reading the contract as a whole. <em>Madson v. Oregon Conf. of Seventh-Day Adventists, </em>209 Or App 380, 384, 149 P3d 217 (2006). If the provision is unambiguous, our analysis ends and we construe the words of the contract as a matter of law. If the provision is ambiguous, we proceed to the second step of the analysis \u2014 the examination of extrinsic evidence of the contracting parties\u2019 intent. <em>Yogman, </em>325 Or at 363. If extrinsic evidence does not provide an answer, we proceed to the third step\u2014reliance on appropriate maxims of construction. <em>Id. </em>at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">We begin with the provisions of the development agreement that are central to the parties\u2019 dispute. River\u2019s Edge contends that Section 7 eliminates its obligation to pay SDCs until the development agreement expires or it exceeds the \u201cMaximum Density\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the PUD as that term is defined in the agreement. The relevant portions of Section 7 state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201c7.1 The City shall not require any additional off-site transportation mitigation measures or street exactions pursuant to Street Policy 6 or any other land use ordinance or policy, unless River\u2019s Edge applies for, and the City approves, modifications to the River\u2019s Edge Village 2004 PUD that would increase the total number of Peak Hour Trips beyond the total number of trips in the Maximum Density, in which case, the development that exceeds the Maximum Density may be subject to additional transportation-related exactions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201c7.2 River\u2019s Edge shall provide additional mitigation for sewer-related impacts by granting the sewer easements to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the City (Exhibits A-ll, A-12 and A-19). The Sewer Easements, together with prior dedications, satisfies River\u2019s Edge\u2019s obligation to provide sewer impact mitigation in connection with the Maximum Density, expressed as Equivalent Residential Units (\u2018ERUs\u2019). The City shall require no other sewer-related exactions as a condition of approval, unless River\u2019s Edge applies for, and the City approves, modifications to the River\u2019s Edge Village 2004 PUD that would increase the total number of ERUs beyond the total number of ERUs in the Maximum Density, in which case, the development that exceeds the Maximum Density may be subject to additional sewer-related exactions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\">\u201c7.3 Water supply volume and pressure requirements to serve the River\u2019s Edge Village 2004 PUD have been satisfied by dedication, and no further improvements or charges shall be assessed or exacted as a condition of approval, unless River\u2019s Edge applies for, and the City approves, modifications to the River\u2019s Edge Village 2004 PUD that would increase the total number of ERUs beyond the total number of hookups in the Maximum Density, in which case, the development that exceeds the Maximum Density may be subject to additional water-related exactions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">\u201c7.4 Other than as specified in this Agreement, there shall be no additional dedications for public use of land or rights-of-way taken as exactions in any City Permit or on account of any component of the Proposed Development. The City\u2019s commitment herein does not extend to exactions that might be required by Third Party governmental entities * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The city acknowledges that Section 7 waived some \u201cexactions,\u201d but asserts that the SDCs charged in this case were not waived in Section 7. Instead, the city maintains that the SDCs were separately addressed and explicitly required by Section 11. Section 11 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">\u201c11. Fees and Charges. River\u2019s Edge and the City shall each pay the filing fees and charges in effect at the time any land use or other applications are filed with the City. When building permit applications are filed for all or any portion of the Proposed Development, the applicant shall pay and the City shall collect the System Development Charges (\u2018SDC\u2019) in effect at the time of each application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>(Underlining in original.) Thus, the question, as framed by the competing contract provisions, is whether the waiver of exactions in Section 7 exempts River\u2019s Edge from paying the SDCs that the city charged under Section 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The city, on appeal, contends that the exactions referenced in Section 7 relate only to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">\u201cproperty and property rights previously transferred and to-be transferred to the City by [River\u2019s Edge] for location of the infrastructure necessary to provide water, sewer, and transportation services to [River\u2019s Edge\u2019s] developments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The city explains that, when the parties entered into the development agreement, they agreed that River\u2019s Edge had \u201cdone all that was required to create a sufficient infrastructure, up to the Maximum Density, and no more exactions were required[,]\u201d but, if the development exceeded the agreed upon Maximum Density, the plaintiff would become susceptible to exactions for that portion, as set out in Section 7. The city maintains that SDCs are not the type of exactions specified in Section 7 and that, \u201cseparate from the provisions addressing the infrastructure for [River\u2019s Edge\u2019s] development,\u201d the parties addressed River\u2019s Edge\u2019s obligation to pay SDCs in Section 11. Accordingly, the two provisions can be read in harmony \u2014 Section 7 excused River\u2019s Edge from contributing the specific types of exactions listed in that section unless Maximum Density was reached, but Section 11 explicitly required River\u2019s Edge to pay any applicable SDCs when River\u2019s Edge filed building permit applications. The city contends that the interpretation advanced by River\u2019s Edge would render Section 11 meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">River\u2019s Edge\u2019s argument on appeal, reduced to its core, is that the development agreement was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">\u201cintended to provide to the [c]ity all infrastructure exac-tions necessary to allow development of the River\u2019s Edge PUD to the \u2018Maximum Density,\u2019 and to prevent the City from requiring any more exactions, of any kind, related to development of the PUD to the Maximum Density.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Accordingly, River\u2019s Edge asserts that SDCs are exactions of the type waived in Section 7. River\u2019s Edge explains that the text in Section 11 simply established that, \u201cwhen charges are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>due, for building permits or other approvals, the amount of those fees and charges will be determined with reference to then current fees and methodologies, not the fees and methodologies in place in 2004, when the Agreement was executed.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Our analysis begins with the text of the competing provisions in the development agreement. As the city points out, Section 7 references very specific types of exactions \u2014 all of which appear to relate to a transfer of property interests or property improvements required as a condition of land use approvals. Section 7.1 addresses \u201coff-site transportation mitigation measures or street exactions pursuant to Street Policy 6 or any other land use ordinance or policy.\u201d The first and second sentences of Section 7.2 address \u201cmitigation for sewer-related impacts\u201d in terms of sewer easements and prior dedications being granted to the city by River\u2019s Edge. The third sentence of Section 7.2 states that \u201cno other sewer-related exactions\u201d shall be required \u201cas a condition of approval\u201d unless the Maximum Density is exceeded, thus explicitly tying the waiver of sewer exactions to those already mentioned \u2014 easements and land dedications. Similarly, Section 7.3 refers to \u201c[w]ater supply volume and pressure requirements\u201d that have been satisfied by dedication, and \u201cno further improvements or charges shall be assessed or exacted as a condition of approval.\u201d Again, like Sections 7.1 and 7.2, Section 7.3 appears to frame the type of exaction addressed as an easement or dedication. Easements and dedications both implicate the transfer of a property interest. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>473 (9th ed 2009) (defining dedication as \u201c[t]he donation of land or creation of an easement for public use\u201d). Section 7.4 summarizes that, \u201c[o]ther than as specified in this Agreement, there shall be no additional dedications for public use of land or rights-of-way taken as exactions in any City Permit or on account of any component of the Proposed Development.\u201d Again, the text of Section 7.4 appears to link the use of the term \u201cexactions\u201d with the dedications and easements granted as part of the development agreement. Moreover, Section 7 precludes exactions that are imposed \u201cpursuant to * * * land use ordinance or policy\u201d or \u201cas a condition of approval.\u201d Those references plainly pertain to land use permits or approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Nevertheless, standing alone, the references to exac-tions in Section 7 could possibly be construed to include SDCs because SDCs have been classified as \u201cexactions\u201d for purposes of analyzing state and federal takings law. <em>See Rogers Machinery, Inc. v. Washington County, </em>181 Or App 369, 394, 45 P3d 966, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 492 (2002). Our task, however, is not to look at contract provisions in isolation, but to consider them in the context of the agreement as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The text of Section 11 calls into question the plausibility of River\u2019s Edge\u2019s proffered interpretation. River\u2019s Edge contends that Section 11 is simply a timing provision that establishes that, if the provisions in Section 7 ever trigger additional <em>exactions </em>\u2014 i.e., if the River\u2019s Edge development exceeds the Maximum Density \u2014 the amount of the fees and charges will be determined with reference to the then-current fee schedule, not the fee schedule in place in 2004. We fail to see how Section 11 can be read in that way. Although the first sentence of the provision plausibly dictates whether a current fee schedule or the fee schedule in 2004 controls, the second sentence does not appear capable of such a limited effect. The first sentence states that the parties \u201cshall each pay the filing fees and charges in effect at the time any land use or other applications are filed with the City.\u201d The second sentence, however, states, \u2018When building permit applications are filed for all or any portion of the Proposed Development, the applicant shall pay and the City shall collect the System Development Charges (\u2018SDC\u2019) in effect at the time of each application.\u201d That text explicitly dictates <em>whether </em>the applicant pays SDCs (\u201cthe applicant shall pay\u201d) and <em>when </em>the applicant pays SDCs (\u201c[w]hen building permit applications are filed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Further, Section 11 requires the payment of SDCs imposed as part of \u201cbuilding permit applications.\u201d Building permits are governed by a code promulgated by a state agency, ORS 455.020, as opposed to land use ordinances, and are not \u201cland use decisions,\u201d ORS 197.015(10)(b)(B) (so stating). They are not imposed as a \u201ccondition of [land use] approval.\u201d In addition, nothing in Section 11 explicitly limits SDCs to only those building permit applications filed after Maximum Density is reached. Similarly, there is no cross-reference to Section 7 that would link \u201cexactions\u201d referenced in Section 7 with the SDCs made payable in Section 11, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\u201cexaction\u201d is not defined in the agreement. Accordingly, nothing explicitly links the SDCs referenced in Section 11 with the use of \u201cexactions\u201d in Section 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Therefore, the text of Sections 7 and 11, when read together, indicate that River\u2019s Edge is excused from any further real property interest exactions of the kind identified in Section 7, but they are explicitly required to pay any applicable SDCs when building permit applications are filed. River\u2019s Edge\u2019s proposed interpretation of Section 11 as a statement of \u201ctiming\u201d is not plausible based on the specific text of the two sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Nevertheless, River\u2019s Edge cites several other provisions in the development agreement that it contends provides contextual support to its proffered reading of the development agreement. We address each in turn to determine if they call into question what appears to be the unambiguous text of Section 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">First, River\u2019s Edge points to several paragraphs in the development agreement that it claims would be rendered nugatory if Section 11 is interpreted to require River\u2019s Edge to pay SDCs as a matter of course. For example, River\u2019s Edge claims that the agreement\u2019s recitals unequivocally recognize that the purpose of the development agreement is to \u201cobtain assurances that the developer\u2019s infrastructure obligations have been fully discharged\u201d and to give River\u2019s Edge the right to continue development \u201cwith no further exactions.\u201d River\u2019s Edge also cites text in the agreement that indicates that, even in areas of the PUD that are still under design and will remain undeveloped for the time being, the city has determined that \u201cno further street, water, sewer and park trail exactions are due from River\u2019s Edge to the extent that the Maximum Density is not exceeded.\u201d Those provisions beg the question. Although they fortify the conclusion that certain exactions are waived in Section 7, they do not call into question the city\u2019s proffered interpretation \u2014 that the exactions referenced throughout the agreement are linked to the specific exactions described in Section 7 but do not include the SDCs due when building permit applications were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The city offers an additional explanation for the different treatment of \u201cexactions\u201d and SDCs in the development agreement. The city asserts that a PUD is first subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>approval through the land use permitting process \u2014 a process that may require certain exactions in the form of dedications and easements. A development agreement is often used to set expectations and obligations during the land use permitting process so that the parties are aware of the exactions and infrastructure needs required for approval during the initial process. In this case, the development agreement addressed those exactions and acknowledged that River\u2019s Edge had contributed sufficient property interests to the infrastructure to garner approval in the land use permitting process. However, after the PUD received approval in that process, River\u2019s Edge was required to submit building permit applications at the time of actual construction, thus triggering the SDCs. The development agreement recognizes that these are separate processes, in that Section 15 treats the building permit application process as a \u201cfuture discretionary approval\u201d and explains that the agreement is not intended to limit the city\u2019s discretion with regard to future building permit approvals. According to the city, the exactions referenced throughout the development agreement were concerned with the land use permitting process; the agreement separately dealt with SDCs related to the building permit applications in Section 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">River\u2019s Edge also notes that \u201cMaximum Density\u201d is expressed quantitatively in terms of \u201cEquivalent Residential Units\u201d (ERUs), which is also a term used in calculating SDC credits under the city\u2019s ordinances. According to River\u2019s Edge, the use of ERUs in the definition of \u201cMaximum Density\u201d evinces an intent to grant it a number of SDC credits that must be taken into account when the city assesses SDCs under Section 11. In other words, SDCs are not assessable until Maximum Density is exceeded. Contrary to River\u2019s Edge\u2019s contention, the agreement does not contain explicit language establishing SDC credits. The definition of \u201cMaximum Density\u2019 is simply a recognizable way of quantifying the concept of \u201cMaximum Density\u201d in the agreement. In light of the text of Section 11 and Section 7, the mere use of ERUs in the definition of \u201cMaximum Density\u201d does not convince us that those sections are inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In summary, the first step of contract interpretation requires us to determine as a matter of law whether the disputed provisions of the contract are ambiguous. In this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the explicit text of Section 11 is open to only one plausible interpretation \u2014 SDCs are due and payable when building permit applications are filed. There are no other provisions in the contract that reasonably link the SDCs due under Section 11 with the exactions waived in Section 7, so as to make Section 7 mutually inconsistent with Section 11. Accordingly, we conclude that the development agreement unambiguously authorizes the SDCs charged by the city in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-6\"> River\u2019s Edge also brought a claim for unjust enrichment and a takings claim under Article I, section 18, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Neither of those claims were determined by the limited judgment under review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\"> The development agreement defines \u201cMaximum Density\u201d as \u201can overall density in the River\u2019s Edge Village 2004 PUD that puts no greater burden on the City\u2019s infrastructure than the sum of (1) the existing development in the River\u2019s Edge Village PUD, (2) the development authorized by the 2004 Master Plan Amendments and (3) the Remaining Development at a stated density. It is expressed quantitatively as 585 sewer EDU credits, 585 water EDU credits, and 505 PM Peak Trips. By way of illustration, the 2004 PUD Master Plan Amendments allocate the Maximum Density to 27,058 square feet of meeting space, 10,300 square feet of restaurant, 101 condominiums, 388 residential units, and a spa and recreation center.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The parties agree that \u201cEDU\u201d is a typographical error and was intended to mean \u201cERU,\u201d the Equivalent Residential Units referenced in Section 7.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
