The trial court\u2019s ruling was predicated on our decision in <em>State v. Machuca, </em>231 Or App 232, 218 P3d 145 (2009) <em>(Machuca I). </em>After the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion, the Supreme Court reversed our decision in <em>Machuca I, </em>holding that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">\u201cfor purposes of the Oregon Constitution, the evanescent nature of a suspect\u2019s blood alcohol content is an exigent circumstance that will ordinarily permit a warrantless blood draw of the kind taken here. We do so, however, understanding that particular facts may show, in the rare case, that a warrant could have been obtained and executed <em>significantly </em>faster than the actual process otherwise used under the circumstances. We anticipate that only in those rare cases will a warrantless blood draw be unconstitutional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-6\"><em>State v.

However, during the hearing concerning the motion to suppress, defendant withdrew those issues from the court\u2019s consideration. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s order concerned only the suppression of defendant\u2019s breath test results.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
