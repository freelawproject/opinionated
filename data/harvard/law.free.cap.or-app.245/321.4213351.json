J.</author>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Respondent appeals from a restraining order that the trial court entered under the Family Abuse and Prevention Act (FAPA), ORS 107.700 to 107.735. Respondent asserts that there was insufficient evidence to establish that petitioner was a victim of abuse. In particular, respondent challenges the trial court\u2019s determination under ORS 107.705(l)(b) that respondent placed petitioner in fear of imminent bodily injury. Respondent also argues that there was insufficient evidence to show that petitioner was in imminent danger of further abuse and that he is a credible threat to petitioner\u2019s safety. ORS 107.718. Respondent asks us to exercise our discretion to review <em>de novo. See </em>ORS 19.415. Because respondent has failed to advance a compelling reason for us to do so, we decline his request. <em>See State v. S. T. S., </em>236 Or App 646, 654-55, 238 P3d 53 (2010). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Without belaboring the facts in unnecessary detail, we review for \u201cany evidence\u201d to support the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Travis v. Strubel, </em>238 Or App 254, 256, 242 P3d 690 (2010). Petitioner and respondent had an intimate relationship that petitioner ultimately broke off in August 2009. Beginning in September 2009, respondent was frequently seen in petitioner\u2019s neighborhood, despite the fact that he lives more than six miles away. On September 2, about a week after their break up, petitioner discovered a flat tire on her car at 5:45 a.m. She then observed respondent driving by her house an hour later while she was changing the tire. On September 19, petitioner discovered that her car had been \u201ckeyed.\u201d Petitioner confronted respondent about the incident, and he claimed that he had been out of town when the vandalism occurred, staying at a hotel where petitioner and respondent had once stayed. The hotel, however, had no record of respondent being there at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">During the fall of 2009, petitioner\u2019s next-door neighbor saw respondent walking by the neighbor\u2019s home so often that he thought respondent lived in the neighborhood. On several occasions during the same period, the neighbor\u2019s girlfriend observed respondent coming out from between petitioner\u2019s house and the neighbor\u2019s house; in one instance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>respondent turned \u201cinto the bushes.\u201d Also during that period, according to petitioner, she received voice and text messages from respondent stating, \u201cthat I wasn\u2019t a compassionate person; trust me, I can be just like you. I\u2019ll be seeing you soon.\u201d Petitioner found respondent\u2019s statements to be very unsettling, because she previously had told him that she did not want to see him or talk to him. Petitioner installed a padlock on the gate to her backyard after the neighbor told her that he had seen someone at the back gate. Petitioner\u2019s bedroom window is \u201cright at the backyard,\u201d and there is an entrance to the living area of the house from the backyard. According to one of petitioner\u2019s friends, as a result of respondent\u2019s lurking about, petitioner \u201cwas scared and fearful of him, and it was growing worse.\u201d In late October, respondent left a telephone message for petitioner that his brother had died. On November 5, petitioner discovered another flat tire on her car while it was parked on the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">On November 23, petitioner\u2019s neighbor saw an intruder in petitioner\u2019s backyard at about 2:00 a.m. The neighbor rang petitioner\u2019s doorbell to report the intrusion. Petitioner and the neighbor then called the police. The police responded, and they apprehended respondent in petitioner\u2019s backyard. Petitioner was so distraught when she saw respondent that it made the neighbor \u201cscared.\u201d Respondent testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">\u201cI got drunk that night. I have no excuse for that. I got drunk, had somebody drive me to the area, because I was too intoxicated to drive. I couldn\u2019t even tell you who the guy was. That\u2019s where I was. And he dropped me off, and I was going to put this letter on her back door, and then [here] come the police. And that was it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">When petitioner went into her backyard, she discovered the padlock was missing from her gate. The next morning, she found a small table in front of the backyard door to her house, and a light bulb had been loosened so that the outside light did not work. Petitioner then decided to apply for the instant restraining order. When a police officer asked petitioner to recount the events of November 23 about one month later, petitioner was crying, shaking, and visibly upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Petitioner obtained an <em>ex parte </em>FAPA order on November 23. Thereafter, respondent chased her in his car at such a high speed that petitioner was in danger. At that point, petitioner was so frightened for her life that she moved from her home to stay with a friend. In addition, on a different occasion, petitioner\u2019s neighbor and his girlfriend saw respondent coming out from the area between his house and petitioner\u2019s house. Respondent also left a threatening message on the voicemail of one of petitioner\u2019s friends, telling her that she was \u201cnext.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Respondent requested an evidentiary hearing on the <em>ex parte </em>FAPA restraining order, and the matter was heard on January 11, 2010. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">\u201cLooking at the totality of the facts, it isn\u2019t an allegation there was actual physical contact. The allegation was fear. And I\u2019m sorry, but the conduct of having someone in someone\u2019s backyard uninvited in the middle of the night \u2014 and the evidence is uncontroverted he\u2019s [been] there more than once \u2014 is certainly sufficient for a stalking order. That issue isn\u2019t before me. The issue is this order, and the court finds, yes, it is. This order remains in effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">On appeal, respondent readily acknowledges that his conduct was \u201ccreepy\u201d and that petitioner was afraid of him. However, respondent disputes that the evidence sufficed to show, as required by ORS 107.705(l)(b), that petitioner had been placed \u201cin fear of imminent bodily injury,\u201d or that, as required by ORS 107.718(1), petitioner was \u201cin imminent danger of further abuse\u201d from respondent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">To warrant the issuance of a FAPA restraining order, the petitioner must show that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">\u201c[(1) the petitioner] has been the victim of abuse committed by the respondent within 180 days preceding the filing of the petition, that [(2)] there is an imminent danger of further abuse to the petitioner and that [(3)] the respondent represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-9\"><em>Fielder and Fielder, </em>211 Or App 688, 693, 157 P3d 220 (2007) (citing ORS 107.718(1)). The analysis of ORS 107.718(1) begins with the question whether petitioner is a \u201cvictim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>abuse.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner alleged that she is a victim of abuse because respondent placed her in fear of imminent bodily injury. Establishing \u201cfear of imminent bodily injury\u201d does not require overt threats or physical violence. <em>Fielder, </em>211 Or App at 693-95. For example, behavior that is \u201cerratic, intrusive, volatile and persistent\u201d conduct combined with an \u201cobsess[ion] with the idea of killing another person\u201d may place a petitioner in \u201cfear of imminent serious bodily injury and in immediate danger of further abuse.\u201d <em>Lefebvre v. Lefebvre, </em>165 Or App 297, 301-02, 996 P2d 518 (2000). However, even if a petitioner makes subjective assertions of fear, a FAPA restraining order will not be upheld when there is insufficient evidence that the alleged conduct creates an imminent danger of further abuse and a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner. <em>Roshto v. McVein, </em>207 Or App 700, 704-05, 143 P3d 241 (2006). To determine whether \u201cfear of imminent bodily injury\u201d has been established requires an examination of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Fielder, </em>211 Or App at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">In this case, there was evidence to support the trial court\u2019s implicit determination that, as she had asserted, petitioner was a victim of abuse because respondent had \u2014 at least recklessly \u2014 placed her in fear of imminent bodily injury. His multiple uninvited trespasses onto her property, coupled with his veiled threats in his voicemail and text messages, and her reasonable belief that, in light of his presence in the vicinity when her car had been vandalized, he had committed those acts, had already placed petitioner in fear for her safety before November 23, 2009. The evidence that she discovered respondent\u2019s presence in her backyard late <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>that night, found that he likely had removed the padlock from her gate to gain entry, learned the next morning that he likely had unscrewed a light bulb near her back door while lurking there and, as a consequence was extremely afraid for her safety, was sufficient in the totality of the circumstances to establish that petitioner was in fear of imminent bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Next, under ORS 107.718(1), petitioner was required to show that she was in imminent danger of further abuse. An overt threat of physical violence is not required to support such a finding. <em>See Lefebvre, </em>165 Or App at 301. To make such a finding, the trial court may consider testimony regarding events outside the 180-day window to satisfy ORS 107.718(1). <em>Id. </em>at 303. The record before us reflects a continuing pattern of respondent\u2019s chilling behavior. Respondent\u2019s conduct in chasing petitioner in his car, his persistent trespasses on her property, and his threat to her friend even after the <em>ex parte </em>restraining order was issued amply demonstrate a dangerous obsession that belies his protests of aberrant intoxication and remorse. There was sufficient evidence to establish that petitioner is in imminent danger of further abuse by respondent; the same evidence showed that respondent represents a credible threat to petitioner\u2019s physical safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-5\"> \u201cAbuse\u201d under ORS 107.705(1) is defined, in part, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">\u201c* * * the occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\u201c(a) Attempting to cause or intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causing bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">\u201c(b) Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly placing another in fear of imminent bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">\u201c(c) Causing another to engage in involuntary sexual relations by force or threat of force.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Respondent acknowledges that petitioner was a family or household member for purposes of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
