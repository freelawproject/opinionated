A detailed statement of facts would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public. The trial court\u2019s ruling was predicated on our decision in <em>State v. Machuca, </em>231 Or App 232, 218 P3d 145 (2009) <em>(Machuca I). </em>After the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion, the Supreme Court reversed our decision in <em>Machuca I, </em>holding that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">\u201cfor purposes of the Oregon Constitution, the evanescent nature of a suspect\u2019s blood alcohol content is an exigent circumstance that will ordinarily permit a warrantless blood draw of the kind taken here. We do so, however, understanding that particular facts may show, in the rare case, that a warrant could have been obtained and executed <em>significantly </em>faster than the actual process otherwise used under the circumstances. We anticipate that only in those rare cases will a warrantless blood draw be unconstitutional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\"><em>State v.
