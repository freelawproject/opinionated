He asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence discovered as a result of the removal of a console located between the front seats of his vehicle. According to defendant, the removal of the console exceeded the scope of a valid inventory search because the area searched was not designed to hold valuables. The state agrees that defendant\u2019s motion to suppress should have been granted because the search of the area under the console was not a proper inventory search. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
