J.</author>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Defendant Oregon Medical Group, P.C. (OMG) appeals a general judgment entered on a jury verdict in favor of plaintiffs Bobbi and Kevin Klutschkowski and their son Braedon Klutschkowski in this medical negligence action arising from the circumstances of Braedon\u2019s birth and a supplemental judgment awarding plaintiffs their costs and disbursements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, OMG contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred in (1) denying its motion for a directed verdict and instructing the jury on plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cinformed consent claim\u201d; (2) denying its motion to reduce the jury\u2019s award of noneconomic damages to $500,000 because application of the statutory cap \u2014 ORS 31.710 \u2014 to plaintiffs\u2019 claim for prenatal injuries does not violate the remedy clause and jury trial provisions of the Oregon Constitution; and (3) awarding plaintiffs, as the prevailing party, their costs in preparing trial transcripts under ORS 21.470(5). As amplified below, we reject OMG\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for a directed verdict because OMG failed to demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the ruling and conclude that its challenge to the trial court\u2019s jury instruction concerning informed consent is unreviewable. Further, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying OMG\u2019s motion to reduce the jury\u2019s award of noneconomic damages and in awarding plaintiffs the cost of preparing daily trial transcripts. Accordingly, we reverse the general and supplemental judgments, in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Consistently with our standard in reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict, we view the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>including any inferences, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, here, plaintiffs. <em>Hudjohn v. S&amp;G Machinery Co., </em>200 Or App 340, 342, 114 P3d 1141 (2005). In general terms, this negligence case concerns alleged complications arising from Braedon\u2019s birth by vaginal delivery and Braedon\u2019s alleged resultant injuries. To provide essential context, before turning to the particular facts, we begin by briefly describing a delivery complication that is at the heart of the <em>dispute </em>\u2014 viz., a shoulder dystocia.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">A shoulder dystocia occurs when a baby\u2019s shoulder becomes stuck behind the mother\u2019s pubic bone. Generally, once a shoulder becomes stuck, doctors use obstetric maneuvers to attempt to facilitate the baby\u2019s delivery. Two such maneuvers are (1) the McRoberts maneuver, which involves flexing the mother\u2019s hips to change the angle of the pubic bone by bringing her legs back up against her chest, and (2) the Woods corkscrew maneuver, which involves the doctor placing his or her hands inside the mother\u2019s vagina on the baby\u2019s shoulders and turning or rotating the baby 180 degrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">When a shoulder dystocia occurs, the baby is at risk of suffering a variety of injuries, including death. A brachial plexus injury is one of the most common and serious injuries that occurs with a shoulder dystocia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, it is undisputed that Braedon has a brachial plexus injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Based on expert testimony at trial, a shoulder dys-tocia occurs approximately once in every 100 births. Of that group of children who experience a shoulder dystocia during delivery, 15 percent will suffer a brachial plexus injury, and, of that group, 10 to 15 percent will have a permanent injury. Significantly, for purposes of this case, once a shoulder dys-tocia occurs during a delivery, there is a significantly higher risk that a shoulder dystocia will occur in subsequent deliveries involving the same mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">For those reasons, the standard of care in the medical profession requires that a doctor inform a mother who has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>had a previous shoulder dystocia of the increased risk of a subsequent shoulder dystocia and a brachial plexus injury to the baby occurring during a vaginal delivery and advise her to consider a cesarean section to reduce or avoid those risks. With that context in mind, we turn to the historic facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">On March 3,1999, Bobbi, who was a patient of OMG, gave birth to her third child, Anna. Bobbi delivered Anna vaginally. Although Anna was unharmed, the delivery was complicated by a shoulder dystocia. Significantly, the doctor who delivered Anna specifically noted, in his report, that \u201c[t]here was a shoulder dystocia managed by shoulder rotation maneuver with the patient\u2019s hips in a flexed position.\u201d However, the doctor did not tell Bobbi about the shoulder dystocia, and Bobbi was unaware that a complication had occurred during the delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Several years later, in 2002, Bobbi and Kevin married. Thereafter, in the spring of 2003, Bobbi became pregnant, and she scheduled an appointment with OMG in June. Because the doctor who had previously delivered her other children had since moved, Bobbi was scheduled to see Dr. Amy McCarthy, an obstetrician and employee of OMG.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In preparation for that appointment, Laura Carpenter, a medical assistant, reviewed OMG\u2019s medical records. Significantly, based on the doctor\u2019s report concerning Anna\u2019s delivery, Carpenter noted on the current pregnancy record that Anna\u2019s delivery had been complicated by a shoulder dystocia.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Soon after Bobbi arrived for her appointment, however, an ultrasound confirmed that Bobbi had suffered a miscarriage. Accordingly, Dr. McCarthy did not address potential obstetrical complications with Bobbi. Nevertheless, following the appointment, Dr. McCarthy dictated a report, noting, as part of Bobbi\u2019s past medical history, the shoulder dystocia that had occurred during Anna\u2019s delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">A few months later, Bobbi became pregnant with Braedon, and, in early October, she scheduled an appointment with Dr. McCarthy. Rebecca Manwill, a medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>assistant, completed a new pregnancy record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Unlike Carpenter, who reviewed OMG\u2019s medical records for information about Bobbi\u2019s prior pregnancies, Manwill obtained that information from Bobbi, who, as previously noted, was unaware that a complication had occurred during Anna\u2019s delivery. In sum, the pregnancy record did not indicate that one of Bobbi\u2019s previous deliveries had been complicated by a shoulder dystocia.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Following that initial appointment in October, Dr. McCarthy managed Bobbi\u2019s pregnancy. On April 16, 2004, Dr. McCarthy determined that Braedon\u2019s size was large for his gestational age, and she ordered an ultrasound for further evaluation. Thereafter, on April 20, before the ultrasound was completed, OMG sent the current pregnancy record to the hospital at which Bobbi planned to deliver.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Three days later, on April 23, an ultrasound confirmed Dr. McCarthy\u2019s determination about Braedon\u2019s size. Specifically, the ultrasound indicated that his weight was approximately 3,964 grams, which was greater than the 97th percentile for babies of his gestational age.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because of Braedon\u2019s size, Dr. McCarthy believed that Bobbi \u201chad a risk for a shoulder dystocia\u201d during delivery and, on April 29, she and Bobbi discussed inducing labor. Ultimately, Dr. McCarthy scheduled an induction for early May.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">According to Dr. McCarthy, she had \u201cforgotten about the documentation\u201d in OMG\u2019s records \u2014 including her own notation in the June 2003 report \u2014 concerning a shoulder dys-tocia during Anna\u2019s delivery. Instead, Dr. McCarthy relied on the current pregnancy record and Bobbi\u2019s statements concerning her previous pregnancies, neither of which indicated that a prior shoulder dystocia had occurred. For that reason, in their discussions on April 29, Dr. McCarthy did not inform Bobbi that there was an increased risk of a repeat shoulder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>dystocia and brachial plexus injury occurring during a vaginal delivery and that, to avoid those risks, she should consider a cesarean section. Had Bobbi been informed of those risks and the alternative of a cesarean section, she would have chosen to have a cesarean section.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">On May 2, the day before the scheduled induction, Bobbi went into labor. Dr. Zena Monji, an obstetrician and employee of OMG, was on call that day. Dr. Monji reviewed Bobbi\u2019s pregnancy record, but, as noted, it did not include any reference to a previous shoulder dystocia or the results of the ultrasound, which indicated that Braedon was large for his gestational age. Dr. Monji testified that had she known about the prior shoulder dystocia and the results of the ultrasound, consistently with the standard of care, she would have informed Bobbi that there was an increased risk of a repeat shoulder dystocia and a brachial plexus injury and would have advised her to consider a cesarean section.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Ultimately, Bobbi delivered Braedon vaginally. As had previously occurred when Bobbi delivered Anna, a shoulder dystocia occurred during Braedon\u2019s delivery. Although Dr. Monji\u2019s report referred to a \u201c[n]ormal spontaneous vaginal birth\u201d and did not expressly refer to a shoulder dystocia, she noted that the \u201c[s]houlders and body were delivered with a modified McRoberts maneuver.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When Bobbi saw Braedon following his delivery, his right arm was bruised and discolored, and, although he was moving his left arm, his right arm \u201cjust laid there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Ultimately, Braedon was diagnosed with a permanent, disabling brachial plexus injury that occurred during his vaginal delivery and that would have been avoided had a cesarean section been performed. Specifically, Braedon\u2019s right arm is physically deformed, and he suffers from reduced strength and reduced and abnormal movement and function.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Braedon\u2019s injury will adversely affect his ability to perform activities of daily living <em>(e.g., </em>reaching and removing something from a cupboard, placing his suitcase in the overhead compartment of an airplane, typing, walking on a slippery sidewalk due to his abnormal gait, and dressing). Further, Braedon\u2019s injury will affect his employability and earning capacity. Specifically, Judith Parker, a vocational rehabilitation specialist, testified that Braedon\u2019s \u201cfuture wage earning capacity will likely be impaired by as much as 25% in consideration of the seriousness of his physical impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">In 2006, plaintiffs filed this action for damages against OMG, as well as a variety of other entities and individuals. <em>See </em>245 Or App at 526 n 1. Thereafter, they amended their complaint several times. Ultimately, the third amended complaint alleged claims against OMG, Dr. McCarthy, and Dr. Monji.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the day before trial, plaintiffs dismissed both Dr. McCarthy and Dr. Monji and the allegations of negligence against them, as well as several of the specifications of negligence against OMG \u2014 the only remaining defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">As pertinent to the issues on appeal, the operative complaint alleged a claim for negligence in paragraph 5. Specifically, paragraph 5 alleged that \u201cOMG was negligent in one or more of the following respects:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">\u201c(d) In failing to inform Bobbi[ ] Klutschkowski that the occurrence of shoulder dystocia in the March 3, 1999, delivery and the fetal size determination by Dr. McCarthy and by the April 23, 2004, ultrasound increased the risk of shoulder dystocia occurring in a vaginal delivery of Braedon Klutschkowski;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">\u201c(e) In failing to inform Bobbi[ ] Klutschkowski that there was increased risk of Braedon Klutschkowski suffering a brachial plexus injury if shoulder dystocia occurred during his delivery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">\u201c(f) In failing to offer Bobbi[ ] Klutschkowski the option of a C-section as an alternative to a vaginal delivery of Braedon Klutschkowski;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>\u201c(g) In failing to document in Bobbi[ ] Klutschkowski\u2019s pregnancy record for her pregnancy with Braedon Klutschkowski the occurrence of shoulder dystocia during the March 3,1999, delivery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">\u201c(h) In failing to inform Dr. Monji of the occurrence of the shoulder dystocia in Bobbi Klutschkowski\u2019s March 3, 1999, delivery, of Dr. McCarthy\u2019s assessment of Braedon\u2019s fetal size as large for gestational age and of the April 23,2004, ultrasound documentation of an estimated fetal weight of 3,964 [grams] and greater than the 97th percentile[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Further, in a separate paragraph \u2014 paragraph 8 \u2014 plaintiffs alleged that OMG \u201cdid not obtain Bobbi Klutschkowski\u2019s informed consent to deliver Braedon Klutschkowski vaginally rather than by cesarean section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">As framed by those allegations, the parties\u2019 competing theories of the case hinged, as a practical matter, on a single, factual question: Did a shoulder dystocia occur during Anna\u2019s delivery in 1999? In turn, each party\u2019s respective answer to that question ultimately dictated a different standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 theory was straightforward. Essentially, they contended that, because a shoulder dystocia occurred when Anna was delivered, the standard of care required that OMG (1) inform Bobbi of the increased risk of a subsequent shoulder dystocia and a brachial plexus injury occurring during a vaginal delivery and (2) advise her to consider a cesarean section to reduce or avoid those risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Conversely, OMG presented expert testimony to support its contention that, although a shoulder dystocia had been documented in connection with Anna\u2019s delivery, that complication had actually <em>not </em>occurred \u2014 and, thus, there was no reason for Bobbi to have been informed of an increased risk of a repeat shoulder dystocia and a brachial plexus injury occurring during a vaginal delivery and advised to consider a cesarean section. In sum, OMG proffered evidence that no shoulder dystocia had occurred in 1999 and that, in the absence of an <em>actual </em>prior shoulder dystocia, there was no violation of the standard of care in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The juxtaposition of those competing theories became acute toward the end of trial, when the court ruled on several reserved motions, including OMG\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, and finalized the jury instructions. The court\u2019s decisions as to those issues reflected its understanding of how the parties had, in presenting their evidence, framed the case for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">The court began by ruling on OMG\u2019s motion for a directed verdict as to what OMG referred to as plaintiffs\u2019 statutory informed consent \u201cclaim\u201d under ORS 677.097<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\u2014 that is, the allegation in paragraph 8 that OMG \u201cdid not obtain Bobbi Klutschkowski\u2019s informed consent to deliver Braedon Khitschkowski vaginally rather than by cesarean section.\u201d As pertinent to the issues on appeal, OMG contended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Stated differently, in moving for a directed verdict, OMG\u2019s position was that a physician need not obtain informed consent for <em>any </em>vaginal delivery because a vaginal delivery is not a \u201cprocedure or treatment\u201d as contemplated by ORS 677.097. The court denied that motion without amplification.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\u201c[ijnformed consent is not necessary where there is no \u2018medical procedure or treatment\u2019 involved. ORS 677.097. Vaginal child birth is a naturally occurring event that could never be included within the definition of a \u2018medical procedure.\u2019 Whether or not an expectant mother \u2018consents\u2019 to a vaginal delivery, the event will occur without physician intervention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Although OMG\u2019s motion for a directed verdict framed a purely legal issue, as previously described, 245 Or App at 532, the parties\u2019 competing theories concerned whether <em>the facts of this case </em>required OMG to inform Bobbi about risks of and alternatives to delivering Braedon vaginally. The court focused on those theories as it finalized the jury instructions. Of significance, the court understood that whether informed consent was required in this case was a jury question \u2014 an understanding with which OMG\u2019s counsel agreed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Ultimately, the court instructed the jury that plaintiffs had raised five specific allegations of negligence and then essentially recited verbatim the specifications set out in paragraph 5 of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. <em>See </em>245 Or App at 531-32 (quoting plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of negligence). With regard to informed consent, the trial court gave the following instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\">\u201cTo obtain the informed consent of a patient, a physician must explain the following: One, in general terms, the procedure or treatment to be undertaken; two, that there may be alternative procedures or methods of treatment, if any; and, three, that there are risks, if any, of the procedure or treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\u201c \u2018Explain\u2019 means to make plain or understandable, clear of complexities or obscurities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">\u201cAfter giving that explanation, the physician must ask the patient if the patient wants a more detailed explanation. If the patient requests further explanation, the physician must then disclose, in substantial detail, the procedure, the viable alternatives, and material risks of the procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">\u201cA risk of procedure or treatment is material when a reasonable person, in what the physician knows or should know to be the patient\u2019s position, would be likely to attach significance to the risk alone or in combination with other risks in deciding whether or not to undergo the procedure or treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">\u201cA <em>failure to obtain [Bobbi\u2019s] informed consent may be considered by you in determining whether or not [OMG] was negligent.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\"><em>\u201cIn order to find [OMG] negligent in failing to provide informed consent, </em>you must determine that [Bobbi] would not have consented to a vaginal delivery had all the risks and alternatives you find to be material been disclosed to her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">Thereafter, the jury returned a general verdict, finding that OMG had been negligent. Specifically, the verdict form, as completed by the jury, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u201cWe, the jury, find:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">\u201c1. Was [OMG] <em>negligent </em>in one or more of the ways alleged by plaintiffs, and, if so, was such <em>negligence </em>a cause of damage to plaintiffs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">\u201cANSWER: YES (Yes or No)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">\u201cIf your answer to Question 1 is \u2018No,\u2019 your verdict is for [OMG]. Your presiding juror should sign this Verdict. Do not answer any more questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">\u201cIf your answer to Question 1 is Yes,\u2019 proceed to Question No. 2. At least the same nine of you who answered Yes\u2019 to Question 1 must agree on the answer to Question No. 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">\u201c2. What are plaintiffs\u2019 damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">\u201cEconomic Damages $557,881.11</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">\u201cNon-economic Damages $1,375,000.00\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">In response to the verdict, OMG filed a motion to reduce plaintiffs\u2019 award of noneconomic damages to $500,000, pursuant to ORS 31.710, the statutory cap on noneconomic damages.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> OMG contended that, because a claim for prenatal injuries did not exist in 1857 when the Oregon Constitution was adopted, the $500,000 cap applied without violating either the remedy clause of Article I, section 10, or the jury trial provisions of Article VII (Amended), section 3, and Article I, section 17. Conversely, plaintiffs contended that the application of ORS 31.710 in the circumstances of this case violated the remedy clause because plaintiffs\u2019 claim was not a claim for prenatal injuries but, rather, a common-law negligence claim. Again without elaboration, the trial court denied OMG\u2019s motion and entered a general judgment consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict. OMG timely appealed that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">Plaintiffs then sought to recover certain costs and disbursements. As pertinent to the issues raised on appeal, plaintiffs, relying on ORS 21.470(5), sought $5,184.75 for \u201c[bjearing transcript and trial transcript fees\u201d incurred during trial. OMG objected. According to OMG, \u201cORS 21.470 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>applies only to costs for preparing transcripts on appeal, not for transcripts obtained during trial.\u201d The court rejected OMG\u2019s argument and entered a supplemental judgment awarding plaintiffs costs, including the disputed transcript costs. OMG then filed an amended notice of appeal from the supplemental judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">On appeal, OMG raises six assignments of error. We reject without discussion OMG\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error concerning one aspect of the trial court\u2019s jury instructions and the court\u2019s failure \u201cto direct a verdict on [OMG\u2019s] vicarious liability based on conduct by Dr. Monji.\u201d We address the remaining assignments of error in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We begin with OMG\u2019s first and second assignments of error concerning, respectively, the trial court\u2019s denial of OMG\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and the jury instructions pertaining to OMG on plaintiffs\u2019 informed consent \u201cclaim.\u201d In those interrelated assignments, OMG contends that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">\u201cthe trial court erred when it denied [OMG\u2019s] motion for a directed verdict and instructed the jury on plaintiffs\u2019 informed consent claim. The allegations and evidence in this case describe a breach of a standard of care claim based on Dr. McCarthy\u2019s purported failure to investigate [Bobbi\u2019s] previous pregnancies and then appropriately advise her based on her medical history; this case has nothing to do with ORS 677.097 or \u2018informed consent.\u2019 A vaginal delivery is not a \u2018procedure or treatment\u2019 from which a woman can withhold consent. Because the court\u2019s instruction permitted the jury to find [OMG] liable on an impermissible ground, a new trial is warranted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">As explained below, we need not resolve the merits of OMG\u2019s assignment of error concerning the denial of its motion for a directed verdict on plaintiffs\u2019 informed consent \u201cclaim\u201d because, even if the trial court erred, OMG has not demonstrated that it was prejudiced by any error in that regard. Further, we reject as unreviewable OMG\u2019s challenge to the jury instructions concerning informed consent because OMG\u2019s present contention was unpreserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">We turn first to the assignment of error concerning the trial court\u2019s denial of OMG\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Pursuant to ORS 19.415(2), we may reverse or modify a judgment only if there is an error that \u201csubstantially affect[s] the rights of a party.\u201d In <em>Shoup v. Wal-Mart Stores, </em>Inc., 335 Or 164, 173-74, 61 P3d 928 (2003), the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\">\u201cThe possibility that an error might have resulted in a different jury verdict is insufficient under the statute. Instead, the court must be able to conclude, from the record, that the error \u2018substantially affect[ed]\u2019 the rights of the losing party. Moreover, the statute protects the trial court judgment from reversal or modification \u2018except for\u2019 error substantially affecting a party\u2019s rights, indicating that reversal of a judgment is the exception, not the rule. The rule embodied in ORS 19.415(2) is neutral as between plaintiffs and defendants; it places the burden to make a record that demonstrates prejudicial error on whichever party loses in the trial court and then seeks reversal or modification of the judgment on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">(Brackets in <em>Shoup.) </em>Accordingly, the Supreme Court reasoned that, \u201cin a case involving a judgment on a general verdict based on multiple specifications [of negligence], one of which is invalid,\u201d the verdict will be sustained on appeal \u201cif there is evidence to support another, valid specification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\"><em>Shoup </em>is dispositive of OMG\u2019s first assignment of error. Here, in framing the case for the jury, the trial court and the parties treated the informed consent allegation in paragraph 8 \u2014 that is, that OMG \u201cdid not obtain Bobbi Klutschkowski\u2019s informed consent to deliver Braedon Klutschkowski vaginally rather than by cesarean section\u201d\u2014 as a specification of negligence. Our determination in that regard is predicated on two salient observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">First, the court\u2019s jury instructions treated OMG\u2019s alleged failure to obtain informed consent as a specification of negligence. In particular, the court told the jury that \u201c[a] failure to obtain [Bobbi\u2019s] informed consent may be considered by you in determining whether or not [OMG] was <em>negligent\u201d </em>and that, <em>\u201c\\i\\n order to find [OMG] negligent in failing to provide informed consent, </em>you must determine that [Bobbi] would not have consented to a vaginal delivery had all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>risks and alternatives you find to be material been disclosed to her.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Second, in discussing the general verdict form, the trial court noted that \u201cinformed consent [was] part and parcel of the specifications of negligence as set out in the jury instructions\u201d and was \u201cnot a separate question.\u201d Consistently with that understanding, the general verdict form presented a single question to the jury: \u201cWas [OMG] <em>negligent </em>in one or more of the ways alleged by plaintiffs, and, if so, was such <em>negligence </em>a cause of damage to plaintiffs?\u201d (Emphasis added.) Stated differently, by its express terms, the verdict form presented only one claim for the jury\u2019s consideration\u2014 <em>viz., </em>a claim for negligence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">With the function of paragraph 8 as a specification of negligence so understood, <em>Shoup\u2019s </em>application is patent. Here, apart from the allegation in paragraph 8, there were additional specifications of negligence alleged in paragraph 5. On appeal, OMG does not contend that those additional specifications were invalid or that there was insufficient evidence to support them. As noted, because the jury in this case returned a general verdict, we cannot determine the rationale for its ultimate determination of negligence. Accordingly, because the verdict might have been based on one or more specifications independent of the informed consent allegation in paragraph 8, OMG failed to demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the court\u2019s denial of its motion for a directed verdict and the subsequent submission of the specification in paragraph 8 to the jury. <em>See Shoup, </em>335 Or at 176. We thus reject the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Having rejected OMG\u2019s contention concerning the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for a directed verdict, we turn to OMG\u2019s related contention pertaining to the court\u2019s jury instructions concerning informed consent. OMG posits that, because a vaginal delivery is not a \u201cprocedure or treatment\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>for purposes of ORS 677.097, the court\u2019s instruction \u201cpermitted the jury to find [OMG] liable on an impermissible ground\u201d and, as such, was legally erroneous. Again \u2014 albeit for very different reasons than pertained to the first assignment of error \u2014 OMG\u2019s present challenge to the informed consent instruction is unreviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">ORCP 59 H prescribes the requisites of preserving an appellate challenge to purported instructional error. Specifically, ORCP 59 H(l) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\u201c[a] party may not obtain review on appeal of an asserted error by a trial court * * * in giving or refusing to give an instruction to a jury unless the party who seeks to appeal identified the asserted error to the trial court and made a notation of exception immediately after the court instructed the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Further, such exceptions shall be \u201cstate[d] with particularity.\u201d ORCP 59 H(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Since the amendment of ORCP 59 H in 2004, we have rigorously \u2014 some might think ruthlessly \u2014 enforced its requirement that an exception be taken after the jury has been instructed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And we have done so even when it has been apparent that the court and parties engaged in substantial preinstructional colloquy regarding the disputed instruction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Further, in construing and applying the rule\u2019s \u201cwith particularity\u201d requirement, we have, on one occasion, deemed a brief post-instructional exception that explicitly referred to, and incorporated by reference, the preinstructional colloquy to be sufficient. See <em>Deason v. TriMet, </em>241 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>App 510, 514 n 2, 251 P3d 779 (2011). However, we did so only where the preinstructional colloquy pertained directly to the disputed instruction in the form in which it was ultimately, actually given.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Specifically, in <em>Deason,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">\u201cbefore the jury was instructed * * *, the court informed the parties that it intended to give the jury the duty-to-assist instruction. Plaintiff asked to be heard on the issue and made extensive argument to the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cAfter hearing argument, the court noted plaintiffs objection for the record but stated that it was \u2018going to include the instruction as written.\u2019 Thereafter, the court gave the duty-to-assist instruction. After the jury was charged, plaintiff took exception \u2018to the special \u2014 or the addendum or the second part of the Special Duty instruction for the reasons that I\u2019ve already advanced to the Court, and I do think it was crucially important.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\"><em>Id. </em>Under those circumstances \u2014 in which the exception referred to extensive arguments to the trial court concerning the instruction that was ultimately given \u2014 we concluded that the \u201c[p]laintiff s exception to the instruction after the jury was charged, that referred the court to the extensive argument on the record, was clearly sufficient to satisfy the requirements of ORCP 59 H.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">With those principles in mind, we return to the circumstances of this case. In considering those circumstances, it is essential to reiterate and remember that OMG\u2019s present challenge to the informed consent instruction is that <em>no </em>instruction on informed consent should have been given because, as a matter of law, informed consent was inapposite. Here, the jury instructions generally \u2014 and the informed consent instruction specifically \u2014 evolved during the course of the trial, with the court preparing approximately 18 proposed drafts, <em>none of which is in the record. </em>Two days before the jury was actually instructed, the court indicated that the parties\u2019 arguments concerning the jury instructions had been sufficient to alert it to their concerns.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Nevertheless, on the day that the jury was instructed, the court began the proceeding by asking the parties whether they had exceptions to the <em>final </em>version of the instructions. OMG, incorporating the \u201cpoints that [it] raised during the discussions initially about jury instructions,\u201d excepted to the final paragraph of the informed consent instruction, which, as previously described, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">\u201cIn order to find [OMG] negligent in failing to provide informed consent, you must determine that [Bobbi] <em>would not have consented to a vaginal delivery </em>had all the risks and alternatives you find to be material been disclosed to her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">(Emphasis added.) OMG noted that that paragraph continued to contain \u201ca reference to Mrs. Klutschkowski having consented to a vaginal delivery\u201d \u2014 and suggested that the italicized phrase above should be replaced with the phrase \u201cwould have opted for a Cesarean section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Thereafter, the court gave the informed consent instruction described above. <em>See </em>245 Or App at 535 (quoting the entire informed consent instruction). Again, after the jury was instructed, the court, noting that the previously made exceptions were \u201ctaken as given,\u201d asked defense counsel whether he had any further exceptions. Defense counsel\u2019s only response concerned the definition of the term \u201cexplain,\u201d which counsel believed had been omitted from the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">In sum, after the jury was instructed, OMG took exception to a single aspect of the informed consent instruction \u2014 that is, the purported omission of the definition of the term \u201cexplain.\u201d Further, to the extent that, under <em>Deason, </em>OMG could properly incorporate exceptions taken to the <em>final version </em>of the instruction before it was actually given, OMG\u2019s only expressed objection at that point was to the use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>phrase \u201cwould not have consented to a vaginal delivery\u201d instead of \u201cwould have opted for a Cesarean section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">On appeal, OMG does not reiterate either of its contemporaneous challenges to the informed consent instruction as actually given. Instead, as noted, it now raises a qualitatively different <em>exception </em>\u2014 viz., that informed consent was inapposite as a matter of law. We reject that challenge as unreviewable for any of three independently sufficient reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><em>First, </em>even under Deason\u2019s benign incorporation-by-reference construction of ORCP 59 H(2)\u2019s \u201cwith particularity\u201d requirement, the referent is the preinstructional colloquy relating to the disputed instruction, in its final form, as it was actually given. As noted, OMG\u2019s present challenge was not expressed even in that referent colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\"><em>Second, </em>to the extent that OMG would have us, notwithstanding Deason, refer to any discussions antedating the ultimate colloquy, the record in that regard defies review. As noted, there were approximately 18 different iterations of the proposed instructions, none of which (except the last) is part of our record. Reading those transcribed discussions is akin to reading critical reviews of a book, without the book \u2014 or, even more, criticisms of a series of drafts without each draft. Further, because the instructions were a \u201cmoving target,\u201d objections that pertained to one version might not pertain to a subsequent version.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\"><em>Third, </em>as previously explained, the parties\u2019 competing theories concerned whether <em>the particular facts of this case </em>required OMG to inform Bobbi about risks of and alternatives to delivering Braedon vaginally. For that reason, the trial court understood that whether informed consent was required in this case was a jury question, and defense counsel agreed. Accordingly, OMG\u2019s contrary appellate contention\u2014 <em>viz., </em>that <em>no </em>instruction on informed consent should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>been given because, as a matter of law, informed consent was inapposite \u2014 was unpreserved for our review. <em>See Peitsch v. Keizer, </em>219 Or App 114, 116, 180 P3d 1239 (2008) (rejecting as unpreserved a claim of instructional error because \u201cthe exception that [the] plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did raise at that time did not cogently present for the trial court\u2019s consideration the alleged deficiencies in that instruction that [the] plaintiffs urge on appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Having rejected OMG\u2019s liability-related challenges, we turn to its fifth assignment of error. In that assignment, OMG contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion to reduce plaintiffs\u2019 award of noneconomic damages to $500,000 pursuant to ORS 31.710(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">\u201cExcept for claims subject to ORS 30.260 to 30.300 and ORS chapter 656, in any civil action seeking damages arising out of bodily injury, including emotional injury or distress, death or property damage of any one person including claims for loss of care, comfort, companionship and society and loss of consortium, the amount awarded for nonecon-omic damages shall not exceed $500,000.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Specifically, relying on our opinion in <em>Christiansen v. Providence Health System, </em>210 Or App 290, 150 P3d 50 (2006), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>344 Or 445, 184 P3d 1121 (2008), OMG contends that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">\u201cORS 31.710 does not violate the remedy clause of Article I, section 10[,] of the Oregon Constitution when applied to a claim for prenatal injuries. In <em>Christiansen </em>* * *, this court applied the remedy clause methodology set forth by the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>Smothers v. Gresham Transfer, </em>Inc., 332 Or 83, 23 P3d 333 (2001), and held that the statute of ultimate repose found at ORS 12.110(4) did not violate the remedy clause when applied to a claim for prenatal injuries. This court reasoned that because a claim for prenatal injuries caused by medical negligence was not recognized by the common law of Oregon or any other jurisdiction around the time the Oregon Constitution was adopted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the plaintiffs would not have had an absolute common law right to bring such an action at that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">According to OMG, because plaintiffs sought to recover for Braedon\u2019s prenatal injuries, application of ORS 31.710 did not violate the remedy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Relatedly, OMG contends that application of the statutory cap to plaintiffs\u2019 claim for prenatal injuries does not violate the jury trial provisions of Article I, section 17, or Article VII (Amended), section 3. That is so because, notwithstanding several appellate decisions that antedated the analytical methodology established in <em>Smothers, </em>more recent case law indicates that, in OMG\u2019s words, \u201cwhere there is no protected right to a remedy, there can be no protected right to a jury trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Conversely, plaintiffs dispute the predicate of OMG\u2019s argument \u2014 that is, that plaintiffs\u2019 claim is a claim for prenatal injuries. Instead, they contend, plaintiffs\u2019 claim is properly, and simply, characterized as a negligence claim\u2014 and because a claim for negligence antedated 1857, the application of ORS 31.710 to limit plaintiffs\u2019 recovery would violate the remedy clause. Alternatively, they contend that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lakin v. Senco Products, Inc., </em>329 Or 62, 987 P2d 463, <em>on recons, </em>329 Or 369, 987 P2d 476 (1999), \u201ceven if [plaintiffs\u2019 claim] is for prenatal injuries, [it] is, at a minimum, of like nature to a negligence claim that existed in 1857,\u201d so that application of the statutory cap violates Article I, section 17. Finally, plaintiffs contend that Article VII (Amended), section 3, \u201capplies to all common law tort claims, regardless of whether they existed in 1857,\u201d and, thus, the application of ORS 31.710 to plaintiffs\u2019 common-law negligence claim violates that constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">For the reasons explained below, we agree with OMG that, under <em>Christiansen, </em>a claim for prenatal injuries in the circumstances presented here did not exist in 1857. Further, in light of several cases decided after <em>Smothers, </em>we conclude that, because plaintiffs would not have had a cognizable claim for prenatal injuries in 1857, neither the remedy clause of Article I, section 10, nor the jury trial provisions of Article I, section 17, and Article VII (Amended), section 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>preclude the application of ORS 31.710 in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In <em>Christiansen, </em>the plaintiff, who was the mother and conservator of the estate of her minor child, brought an action against a hospital and an obstetrician, alleging that they \u201cfailed to recognize signs of fetal distress and maternal infection during [the] plaintiffs labor * * * and, as a result, negligently delayed performing a cesarean section delivery of the child,\u201d who suffered injuries. 210 Or App at 292. The issue in <em>Christiansen </em>was whether the statute of ultimate repose in ORS 12.110(4) violated the remedy clause of Article I, section 10, which provides, in part, that \u201cevery man shall have remedy by due course of law for injury done him in his person, property, or reputation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Applying the analytic construct established in <em>Smothers, </em>we explained that the dispositive issue was whether the plaintiff had alleged an injury to a right that Article I, section 10, protected. In other words, the question became \u201cwhether a claim for prenatal injuries caused by medical negligence was recognized by the common law of Oregon, or any other jurisdiction, around the time the Oregon Constitution was adopted.\u201d <em>Christiansen, </em>210 Or App at 297. Ultimately, we concluded that, \u201c[i]n the years immediately surrounding the adoption of the Oregon Constitution, no Oregon case addressed whether an infant injured <em>during birth </em>could maintain an action for medical negligence against the delivering physician.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297-98 (emphasis added). Accordingly, we held that application <em>of </em>ORS 12.110(4) did not violate the remedy clause.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Consistently with the reasoning expressed in our opinion in <em>Christiansen, </em>we conclude that a claim for prenatal injuries \u2014 including those that occur during birth \u2014 did not exist at the time that the Oregon Constitution was adopted. Accordingly, in the circumstances of this case, the remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>clause does not preclude application of the statutory cap on noneconomic damages. Further, as we will explain, our determination in that regard also necessarily forecloses plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the jury trial provisions of Article I, section 17, and Article VII (Amended), section 3, preclude the application of ORS 31.710.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">We begin with Article I, section 17, which provides that \u201c[i]n all civil cases the right of Trial by Jury shall remain inviolate.\u201d That constitutional provision \u201cis not a source of law that creates or retains a substantive claim or a theory of recovery in favor of any party.\u201d <em>Jensen v. Whitlow, </em>334 Or 412, 422, 51 P3d 599 (2002). Instead, as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Lakin, </em>\u201cArticle I, section 17, guarantees a jury trial in civil actions for which the common law provided a jury trial when the Oregon Constitution was adopted in 1857 and <em>in cases of like </em>nature.\u201d 329 Or at 82 (emphasis added). A few years later, the Supreme Court decided <em>Hughes v. PeaceHealth, </em>344 Or 142, 154-55, 178 P3d 225 (2008), a case in which the plaintiff contended that \u201cthe jury trial right that Article I, section 17, guarantees is not confined to the class of cases in which it was customary in 1857, but also applies to cases of like nature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In that case, the plaintiff posited that, in light of the principle that the court had expressed in <em>Lakin, </em>as well as other cases, she had a right to a jury determination of damages in her wrongful death claim because it was akin to a personal injury action. The court rejected the plaintiffs \u201cexpansive\u201d view of her claim because it clearly conflicted with the principle that Article I, section 17, is not a source of law that creates or retains a substantive claim or theory of recovery. Given <em>Hughes, </em>and in light of our holding in <em>Christiansen, </em>we necessarily reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that, \u201ceven if [plaintiffs\u2019 claim] is for prenatal injuries, [it] is, at a minimum, of like nature to a negligence claim that existed in 1857\u201d such that application of the statutory cap violates Article I, section 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">We turn then to the final constitutional provision invoked in this <em>case </em>\u2014 viz., Article VII (Amended), section 3. That provision states, in part, that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u201c[i]n actions at law, where the value in controversy shall exceed $750, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of this state, unless the court can affirmatively say there is no evidence to support the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">In <em>Voth v. State of Oregon, </em>190 Or App 154, 161, 78 P3d 565 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 377 (2004), the plaintiff contended that Article I, section 17, and Article VII (Amended), section 3, \u201cguaranteed him the right to a trial by jury on his claims for noneconomic damages.\u201d Noting that Article I, section 17, was not a \u201csource of law that creates or retains a substantive claim or a theory of recovery in favor of any party,\u201d <em>Jensen, </em>334 Or at 422, we held that Article I, section 17, \u201cd[id] not assist [the] plaintiff\u2019 because \u201cthe common law did not provide a jury trial for negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress actions against the state in 1857[,]\u201d <em>Voth, </em>190 Or App at 161. Similarly, we held that the plaintiff s contention concerning Article VII (Amended), section 3, failed for the same reason. <em>Id. </em>at 161-62. Specifically we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">\u201cIn <em>Greist v. Phillips, </em>322 Or 281, 293, 906 P2d 789 (1995), the court characterized section 3 as \u2018guarant[eeing] that, after a jury trial, \u201cno fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of this state, unless the court can affirmatively say there is no evidence to support the verdict.\u2019 \u201d As the court explained in <em>Greist, </em>Article VII (Amended), section 3, addresses the power of courts to reexamine issues decided by a jury. 322 Or at 296. While Article VII (Amended), section 3, reaffirms the right of trial by jury, <em>it is not a source of law that creates or retains a substantive claim or theory of recovery and is like Article I, section 17, in that </em>regard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\"><em>Voth, </em>190 Or App at 162 (brackets in <em>Voth; </em>emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Here, as we have previously explained, plaintiffs had no protected right to a remedy because, consistently with our opinion in <em>Christiansen, </em>a claim for prenatal injuries did not exist at the time that the Oregon Constitution was adopted. Accordingly, consistently with the principles expressed in <em>Voth, </em>Article VII (Amended), section 3, does not assist plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">In sum, neither the remedy clause of Article I, section 10, nor the jury trial provisions of Article I, section 17, and Article VII (Amended), section 3, preclude application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ORS 31.710 under the circumstances of this case. For that reason, the trial court erred in denying OMG\u2019s motion to reduce plaintiffs\u2019 award of noneconomic damages to $500,000 pursuant to ORS 31.710(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Finally, we address OMG\u2019s sixth assignment of error. In that assignment, OMG contends that the trial court erred in awarding plaintiffs, as the prevailing party, the costs of preparing daily transcripts during trial because, OMG asserts, those costs are not recoverable under ORS 21.470(5). The parties essentially renew their arguments to the trial court concerning the proper construction of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In resolving that issue, we are guided by the principles of interpretation described in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), as amplified in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). In general terms, \u201cwe attempt to determine the meaning of the statute most likely intended by the legislature, examining the text in context along with any legislative history offered by the parties and, if necessary, relevant canons of construction.\u201d <em>Friends of Yamhill County v. Yamhill County, </em>229 Or App 188, 192, 211 P3d 297 (2009). Changes in the text of a statute over time are context for interpreting the version at issue in a given case. <em>See Krieger v. Just, </em>319 Or 328, 336, 876 P2d 754 (1994) (\u201cIn a serially amended statute * * *, the wording changes adopted from session to session are a part of [the] context of the present version of the statute being construed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">ORCP 68 A governs the allowance of costs and disbursements in the trial court. Although ORCP 68 A(2) does not include the costs of daily trial transcripts in its nonexclusive list of recoverable \u201ccosts and disbursements,\u201d the rule\u2019s definition of \u201ccosts and disbursements\u201d encompasses \u201cany other expense specifically allowed by agreement, by these rules, or by other rule or <em>statute.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) As support for the award in this case, as being \u201callowed by * * * statute,\u201d plaintiffs rely on a single sentence from ORS 21.470(5), which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, the fees for preparing a transcript requested by a party shall be paid forthwith by the party, and when paid shall be taxable as disbursements in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>In isolation that sentence would appear to confirm plaintiffs\u2019 contention that they are entitled to daily transcript fees. However, when the sentence is viewed in the context of ORS 21.470 as a whole, plaintiffs\u2019 position is unavailing. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\">\u201c(1) A reporter appointed under ORS 8.340(2) may not charge more than $2.50 per page for the original transcript, or more than 25 cents per page for each additional copy, for preparing transcripts <em>on appeal </em>as provided in ORS 8.350.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">\u201c(2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a reporter employed by one of the parties may charge fees as agreed to between the reporter and all of the parties to the proceeding for preparing transcripts <em>on appeal </em>as provided in ORS 8.350. The reporter and the parties shall agree to the fees to be charged prior to the commencement of the proceeding to be recorded. Any fees agreed upon shall be charged to parties joining the proceeding after the commencement of the proceeding for preparing transcripts <em>on appeal </em>as provided in ORS 8.350.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">\u201c(3) A reporter employed by one of the parties may not charge a public body, as defined by ORS 174.109, fees for preparing transcripts <em>on appeal </em>as provided in ORS 8.350 that exceed the fees established by subsection (1) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">\u201c(4) Each page of the original transcript <em>on appeal </em>prepared by a reporter under this section must be prepared as specified by rules for transcripts on appeal adopted by the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">\u201c(5) Except as otherwise provided by law, the fees for preparing a transcript requested by a party shall be paid forthwith by the party, and when paid shall be taxable as disbursements in the case. The fees for preparing a transcript requested by the court, and not by a party, shall be paid by the state from funds available for the purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">\u201c(6) When the court provides personnel to prepare transcripts from audio records of court proceedings, the transcript fees provided in subsection (1) of this section to be paid by a party shall be paid to the clerk of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Viewed in context, it appears that subsection (5), like every other subsection in this statute, concerns transcripts on appeal. Alternatively, to the extent that each of the subsections other than subsection (5) either specifies transcripts \u201con appeal\u201d or cross-references another subsection that does so, it might be argued that subsection (5), because it fails to specify \u201con appeal,\u201d applies to any transcript. The latter view, however, is foreclosed by the evolution of the statute over the last 30 years. In 1981, the legislature amended the then-extant version of ORS 21.470 \u2014 which pertained exclusively to appellate transcripts \u2014 by adding the sentence on which plaintiffs rely here. Or Laws 1981, ch 3, \u00a7 86 (Special Session). A \u201cbefore-and-after\u201d comparison of the text of ORS 21.470 shows that nothing in the amendment altered the statute\u2019s exclusively appellate application.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Thereafter, the statute was amended to its current form in 2005. Or Laws 2005, ch 164, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The 2005 amendments added three new <em>subsections </em>\u2014 viz., subsections (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>through (4) \u2014 each of which concerns the preparation of the transcript on appeal. Further, the sentence on which plaintiffs rely was moved from subsection (1) to its own subsection \u2014 that is, subsection (5). Despite that change in structure, however, the statute as a whole continued to reflect the legislature\u2019s intent that the recovery of \u201c[t]he fees for preparing a transcript\u201d as contemplated in subsection (5) referred to the transcript \u201con appeal\u201d referred to in the four preceding subsections. ORS 21.470.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Thus, the trial court erred in awarding plaintiffs the cost of preparing daily trial transcripts. Accordingly, we reverse the award of those costs in the supplemental judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">General judgment reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment reducing plaintiffs\u2019 award of noneconomic damages to $500,000; otherwise affirmed. Supplemental judgment reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\"> In addition to defendant OMG, other defendants are designated as appellants in the notice of <em>appeal </em>\u2014 viz., (1) Amy McCarthy; (2) Center for Women\u2019s Health, P.C.; (3) Zena I.

One of the preliminary versions of the informed consent instruction apparently contained a statement, requested by plaintiffs, that OMG was required to obtain Bobbi\u2019s informed consent to a vaginal delivery. During discussions of that language \u2014 which did not appear in the final version of the instruction \u2014 the following exchange occurred between the court and defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: So, you don\u2019t think there are circumstances under which, for example, like this case, where one might argue, no, the duty is such, under these facts, that informed consent was required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I guess I\u2019m not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, one of your experts testified over rather strenuous objection by [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] that this was not a situation in which informed consent was required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes. True.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Which impliedly means to me that there could be situations in which it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, I guess you would have to imply that. But I don\u2019t think that you can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I think obviously on this record, one could at least argue when to imply that, since most of [plaintiffs\u2019 evidence] said that it was a situation where informed consent was required. So I\u2019m struggling with, given that problem, where you\u2019re saying this isn\u2019t an informed consent case at all, and [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] is saying it\u2019s not only informed consent, but as a matter of law, it was required, it wasn\u2019t given, and I ought to win on that issue outright \u2014 if you take vaginal delivery as a default position, but not automatically assume that therefore there\u2019s no informed consent required, nor automatically assume that it must be required, then is the determination of the duty not the jury\u2019s?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-13\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It\u2019s the jury\u2019s.

Even if OMG\u2019s characterization of paragraph 8 were correct, it would not be entitled to relief because, as the verdict form indicates, a distinct claim for informed consent was never submitted to the jury.
