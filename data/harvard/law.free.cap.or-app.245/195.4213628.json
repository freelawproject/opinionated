J.</author>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Defendant was convicted of one count of unlawful possession of methamphetamine, ORS 475.894, and two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor, ORS 163.575. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying her motion to controvert the state\u2019s search warrant and her motion to suppress evidence discovered pursuant to that warrant. We reject those arguments without discussion and therefore affirm with respect to her conviction for unlawful possession of methamphetamine. With respect to the remaining misdemeanor convictions for endangering the welfare of a minor, defendant advances an additional argument: that the state failed to commence the prosecution within the two-year period of limitations for misdemeanors. ORS 131.125(6)(b) (subject to exceptions not applicable here, prosecutions for \u201cany misdemeanor\u201d must be commenced within two years). We agree that the state failed to timely commence the prosecution of the misdemeanor offenses and, accordingly, we reverse her convictions for endangering the welfare of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The procedural facts are undisputed. The events that form the bases of the charges against defendant occurred in 2005, and defendant was indicted shortly thereafter. The original indictment, however, was defective and was dismissed. At the time of the dismissal, the state \u201cput on the record\u201d that it intended to reindict defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">True to its word, the state reindicted defendant on October 29, 2007. The indictment included two misdemeanor charges of endangering the welfare of a minor; each crime was alleged to have been committed \u201con or about November 10, 2005.\u201d On November 1, 2007, the district attorney sent defendant a letter by first-class mail advising her that her arraignment was scheduled for November 15 and that her failure to appear could result in the issuance of a warrant for her arrest. The caption of the letter identified the charges against her as \u201cunlawful possession of methamphetamine\u201d and \u201cendangering the welfare of a minor (2 counts).\u201d Defendant appeared for her arraignment on November 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Before trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>ground that the state had not commenced its prosecution of those offenses within the time mandated by ORS 131.125(6)(b). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">\u201cExcept as provided in subsection (7) of this section or as otherwise expressly provided by law, prosecutions for other offenses <em>must be commenced </em>within the following periods of limitations after their commission:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\u201c(a) For any other felony, three years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">\u201c(b) <em>For any misdemeanor, two years.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\u201c(c) For a violation, six months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">(Emphasis added.) The limitation period for the offense of endangering the welfare of a minor, a misdemeanor, is neither \u201cprovided in subsection (7) of this section\u201d nor \u201cotherwise expressly provided by law\u201d for purposes of ORS 131.125; accordingly, a prosecution for that offense \u201cmust be commenced\u201d within two years of the offense \u2014 in this case, by November 10, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">For limitation purposes, \u201c[a] prosecution is commenced when a warrant or other process is issued, provided that the warrant or other process is executed without unreasonable delay.\u201d ORS 131.135. Before the trial court, defendant took the position that the district attorney\u2019s letter regarding her arraignment was not \u201ca warrant or other process,\u201d and, for that reason, it did not commence the prosecution against her. Rather, she argued, the prosecution did not commence until she was arraigned on November 15, 2007, more than two years after the date of the crimes alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The state responded that the district attorney\u2019s letter was, indeed, \u201cother process\u201d within the meaning of ORS 131.135, and that, because the letter had been sent \u201cwithout unreasonable delay,\u201d it therefore commenced the prosecution. The trial court agreed with the state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-11\">\u201cWell, under the limited facts of this case, because there was a previous proceeding, it was dismissed with contemplation that it was going to be reinitiated. And because the State did submit its process letter November 1st, 2007, within the statute of limitations, and in that, the Defendant did come in five days after the statute of limitations for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>arraignment process, I\u2019m going to find that process in this case was satisfactory under ORS 131.135, agreeing with the State\u2019s position, and I\u2019ll deny the motion. Otherwise, I think it might be otherwise well-founded but for the limited facts of this case.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Defendant later raised the issue again by way of a motion for a judgment of acquittal, which the trial court likewise denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">On appeal, defendant again argues that prosecution of the misdemeanor charges against her did not commence until she was arraigned on November 15, 2007, more than two years after she allegedly committed those offenses. In support of her contention, she cites <em>State v. Williams, </em>232 Or App 303, 222 P3d 31 (2009), which issued after the trial court denied her motions and which explicates the meaning of \u201cother process\u201d in ORS 131.135. In <em>Williams, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">\u201cProcess, for purposes of initiating a court action against a person, is commonly understood to mean a warrant, summons, or writ, that is, a legal instrument that requires the person to appear in court to respond to a charge or complaint. <em>E.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1242-43 (8th ed 2004). <em>The phrase \u2018warrant or other process\u2019 in the statute supports that understanding, because it implies that the \u2018other process\u2019 to which the statute refers are things akin to warrants.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">232 Or App at 306 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">In light of <em>Williams, </em>the state now all but concedes that the district attorney\u2019s letter was insufficient to commence prosecution on the misdemeanor charges: \u201cUnder that strict framework, the prosecution here on counts 2 and 3 [for endangering the welfare of a minor] would not appear to have been commenced within the limitation period because no warrant issued requiring defendant to appear for arraignment.\u201d The state rightly jettisons its argument that the district attorney\u2019s letter was \u201cother process\u201d within the meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>of ORS 131.135. The letter merely advised defendant of her arraignment date and asserted consequences of failing to appear; it was not a legal instrument that required her to appear in court to respond to a charge or complaint. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The state does not, however, concede that the trial court erred. The state instead argues that the misdemeanor convictions should be affirmed because defendant had <em>notice </em>that she was being prosecuted, notwithstanding the lack of a warrant or other process. The state\u2019s notice argument proceeds from our observation in <em>Williams </em>that the Criminal Law Revision Commission, which proposed the current version of ORS 131.135, intended the limitation statutes \u201cto give a defendant the ability to obtain evidence and to otherwise respond to charges before the passage of time impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to do that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307. According to the state, the trial court correctly concluded that those \u201cunderlying principles behind the limitation statutes\u201d were satisfied, because \u201cdefendant here not only had been indicted previously on these very charges, but she had notice that the state intended to refile charges against her after it dismissed the original indictment for technical reasons.\u201d The state concludes, \u201cBecause defendant had notice of the charges, and because she voluntarily appeared at her arraignment, she should be deemed to have consented to this process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The state\u2019s argument is premised on two fundamental misconceptions. First, we do not apply the \u201cunderlying principles\u201d of a statute as expressed by particular legislators during subcommittee hearings; we construe the enacted text. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (\u201cThe formal requirements of lawmaking produce the best source from which to discern the legislature\u2019s intent, for it is not the intent of the individual legislators that governs, but the intent of the legislature as formally enacted into law * * *.\u201d). The state makes no effort to identify text in the statute that could plausibly support its contention that notice alone is sufficient to commence a prosecution, and for good reason: the text of ORS 131.135 is patently inconsistent with that view. As we pointed out in <em>Williams </em>(indeed, in the sentences immediately following the portion quoted by the state), the general principle behind the limitation statutes was effectuated in a particular way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\u201cIn [the Criminal Law Revision Commission\u2019s] view, <em>that principle was best served by tying the commencement of a prosecution to the issuance of an arrest warrant or similar process, </em>because the issuance of such process is the step that is taken to bring a person to court to respond to criminal charges. Issuance of an arrest warrant generally follows the filing of an accusatory instrument and, compared to the filing of an accusatory instrument, issuance of an arrest warrant is more likely to lead the defendant to be brought to court to learn of the charges and of the need to respond to them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 307 (emphasis added). The text of ORS 131.135 unambiguously runs the limitation period from the time that \u201ca warrant or other process is issued,\u201d and not from the time that a defendant receives actual notice of an indictment. We are not at liberty to write that text out of the statute simply because, in the state\u2019s view, some of the same policy concerns could have been addressed in some other way, such as an \u201cactual notice\u201d exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Second, and relatedly, the obligation to timely commence a prosecution falls squarely on the state. Nothing in ORS 131.135 suggests that a defendant, by appearing at an arraignment, consents to a prosecution outside the statutory time frame; rather, the defendant is deemed to consent to commencement of the prosecution as of the date of his or her appearance. <em>See id </em>at 317. (\u201cAn appearance by a defendant in court in connection with the charges is sufficient to commence a prosecution even if no warrant is issued or executed. * * *. Thus, for example, if a defendant agrees to appear voluntarily to respond to charges <em>within the limitation period, </em>the action is timely commenced.\u201d (Emphasis added.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In this case, no \u201cwarrant or other process\u201d issued before defendant appeared at her arraignment on November 15, 2007. Accordingly, the prosecution did not commence \u2014 at least, for limitation purposes<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 until that appearance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 317; <em>see also Abbott v. Baldwin, </em>178 Or App 289, 36 P3d 516 (2001), <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 75, <em>cert den, </em>537 US 901 (2002) (previously dismissed indictment in a separate case is not sufficient to commence prosecution on a later indictment for purposes of ORS 131.135). By that time, more than two years had passed since the date of her offenses, and the trial court should have dismissed the misdemeanor charges against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Convictions for endangering welfare of a minor reversed; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\"> In denying the motion to dismiss, the trial court noted that the motion was untimely; it nonetheless considered and rejected the motion on its merits. <em>See </em>UTCR 4.010 (\u201cMotions for pretrial rulings on matters subject to ORS 135.037 and ORS 135.805 to 135.873 must be filed in writing not less than 21 days before trial or within 7 days after the arraignment, whichever is later, unless a different time is permitted by the court for good cause shown.\u201d). The state does not address on appeal the timeliness of that motion, and we do not discuss it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b223-7\"> \u201c[T]here are statutes that treat a prosecution as commencing when an accusatory instrument is filed. <em>E.g., </em>ORS 131.005(3), (4); ORS 135.747. However, ORS 131.135 establishes that a prosecution commences <em>for limitation purposes </em>when a warrant or other process is issued, as long as execution of the warrant or other process is not unreasonably delayed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\"><em>Williams, </em>232 Or App at 318 n 4 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
