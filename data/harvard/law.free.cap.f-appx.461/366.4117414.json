Alvarado argues that her within-guidelines 57-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). She asserts that the district court should have sentenced her below the guidelines range of imprisonment because the unlawful reentry Guideline is not empirically based and effectively double counts a prior conviction; she is prejudiced by a disparity between districts that employ \u201cfast track programs\u201d and the district in which she was sentenced, which lacks such a program; she committed her offense under duress; and her offense was tantamount to trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-21\">We review the substantive reasonableness of Alvarado\u2019s sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Alvarado correctly acknowledges that her arguments regarding the reentry Guideline and the lack of a \u201cfast track program\u201d are foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.2009). She has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that applies to her within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
