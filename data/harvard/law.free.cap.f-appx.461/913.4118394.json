First, he argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his second motion to reopen because his counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance created exceptional circumstances and caused him to receive insufficient notice of his hearing. Second, Enoh argues that he presented evidence of extrajudicial killings in Cameroon and that the BIA therefore abused its discretion in alternatively finding that he did not demonstrate changed country conditions that could excuse his time- and numerically-barred second motion to reopen. Upon review, we dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-15\">Enoh originally applied for asylum and withholding of removal in 1999. He failed to appear for his removal hearing that was held on May 23, 2001. As a consequence, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) deemed his application for relief abandoned and ordered him removed <em>in absentia. </em>In June 2009, over eight years later, Enoh moved to reopen his case, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and changed country conditions in Cameroon. Both the IJ and the BIA denied the motion. Enoh filed a second motion to reopen his removal proceedings that is based on the same grounds as his first motion. The BIA found the motion had no merit, and it denied his second motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-16\">\u201cWe review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1340 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). Our review is limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>Abdi v. U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number><em>Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are \u201cconclusive unless a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Lonyem, </em>352\" F.3d at 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-3\">If an alien fails to appear for a removal hearing, his application will be denied. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). Ordinarily, an alien may file only one motion to reopen his removal proceedings, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), which must be filed within ninety days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C). Time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen, however, do not apply when \u201c(1) an alien files a motion to reopen that seeks asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture; (2) the motion is predicated on changed country conditions; and (3) the changed conditions are material and could not have been discovered at the time of the removal proceedings.\u201d <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir .2009) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)\u00ae).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">Enoh already filed a motion to reopen based on his counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance, and he cannot file a second. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Therefore, Enoh\u2019s petition is dismissed insofar as it seeks to reopen removal proceedings on this ground. Additionally, time and numerical limitations are not suspended for his application for asylum and withholding of removal because Enoh has failed to show that conditions in Cameroon have changed. The evidence Enoh submitted regarding extrajudicial killings parallels the evidence that he submitted to support his original asylum application in 1999. Therefore, we deny his petition insofar as it seeks to reopen proceedings based on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-1\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
