He concedes that this argument has been rejected as to other guideline sentencing provisions. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.2009). His argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Miller, </em>665 F.3d 114, 118-26 (5th Cir.2011). Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary af-firmance is GRANTED, its alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
