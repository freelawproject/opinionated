In sentencing Sanders, the district court found that Sanders was not a career offender under the Sentencing Guidelines because Sanders\u2019s prior Florida conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 for resisting a law enforcement officer with violence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>\u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the career-offender enhancement. As a result, the court determined that Sanders did not qualify for a sentence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">On appeal, the government challenges the court\u2019s finding and insists that a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. The government further emphasizes that we are bound by this Court\u2019s prior decision in <em>United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir.2010), which holds that a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 1342. Conversely, Sanders claims that the offense is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 in light of precedent from the Supreme Court, which, he argues, undermines the holding in <em>Nix </em>to the point of abrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1240 (11th Cir.2011). In doing so, we apply the same analysis to the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 career offender enhancement as we do to the violent felony enhancement under the ACCA, <em>id. </em>at 1243 n. 5; <em>United States v. Whitson, </em>597 F.3d 1218, 1220 (11th Cir.2010), even though the provisions differ slightly in their wording, <em>compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a), <em>with </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). Consequently, cases that address the classification of offenses as violent felonies under the ACCA inform our conclusion regarding whether such offenses qualify as crimes of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a). <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1253 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The district court\u2019s determination that Sander\u2019s prior conviction for resisting arrest under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 did not qualify as a crime of violence was a reasonable conclusion under then-existing precedent, especially given Justice Scalia\u2019s recent observations about efforts to clarify what distinguishes \u201cviolent felonies\u201d from nonviolent ones under the ACCA. <em>See Sykes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2284, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201cAs was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clarification of the Delphic residual clause, today\u2019s opinion produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further confusion .... We should admit that ACCA\u2019s residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.\u201d). At the time of Sander\u2019s sentencing, the district court did not have the benefit of our decisions in <em>Nix </em>and <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>409 Fed.Appx. 277 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">In <em>Nix, </em>we held that a defendant\u2019s conviction for resisting a law enforcement officer with violence, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01, constituted a predicate \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. 628 F.3d at 1342. In doing so, we adopted the reasoning of the Court in <em>Hayes, </em>which holds that \u00a7 843.01 is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause because it presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, and involves elements of purposeful violence and aggression. <em>Nix, </em>628 F.3d at 1342; <em>see Hayes, </em>409 Fed.Appx. at 278-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">Seeing no basis for distinguishing <em>Nix, </em>we conclude we are bound by it. <em>See United States v. Kaley, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir.2009) (emphasizing that \u201c[w]e may disregard the holding of a prior opinion only where that holding is overruled\u201d or undermined to the point of abrogation \u201cby the Court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court\u201d (quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>omitted)); <em>see also Garrett v. Univ. of Ala. at Birmingham Bd. of Trs., </em>344 F.3d 1288, 1292 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cWithout a <em>clearly contrary </em>opinion of the Supreme Court or of this court sitting en banc, we cannot overrule a decision of a prior panel of this court .... \u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Even if, as Sanders points out, there is serious tension between <em>Nix </em>and recent Supreme Court case law, we may not disregard prior panel precedents as overruled or abrogated by the Supreme Court unless the conflicting Supreme Court decision is \u201cclearly on point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Vegar-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1237 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that \u201c[f]or the Supreme Court to overrule a case, its decision must have actually overruled or conflicted with this court\u2019s prior precedent,\u201d and that \u201c[e]ven if the reasoning of an intervening high court decision is at odds with a prior appellate court decision, that does not provide the appellate court with a basis for departing from its prior decision\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Under these constraints, we have little choice but to vacate the district court\u2019s decision and remand for resentencing in light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nix.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Although we reverse this case and remand for resentencing, we express no opinion as to the reasonableness of the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court, which is in a superior position to evaluate all of the relevant sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), of which the Sentencing Guidelines are only one part.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-19\">. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 makes it a felony to \"knowingly and willfully resist!], obstruct!], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>or oppose! ] any officer ... in the lawful execution of any legal duty, by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\">. Given that our holding in <em>Nix </em>decides the issue, we do not address the government\u2019s argument that violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 is also a \"crime of violence\u201d under the elements clause of the Sentencing Guidelines' career-offender enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
