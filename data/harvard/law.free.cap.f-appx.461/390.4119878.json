California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Escobar has filed a response. To the extent that Escobar\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance relate to his substantive sentencing claims concerning the 16-point sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) and the calculation of his criminal history points based on his prior sentences under \u00a7 4A1.1 and \u00a7 4A1.2, these claims present no nonfrivo-lous issue. <em>See Clark v. Collins, </em>19 F.3d 959, 966 (5th Cir.1994) (counsel does not render ineffective assistance by failing to make meritless objections). To the extent that Escobar\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel go beyond that, the record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Escobar\u2019s claims; such claims generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when [they have] not been raised before the district court since no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Escobar\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
