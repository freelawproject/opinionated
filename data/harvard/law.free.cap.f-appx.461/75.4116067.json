We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise a plenary standard of review. <em>See State Auto Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Pro Design, P.C., </em>566 F.3d 86, 89 (3d Cir.2009). For the reasons set forth below, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">This action concerns Lilly\u2019s drug Prozac. A doctor prescribed Prozac for Danysh on April 8, 1996. On April 25, 1996, a few days after discontinuing his use of the drug, Danysh shot and killed his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Danysh confessed to the crime, and almost immediately attributed his behavior to Prozac. He said that the medication caused him to \u201cact differently,\u201d so that \u201cwhen something bother[ed] [him], it bother[ed] [him] to extreme.\u201d However, despite Danysh\u2019s suspicions, he was unable to find evidence to support his theory, and he ultimately pleaded guilty in Pennsylvania state court. In November 1997, the trial court sentenced him to 22.5 to 60 years\u2019 imprisonment, and the Superior Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In May 2003, Danysh filed a petition pursuant to Pennsylvania\u2019s Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA). He claimed that he had discovered new evidence linking Prozac to violent behavior. In support of his petition, he presented a letter from Donald H. Marks, M.D., Ph.D., stating that \u201ca wide body of scientific literature\u201d showed that Prozac \u201cwould be capable of interfering with thought and judgment to enough a degree to interfere with your ability to understand the significance of a violent act.\u201d Danysh also submitted records of adverse reactions associated with Prozac and an article by three psychiatrists concerning side effects of antidepressant drugs. He continued to supplement his petition, and in July 2004, presented 31 additional exhibits that purportedly \u201chighlight[ed] Prozac\u2019s ability to cause violent/suicidal behavior in individuals\u201d and \u201cindicate[d] that the manufacturers of Prozac ... have purposely hid[den] the dangers associated with these drugs, including their potential to cause violent behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The PCRA courts denied all relief to Danysh. Nevertheless, he continued to research his theory. In August 2008, he allegedly learned that he was a \u201cpoor me-tabolizer of Prozac,\u201d which caused him to be \u201cabnormally susceptible to the negative side effects of Prozac.\u201d Then, in 2009, he read an article reporting, based on Lilly\u2019s internal documents, that the company had known since 1988 that Prozac could cause side effects like the ones that he allegedly experienced.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">On August 16, 2010, Danysh instituted this civil action. He claimed, under state law, that Lilly had committed fraud and negligence, violated the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (UTPCPL), and breached an express warranty. Danysh alleged, at bottom, that Lilly had unlawfully failed to warn him that Prozac could cause violent behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">A magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation concluding that Lilly was entitled to summary judgment because Danysh\u2019s action was barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. The District Court approved and adopted the report and recommendation, and Danysh then filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s disposition of this case. Pennsylvania law, which governs this diversity action, <em>see Mest v. Cabot Corp., </em>449 F.3d 502, 510 (3d Cir.2006), provides varying statutes of limitations for Danysh\u2019s different causes of actions. These limitation periods range from two years (fraud and negligence, <em>see Ash v. Cont'l Ins. Co., </em>593 Pa. 523, 932 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>A.2d 877, 879 (2007)) to six years (the UTPCPL, <em>see Lesoon v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>898 A.2d 620, 627 (Pa.Super.Ct.2006)). For the sake of simplicity, and because it does not affect the result of this case, we will proceed as if all of Danysh\u2019s claims were subj\u00e9ct to the six-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The statute of limitations begins to run on the date that \u201cthe cause of action accrued.\u201d 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 5502(a). A cause of action accrues \u201cwhen the injury is inflicted.\u201d <em>Fine v. Checcio, </em>582 Pa. 253, 870 A.2d 850, 857 (2005). Danysh\u2019s causes of action therefore accrued in 1996, when he was allegedly injured by the defendant\u2019s failure to warn him of Prozac\u2019s possible side effects. <em>See generally id.; see also William A. Graham Co. v. Haughey, </em>646 F.3d 138, 150 (3d Cir.2011) (\u201cthe \u2018accrual\u2019 of a cause of action occurs at the moment at which each of its component elements has come into being as a matter of objective reality\u201d). Therefore, the statute of limitations presumptively began to run in 1996 and expired long before Danysh filed his August 2010 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Danysh argues that the statute of limitations should be tolled pursuant to the discovery rule or the doctrine of fraudulent concealment. We agree with the District Court that these doctrines do not help Danysh here.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Under the discovery rule, the statute of limitations \u201cdoes not begin to run until the injured party discovers or reasonably should discover that he has been injured and that his injury has been caused by another party\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Fine, </em>870 A.2d at 859. More specifically, the limitations period commences upon the plaintiffs \u201cactual or constructive knowledge of at least some form of significant harm and of a factual cause linked to another\u2019s conduct, without the necessity of notice of the full extent of the injury, the fact of actual negligence, or precise cause.\u201d <em>Gleason v. Borough of Moosic, </em>15 A.3d 479, 484 (Pa.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Here, the undisputed evidence shows that Danysh knew of his injury and Lilly\u2019s alleged role in July 2004, when he provided a wealth of evidence to the PCRA court in support of his claim that Prozac had caused him to behave violently and that Lilly had fraudulently withheld its knowledge of the drug\u2019s side effects. While Danysh contends that the discovery rule should toll the limitations period until August 2008 when he discovered that he was a \u201cpoor metabolizer of Prozac\u201d or sometime in 2009 when he learned of the defendants\u2019 internal documents, he had unquestionably \u201cdiscover[ed] ... that he ha[d] been injured and that his injury ha[d] been caused by another party\u2019s conduct\u201d well before those dates. <em>Fine, </em>870 A.2d at 859; <em>see generally Zeleznik v. United States, </em>770 F.2d 20, 23 (3d Cir.1985) (explaining that the limitations period is \u201cnot postponed until the injured party knows every fact necessary to bring his action\u201d). Therefore, the District Court correctly rejected Danysh\u2019s discovery-rule argument as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Likewise, we agree with the District Court that the doctrine of fraudulent concealment does not render Danysh\u2019s claim timely. Under this doctrine, \u201cthe defendant may not invoke the statute of limitations, if through fraud or concealment, he causes the plaintiff to relax his vigilance or deviate from his right of inquiry into the facts.\u201d <em>Fine, </em>870 A.2d at 860. However, even if a limitation period is tolled by virtue of fraudulent concealment, it will begin \u201cto run when the injured party knows or reasonably should know of his injury and its cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 861. As discussed above, reasonable minds would not differ in finding that Danysh knew of his injury and its alleged cause, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>latest, in July 2004, more than six years before he instituted this action. Hence, his claims are time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to the defendant. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
