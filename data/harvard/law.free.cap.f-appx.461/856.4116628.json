He eventually conceded that he was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) but filed a motion requesting that the district court construe his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition. The district court denied that motion, and Glover appeals, arguing that his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion \u201cmade it clear that [he] was challenging the fact that he was guilty of being a career offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">A jury found Glover guilty of three counts of dealing crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846. Based on Glover\u2019s 1984 Florida conviction for aggravated battery and his 1992 Florida conviction for selling crack cocaine, the presen-tence investigation report determined that he was a career offender under the sentencing guidelines. As such, and because he was subject to a maximum life sentence for each of his current convictions, the PSR recommended a total offense level of 37. Combined with Glover\u2019s criminal history category of VI, his applicable guidelines range was 360 months to life. Glover did not object to his career offender status, and the district court sentenced him to 360 months imprisonment on each count, with all to run concurrently. We affirmed Glover\u2019s conviction on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Glover, </em>150 F.3d 1197 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">Over the course of the next six years, Glover filed three 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. He did not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that he was a career offender under the guidelines in any of those motions, and the court dismissed each one.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">In February 2010, Glover filed a <em>pro se </em>motion requesting a reduction of his prison sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on retroactive guidelines amendments concerning crack cocaine. He attached the following handwritten note to his motion: \u201cI am request for a attorney because my 198[4] aggravated battery is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>not crimes of violence.\u201d After the court appointed counsel, Glover conceded that he was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his guidelines range was based on his status as a career offender and not on the amount of drugs distributed in his drug deals. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Glover then filed a motion requesting that the district court construe his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition so that he could challenge the district court\u2019s finding that he was a career offender under the guidelines. The career offender enhancement requires that \u201cthe defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) (Nov. 1996). He argued that he was not a career offender because his 1984 Florida conviction for aggravated battery was not a crime of violence. The court denied his motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279,1280 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cTypically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal sentence must be brought under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005) (per cu-riam). \u201cWhen a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion ..., he must apply for and receive permission from us before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945; <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). But \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). \u201c[Consequently, a petitioner who has filed and been denied a previous \u00a7 2255 motion may not circumvent the successive motion restrictions simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241.\u201d <em>Darby, </em>405 F.3d at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">The district court did not err in refusing to construe the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as a \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition because Glover was not entitled to file such a petition. As he concedes, our decision in <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc), forecloses his claim. In <em>Gilbert, </em>we held that \u00a7 2255(e) does not permit a \u201cfederal prisoner to challenge his sentence in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 [habeas corpus] petition when he cannot raise that challenge in a \u00a7 2255 motion because of the \u00a7 2255(h) bar against second and successive motions.\u201d Glover could not challenge his sentence based on his career offender status in a \u00a7 2255 motion because we have not granted him permission to file what would be his fourth \u00a7 2255 motion. He thus cannot raise that same challenge in a \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Glover also argues that the district court erred because it denied his motion for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether his aggravated battery conviction was a crime of violence. Because Glover was not entitled to file a \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition challenging his sentence, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
