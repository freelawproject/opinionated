Avila Lopez argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court did not properly balance the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors to give the proper weight to such factors as the remoteness of his prior voluntary manslaughter conviction, his prior addiction to drugs and alcohol, and his efforts to rehabilitate his life. The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance or, in the alternative, an extension of time to file a brief, which Avila Lopez opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-17\">After determining that a sentence is proeedurally reasonable, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Like within-guidelines sentences,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> below-guidelines sentences are presumed to be reasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-18\">Avila Lopez has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness attached to his below-guidelines sentence. He has not demonstrated that his sentence fails to take into account a factor that should receive significant weight, gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>or represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Contrary to Avila Lopez\u2019s assertions, the district court did account for his alcohol and drug addiction, the age of his prior conviction, and his \u201cextraordinary rehabilitation.\u201d In particular, before imposing a below-guidelines sentence, the district court expressly noted that it had considered all of Avila Lopez\u2019s reasons for requesting a downward variance. In the written Statement of Reasons, the district court explained that is was varying below the guidelines based on the nature of the offense and Avila Lopez\u2019s history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Avila Lopez eonelusionally asserts that the district court erred in balancing the sentencing factors, and his general argument that the district court should have sentenced him even further below the guidelines range merely reflects his disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The issue of the reasonableness of Avila Lopez\u2019s sentence is not foreclosed by circuit precedent. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is denied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, because Avila Lopez has not presented any evidence to rebut the presumption of reasonableness attached to his below-guidelines sentence,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> further briefing in this case is not neees-sary. We therefore deny as unnecessary the Government\u2019s alternative request for an extension of time to file a brief, and we</p>\n<p id=\"A-0\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
