The district court concluded that Vahey failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination because he failed to establish that he was replaced by or disciplined more harshly than a younger person. In the alternative, the district court also concluded that Lifeline provided a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Va-hey and that Vahey failed to show that Lifeline\u2019s reason was pretext for age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">To prevail on a disparate treatment claim under the ADEA, a plaintiff must prove that age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause for ttle challenged adverse employment action. <em>Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 </em>U.S. 167, 129 S.Ct. 2343, 2351, 174 L.Ed.2d 119 (2009). We have traditionally applied the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), to ADEA cases where a plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence to prove age discrimination. <em>See Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en banc). </em>Because the Supreme Court did not overrule this precedent in <em>Gross, </em>we review Vahey\u2019s claims under both <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and <em>Gross. See Gandara v. Bennett, </em>528 F.3d 823, 829 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that \u201cwe are bound by the holdings of earlier panels unless and until they are clearly overruled <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">Under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>the plaintiff first must establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination by showing that he \u201c(1) was a member of the protected age group, (2) was subjected to adverse employment action, (3) was qualified to do the job, and (4) was replaced by ... a younger individual.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1024. Once a plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden shifts to the employer to \u201carticulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged employment action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>If the employer does so, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer\u2019s proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination. <em>Id. </em>\u201cProvided that the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, an employee must meet that reason head-on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1030. In addition, if the employer acted on an honestly held belief that the employee engaged in misconduct, even if it was mistaken, no discrimination exists. <em>Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., </em>939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Even if we assume \u2014 without deciding \u2014 that Vahey established a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lifeline presented a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Vahey based on his adversarial management style and poor relationships with Lifeline employees and customers. Vahey\u2019s supervisor, Jeffrey Moore, received repeated complaints from Vahey\u2019s subordinates about Vahey\u2019s condescending and aggressive managerial style. Even after discussing the issue with Vahey and instructing Vahey to be more encouraging, Moore continued to receive similar complaints. After a National Sales Meeting \u2014 held six months after Moore first advised Vahey to adjust his management style \u2014 Moore received several more complaints about Vahey\u2019s disrespectful attitude both from Vahey\u2019s subordinates and from other Lifeline employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Moore then conducted a more thorough investigation of the matter, including interviewing Vahey\u2019s subordinates and instituting a \u201c360 review.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The feedback from these investigations was consistent with the various complaints Moore had received about Vahey. Soon thereafter, Moore also received complaints about Vahey from an official at Lifeline\u2019s largest and most important customer, who indicated that he did not want to work with Vahey because of Vahey\u2019s disrespectful attitude. Based on all of these complaints, Moore and Lifeline\u2019s general manager agreed to terminate Vahey.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">Because the complaints against Va-hey would motivate a reasonable employer to terminate him, Vahey must rebut Lifeline\u2019s proffered reason head on. <em>See Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030. But Vahey failed to do so. In fact, he concedes that Moore received complaints about him from his subordinates, from other Lifeline employees, and from Lifeline\u2019s largest customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Vahey argues instead that, because these complaints lacked credibility, Moore should not have relied on them in deciding to terminate him. But Vahey cannot establish pretext by arguing with the wisdom of Lifeline\u2019s decision to terminate him based on allegedly unreliable complaints. <em>See id. </em>In addition, nothing evidences that Moore believed that the complaints lacked credibility, particularly given his interviews with Vahey\u2019s subordinates and the independently-conducted 360 review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Vahey, Moore \u2014 even if mistaken \u2014 acted on his honestly held belief that Vahey had engaged in misconduct warranting termination. Thus, Vahey failed to meet his burden to show that Lifeline\u2019s proffered reason for terminating him was pretextual. <em>See Elrod, </em>939 F.2d at 1470. For the same reasons, Vahey also failed to establish that age discrimination was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of his adverse employment action, as required under <em>Gross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-9\">. Vahey has abandoned expressly his claims against Philips Electronics North America Corporation and his sex discrimination claims under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">Vahey has also abandoned his argument that a similarly situated younger Lifeline employee was treated more favorably because Vahey raised the argument for the first time in his reply brief. <em>See Asociacion de Empleados del Area Canalera (ASEDAC) v. Panama Canal Comm'n, </em>453 F.3d 1309, 1316 n. 7 (11th Cir.2006). In addition, we will not consider Vahey\u2019s argument that he was not selected for a newly created position at Lifeline based on his age: he did not present this argument in the district court. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that we will not consider arguments on appeal that were not fairly presented below).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b898-14\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's grant of summary judgment. <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir.2007). And we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b899-6\">.The district court, relying on non-binding case law from other circuits, concluded that Vahey failed to demonstrate that he was replaced by a younger person. Contrary to the district court's statement of the law, a plaintiff may demonstrate that he was replaced when another employee assumes the plaintiff's responsibilities in addition to their own responsibilities after the plaintiff is terminated. <em>See Rollins v. TechSouth, Inc., </em>833 F.2d 1525, 1529 (11th Cir.1987). Here, evidence exists that a 36-year-old assumed Vahey's duties after Vahey was fired. Because we conclude that summary judgment was proper on other grounds, however, we need not resolve whether Vahey demonstrated that he was replaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b899-10\">. The 360 review was designed to obtain feedback, determine Vahey\u2019s impact on others, and evaluate his skill gaps. The review was conducted by an outside vendor who communicated with Vahey's subordinates, Moore, and other Lifeline employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b899-11\">. When the decision to terminate Vahey was made, Moore was 44 years old and Lifeline\u2019s general manager was 46 years old. <em>See Elrod, </em>939 F.2d at 1471 (noting that a plaintiff alleging age discrimination by decisionmak-ers over age 40 faces a \"difficult burden\" because such decisionmakers \"are more likely to be the victims of age discrimination than its perpetrators\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b900-7\">. We reject Vahey\u2019s assertion that Moore\u2019s failure to comply with Lifeline\u2019s company policies for disciplining employees and for conducting 360 reviews constituted evidence of discriminatory intent. Not only were these company policies discretionary, but Vahey fails to demonstrate a nexus between Moore\u2019s failure to adhere to the policies and Vahey's protected status. <em>See Mitchell v. USBI Co., </em>186 F.3d 1352, 1355-56 (11th Cir.1999) (\"Standing alone, deviation from a company policy does not demonstrate discriminatory animus.\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
