California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Diaz has filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Diaz\u2019s response. To the extent that Diaz challenges the conduct of counsel at sentencing, the record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of his claim; such a claim generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>42.2. Diaz\u2019s request for appointment of new counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47., 5 the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
