The revocation petition filed by Rainner\u2019s probation officer, Steven Aaster-ud, alleged five violations of the conditions of his release. Violation One alleged that Rainner had conspired with Othel Turner to violate the law by fraudulently obtaining approximately $127,000 from Lois Rhodes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349. Violation Two alleged that Rainner had violated the law by having knowingly and fraudulently obtained Rhodes\u2019s property in the form of two personal checks totaling $2,000, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.014(1). Violation Three alleged that Rainner had violated the law by driving with a suspended license, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 322.34(2)(c). Violation Four alleged that Rainner violated a condition of his release by failing to report to the probation officer the $2,000 in income he obtained as a result of Violation Two. Violation Five alleged that Rainner violated the condition of his release that required him to be truthful to his probation officer, by presenting Aasterud with copies of money orders Rainner claimed he was using to make restitution payments but, instead, was altering those money orders and using them for personal gain. On appeal, Rain-ner alleges that the district court abused its discretion in revoking his supervised release and in varying upward from the suggested guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">\n<em>A. Revocation of Supervised Release</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ahd\">Rainner argues that the district court abused its discretion in revoking his supervised release based on Violations Two and Four, as the $2,000 in checks that Rainner may have cashed were for services Rhodes actually received, and no evidence showed that Rainner kept the money.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With regard to Violation Three, Rainner asserts that there was insufficient evidence to show that his license was suspended on the date of his arrest. Finally, Rainner maintains that Violation Five, to which he admitted, is not a violation of state or federal law and therefore not a basis for revoking his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">We review the district court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant violated the terms of his supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>607 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 482, 178 L.Ed.2d 305 (2010). A district court\u2019s findings of fact made at a revocation proceeding are binding unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">A district court may revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of his supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); <em>see also United States v. Trainor, </em>376 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that the preponderance of the evidence standard requires only that the trier of fact believe that \u201cthe existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>tence\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the court finds that the defendant committed a violation categorized by the Sentencing Guidelines as a Grade B, the court shall revoke the defendant\u2019s supervised release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(l). If the court finds the defendant committed a Grade C violation, the court may revoke the supervised release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(2). A Grade B violation is found where there is conduct constituting a federal or state offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2). A Grade C violation exists for conduct constituting either: (1) a federal or state offense punishable by a year or less in prison; or (2) a violation of any other condition of supervision. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(3). Theft of property valued at more than $300 but less than $5,000 is a third-degree felony under Florida law and punishable by a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 812.014(2)(c)l. 775.082(3)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding a basis to revoke Rainner\u2019s supervised release. Violation Two, which alleged a theft of property exceeding $300 but less than $5,000, constituted a state offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year and, as such, represents a Grade B violation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(2), Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 812.014(2)(e)l., 775.082(3)(d). Because Violation Two was a Grade B violation, if the court properly found that Rainner committed Violation Two, then such a finding required the revocation of his supervised release. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(l). The court\u2019s finding was supported in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The evidence presented at the revocation hearing established that the $2,000 in checks had been cashed in Rainner\u2019s name, using his identification. Rhodes left the \u201cpay to the order of\u2019 line on both checks blank, believing that the funds would be used for legal work and not to pay Rainner personally. Although Probation Officer Aasterud was not able to provide evidence that Rainner had kept the funds, Rainner failed to produce evidence to support his claim that the funds had gone to pay for legal work for Rhodes. Therefore, the district court\u2019s finding that Rainner committed Violation Two was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Almand, </em>992 F.2d at 318; <em>Trainor, </em>376 F.3d at 1331. Although a finding that Violation Two had been committed was sufficient to trigger the court\u2019s obligation to revoke Rainner\u2019s release, it is worth noting that, assuming Rainner committed Violation Two, he necessarily committed Violation Four as well, as undisputed evidence showed that Rain-ner had not reported the $2,000 as income to his probation officer. Alternatively, the court was permitted to exercise its discretion to revoke Rainner\u2019s supervised release based on his admission to Violation Five, failing to be truthful when answering the probation officer\u2019s inquiries. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">\n<em>II. Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Rainner argues that the district court\u2019s belief that he defrauded Rhodes out of the $127,000, despite its findings that a conspiracy had not been proven, was the principle reason for the upward variance imposed by the court. Rainner contends that the court\u2019s stated reasons for the variance \u2014 the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense and ensure just punishment \u2014 reflected, at least in part, its belief that Rainner was guilty of Violation One. Rainner reiterates his argument that Violation One was not proven and, thus, maintains that the court erred by imposing an upward variance based in part on an unproven offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">\u201cWe review the sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). This review is akin to that conducted under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1188-89 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we conduct a two-step inquiry. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we must ensure that the sentence was proeedurally reasonable, meaning the district court (1) properly calculated the guidelines range, (2) treated the guidelines as advisory, (3) considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, (4) did not rely on clearly erroneous facts, and (5) adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>Once we determine that a sentence is proeedurally sound, we must examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">The justification for a variance from the guidelines range \u201cmust be sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1186-87 (internal quotation marks omitted). We may not presume that a sentence outside the guidelines is unreasonable and \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1187 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">\u201cChapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines governs violations of [supervised release] and contains policy statements, one of which provides recommended ranges of imprisonment applicable upon revocation.\u201d <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4). The policy statements of Chapter 7 are merely advisory and not binding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not abuse its discretion in varying upward from the suggested guidelines sentence. Despite the contentions of the parties, a review of the sentencing transcript does not reveal any reason to believe that the court relied on the unproven conspiracy in Violation One as a basis for its sentencing decision, as the court nowhere references the circumstances of that violation in rendering its sentencing decision. The court\u2019s sentence was proeedurally sound as it is clear that the court properly calculated the advisory guidelines range, considered the proper evidence and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and explained its sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The court\u2019s sentence was also substantively reasonable. The court particularly emphasized at sentencing its hope that the above-guidelines sentence would serve to promote in Rain-ner a greater respect for the law and for the seriousness of what he had done. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). Given the relatedness of Violations Two, Four, and Five to Rainner\u2019s original fraud conviction, for which the instant term of supervised release was imposed, the court\u2019s finding\u2014 that Rainner\u2019s continued conduct evinced a lack of respect for the law and an insufficient appreciation for the seriousness of his offenses \u2014 was reasonable. In this case, the 22-month sentence represented a variance from the guidelines range of 4 to 10 months. However, the degree of the variance, while significant, was justified by the conduct necessitating revocation. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1186-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s revocation of Rain-ner\u2019s supervised release and the sentence it imposed pursuant to that revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-6\">. Rainner also contends that, in discussing its decision to revoke his release, the court\u2019s statement that it did not doubt that Rainner defrauded Rhodes out of approximately $127,000, was erroneous and not a reasonable inference from the evidence. However, it is clear from the context that Rainner only argues that the court\u2019s belief in this regard affected its sentencing decision, which is discussed <em>infra, </em>not its revocation decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
