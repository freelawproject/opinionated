Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Franklin sued Parnell and Parnell &amp; Crum in Alabama state court alleging fraud and common law negligence for noncompliance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g. The court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, but Franklin was not deterred. She then sued the defendants in federal district court for violating the FDCPA. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, finding that Alabama res judicata principles barred Franklin\u2019s claims because the Alabama state court had dismissed the earlier lawsuit by Franklin against the defendants on the same cause of action. Franklin then filed this appeal, and she makes three arguments: that the magistrate judge erred by denying her motion for default judgment; that the district court erred by denying her motion for recusal of the magistrate judge; and that the district court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-19\">In Alabama state court, Franklin filed a three-count complaint against Parnell \u2014 la<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>ter amending it to add Parnell &amp; Crum. The first count alleged that the defendants committed fraud, in part because the second paragraph of their debt-collection letter informed Franklin that she had 7 days to pay the alleged debt but on the back of the letter \u201cwas the mandatory [FDCPA] 15 USC \u00a7 1692g notice which requires the debt collector to allow the debtor 30 days to dispute the alleged debt and request proof for validation of the alleged debt.\u201d The second count alleged that the defendants committed common law negligence by not responding to Franklin\u2019s request for proof of the alleged debt pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g. The third count alleged common law negligence because of insufficient service of process. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and after the presentation of testimony, consideration of evidence, and taking the matter under advisement, the court dismissed the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court\u2019s order stated that either party had 14 days to appeal the court\u2019s decision. Franklin filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court denied, and the court again stated that the parties had 14 days to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Franklin did not appeal but instead filed this action against the defendants. In count one of her federal complaint, she alleged that the defendants violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g by not responding to her request for validation of the debt. In count two, she alleged that the 7-day/30-day discrepancy violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10)\u2019s prohibition on using \u201cany false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The summons and complaint were served on the defendants at the Parnell &amp; Crum office on July 8, 2010. Parnell filed a notice of appearance on the defendants\u2019 behalf on July 30, 2010, but on July 31, 2010, Franklin filed a motion for default judgment, arguing that the defendants\u2019 21-day response period had expired on July 29, 2010. On August 3, 2010, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss in which they argued that Franklin\u2019s claims were barred by res judicata because of the earlier dismissal of Franklin\u2019s state court case.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">The magistrate judge denied Franklin\u2019s motion for default judgment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and construed the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment because it relied on the earlier state court case. Franklin then filed her own motion for summary judgment and a motion for recusal of the magistrate judge. The magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation was that the earlier state court judgment was final and on the merits, all the other elements of res judicata were met, and Franklin\u2019s claims were barred. The district court denied Franklin\u2019s motion for recusal, adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, denied Franklin\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Franklin argues that the magistrate judge erred by denying her motion for default judgment. We review for abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>discretion a magistrate judge\u2019s denial of a motion for default judgment. <em>Mitchell v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>294 F.3d 1309, 1316 (11th Cir.2002). A \u201cdefault is to be used sparingly\u201d because it \u201cis a drastic remedy which should be used only in extreme situations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1316\u2014 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">This was not an extreme situation. The magistrate judge denied Franklin\u2019s motion for default judgment because \u201cthe defendants\u2019 delay was slight, only four days\u201d; Franklin had suffered only slight prejudice, if any; there was no evidence of bad faith by the defendants; and the defendants appeared to have a meritorious res judicata defense. The magistrate judge\u2019s decision to deny Franklin\u2019s motion for default judgment was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Franklin also argues that the district court erred by denying her motion for recusal of the magistrate judge. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for recusal. <em>Draper v. Reynolds, </em>369 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2004). A federal judge must re-cuse herself \u201cin any proceeding in which h[er] impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d or when she \u201chas a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 455(a), (b). \u201c[T]he standard is whether an objective, fully informed lay observer would entertain significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Chisto v. Padgett, </em>223 F.3d 1324, 1333 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Franklin\u2019s motion for recusal of the magistrate judge alleged that the following 8 actions by the magistrate judge proved that he was biased against her: (1) the magistrate judge \u201cwantonly denied\u201d Franklin\u2019s attempt to proceed in forma pauperis; (2) the magistrate judge accepted the defendants\u2019 \u201cuntimely answer\u201d; (3) the magistrate judge did not provide Franklin with a copy of the court\u2019s order to the defendants to show cause; (4) the magistrate judge accepted the defendants\u2019 \u201canemic and inartfully drafted motion to dismiss comprised <em>only </em>of conclusory statements and conjecture\u201d; (5) the magistrate judge \u201cbash[ed]\u201d Franklin\u2019s \u201clegally substantiated[ ] and cited brief[ ] as \u2018hyperbole and rhetoric\u2019 \u201d; (6) the magistrate judge construed the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment and gave Franklin only 10 days to respond; (7) the magistrate judge harassed Franklin with \u201crepeated orders\u201d; and (8) the magistrate judge accepted the defendants\u2019 violation of two orders and a second untimely filing. None of these actions would lead an objective, fully informed lay observer to entertain significant doubt about the magistrate judge\u2019s impartiality. The district court\u2019s denial of Franklin\u2019s motion for recusal was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Finally Franklin contends that the district court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. We review <em>de novo </em>the grant of summary judgment and draw \u201call inferences and review[ ] all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Moton v. Cowart, </em>631 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate only if \u2018the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a)). We also review <em>de novo </em>whether a party\u2019s claims are barred by res judicata, and \u201cwhen we are asked to give <em>res judicata </em>effect to a state court judgment, [we] must apply the <em>res judica-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number><em>ta </em>principles of the law of the state whose decision is set up as a bar to further litigation.\u201d <em>Kizzire v. Baptist Health Sys., Inc., </em>441 F.3d 1306, 1308 (11th Cir.2006) (alteration in original) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Because the defendants contend that an Alabama state court judgment bars Franklin\u2019s federal claims, we apply Alabama res judicata principles. <em>See id. </em>Under Alabama law the elements of res judicata are \u201c(1) a prior judgment on the merits, (2) rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, (3) with substantial identity of the parties, and (4) with the same cause of action presented in both actions.\u201d <em>Chapman Nursing Home, Inc. v. McDonald, </em>985 So.2d 914, 919 (Ala.2007) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cIf those four elements are present, then any claim that was, or that could have been, adjudicated in the prior action is barred from further litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The record shows that those elements are satisfied; therefore, Franklin\u2019s federal lawsuit is barred. First, the Alabama state court\u2019s dismissal of Franklin\u2019s case was a prior judgment on the merits. In its order dismissing the case, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-7\">After presentation of testimony, consideration of the evidence and the Court having taken this matter under advisement, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that the Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. Case dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">The court did not specify whether or not its order was on the merits, but Alabama law establishes that it was. <em>See </em>Ala. R. Civ. P. 41(b) (\u201cUnless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for failure to join a party ..., operates as an adjudication upon the merits.\u201d); <em>Smith v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>884 So.2d 861, 864-65 (Ala.Civ.App.2003) (\u201cThe trial court\u2019s order dismissing Smith\u2019s claims does not specify whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice; therefore, the dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits. The trial court\u2019s judgment, therefore, forever bars Smith from prosecuting her claims against Tyson Foods.\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). Also the court order stated that each party had 14 days to file an appeal, which is further evidence that the dismissal was on the merits because a judgment that was not on the merits would have allowed Franklin to refile her suit instead of appealing. <em>See Smith v. Union Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>653 So.2d 933, 935 (Ala.1995) (holding that a dismissal not on the merits allows a plaintiff to file a new complaint); <em>cf. </em>Ala.Code. \u00a7 12-12-70(a) (\u201cAny party may appeal from a final judgment of the district court in a civil case by filing notice of appeal in the district court, within 14 days from the date of the judg-ment_\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">The other res judicata elements are satisfied as well. The Alabama state court that entered the judgment was a state district court, and state district courts have jurisdiction in \u201call civil actions in which the matter in controversy does not exceed ten thousand dollars.\u201d Ala. Code \u00a7 12-12-30. Franklin\u2019s state court suit claimed $10,000 in damages; therefore, the state district court was a court of competent jurisdiction. Further the plaintiff and the defendants in both suits were identical, and both suits presented the same cause of action based on the same alleged noncompliance with 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g. <em>See Chapman, </em>985 So.2d at 921 (\u201c[T]he principle test for comparing causes of action [for the application of <em>res judicata </em>] is whether the <em>primary right and duty </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number><em>or vrrong </em>are the same in each action.\u201d (alteration in original) (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">For these reasons, the defendants established that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Franklin\u2019s claims are barred by Alabama\u2019s res judicata principles. The district court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">For the foregoing reasons we affirm the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of Franklin\u2019s motion for default judgment, the district court\u2019s denial of Franklin\u2019s motion for re-cusal, and the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-6\">. Because the court heard testimony and considered evidence, it may have construed the defendants' motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Alabama Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b). <em>Cf. Lloyd Noland Foundation, Inc. v. HealthSouth Corp., </em>979 So.2d 784, 792 (Ala.2007) (\u201cThe substance of a motion, not what a party calls it, determines the nature of the motion.\u201d). The record does not indicate whether that was the case here, but it does not matter to the result anyway.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b849-13\">. The magistrate judge had authority to deny Franklin's motion for default judgment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b852-18\">. Franklin argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment for the defendants, in part, because the court did not hold a hearing before rendering its decision, but \"[i]t is well settled in this circuit that Rule 56(c) does not require an oral hearing.\u201d <em>Smith v. Sch. Bd. of Orange Cnty., </em>487 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
