This court takes \u201ca strict approach\u201d to the exhaustion requirement, <em>see Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 866 (5th Cir.2003) (overruled by implication on other grounds by <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 216, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007)), and reviews the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo. <em>Carbe v. Lappin, </em>492 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-18\">Wood contends that it was error for the court to raise exhaustion sua sponte, urging that \u00a7 1997e does not require a plaintiff to prove exhaustion and that exhaustion is an affirmative defense properly raised only by a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. He concedes that he did not completely exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing his lawsuit but asserts that he did so after filing, urging that he should have then been permitted to amend his complaint to show exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-19\">Although Wood is correct that failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense and that he was not required to prove the same, <em>see Jones, </em>549 U.S. at 216, 127 S.Ct. 910, because it was clear from the face of his complaint that he had not fully exhausted his administrative remedies prior to filing the instant lawsuit, the district court properly dismissed it. <em>See Carbe, </em>492 F.3d at 328; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e. Wood\u2019s argument that the district court erred in refusing to stay proceedings to enable him to exhaust rather than dismiss his complaint is without merit. <em>See Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 523-32, esp. at 523-24, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002); \u00a7 1997e. That he exhausted his administrative remedies subsequent to filing the instant suit is insufficient. <em>See Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 296 (5th Cir.1998) (overruled by implication on other grounds by <em>Jones, </em>549 U.S. at 215, 127 S.Ct. 910).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-20\">Moreover, Wood presents no valid defense to the exhaustion requirement. His argument that emergency circumstances should have excused him from exhaustion is merely a restatement of his claim that he is being retaliated against and does not comprise one of the \u201crare instances\u201d in which exhaustion may be excused. <em>See Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 102, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Wood has failed to demonstrate any error in the district court\u2019s dismissal. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AIj\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
