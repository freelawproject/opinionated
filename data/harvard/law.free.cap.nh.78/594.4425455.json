The question, therefore, and the only question raised by his exception is whether there is any evidence tending to prove, either that he did not buy these boards, or, that he knew of the sale to the plaintiffs. While it seems to be conceded that he bought a car of boards from the same vendor in March, 1913, the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence tended to prove that the boards he bought were not the ones that were replevied. Since this is so, the jury was warranted in finding that these boards did not belong to Eaton. In other words, the jury was warranted in finding that, even if the plaintiffs\u2019 title was defective as to subsequent purchasers for value, it was good as against Eaton; or that if there was a defect in the plaintiffs\u2019 title he was not in a position to take advantage of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b625-7\">All cohcurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
