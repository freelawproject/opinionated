Collins.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b578-10\">A verdict for work done upon the defendant\u2019s house by the plaintiff was sustained upon evidence that the defendant ordered him to do the work, though the plaintiff understood he was to be paid therefor by the defendant\u2019s husband.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-11\">Assumpsit, for work done and materials furnished. Judgment for the plaintiff on the report of an auditor. The auditor found that the defendant\u2019s husband asked the plaintiff to make a price for painting a house, telling him that it belonged to his wife, that the work was nothing to him and that any agreement she made would be satisfactory to him. The plaintiff told him he would like to do the work but that it was too large a job for him to figure. The plaintiff saw the defendant the next day and told her the same thing and she told him to do the work. He understood, however, that he was to be paid by her husband. Transferred by <em>Allen, </em>J., from the May term, 1917, of the superior court, on the defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of her motion for judgment on the report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b578-12\"><em>Wason &amp; Moran </em>and <em>Martin &amp; Howe (Mr. Howe </em>orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b578-13\"><em>Doyle &amp; Lucier </em>and <em>Bernard W.

It does not necessarily follow from the finding that the plaintiff understood he was to be paid by the defendant\u2019s husband that he cannot maintain this action. If the minds of the parties did not meet on this point, that is, if the plaintiff understood he was to be paid for the work by the defendant\u2019s husband while she understood he was to be paid by her, he can recover and that is the effect of the general finding. In other words, the finding that the plaintiff understood he was to be paid by the defendant\u2019s husband is not inconsistent with a finding that the work was done for her and that her husband was merely acting as her agent in what he did in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b579-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
