Facts agreed as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-8\">On January 20, 1915, the defendant accepted from the plaintiff at Exeter, N. H., for transportation, property worth $65, and agreed to deliver it in an undamaged condition to W. G. Hill, of Marquette, Michigan, issuing to the plaintiff a receipt or bill of lading therefor. The property was damaged in transit. July 28, 1915, the plaintiff received notice from the Duluth, South Shore &amp; Atlantic Railway, saying, \u201cthe desk is still held in our warehouse refused by the consignee.\u201d Delivery was never made to the consignee, and at the time the action was begun Mr. Higgins was the rightful holder of the bill of lading. On August 10,1915, the plaintiff made demand, upon the defendant, in writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-9\">The defendant claimed that because of the failure of the plaintiff to make demand within four months after the time when delivery should have been made, the action cannot be maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-10\">Transferred, without a ruling, from the January term, 1917, of the superior court by <em>Sawyer, </em>J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b639-11\"><em>Sleeper &amp; Brown, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b639-12\"><em>Albert R.

The question is a federal one, and the provision in the uniform bill of lading, requiring notice of claims within four months, has been upheld by the court of last resort. <em>Georgia, &amp;c., R. R.
