Trial by jury and\u201d verdict for the defendants. The defendants are the owners of a tenement house., having one tenement on the ground floor and one on the second floor, each having a . separate entrance. Each tenement had also a finished room in the attic, but it was not shown whether they were reached by a common stairway or by separate passages. William Petroski was a tenant in the upstairs tenement. The injuries complained of were caused by the falling of the plaster over the bed where Melvina;, a child of William, seven days old, lay with her mother. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that the plaster was loosened by rain coming through a leaky -roof. The exceptions of the plaintiff which were to the charge of the court, appear in the opinion.

The tenant takes the premises as he finds them, and in the absence of a warranty, or of deceit or fraud on the part of the landlord, the tenant takes the risk of the quality of the premises. <em>Towne </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>68 N.

The plaintiff excepted because the court did not send to the jury the question of the control of the roof, and instruct them that, if they found the roof was under the control of the defendants, the plaintiff could recover. It not appearing that the roof was under the control of the defendants, the court was justified in refusing to submit that question to the jury or give instructions in relation thereto. In his charge to the jury the court said: \u201c It is suggested to me that one of the last witnesses on behalf of the plaintiff testified that the defendant, Dr. Mulvanity, stated that he would \u2018fix the premises all right.\u2019 If such is the testimony, no liability would occur in this action by reason of the failure to fix it all right, because that is a pure matter of contract, and this action is based upon the negligent performance of a legal duty imposed by law, rather than one that attaches by reason of any contract. Even if a landlord does agree to repair the premises, and fails to do so, in an action for negligently undertaking the duty, no liability attaches by reason of the agreement. \u201d To this statement the plaintiff excepted. No error was committed by the court in giving this instruction. <em>Dustin </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>74 N.
