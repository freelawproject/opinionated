Previous to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, the defendants had accepted the-provisions of the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-11\">The defendants own and operate several large mills at Berlin, in some of winch they manufacture pulp stock. In such mills th&amp; defendants employ five or more persons in manual or mechanicaL labor, and operate machinery propelled by mechanical power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-12\">The plaintiff was injured by a plank falling and striking him oru the back while engaged with five or more fellow-servants in erecting between the side tracks of the Grand Trunk Railway and Dead river, a carrier, which, when completed, is to be used to convey pulp-wood from freight cars to the river to be floated down to the defendants\u2019 mill situated some two miles below on the Androscoggin river. The carrier, being more than a-mile from any of their shops, mills or factories, will be physically separate and distinct from any shop, mill, factory or other place of the defendants where they require the services of their employees. The carrier will consist of a large Y-shaped trough, supported on wooden horses resting on foundations set in the earth. At the-bottom of the trough will be an endless chain carried around drums- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u25a0or wheels at the ends of the carrier, and having blocks attached thereto at regular intervals, which will force the pulp-wood along the trough to the end, where it will fall into the river. When in \u2022operation, the chain will be propelled by mechanical power. At the time the plaintiff was injured, he was engaged with other servants of the defendants in erecting one of the wooden horses for the support of the trough. No part of the trough or chain had been placed in position, nor had any of the apparatus been then installed for propelling the chain. The question of the applicability of the act was reserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-3\">Transferred from the April term, 1916, of the superior court, by <em>.Sawyer, </em>J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-4\"><em>O.

(Laws 1911, <em>c. </em>163.) If so, it must be under section 1, sub-division (b), of said statute, which provides that the act shall apply to \u201cwork in any shop, mill, factory or other place \u25a0on, in connection with or in proximity to any hoisting apparatus, or .any machinery propelled or operated by steam or other mechanical power in which shop, mill, factory or other place five; or more persons are engaged in manual or mechanical labor.\u201d From the case it appears that the plaintiff was not engaged in work on, in connection with or in proximity to any hoisting apparatus; neither was there .any machinery propelled or operated by steam or other mechanical power at the place where he was working. He was employed with \u25a0others in building a pulp-wood carrier, and at the time of the accident they were erecting one of the wooden horses for the support of the trough, but no part of the trough or chain that was to carry the pulp-wood, had been placed in position, nor had any of the apparatus been then installed for propelling the chain.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">If the plaintiff had been engaged in working on or about a completed carrier propelled or operated by mechanical power when the accident occurred, there would be no question as to the applicability of the statute. He would then have been working in a place, on, in connection with or in proximity to machinery propelled or oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ated by steam or other mechanical power. But as there was no apparatus or machinery installed or in operation at the time and place of the accident, it cannot be said that he was so employed. Therefore if the employment of erecting the carrier falls within the ambit of the statute, it must be held to be work in a shop, mill or factory. That is, the operation of the defendants\u2019 mills in which machinery is propelled by mechanical power must comprehend the work of erecting the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">It was held in <em>Boody </em>v. <em>Company, </em>77 N. H. 208, 210, that work in a mill included not only the mill buildings in which the business is conducted, but also everything appurtenant to them, such as the dam, flume, yards, and the ways provided for the use of employees, \u2014the entire manufacturing plant. But under this construction of the statute labor performed in erecting a pulp-carrier for the defendants more than a mile from their mills would not constitute work in the defendants\u2019 mills. The place where the pulp-carrier was being erected was in no way appurtenant to the defendants\u2019 mills, and in no sense a part of their manufacturing plant. To hold that building a pulp-carrier for the defendants more than a mile from their mills is working in the mills within the meaning of the statute, would lead to results never contemplated by the legislature. Under such an interpretation of the statute those engaged for the defendants in felling trees, and hauling them from the forest many miles from their mills, could be said to be working in their mills. Indeed it is difficult to imagine any manual or mechanical labor that employees of a manufacturing concern could do that might not be construed as work in a shop, mill or factory.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The English workmen\u2019s compensation act of 1897 (60 &amp; 61 Viet, c. 37) contained the following clause: \u201cThis act shall apply only to employment by the undertakers as herein-after defined, on or in or about a railway, factory, mine, quarry, or engineering work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">This provision is somewhat similar to that portion of our statute that is under discussion, although it is more comprehensive and elastic than-our law in that the word \u201cabout\u201d is used. The English courts in construing the above clause have held that employment at places separate and at some distance from factories, mines, quarries or engineering works was not work on or in or about them, but that the employment must be at a place contiguous or in close proximity to them, to bring it within the purview of the statute. <em>Fenn </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>[1900] 1 Q. B. 788; <em>Lowth </em>v. <em>Ibbotson, </em>[1899] 1 Q. B. 1003; <em>Turnbull </em>v. <em>Lambton Collieries Co., </em>82 L. T.

(n. s.) 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\">The plaintiff\u2019s case is not within the purpose and spirit of the' employers\u2019 liability and workmen\u2019s compensation statute. He was-not employed at a place where there was any machinery, but was engaged in manual labor at a place wholly separate and distinct from the defendants\u2019 mills where machinery was in use, and at <em>ss </em>distance from them, and his employment was not such as to entitle-him to protection under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><em>Judgment for the </em>defendants.</p>\n<judges id=\"b349-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
