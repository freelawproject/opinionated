Freeman\u2019s estate, Andrew being the son of Mrs. Freeman. \u25a0 The question presented arises under the 'fourth clause of the will which is as follows: \u201cFourth. All the rest and remainder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>of my estate, whether real or personal, that I may be possessed of at my decease, I give, bequeath and devise to George W. Clyde, of said Hudson, in trust, for the following purposes. So much of the interest or income, or if necessary, a part of the principal, to be used by said trustee for the support of my said son, Andrew N. Freeman. Meaning that said trustee shall invest such funds as may come into his hands as a part of my estate, and at his discretion may use the same for the comfortable support of my said son, Andrew, for board, clothing, medical attendance or medicine, or any other thing that may be necessary or proper for his welfare or comfortable support. But said trustee shall not pay to said Andrew any of the money of my estate or shall furnish him any intoxicants except for medicinal purposes, when ordered by a respectable physician.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-5\">Mrs. Freeman died April 21, 1904, and Andrew, October 31,1915. The administrator of her estate, upon the settlement of his account, turned over to the trustee the balance in his hands, which the trustee used for the support of Andrew until his death. Upon the settlement of the trust it appeared that the unexpended balance amounted to $3,441.65. This sum is now claimed by each of the defendants. Transferred without a ruling from the May term, 1916, of the superior court, by <em>Branch, </em>J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-6\">\n<em>George W.

This was her controlling purpose in creating a trust fund and authorizing the trustee to use the same for the comfortable support of her son. She omitted to use language indicative of a purpose to specifically limit his interest in the trust to such part as the trustee might in his discretion appropriate to his support and to dispose of the unexpended balance remaining upon the son\u2019s death to other beneficiaries. It is not probable that she intended to leave what was not required for his support undisposed of by her will, or to die intestate in regard to it. She understood that she was disposing of \u201call the rest and remainder of my estate,\u201d and not that she was leaving a considerable portion of it undisposed of. In the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>of any clear evidence tending to show a purpose of intestacy the presumption is that she intended that all of her estate should pass by her will. <em>Kennard </em>v. <em>Kennard, </em>63 N. H. 303, 311. It follows that that portion of her estate covered by the residuary clause vested upon her decease in her son, whom she desired to provide for, subject to its discretionary control by the trustee during the son\u2019s life, and after his decease the remainder became a part of his estate. The mere fact that a trustee was appointed to manage the estate for the son\u2019s benefit did not deprive him of his interest in it or terminate the .same upon his death, for the reason that the testatrix has left no sufficient evidence of such a purpose. The result is the same as it would be if she had given.the property directly to her son, subject to the condition that during his life-time it should be managed for his benefit by a trustee or a testamentary guardian appointed in the will. The fact that the legal title is held by the trustee is not of controling importance upon the question of the intention of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Banfield, </em>55 N. H. 149, a testator gave to a trustee a sum of money in trust for the testator\u2019s wife \u201cto keep, use, and dispose of for the benefit of my said wife according to the best of his discretion as her trustee,\u201d and it was held that the gift was an absolute one to her, <em>Smith, </em>J. remarking: \u201cIt is not a devise of the income or of some definite part for her benefit with remainder over to some third person; but the trustee can dispose of the whole principal sum, if that be necessary, for her benefit, during her life. Whatever sum may be left at her decease goes to her heirs, and not to the residuary legatee named in the will.\u201d See also <em>Rollins </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>70 N. H. 436; <em>McAllister </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>76 N. H. 108, 113; <em>Sparhawk </em>v. <em>Cloon, </em>125 Mass. 263. Cases like <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>Fernald, </em>92 Me. 282, and <em>Minot </em>v. <em>Tappan, </em>127 Mass. 333, relied upon by the administrator of Mrs. Fernald\u2019s estate, are clearly distinguishable from the case at bar. In those cases there was a disposition of the remainder of the estate after the death of the <em>cestui que trust. \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The trustee is advised that the balance of the trust fund in his hands is payable to the administrator of the estate of Andrew N.
