The fault with which the declaration charges the defendant is its failure to do what the average man would have done, if he had undertaken to procure the assent of the commission to the allowance of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim \u2014\u2022 not its failure to perform a duty imposed on it by the federal statute, entitled <em>\u201c </em>An act to Regulate Commerce.\u201d In other words, the plaintiffsj^lege^hat they have been damaged by the defendant\u2019s failure to perform a duty imposed pn'it by the common law,\u2014 not a foderalstatute. Since this is so, there is no merit In the defendant\u2019s contention that the courts of this state have no jurisdiction of the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">This also disposes of the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiffs cannot recover because the agreement they allege it made is one that it could not legally make and that it had no consideration to support it, for, as has already appeared, their declaration sounds in tort. In other words,\u00bb they are not seeking to enforce the agreement they allege the defendant made, but to recover the damages they sustained because of its fraudulent or negligent failure to do what the average man would have done, if he had undertaken to procure the assent of the commission to the allowance of their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In short, the office of the allegation that the defendant agreed to procure the assent of the commission is not to set forth the foundation on which the plaintiffs rest their cause of action, but to show how they came to rely on it to procure the assent of the commission to the allowance of their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The question, therefore, and the only question of law raised by the defendant\u2019s exception, is whether the common law imposes the duty of using average care on those who undertake to perform a service for others., The common law imposes that duty on every member of the community for the benefit of all those with whom he comes in contact regardless of whether he is, or is not to be compensated for his services. <em>Coggs </em>v. <em>Bernard, 2 </em>Ld. Raym. 909; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>69 N. H. 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>It follows that, if the defendant accepted the papers evidencing the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for the purpose of forwarding them to the commission, it then and there became its duty to do what the average man would do in that situation. <em>Pittsfield &amp;c. Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Company, </em>71 N. H. 522, 533. In other words, notwithstanding the defendant owed the plaintiffs no duty in respect to procuring the assent of the commission to the allowance of their claim, still, when it undertook to perform that service for them, the law then and at tha't instant imposed on it the duty of doing what the average man would do in that situation; and it is no answer to an action to recover damages caused by its failure to perform that duty, to show that it was not to be paid for what it undertook to do. <em>Coggs </em>v. <em>Bernard, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">If, therefore, the plaintiffs show that the defendant accepted the papers evidencing their claim for the purpose of forwarding them to the commission and then did or omitted to do something the average man would not have done or omitted, they can recover all the damage they sustained as the result of such failure, provided no fault of theirs contributed to produce their loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
