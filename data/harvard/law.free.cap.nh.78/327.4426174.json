Said church when erected shall be known as the 1 Camille Gagnon Church\u2019 and said officers . . . shall place therein ... a tablet of bronze which shall commemorate the fact that I through this gift have made it possible for this church to be erected and that I have so done that the memory of myself, of my late wife . . . and of my family shall be perpetuated in said Parish . . . and it is my hope that this gift will prove a lasting benefit to the people of said parish for many generations.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-14\">The plaintiffs contend that the devise to the parish is void because, as they say, the rules of the Roman Catholic church forbid the naming of a church for any other than a saint or a member of the Trinity.

The provision that the money be used to build a church to be known by his name is merely the scheme he devised to effectuate that purpose. The property therefore was not given to the parish on condition that it build a church to be known by the testator\u2019s name, but was given to it in trust to be used for the benefit of the inhabitants. Such a bequest, \u2014 one intended to benefit the inhabitants of the world, <em>Fernald </em>v. <em>Church, </em>77 N. H. 108, or those of a particular state, <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>70 N. H. 463, or those of a particular city, <em>Keene </em>v. <em>Eastman, </em>75 N. H. 191, constitutes a public trust. Since this is so, the bequest will not fail even if the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the parish church cannot be known by the testator\u2019s name is sound; for it is the court\u2019s duty, whenever a testator\u2019s intention can be ascertained and is-legal, to effectuate it. This is as true when the scheme the testator devises for that purpose breaks down, or is for any reason illegal, as when his scheme is both legal and workable. <em>Adams Academy </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>65 N. H. 225; <em>Edgerly </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>66 N. H. 434; <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>70 N. H. 463; <em>Haywood </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>75 N. H. 92; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Page, </em>76 N. H. 96; <em>French </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>76 N. H. 234; <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Durham, </em>77 N. H. 58; <em>Fernald </em>v. <em>Church, </em>77 N. H. 108; <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>77 N. H. 400. If, therefore, the parish finds that the church cannot be known as the \u201cCamille Gagnon Church, \u201d it will be its duty to apply to the court for relief, and the court will formulate a plan for administering the trust, by which the property can be used in such a way that it will at one and the same time \u201c prove a lasting benefit to the people of said parish\u201d and perpetuate the testator\u2019s memory and that of his family for many generations.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b358-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
