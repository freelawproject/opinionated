Decree for the plaintiff. Transferred by <em>Allen, </em>J., from the January term, 1917, of the superior court on the defendant\u2019s exception to the exclusion of evidence as to the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s damages and to the court\u2019s refusal to set aside the decree because the plaintiff had an adequate legal remedy.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b544-10\"><em>Markdr G. Markarian </em>and <em>Henri A. Burque, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b544-11\"><em>Walter E. Kittredge </em>and <em>Frederick J.

In such a case relief is refused unless that would operate as a fraud on the plaintiff. <em>Muir </em>v. <em>Bartlett, ante, </em>313. But when the agreement is in writing, relief is granted as a matter of course, if the court finds that compelling the defendant to convey would be equitable. <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>72 N. H. 442; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>65 N. H. 196; <em>Ewins </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>49 N. H. 444; 36 Cyc. 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">\u2022 In this case there is such a finding, and if the evidence excluded would have shown that the plaintiff had lost but little by the defendant\u2019s refusal to convey, that fact in and of itself has no tendency to prove that it is inequitable to compel him to do as he agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b544-15\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
