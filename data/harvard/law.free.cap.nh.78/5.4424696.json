The case was heard at the January term, 1909, of the superior court by <em>Wallace, </em>C. J., who denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a nonsuit, subject to his exception, and found a verdict for the plaintiff on the question of liability. At the January term, 1915, of the superior court, the plaintiff\u2019s administrator appeared and moved for an assessment of damages; and thereupon the questions of law arising upon the defendant\u2019s exception were transferred by <em>Branch, </em>J., on an agreed statement of facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-10\">January 25, 1900, Sarah C. Prescott conveyed certain standing timber to Amidon, by a deed which provided that the growth was \u201cto be cut and removed within three years.\u201d The deed was duly recorded. Amidon did not cut the timber, and in 1908 Sarah conveyed the same to the defendant, who removed and sold it. The plaintiff seeks to recover the value of the timber, or the amount which the defendant received for it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-11\"><em>Kirk D.

H. 38, 42; <em>Hoit </em>v. <em>Stratton Mills, </em>54 N. H. 109. In short, Mrs. Prescott\u2019s deed converted all the .wood and timber standing on the lot into personal property <em>(Kingsley </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>45 N. H. 313) and. gave the plaintiff the right to leave it there until January 25, 1903. <em>Plumer </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>43 N. H. 277. The only difference, therefore, between this case and <em>Peirce </em>v. <em>Finerty, supra, </em>is that in that case the defendant claimed the timber, and in this case the defendant has converted it into money; and it was held in that case that the mere fact the plaintiff wrongfully left his property on the defendant\u2019s land for any length of time short of that prescribed by the statute of limitations would not, as matter of law, work a forfeiture of his right to it. <em>Peirce </em>v. <em>Finerty, </em>76 N. H. 38, 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b36-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
