It was ordered that the receiver \u201c deliver, under the orders heretofore made, thirty-eight cubic feet of water per second for ten hours of each working day to the gristmill wheels.\u201d The orders in force provide that when the water in the reservoir is drawn down to the four foot point the receiver shall cease drawing water until a sufficient quantity accumulates in the reservoir to run all the mills at dam C for an economical period. The defendants excepted to the court\u2019s order on the grounds (1) the plaintiff has no right to develop electric energy to sell; (2) the plaintiff\u2019s preferential right is limited to the use of the water for grist-mill purposes.
