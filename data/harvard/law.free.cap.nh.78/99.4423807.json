Both defendants were employed by one Fossa, the proprietor of a laundry in Nashua. On the Sundays mentioned in the complaints the defendants drove Fossa\u2019s laundry team through the streets of Nashua in the afternoon, collecting bundles of dirty clothes, and carried them to Fossa\u2019s place of business to be washed and returned on Monday. One and sometimes two other men were on the teams with the respondents, and there were people on the streets as they passed. The defendants were regular drivers for Fossa, and worked for him during the week. What they did on the days mentioned in the complaints was done in the prosecution of Fossa\u2019s business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-9\">The defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that the work complained of was work of necessity.

H. 575, the strict limitation of the right to labor on Sunday was upheld, apparently as matter of law, for the reason that otherwise much confusion and uncertainty would follow from trying the question of necessity as one of fact in every case. The suggestion is there made that if a relaxation of the rule is desirable it should be effected by legislative exemption of specific cases. Shortly thereafter the legislature ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>empted one class of labor (Laws 1883, c. 93), and in 1891 reenacted the statute as amended. P. S., c. 271, s. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\">In view of this history it must be concluded that the word necessity as used in this statute has the same limiting effect that it did in earlier times, and that the construction of the statute is not to be modified by the changed ideas of people in general upon the subject of the observance of Sunday as a day set apart from secular labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">In the absence of argument or brief on behalf of the defendants, the particular theory of the law relied upon is left to conjecture; and an examination of the record discloses no error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b130-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
