Noone.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b579-10\">A finding on the <em>voir dire, </em>that a witness is competent to judge of the value of land, is not subject to exception if based on evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b579-11\">Counsel may assert <em>arguendo </em>that the false testimony comes from the opposite party.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b579-12\">An exception to the refusal of the presiding justice to set aside a verdict as against the evidence presents no question of law.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-13\">Petition, under the flowage act, being the same case reported <em>ante, </em>338. Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-14\">Subject to exception, one Moore was found qualified to testify as to his opinion of the value of farm land upon evidence that he had resided in the vicinity seventy-three years, had worked on the land, owned some 300 acres in the vicinity, had bought a few pieces of real estate and tried to buy others, had charge of various lands in the neighborhood as executor, and was somewhat familiar with land values.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-15\">The declaration of Gallup that Joseph Noone was present when the letter H was cut, was excluded, subject to exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-16\">In the closing argument to the jury, counsel for the plaintiff said: \u201cMr. Noone may be the most public spirited man in Peterborough, but 1 have got this to say to you, Mr. Noone: You stand here con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>vieted before your fellow-men and a jury of Hillsborough county of trying to take my client\u2019s property away from him for nothing.\u201d The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-5\">The defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, as against the weight of the evidence, and because the jury fell into a plain mistake, was denied and he excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-6\">Transferred from the May term, 1917, of the superior court by <em>Allen, </em>J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b580-7\"><em>Charles J.

Brennan (Mr. Smith </em>orally), for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b580-9\">Peaslee, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1z\">There was evidence that the witness Moore was qualified to judge of the value of the land in question, and a finding to that effect, based on evidence, is not open to review here. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Tiffany, </em>70 N. H. 249, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">The proffered declaration of Gallup that when he cut the letter H on the\u00b0rock Joseph Noone was present, was held to be inadmissible upon the former transfer of the case. <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Noone, ante, </em>338. The surrounding facts as now shown do not differ from those presented then, and consequently the exception to the exclusion of the evidence must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">The argument of counsel to which exception was taken, was tantamount to a charge that the testimony of the defendant and his witnesses was false. \u201cCounsel have the right to claim that the false testimony came from his opponents.\u201d <em>Story </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>70 N. H. 364, 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">The defendant\u2019s exception to the refusal of the presiding justice to set the verdict aside as against the evidence presents no question of law. It is conceded that witnesses testified to facts which would support the plaintiff\u2019s case. The claim argued is that the defendant\u2019s witnesses were more numerous and more trustworthy and therefore should have been believed. This contention was finally disposed of by the decision of the presiding justice. <em>Flaherty </em>v. <em>Railway, ante, </em>254, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b580-14\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
