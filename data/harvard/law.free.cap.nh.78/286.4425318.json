The amendment of Laws 1915, <em>c. </em>30, s. 3, contained in Laws 1915, c. 60, s. 1, could not by any process of interpretation be' held to mean statutes not in force at the time of its passage. Even if the legislature thought the old statute still effective, that could not make it so. <em>\u201cA </em>mistaken opinion of the legislature concerning the law, does not make law.\u201d <em>Postmaster General </em>v. <em>Early, </em>12 Wheat. 136, 148. \u201cThe mere reference to a repealed act or section as still in force, or the supposition or assumption on the part of the legislature that such act or section remains in force, does not affect the repeal Or restore the law.\u201d Lewis\u2019 Suth.

Laws 1915, c. 30, ss. 3, 16. At that time the general law applicable to all courts of criminal jurisdiction provided that all fines imposed for violations of the automobile law should go to the state. Laws 1911, c. 133, <em>s. </em>27. Twenty days later the legislature amended said section 3 so as to except \u201c cases where otherwise specifically fixed by statute. \u201d Laws 1915, <em>c. </em>60, s 1. It is argued that chapter 30 repealed the provision of the act of 1911, so far as it applied to municipal courts, and that if chapter 60 in effect repealed that provision of chapter 30, it did not revive the earlier provision repealed by chapter 30. P. S., c. 2, s. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The legislature meant to accomplish something by the enactment of this provision of chapter 60; .but if the defendants\u2019 contention were sound the provision would be without any effect. If it did not re-instate this provision of the automobile law, it did not have that effect upon any other provision which was in force when chapter 30 was enacted. And all acts passed after the enactment of chapter 30, and specifically fixing the ultimate destination of fines, would be effective without the provision of chapter 60. It is evident that the legislative intent in enacting chapter 60 was to correct an error or oversight in chapter 30. The provision is in terms an amendment of the earlier act, not a repeal thereof. As to offences thereafter committed it is to be treated as though it had been a part of chapter 30 in the first instance. The provisions of Public Statutes, chapter 2, section 37, have no application to the present situation, because such application \u201cwould be inconsistent with the'manifest intent of the legislature.\u201d P.
