Decree for the defendant in the first, and for the plaintiffs in the second suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-14\">Richard Gage died in 1907 leaving a widow, Eliza, to whom he gave all his \u201cestate real personal and mixed . . . during her natural life for her comfort, pleasure and maintenance, and the control and management of the same\u201d; and by another clause he gave what remained of his estate after the death and burial of his wife \u201cor the proceeds thereof then remaining unconsumed and unexpended\u201d to his legal heirs. Eliza subsequently married Wesley Fuller who owned, subject to a mortgage the house in which they lived. Eliza gave him $938.50 of the money she received under Richard\u2019s will to pay this mortgage and $400 to repair the house. The plaintiffs are Richard\u2019s heirs. The defendant in the first suit is admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>istrator <em>c. t. a. </em>of Wesley\u2019s estate, and in the second, Eliza\u2019s executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-5\">Transferred by Allen, J., on the plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions to the decrees, from the May term, 1917, of the superior court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b570-6\"><em>Thorp &amp; Abbott </em>and <em>Samuel J.

If the language Richard used is given its ordinary meaning he intended Eliza should use his estate in any wayshe thought would be conducive to her comfort; and that if there was any of it left at her death it should go to his children. The court has found that Eliza acted in good faith when she gave the money in question to her second husband, that is, has found that she thought it would be conducive to her comfort to repair the house in which she lived and to pay the mortgage on it. It must be held, therefore, that she was acting within her rights when she gave this money to Wesley <em>(Shapleigh </em>v. <em>Shapleigh, </em>69 N. H. 577, 580), for there is nothing either in or outside of Richard\u2019s will which even tends to the conclusion that the language he used is not to be given its ordinary \u2022 meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b570-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
