Quimby <em>v. </em>Central New Hampshire Power Company.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b204-7\">In an action \u201cagainst a foreign corporation, service on the secretary of state, in accordance with the provisions of Laws 1913, c. 187, s. 1, gives the court jurisdiction of the corporation as well as of the property attached on the writ, though the copy given to the secretary of state does not include a copy of the officer\u2019s return of the attachment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-8\">Assumpsit. Service was made on the defendants, a Maine corporation, by giving an attested copy of the writ to the secretary of state. Transferred by <em>Branch, </em>J., from the October term, 1915, of the superior court on the defendants\u2019 exception to the denial of their motion to dismiss on the ground that the copy given to the secretary of state did not include a copy of the officer\u2019s return of the attachment of their real estate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-9\"><em>Robert W. Upton, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-10\">A\u201e <em>Chester Clark </em>and <em>Arthur V. D. Piper </em>(of Vermont), for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b204-11\">Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOc\">The defendants\u2019 contention rests on the proposition that the copy to be served on the secretary of state, under the provisions of Laws 1913, c. 187, s. 1, is the same as that required by P. S., <em>c. </em>219,' s. 5. In other words, they contend that s. 1 simply provides an additional method of completing service on non-resident corporations. The validity of this contentioh depends on the intention of the legislature; and the language it used is all the evidence there is relevant to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Section 1 provides among other things that process served on the secretary of state \u201cshall be of the same legal force and validity as if served on\u201d the corporation. If this language is given its ordinary meaning \u2014 and there is nothing to show that that was not the sense in which it was used \u2014 service on the secretary of state in accordance with the provisions of s. 1 gives the court jurisdiction of the corporation as well as of the property attached on the writ; while service made in accordance with the provisions of s. 5 gives the court jurisdiction of the attached property only. Since service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>in accordance with the provisions of s. 1 is service on the corporation, it is probable that the copy the legislature had in mind was the \u2022one called for by P. S., c. 219, s. 2, as amended by Laws 1893, c. 67, s. 6, which provides that \u201call writs and other processes shall be served by giving to the defendant, or leaving at his abode, an attested copy thereof, except in cases otherwise provided for.\u201d In other words, it is probable the legislature intended <em>s. </em>1 as an addition to, or amendment of, P. S., <em>c. </em>219, s. 2 rather than as an addition to, or amendment of, P. S., <em>c. </em>219, s. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b205-4\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
