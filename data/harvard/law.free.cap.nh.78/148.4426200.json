The county commissioners found there was necessity for the proposed highway. Many witnesses testified before them, giving their opinions upon the question and their reasons therefor. There -are no houses on the new highway except one at the end, called the Newell place. The occupants of the Newell place have a way by prescription over the route of the proposed highway. The plaintiff moved to vacate the finding of the commissioners. The motion was denied, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-11\">Transferred from the September term, 1915, of the superior \u25a0 court by <em>Sawyer, </em>J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-12\"><em>Henry A.

S., <em>c. </em>68, s. 8), but it has always been held that \u201cthe court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>has no power to revise the doings of the commissioners for the purpose of ascertaining whether they have judged wisely and correctly . . . nor for any purpose but to see that their proceedings have been regular, and that fraud or surprise has not been used to vitiate their results.\u201d <em>Hampstead\u2019s Petition, </em>19 N. H. 343, 347; <em>Crosby </em>v. <em>Hanover, </em>36 N. H. 414, 418; <em>Doughty </em>v. <em>Little, </em>61 N. H. 365, 368. There is no suggestion of any irregularity, fraud or surprise. What the public good requires, whether there was public necessity for the highway is a question of fact. <em>Petition of the Milford &amp; Manchester R. R., </em>68 N. H. 570. \u201cThe statute makes the commissioners the tribunal to judge of the necessity of the highway. In this respect the court has no power to revise the judgment of the commissioners.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>53 N. H. 622, 626. That there are no houses on the proposed highway, or only one, and the existence of a private way over the proposed route are evidentiary facts, which might be regarded as tending to establish that the highway was unnecessary. But as the weight of the evidence is exclusively for the commissioners <em>(Webster\u2019s Petition, </em>60 N. H. 576, 578) these facts do not establish as matter of law the absence of necessity for the public way.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
