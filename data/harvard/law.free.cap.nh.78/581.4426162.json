Ayer, who was killed on February 12, 1913, by collision with a passenger train, while driving in an open carriage over a grade-crossing at Barrington station. Trial by jury resulting in a disagreement. Transferred from the February term,. 1914, of the superior court by <em>Pike, </em>C. J., on the defendants\u2019 exceptions to the denial of their motions for a nonsuit and the direction of a verdict in their favor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-8\"><em>Mathews &amp; Stevens (Mr. Stevens </em>orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-9\"><em>Leslie P.

The case is not distinguishable from <em>Gahagan </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>70 N. H. 441; <em>Waldron </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>71 N. H. 362, and <em>Bonnin </em>v. <em>Railroad, 77 </em>N. H. 559. The deceased was riding in a carriage when the collision occurred; but that fact, in the absence of all evidence of care on his part, does not differentiate the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained: verdict and judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b611-12\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
