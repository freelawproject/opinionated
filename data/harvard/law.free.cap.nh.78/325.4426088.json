The copy offered in evidence is as follows: \u201cManchester, N. H., August 17th, 1892. This is to certify that I will not collect any wages (or money) from Alma E. Jackson as long as she livefe, but the condition in this agreement is that the said Alma E. Jackson shall pay me with what is left of her personal and real estate (all property, wherever found), which is to the full amount of all her property, after her legal debts are payed, if I outlive her.

On October 5, 1912, a second will was made, of which the defendant is executrix, leaving the plaintiff the sum of five hundred dollars, but none of the property set forth in this bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-11\">A bill of exceptions was allowed by <em>Branch, </em>J., at the May term, 1916, of the superior court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-12\"><em>George A.

P. S., c. 224, s. 16; <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>68 N. H. 264; <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>73 N. H. 122; <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>74 N. H. 238; <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Jordan\u2019s Estate, </em>76 N. H. 20, and numerous other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The plaintiff contends that he should have been allowed to testify under section 17 of said chapter 224, which provides that \u201cwhen it clearly appears to the court that injustice may be done without the testimony of the party in such case, he may be allowed to testify.\u201d In construing this section the courts have always been very reluctant to allow such testimony, and have never permitted it unless it was very clearly made to appear that injustice would be done by its exclusion. The rule being, in all ordinary cases, that the surviving party cannot give evidence as to any facts about which the deceased could testify, if living. In <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>47 N. H. 462, 465, <em>Perley, </em>C. J. said: \u201cBut we think, that, for ordinary cases, the safe guide and the decisive test is found in the inquiry whether the deceased, if alive, could testify to the same matters.\u201d <em>Hoit </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>56 N. H. 559, 563; <em>Tuck </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>62 N. H. 469; <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Gafney, </em>66 N. H. 261. The testimony of the surviving party is never received as to matters about which the deceased could have testified, when his representative being a party to the suit does not elect to testify, unless it appears from other evidence than that of the party himself that injustice will be done by its rejection. <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Hilliard, </em>47 N. H. 551; <em>Fosgate </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>54. N. H. 455; <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Langmaid, </em>60 N. H. 571; <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Hennessey, </em>65 N. H. 101. There was no such evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The court committed no error in excluding the writing signed by the plaintiff and offered in evidence by him, which states in substance that he would not collect wages of the deceased as long as she lived, on condition that he should have all of her property, if he outlived her. It does not appear that the paper was binding upon the deceased, it was not signed by her, and there is nothing in the case to indicate that she assented to the condition therein, or that she ever saw it, or knew of its contents. It was therefore in the nature of a self-serving declaration, and its admission would have placed before'the court by indirection the testimony of the plaintiff, which, as above pointed out, could not be received in this case. Furthermore, as the paper was not obligatory upon the deceased, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>its introduction in evidence could not have affected the issue on trial, and it might well have been rejected as immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b357-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
