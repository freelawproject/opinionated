The defendant filed an answer alleging that the property could not be divided and ought not to be sold because if that were done she would lose a very large sum of money she had put into the property at the plaintiff\u2019s request, and in reliance on her promise that she (the defendant) might occupy it as a home as long as she lived. Transferred by <em>Branch, </em>J., from the October term, 1915, of the superior court on the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the ruling that the answer stated a defence. This is the case reported in 77 N. H. 601.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-9\"><em>Joseph S.

H. 84; and all fair minded men will agree that if the facts stated in the answer are true it would be inequitable for the plaintiff to cause the property to be sold without first doing whatever is reasonably necessary to secure the defendant from the loss she would sustain because of having improved the property at the plaintiff\u2019s request and in rebanee on her promise not to dispose of it in her (the defendant\u2019s) lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b164-13\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
