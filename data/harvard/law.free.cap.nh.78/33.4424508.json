The liability rests on the theory that it is a fraud upon the corporate creditors to distribute the corporate property to the stockholders without providing for the payment of the debts of the corporation. The willful destruction or the intentional diminution of any part of the corporation\u2019s capital, or the diversion of the profits thereof, is held to be a fraud upon the creditors and entitles them as against the perpetrators to maintain an action for proper relief.\u201d 4 Thomp. Corp. (2d ed.), s. 4926; <em>Crandall </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>52 Conn. 73; <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Company, </em>167 N. Y. 89;. <em>Farnsworth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>36 Minn. 369. The term \u201cdebts\u201d is used in this connection in the sense of legal liabilities. The trust is imposed in favor of the holders of all -corporate obligations, and may betaken advantage of by those whose claims sound in tort rather than contract. <em>Grenell </em>v. <em>Gas Co., </em>112 Mich. 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The defendants\u2019 contention that because no attachment was made-no lien was obtained upon the property does not affect the result. If there had been such a lien, it would have been superior to the rights of <em>bona fide </em>purchasers for value; and without the lien, the right of such a purchaser would prevail. But the stockholder to-whom distribution was made does not stand as a purchaser, but as a trustee, accountable to those having lawful .claims against the.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>corporation. The decree does not impose a lien upon the specific property, which may have passed to a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser. It merely charges one who wrongfully received the property for what was so received.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The fact that the stockholder has disposed of the specific property transferred to it does not alter the legal situation. When it took the property it became chargeable for the value thereof, and its liability is not decreased by the fact that it has sold the property and now holds the proceeds of the sale. It is not necessary to determine whether the transfer violated the law in other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b65-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
