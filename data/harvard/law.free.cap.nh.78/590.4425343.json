In 1790 the town attempted by vote to lay out the highway in dispute. The court did not rule that the action of the town constituted a valid layout of the road, but found that this road had been used as a public highway when occasion required for forty years previous to 1913, and, by reason of this and other facts found, ruled that there is a public highway following the course set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s bill as marked by the evidence on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">There being no exception to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the court\u2019s findings of fact, and none to the ruling that the road in dispute is a public highway, no question is now open to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b621-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
