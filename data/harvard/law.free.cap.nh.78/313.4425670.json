Bartlett, deceased, agreed'1 to convey certain real estate on Harrison Street in Manchester to. the plaintiff, in consideration of her promise to occupy the premises and render certain services to him as a housekeeper and nurse. The defendant is the heir and administrator of Eben, who died intestate. The case was heard by a master who reported the facts, which are sufficiently referred to in the opinion. The defendant, excepted to the order overruling his demurrer to the bill, and denying his motion that upon the evidence and the findings the bill be dismissed. The rights of the defendant under the demurrer are transferred without ruling. The plaintiff excepted to the refusal of the master to receive the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019 in regard to facts which the deceased could testify to, if alive. The bill was brought against the defendant both as heir and as administrator, but at plaintiff\u2019s instance was discontinued against the estate. Transferred from the May term, 1916, of the superior court by <em>Sawyer, </em>J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-11\"><em>John M.

He does not specifically find what the terms of the contract were in accordance with which the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>tiff moved into and occupied the deceased\u2019s premises. The most \u25a0that is stated is, that he \u201cinduced\u201d her to give up her home and business on Union street and set up a lodging house in his house on Harrison street, \u201cunder the promise of the gift of the same to her, where he could come to be taken care of by her whenever he should demand it. \u201d This finding is based upon casual remarks made by him as to the general effect of the contract, which it does not appear he attempted at any time to state concisely or fully. Her assent to his proposal as well as her obligation is left largely to inference and surmise. The contract as disclosed by the report is not clear, definite .-and complete. Pom. Cont: Spec. Perf. (2nd ed.) ss. 159-161. While .-.she occupied the premises after the contract was made, for about two months or until his death, it is not found what the character -of her possession was, whether she claimed a right of possession -referable to the contract, or whether the contract itself even defined \u25a0or specified when the conveyance should be made. If she occupied the premises claiming to be the fee simple owner under and in ac-cordance with the contract, her possession might be said to be -adverse and constitute a part performance of the contract. <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>76 N. H. 483, 488. But her undefined occupation cannot Nave that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">If, however, it could be held that the master\u2019s report is sufficiently \u25a0definite to show what the agreement was, there is not only no finding .that the plaintiff will be defrauded if the contract is not carried out, but no facts are reported which sustain such a conclusion. Unless fraud would result from the non-performance of a parol contract to -convey land, it is the established doctrine in this jurisdiction that \u2022equity will not decree specific performance. <em>Stillings </em>v. <em>Stillings, </em>67 N. H. 584; <em>White </em>v. <em>Poole, </em>74 N. H. 71; <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Dana, supra. </em>For the services the plaintiff rendered in caring for .the deceased no \u25a0reason is apparent why she cannot recover compensation from his \u2022estate. So far as appears no substantial difficulty exists in estimating their value by a pecuniary standard. <em>Ham </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>33 N. H. 32; <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Lund, </em>69 N. H. 78, 82. The fact that the deceased believed from his acquaintanceship with the plaintiff and his lcnowl-edge of her faithfulness as a nurse that she would prove to be the most competant and satisfactory person he could secure for the performance of these services, does not show they could not be valued in money, but merely that he might have regarded them as \u25a0especially valuable. <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Lund, supra, </em>83. There is little \u25a0to indicate that the parties regarded the services she promised to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>render as incommensurable in money. No peculiar relationship of confidence or regard, such as might warrant a finding of that kind, is shown to have existed between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Nor did the plaintiff change \u201cher plans for life\u201d in consequence of the contract, within the reasonable meaning of that expression as used in <em>White </em>v. <em>Poole, 74 </em>N. H. 71, 73. What, if any, definite plans she had for her future support and comfort is not disclosed; hence it cannot be said that she made any special sacrifice on that account. It is true that in consequence of her arrangement with Mr. Bartlett she moved from her home in a rented house to his house in the same city, but did not give up her lodging house business or make any substantial change except that of moving and discontinuing a small mattress business she had carried on. In fact there is no evidence that at the time the contract was made she contemplated any radical change in her place of abode, her manner of life, or her means of support, or that she gave up, in consequence of the contract, any opportunity or prospect of improving her condition in life. She merely moved from one lodging house to another .and did not in any material sense change her situation or mode of life, or sacrifice any prospective benefits which could be reasonably anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">If, therefore, it is assumed in accordance with the plaintiff\u2019s claim that in consideration of her promise to move to Mr. Bartlett\u2019s house and perform for him the services of nurse, housekeeper, or .attendant, he promised to convey the house to her when she entered upon the performance of her agreement, specific performance cannot be decreed in the absence of facts showing that she would be the victim of a fraud, if equitable relief is denied. The defendant\u2019s exception to the insufficiency of the facts to warrant a decree for the plaintiff is sustained. But as it is practically conceded that the administrator of the deceased\u2019s estate is not legally interested in the suit, since the estate is solvent, it was error for the master to refuse to permit the plaintiff to testify to facts occurring during the lifetime of the deceased in regard to which he might have testified if he had been alive, for the mere reason that the administrator did not elect to testify. P. S. c. 224, s. 16. At the time her testimony was offered, the bill so far as it related to the administrator had been properly dismissed. He was no longer even a nominal party in that capacity. The relief then sought was against him as the heir of the deceased and not as the administrator. Under such circumstances her testimony should have been received. The plaintiff\u2019s exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>to its exclusion must be sustained. <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>72 N. H. 241; <em>Eagan </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>75 N. H. 410. In view of this error the mas-1ter\u2019s report must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\">Whether the bill is demurrable in its present form need not be-determined, since upon a new trial such amendments may be made-as may seem to be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\n<em>New trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b346-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
