Trial by jury. The evidence tended' to prove that the plaintiff, who had been shipping milk from his-farm in Vermont to the defendants in Manchester, N. H., for a year or more, leased his farm in October, 1914, and agreed with the-tenant that he should continue to ship milk to them but should ship it in the plaintiff\u2019s name, who should collect payment therefor and, after deducting his rent, turn the balance over to the tenant. On July 21, 1915, one of-the city inspectors found that two cans of the plaintiff\u2019s milk were not up to standard and, on August 6, three more cans. Certain shipments were inspected by the defendants\u2019 employees when unloading the milk from* the cars and they accepted all of it and used it in their business without notifying the plaintiff until September 1, 1915, that there was any trouble with it, when they sent their treasurer to him, who, after telling him that criminal proceedings either had been or would be instituted against him, said that they would not appear against him if he would allow them one hundred dollars on the account. The plaintiff agreed to this and gave the defendants\u2019 treasurer a receipt for one hundred dollars on the milk account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-9\">A few days later the plaintiff wrote the defendants and repudiated the agreement and asked them to return the receipt to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-10\">In reply they wrote him that the agreement was valid and that-the enclosed .check together with the one hundred dollars he had agreed to allow them represented the amount they owed him at that-time and that the check was sent in settlement of the account. On its back was written: \u201cThis check in payment of all milk received, to date.\u201d The plaintiff drew a line through these words, endorsed the check and deposited it for collection, and a day or two later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>brought this suit. The jury found (1) a general verdict for the plaintiff; (2) that all the milk except five cans was up to standard; (3) that the plaintiff did not accept the check in settlement of the milk account. The court refused to instruct the jury that if the plaintiff erased the receipt on the back of the check without the defendants\u2019 consent it would not affect the condition on which the check was sent. Transferred by <em>Sawyer, </em>J., from the April term, 1916, of the superior court on the defendants\u2019 exception to this ruling and to the denial of their motion for a directed verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-5\"><em>Bernard Jacobs, </em>by brief and orally, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-6\"><em>Drew, Shurtleff, Morris &amp; Oakes </em>and <em>Arthur B.

The evidence relevant to the issue whether the milk was up to standard was that it was all right when the city inspected it on August 31; that the defendants accepted it without complaint and used it in their business; and that notwithstanding they inspected it as it was unloaded from the cars they did not call the inspectors to testify as to its quality. This warrants the finding that all but five cans were up to standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">2. It can be found that the defendants\u2019 treasurer told the plaintiff that he was liable to a criminal prosecution but that they would not appear against him if he would allow them one hundred dollars on the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">In other words it can be found that the agreement of the defendants\u2019 treasurer not to appear against the plaintiff if he was prosecuted criminally was the consideration for the agreement evidenced by the receipt. It is elementary that if the consideration for the agreement was illegal the agreement itself was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">3. The fact the plaintiff collected the check is not an answer to this suit unless he either agreed to accept it in settlement of the account <em>(St. Pierre </em>v. <em>Company, </em>77 N. H. 599) or is estopped to deny that he so accepted it. <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Buzzell, </em>75 N. H. 486. No one contends that he agreed to so accept it; consequently the question on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>this branch of the case is whether he is estopped to deny he so accepted it. The test to decide that question is to inquire whether he used ordinary care to notify the defendants that if they paid the check he would not accept the proceeds in settlement of the account; or to notify them that if they paid it he should treat the proceeds as a payment on account; for on the one hand while it is true, as the defendants contend, that if he used the check without doing what the ordinary man would have done to notify them that he would not accept it in settlement of the account, he cannot now be heard to deny that he. so accepted it; oil the other hand it is just as true that if they paid the check after they either knew or ought to have known that he refused to accept it in settlement of the account, they cannot now be heard to deny that they permitted him to treat the check as a payment on the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u25a0 In considering whether the plaintiff is estopped to deny he accepted the check in settlement, it is important to remember that the check was not a check within the ordinary meaning of that term, but a written instrument directing the bank on which it was drawn to pay $36.50 to the order of the plaintiff-provided he executed the receipt on its back. It was reasonable, therefore, for the plaintiff to think that, if he erased the receipt before he deposited the check for collection, the bank would not pay it without notifying the defendants of what he had done and that it would be guided by them as to paying it. In short it can be found that the plaintiff did all the ordinary man would have done to notify the defendants that he would not accept the check in settlement of the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">It follows, therefore, that there is evidence to warrant the finding that the plaintiff is not estopped to deny that he accepted the check in settlement of the account. This disposes of the defendants\u2019 exception to the court\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction as well as of their exception to the court\u2019s denial of their motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b404-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
