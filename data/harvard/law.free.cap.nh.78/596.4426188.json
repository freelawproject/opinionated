The number of counsel appearing was of record in the case and their ability, if not matter of common knowledge, was an inference which might be drawn from their conduct of the cause. Whether from these facts any inference could be drawn material upon the question tried, is a question of law upon which in the absence of exception as \"to the instruction of the jury it must be presumed proper instructions were given to and followed by them. <em>Conn.
