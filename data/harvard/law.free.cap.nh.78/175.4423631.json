Trial by the court and verdict for the plaintiffs. The defendants, who are husband and wife, visited the plaintiffs\u2019 store in June, 1914, and bought the goods in question for Merrill <em>&amp; </em>Co., a partnership of which they were the members. Transferred by <em>Branch, </em>J., from the April term, 1916, of the superior court on the wife\u2019s exception to the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-12\"><em>Harry J.

In other words, the question is not whether she is liable on a contract made by her husband, but on one she made with the plaintiffs, and that she is, is not open to question. P.
