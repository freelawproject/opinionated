Trial by jury. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the defendants\u2019 motion for a nonsuit was granted subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception.

He was run over and killed on the east bound track of the defendants\u2019 railroad, main line, at Rockingham Junction, some time during that night. His remains, which were found on the track on the morning of the thirteenth, indicated that a train had passed over his body more than once. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to prove that Thompson was at the Newmarket station, on the evening of December 12,1914, at about 10:30 o\u2019clock, in an intoxicated condition; that a special train running between Dover and Exeter that night came into the Newmarket station at that time; and that Thompson got onto the platform of a car. No one saw him on the train, although several people who knew him were on the train including his son who was expecting him to get on at Newmarket, and looked out to see if he could see him. There was no evidence that disclosed Thompson\u2019s movements after he was seen at Newmarket. The circumstances that surround his death are unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">The burden was upon the plaintiff to prove that the defendants\u2019 negligence caused the intestate\u2019s death, and that the intestate was free from fault. The evidence did not furnish proof from which the jury could find either of these fundamental requirements, and therefore the nonsuit was properly ordered. A verdict found for the plaintiff in this case would necessarily be based upon surmises and conjectures, instead of legal evidence such as the law demands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number><em>Dingman </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>77 N.
