The first count alleges that within two years last past defendant became indebted to plaintiff in the sum of $570, for goods, wares and merchandise, to wit: 38,000 pounds of bentonite at an agreed price of $30 per ton, sold and delivered by plaintiff to defendant at the special instance and request of defendant. The second count in the complaint reads as follows: \u201cThat within two years last past, in the City of Napa, County of Napa, State of California, an account was stated between plaintiff and defendant, and upon such statement a balance of $570 was found to be due to plaintiff from said defendant which said defendant then and there agreed to pay to the plaintiff. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The first answer of the defendant contains a general denial of the allegations contained in the complaint, and also a cross-complaint in which the defendant asked for damages in the sum of $1336.61, for and on account of plaintiff\u2019s failure to deliver the product ordered by the defendant. During the course of the trial the defendant filed an amended answer in which it set up a defense to the plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause \"of action on a contract stated, to wit: That the alleged promise of the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of $570 was made through mistake and at a time when the defendant did not know that the plaintiff had failed to ship the kind and quality of merchandise theretofore ordered by the defendant from the plaintiff, but had shipped to the defendant an entirely different product.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The defendant asked judgment, first: That the plaintiff take nothing by reason of its action, and second, that it recover of and from the plaintiff the damages alleged in the cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Upon this appeal no question is presented as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the judgment for damages in favor of the defendant, if the defendant is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>to any judgment. Upon this appeal the plaintiff relies exclusively upon a certain letter and telegram hereinafter set forth, contending that the evidence introduced in the case was for the purpose of varying a written contract, and therefore was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\">It is also claimed by the appellant that the order for the merchandise to be delivered, its quality and kind, was definitely fixed by the telegram, to wit: That it should be according to sample without any designation or qualifying words as to the grade or quality of the sample. The contention of the plaintiff is not made exactly \"in the words which we have stated, but is to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">It appears that the letter which we. shall hereinafter set forth was received by the defendant, and immediately thereafter a telegram, which we will set forth, was sent by the defendant to the plaintiff. However, immediately following the telegram, which stated that a letter would be written in connection with or following the telegram, the defendant boarded a train for Los Angeles, went to the office of the plaintiff in that city, and there, in conversation with the president of the plaintiff, specified the kind and quality of the material which he desired. On the part of the plaintiff it is alleged that what took place at this visit is no part of the order. However, a letter written by the plaintiff to the defendant directly controverts this contention. The subject of the controversy is a clay material found near Barstow, in the state of California. The material desired by the defendant, and theretofore purchased from the successors of the plaintiff, was and is known as 1 \u2018 Bentonite No. 1\u201d; that this \u201cBentonite No. 1\u201d was used by the defendant in making a preparation for the softening of water, and sold by him to customers engaged in the laundry business; that this material must be sufficiently pulverized or ground to admit of its passing through a 200-mesh screen, practically as fine as flour.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The record shows that prior to the receipt of the letter which we are about to quote, the defendant had been making some inquiries of distributing agents in Los Angeles, as to where he could obtain \u201cBentonite No. 1\u201d to use in his business. Following this, a letter was written by the president of the plaintiff to the defendant, which letter is in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u201cWestern Talc Company</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVd\">\u201cProducers and Distributors of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah3r\">\u2018 \u2018 Non-metallic Materials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\">\u201cCustom Grinding</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9v\">\u201c1901-11 East Slauson Avenue</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A44\">\u201cLos Angeles, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">\u201cJune 5, 1935.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">\u201cWestern Cider Works,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">\u201cNapa, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">\u2018'Gentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">\u201cWe are sending you today, by freight, two bags of unground No. 1 Bentonite.

It may be here stated that the two bags of sample material sent by the plaintiff to the defendant contained unground material, and therefore could not be tested and its quality or grade or usefulness determined by the defendant, as he had no machine with which to grind the same to the required fineness. Realizing this the defendant, as stated in his testimony, went to Los Angeles to make the order for the material more definite and certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Following the visit of the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s office in Los Angeles, the plaintiff shipped 38,000 pounds of material taken from its mine in Barstow, to the defendant at Napa.

Savell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-16\">This letter, as we have stated, directly controverts the contention made by the appellant that the telegram set forth herein was the complete order for the shipment of the material made by the plaintiff to the defendant. It will be noted that the invoice of the material shipped made no reference to the sample theretofore sent by the plaintiff to the defendant, and we may here add that there is not a word in the record showing that the 38,000 pounds of clay material shipped by the plaintiff to the defendant corresponded in any particular with the samples contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>two sacks mentioned in the letter of the plaintiff to the defendant. Nor was any testimony introduced by the plaintiff showing that the invoice correctly described the quality of the shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The basis of the appellant\u2019s contention that the defendant is bound by an account stated rests upon a letter written by the defendant to the plaintiff, dated August 3, 1935, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-14\">\u201cCarbonated Sweet Cider in bottles</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-15\">Pure Apple Juice in bulk and glass jars</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-16\">Awarded Gold Medal Panama Pacific Exposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">Pure Cider Vinegar Apple Syrup Apple Butter Boiled Cider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">Western Cider Works George Blaufuss, Prop.

IT. Saveli.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">\u201cDear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">\u201cI have been wanting to write you long before this. I almost despaired because I was afraid that I could not use that shipment of Bentonite at all. It is not the same material that we had five years ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">\u201cWe have to burn it at 245 degrees higher before it will stand the hydration treatment. It took us a long time to find that out. In the meantime, we was compelled to make a shipment of a ton-and-a-half of softener because the party had made a down payment. Unfortunately, it takes approximately 10 days to find how the mineral will act after it is finished. We took a chance on the ton-and-a-half, and now we had to take it back again and give the man his money back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-13\">\u201cWe have used up a third of the shipment and we have only one ton that will give 80 grains per pound instead of 125 as we had guaranteed our prospects. The vitrification point and point of hardness are so close that I was compelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>to put in a new pyrometer equipment in order to handle it at all. I have been under a tremendous expense for fuel, labor and chemicals besides. And we have practically nothing to sell. I do not blame you directly for this because I believe you thought you was giving me the same material. But I have to ask you now to give me lots more time for the payments. I had to mix some other material with the Bentonite in order to get it up to 80 grains. I will have to sell it at a reduced price in order to compete with the capacity of other base exchange material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\">\u201cMy cider season is now at hand and I will have to stop for two or three months before going any further with the softener. In the meantime, I must ask you, under the circumstances, to extend me a credit for at least three months before the payments start. I expect to have a good run on the cider and can use the profits of that to pay for this Bentonite.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">\u201cHoping that you will be able to see the difficulties that I am working under, and grant my request, I am,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">\u201cYours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axp\">\u201c(Signed) George Blaufuss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The amended answer of the defendant raises the question for consideration by the court that this letter was written under a mistake as to the quality of the material theretofore shipped by the plaintiff to the defendant, and before he had fully ascertained that it was not \u201cBentonite No. 1\u201d, or bentonite at all, and that he subsequently did ascertain, from having a chemical analysis made, that the material shipped was known as \u201cAmmonium Silica\u201d. It appears from the record that \u201cAmmonium Silica\u201d and \u201cBentonite No. 1\u201d come from the same mine near Barstow, but in different portions thereof. The record shows an abundance of testimony, not only that the shipment made by the plaintiff to the defendant was not \u201cBentonite No. 1\u201d, as described in the invoice, but was not bentonite at all. The record contains much testimony showing the difference in the material, which, however, it is unnecessary to set forth herein as the sufficiency of such testimony is not questioned by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The contention of the appellant that the alleged account stated could not be questioned is sufficiently answered in the case of <em>Budd </em>v. <em>Bough, </em>100 Cal. App. 103 [279 Pac. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>1074], and likewise, the grounds upon which such an account may be impeached is set forth definitely, to wit: \u201cAs uniformly held, an account stated does not operate as an estoppel, but may be impeached for fraud or mistake; and if either of those elements is plead and the evidence adduced in support of the pleading proves that there has been any mistake, fraud, or undue advantage, by which the account is in truth vitiated, and the balance incorrectly fixed, the account is not conclusive upon the parties. <em>(Union Lbr. Co. </em>v. <em>J. W. Schouten &amp; Co., 25 </em>Cal. App. 80 [142 Pac. 910] ; <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>County of Tulare, 56 </em>Cal. App. 261 [205 Pac. 21]; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>170 Cal. 570 [150 Pac. 994]; 1 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law 2d ed., 463.) Moreover, section 1700 of the Civil Code provides that the material alteration of a written contract by a party entitled to any benefit under it extinguishes all executory obligations of the contract in his favor against the parties who do not consent to the act.\u201d Further citation of authorities on this point seems to us unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In view of what we have stated and what the record shows, as set forth herein, we do not very well perceive any necessity for following the discussion of the appellant any further as to the subject of warranties and the different cases holding that under the circumstances in the different cases involved no warranties could be either expressly or impliedly held to exist. The record shows, as set forth herein, that the plaintiff assumed, and in its invoice represented that it had shipped to the defendant \u201cBentonite No. 1,\u201d whereas in truth and in fact there is sufficient testimony in the record upon which the jury had a right to conclude that the plaintiff did not ship \u201cBentonite No. 1\u201d or any bentonite at all, but did ship to the plaintiff a clay composition known as \u201cAmmonium Silica\u201d, which was of no value whatever to the defendant, but which, in his attempt to use the same, greatly injured his business and damaged him in the sum alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">There was also sufficient testimony in the record to support the conclusion of the jury that the defendant, when he wrote the letter of August 3, 1935, was acting under a mistake and misapprehension as to what kind of product the plaintiff had shipped to him, and did not ascertain the same until some months afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The contention of the appellant that it was error for the court to allow the defendant to file an amended answer seems to us wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Thompson, J., and Pullen, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
