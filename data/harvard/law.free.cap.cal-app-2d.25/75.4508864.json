The plaintiff alleged that the structures erected by the defendants were partly upon lands owned by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">As the alleged trespass has been discontinued, we have, as just stated, only the question of determining the method of ascertaining the line designated as \u201cordinary high water mark\u201d, as found in section 670 of the Civil Code. That section specifies that the state is the owner of all lands below tide water and below ordinary high water mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">The defendants and the intervener contended in the trial court and likewise insist upon this appeal, that the term \u201cordinary high water mark\u201d means a line along the shore left by the highest run or reach of the water, or stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>the language of their brief: \u201c1. Does this term, \u2018ordinary high water mark\u2019 mean the line reached on the beach by the edge of the sea water when an ordinary high tide is at its full, and where the edge of such sea water on the beach leaves its visible mark upon the shore, plain to all or, 2. Does such term \u2018ordinary high water mark\u2019 mean an imaginary theoretical contour line arrived at by projecting to its intersection with the shore, the plane of the vertical rise of the tide only, and completely eliminating the higher line on the shore reached by the natural flow of the sea water when such tide is at its full 1 \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\">Stated in other language: Does the ordinary high water mark mean the run or reach of the water or waves upon the shore, or does it mean the vertical rise of the tide, and then the horizontal line projecting therefrom intersecting the shore? The uncertainty seems to arise from the confusion of the run of the sea water or reach of the sea water as it dashes up against the shore with what is really intended by the term \u201cordinary high water mark\u2019\u2019 as determined by the actual rise of the tide. Or, expressed in other words: Does the run or reach of the sea-water upon the shore as it advances and recedes, have any connection whatever in legal meaning with what is known as tide-water?</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">The respondent contended in the trial court, and upon this appeal contends that the \u201cordinary high water mark\u201d is to be determined by ascertaining the mean ordinary rise of the tides, and then projecting a horizontal line to the shore. In determining the mean rise of the tides and what is meant thereby, it appears that the federal government has adopted a rule which takes into consideration all of the tides, while the rule adopted by the State of California includes only what is ordinarily called \u201cneap\u2019\u2019 tides. Wherever the lands are granted by the federal government, a federal question of course is involved, and the rule adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In the determination of the present controversy it appears that the court excluded certain of the higher tides which under the federal rule should have been included.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The appellants contend that the position taken by the respondents and by the trial court is in furtherance of a rule which is new and novel, and that the true method of determining \u201cordinary high water-mark\u2019\u2019 is the line left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>by the water along the shore. This contention, however, does not seem to be supported by the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\">In 1908, in the case of <em>Eichelberger </em>v. <em>Mills Land &amp; Water Co., </em>9 Cal. App. 628 [100 Pac. 117], in considering the finding made by the trial court, the language used is as follows : \u201cThis is not a finding as to the width of the tract, for the reason that neither the point of extreme reach of the wash of the waves, nor the highest point of tide level constitutes the boundary line of lands bordering on the ocean. The law takes notice of three kinds of tides, namely: 1. The high spring tides, which are fluxes of the sea, and those tides which happen at the two equinoctials; 2. The spring tides which happen every month at the full and change of the moon; 3. The neap or ordinary tides which happen at the change and full of the moon twice every twenty-four hours.\u201d (Citing authorities.) \u201cTidelands are such as are covered and uncovered by the flow and ebb of the ordinary neap tides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In <em>Forgeus </em>v. <em>County of Santa Cruz, </em>24 Cal. App. 193 [140 Pac. 1092], where the court held that the determination of the ordinary high-water mark was a question of fact, and that the line determined by the United States Geodetic Survey might be taken into consideration, it was held, also, that the term \u201cordinary high-water mark\u201d meant the limit reached by the neap tides, that is, those tides which happen between the full and change of the moon twice in every twenty-four hours (citing authorities), and then refers to the Eiehelberger case, <em>supra, </em>as follows: \u201cto the extent that it is in point at all, supports the position of appellant, inasmuch as it is held that a tract of land described as bordering upon the Pacific Ocean is delimited by \u2018the line to which the flow of the water reaches at ordinary or neap tide, unaffected by wind or wave, not the line of extreme high tide nor extreme reach of the wash of the waves\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In <em>F. A. Hahn Co. </em>v. <em>City of Santa Cruz, </em>170 Cal. 436 [150 Pac. 62], the court said: \u201cThe high-water mark which defines the limit of the State sovereignty is the usual or ordinary high-water mark. By that designation we mean the limit reached by the neap tides, that is, those tides which happen between the full and change of the moon twice in every twenty-four hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In 62 C. J., page 951, \u201ctideland\u201d is described as follows: \u201cIn the usual meaning of the term, land between the lines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>of the ordinary high and low tides, covered and uncovered successively by the ebb and flow thereof; land covered and uncovered by the ordinary tides; land over which the tide ebbs and flows; land which is daily covered and uncovered by water by the ordinary ebb and flow of normal tides; land usually overflowed by the neap or ordinary tides; such land as is affected by the tide, that lies between ordinary high-water mark and low-water mark, and which is alternately covered and left dry by the ordinary flux and reflux of the tides; that portion of the shore or beach covered and uncovered by the ebb and flow of ordinary tides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\">In <em>Otey </em>v. <em>Carmel Sanitary Dist., </em>219 Cal. 310 [26 Pac. (2d) 308], the latest expression of our Supreme Court as to the meaning of \u201cordinary high-water mark\u201d is thus worded: ' \u2018 Ordinary high-water mark is the limit reached by the neap or twice a day tides\u201d (citing authorities).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">In 26 California Jurisprudence, page 321, section 536, the term \u201chigh-water mark\u201d is thus defined: \u201cThe high-water mark, which defines the limit of the state sovereignty, is the usual or ordinary high-water mark, that is, the limit reached by the neap tides, or those tides which happen at the change and full moon, twice in every twenty-four hours, rather than the monthly spring or extraordinary tides. That is to say, it is the line which the flow of the water reaches at ordinary or neap tide unaffected by wind or wave, not the line of extreme high-tide, nor the extreme reach of the wash of the waves, that constitutes the boundary line of a tract bordering on the ocean or other tidal waters. How far the tide reaches is a question of fact. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">As we have seen in the case of <em>Forgeus </em>v. <em>County of Santa Cruz, supra, </em>the United States Geodetic Survey may be taken into consideration in determining the height of the tide. In all the cases which we have cited the California rule is that the mean of the neap tide shall be taken into consideration in determining the high-water mark; that is, it is the mean level of the tide, and not merely the wash of the waves or the run of the sea-water upon the coast. Every case gives exactly the same definition,\u2014mean level of the neap tides. No consideration whatever is given to the wash of the waves or the reach or the run of the sea-water upon the coast. Such movements of the sea are not considered in determining the height of the tide. In other words, the run or reach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>sea-water does not measure the height of the tide. Nor does the run, roll or reach of the waves constitute the measure of the rise of the tide. Likewise, tide-water is confined to the level of the rise of the tide, and not to the run or reach of the waters caused by the waves or swell of the ocean.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\">In the case of <em>Borax Consolidated Co. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>296 U. S. 10 [56 Sup. Ct. 23, 80 L. Ed. 9], the rule is thus stated: '\u2018 The tideland extends to the high-water mark. (Citing a number of cases.) This does not mean, as petitioners contend, a physical mark made upon the ground by the waters; it means the line of high-water as determined by the course of the tides. By the civil law the shore extends as far as the highest waves reach in the winter. (Citing authorities.) But by the common law, the shore \u2018is confined to the flux and reflux of the sea at ordinary tides\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The opinion in this case quotes largely from the language of certain English cases, but finally adopts the rule for determining the line of demarkation ascertained by the Geodetic Survey, taking the mean of the tides over a considerable period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In fixing the rule that should be followed in determining the limit of a federal grant, the court used the following language: \u2018\u2018In determining the limit of the Federal grant, we perceive no justification for taking neap high tides, or the mean of those tides, as the boundary between upland and tideland, and for thus excluding- from the shore the land which is actually covered by the tides most of the time. In order to include the land that is thus covered, it is necessary to take the mean high tide line, which, as the Court of Appeals [74 Fed. (2d) 901] said, is neither the spring tide nor the neap tide, but a mean of all the high tides. In view of the definition of the mean high tide, as given by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, that \u2018Mean high water at any place is the average height of all the high waters at that place over a considerable period of time, \u2019 it appears in that case that the court considered a period of time covering slightly more than eighteen years. It further appears, however, that with the datum plane of the Geodetic Coast Survey being available, the mean high-tide level can be ascertained within the limits of what we may call \u2018reasonable time\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">From what we have said, it seems to us clear that \u2018\u2018ordinary high-water mark\u201d means just as the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>held, the ascertaining of the mean rise of the tide, and a horizontal line projecting therefrom to the shore, and that the run or wash of the waves, or reach of the .water caused by the waves or swell of the ocean, has nothing to do with determining the \u201cordinary high-water mark\u201d, as determined by the rise of the tide. In other words, there is a clear distinction between mere sea-water and tide-water.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">In the instant case it appears that the trial court erred in not taking into consideration all the tides in fixing the actual mean rise thereof. However, as the appellant is not entitled to a reversal of the judgment, and the plaintiff has not appealed from the judgment, and the action is not one to quiet title, we do not find any necessity for remodeling the findings of the trial court and the entering of a corrected judgment. The main issue involved is the one which we have determined, to wit: The method of determining what is meant by the terms \u201cordinary high-water mark\u201d. That being all that is really involved in this appeal, we think the judgment should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Pullen, P. J., and Thompson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">A petition by intervener and appellant to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on April 14, 1938. Houser, J., voted for a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
