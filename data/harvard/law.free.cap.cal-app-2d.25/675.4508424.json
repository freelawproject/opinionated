The clerk\u2019s and reporter\u2019s transcripts were filed July 28, 1937. Thereafter the parties entered into a stipulation taking the ease off calendar, in the hope of making settlement. This court has waited sufficiently. There is no opposition, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>(In re Yahne, </em>193 Cal. 386 [224 Pac. 452] ; <em>In re Wignall, </em>193 Cal. 387 [224 Pac. 452].)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
