He demurred to the indictment on the ground that the offenses charged in the indictment were barred by the <em>ex post facto </em>provisions of the Oregon and federal constitutions. The court overruled the demurrer, and defendant appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The offenses were committed on January 9, 1991. Defendant was originally indicted under the \u201cscheme or network\u201d offense subcategory language of the sentencing guidelines. OAR 253-04-002(3), Appendix 4. On February 6, 1991, we held that the \u201cscheme or network\u201d language was unconstitutionally vague. <em>State v. Moeller, </em>105 Or App 434, 806 P2d 130, <em>rev dismissed </em>312 Or 76, 815 P2d 701 (1991). In response to <em>Moeller, </em>the legislature enacted a new sentencing scheme for drug offenses in Oregon Laws 1991, chapter 690, which is codified at ORS 475.996. It establishes the requirements for classifying violations of ORS 475.992 in different crime seriousness categories. The legislation became effective July 25, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Under the original \u201cscheme or network\u201d offense subcategory, a DCS conviction was enhanced from a crime seriousness category 4 to a category 8 offense; a PCS conviction was enhanced from a category 1 to a category 6. Under Oregon Laws 1991, chapter 690, DCS is classified as a category 8 crime if it involves a \u201csubstantial quantity\u201d of a controlled substance or if it is a \u201ccommercial drug offense,\u201d as defined by the law. Possession of more than the described quantity of seven listed controlled substances is classified as a category 6 offense. In the absence of these offense subcategories, a controlled substance felony under ORS 475.992 is classified as category 4 if it involves delivery or category 1 if it involves possession only.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The state moved to dismiss the original indictment that alleged that defendant\u2019s acts were part of a \u201cscheme or network.\u201d It then re-indicted him under offense subcategory provisions of the newly enacted statute, charging that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>offenses were \u201ccommercial drug offenses\u201d and involved a \u201csubstantial quantity\u201d of a controlled substance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">An <em>ex post facto </em>law is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">\u201cone that retroactively applies to events that occurred before the law was enacted. It criminalizes acts that were lawful when committed or makes an act a greater crime than when it was committed, changes the elements of the crime or deprives the defendant of a defense, permits conviction on lesser or different evidence than was previously required or increases the quantum of punishment for the crime.\u201d <em>State v. Burke, </em>109 Or App 7, 11, 818 P2d 511 (1991), <em>rev den </em>312 Or 589 (1992).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument is that, until the effective date of Oregon Laws 1991, chapter 690, there was no constitutionally valid category 8 crime of DCS or category 6 crime of PCS. According to defendant, the effect of the 1991 enactment was to create those crimes for the first time. Therefore, as applied to him, the 1991 legislation is an <em>ex post facto </em>provision, because it makes his acts greater crimes than when committed and increases the quantum of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The <em>ex post facto </em>clause of Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution is applied similarly to the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the federal constitution. <em>See State v. Gallant, </em>307 Or 152, 764 P2d 920 (1988); <em>State v. Wille, </em>115 Or App 47, 839 P2d 712 (1992), <em>rev allowed </em>315 Or 311 (1993). The Supreme Court has answered defendant\u2019s contentions adversely to his position in <em>Dobbert v. Florida, </em>432 US 282, 97 S Ct 2290, 53 L Ed 2d 344 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">In <em>Dobbert, </em>the capital punishment sentencing scheme in effect when the defendant committed murder was later declared unconstitutional. Under that scheme, the death penalty was \u201cpresumed\u201d unless the jury, in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>unbridled discretion, recommended mercy. The Florida legislature then enacted a different capital punishment sentencing scheme based on aggravating and mitigating factors. That scheme passed constitutional scrutiny. The defendant argued that the <em>ex post facto </em>clause prohibited application of the new statute to his crimes. The Supreme Court rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments, holding that the change in the new statute was procedural and ameliorative and did not increase the quantum of punishment attached to the crime. 432 US at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The defendant also argued that there was no death penalty when he committed the crimes, because the statute in effect was later declared unconstitutional. The Supreme Court summarily dismissed his contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\u201c[T]his sophistic argument mocks the substance of the Ex Post Facto Clause. Whether or not the old statute would, in the future, withstand constitutional attack, it clearly indicated Florida\u2019s view of the severity of murder and of the degree of punishment which the legislature wished to impose upon murderers. The statute was intended to provide maximum deterrence, and its existence on the statute books provided fair warning as to the degree of culpability which the State ascribed to the act of murder.\u201d 432 US at 297.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Likewise, Oregon Laws 1991, chapter 690, does not violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clauses. It did not create a greater crime or enhance the penalty. The elements of the crimes of DCS and PCS under ORS 475.992 are the same. The 1991 legislation controls only the sentencing factors that ORS 135.711 requires the indictment to allege. <em>See State v. Lark, </em>113 Or App 458, 833 P2d 1286, <em>rev allowed </em>314 Or 727 (1992). As the Supreme Court recently noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">\u201cThe only function of the \u2018scheme or network\u2019 allegation * * * was to move up the underlying drug offenses on the \u2018crime-seriousness\u2019 scale <em>for sentencing purposes. </em>Although the state is required to plead specially in the indictment any offense-subcategory fact on which it seeks to rely to enhance an offense for sentencing purposes, such an allegation is required <em>in addition to </em>the allegations of the elements of the underlying offense. ORS 135.711.\u201d <em>State v. Ferrell, 315 Or 213, 221, </em>843 P2d 939 (1992). (Emphasis in original; footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The 1991 legislation also did not enhance the quantum of punishment for a conviction of DCS or PCS. Under the \u201cscheme or network\u201d provision, the maximum penalty that could be imposed on a conviction for DCS was within category 8 and for PCS was within category 6. Those penalties apply under Oregon Laws 1991, chapter 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">\u201cScheme or network\u201d aggravated the seriousness of the drug offenses of manufacture, delivery or possession. In <em>State v. Moeller, supra, </em>105 Or App at 441, we held that the phrase was unconstitutionally vague because it was \u201csusceptible to an abundance of possible meanings and applications, all or none of which may be the intended ones.\u201d Oregon Laws 1991, chapter 690, was enacted to provide specific notice of what conduct would support an enhanced sentence for those crimes. As in <em>Dobbert, </em>the new legislation provides defendants with more protection. The court did not err in overruling defendant\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\"> Defendant challenges only his conviction and sentence in CA A72350.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\"> Although defendant was charged with both DCS and PCS and argues that the court erred in overruling his demurrer, his argument primarily addresses the DCS charge. Count 2 of the indictment, which alleged the PCS offense, originally included the allegation that it was a \u201ccommercial drug offense.\u201d That factor would have authoiized a category 8 treatment of the conviction, greater than that authorized under \u201cscheme or network.\u201d The prosecutor conceded that the <em>ex post facto </em>clause barred retroactive application of \u201ccommercial drug offense\u201d and moved to strike that allegation from the indictment. Defense counsel concurred. After trial, the court merged the two convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
