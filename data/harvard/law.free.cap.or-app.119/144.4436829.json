ORS 164.225. He was sentenced on four separate cases in one sentencing proceeding. His placement on the criminal history scale was F for the first conviction. The court then used that conviction to enhance his criminal history to C. Defendant is correct that that was error. <em>State v. Bucholz, </em>113 Or App 705, 834 P2d 456 (1992), <em>rev allowed </em>315 Or 311 (1993); <em>State v. Seals, </em>113 Or App 700, 833 P2d 1344 (1992). However, the error requires no remedial action. The challenged sentence is concurrent to a 24-month term of imprisonment in a separate case. <em>State v.
