The fact of bankruptcy and the proving of the plaintiff\u2019s claim should have been pleaded in bar, or a stay of proceedings obtained.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-12\">Contract by Marshall N. Cutter and Benjamin F. Parker upon a joint and several bond to dissolve an attachment conditioned to pay a judgment within thirty days. The case was heard in the Superior Court upon the following agreed statement of facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-13\">\u201c The writ was dated March 12,1873. The defendant, Evans, was a surety upon the bond, and George C. Angel\u00ed was principal, and the date of the bond was June 13, 1870. The original action, in which the attachment was made and the bond given, was brought in the Superior Court, for goods sold and delivered. Judgment, was recovered against Angel\u00ed in that action, at January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>term 1871, and has never been satisfied or reversed. The defendant offered to prove certain facts which plaintiffs objected tc as incompetent and immaterial; but if the same are competent and material, the following is to be taken as a true statement thereof:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-4\">\u201c At July term, 1870, pending the above original action, James Sumner, an attorney at law, appeared and filed an answer therein for the defendant Angel\u00ed. Thereafter, on September 27, 1870, Angel\u00ed was adjudicated a bankrupt, under the laws of the United States, in the District Court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts, and on the same day, Charles G. Keyes, Angell\u2019s solicitor in bankruptcy, entered his name in said action, with Sumner\u2019s name, upon the clerk\u2019s docket, as of counsel for defendant, and made an oral suggestion of defendant\u2019s bankruptcy, which the clerk noted in pencil upon the docket, Sumner having been notified by said Angel\u00ed to withdraw from the case. Keyes\u2019s name was never withdrawn. No motion or paper touching the bankruptcy was filed in this case. The plaintiffs put the action upon the trial list for January term, 1871. In January or February, 1871, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel met Sumner upon the street, and said to him, \u2018 I suppose you have no objection now to our having judgment in the Angel\u00ed case.\u2019 And Sumner said \u2018No.\u2019 About the first day of March following, the case was reached upon the trial list, and plaintiffs were in\" court and said they were ready, and defendant not appearing, plaintiffs moved for a default, which was allowed. Ten days afterwards, on March 11, judgment was entered upon the default, on motion of the plaintiffs. In October, prior to the default and judgment, the first meeting in bankruptcy of Angell\u2019s creditors was held, and one of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel chosen assignee; and at the same meeting plaintiffs proved their claim, and the same was allowed , and plaintiffs appear upon the record of the bankrupt court as creditors who have proved their claim. Within thirty days after recovering the judgment, plaintiffs gave notice thereof in writing to Angel\u00ed, and made demand for payment; and immediately after the expiration of the thirty days, gave similar notice to, and made demand upon Evans. Shortly after this, on April 17,1871 Angel\u00ed filed a bill in the United States District Coun, taking for an injunction against- plaintiffs, and, by consent, plaintiffs were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>enjoined in the following terms: ' By consent in open court, ordered that injunction issue restraining respondents from levying their judgment mentioned in complainant\u2019s bill upon the person or estate of complainant, and from levying, or in any way proceeding in said judgment against the complainant, until the further order of the court.\u2019 Angell\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy was refused January 14, 1873, and the above injunction dissolved March 1,1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-4\">\u201c If these facts offered by defendant are competent, and afford a legal defence or ground for abating or barring this action, then such decree is to be made for the defendant as the court deems proper; otherwise, judgment to be entered for plaintiffs in one thousand dollars, the penalty of the bond.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">On the foregoing facts judgment was ordered for the plaintiffs, and the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-6\"><em>G. W. Morse, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apn\">No creditor proving his claim in bankruptcy shall be allowed to maintain any suit therefor, and all proceedings already commenced shall be deemed to be discharged and surrendered thereby; and no creditor whose debt is provable shall be allowed to prosecute any suit therefor until the question of the debtor\u2019s discharge is determined. II. S. Bankrupt Act of 1867, \u00a7 21. By the first clause, if the claim is proved pending suit, the proceeding \u201c shall be deemed to be discharged,\u201d and no action on the bankrupt\u2019s part is necessary. There need be no formal discontinuance, the proof itself discontinues the action. It is only when the claim is provable and has not been proved and the suit is to await bankruptcy proceedings that it is necessary to plead the bankruptcy. <em>Geikie </em>v. <em>Hewson, </em>5 Scott N.

But not having done either, the judgment rendered against him was lawful and valid, and in the absence of fraud or collusion (of which the case affords no evidence) was conclusive both against him and against the surety on his bond to dissolve the attachment. <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Maloney, </em>105 Mass. 90. The injunction granted by the District Court of the United States, if it ever had any validity, was dissolved before the bringing of the present action. The result is that there must be <em>Judgment for the plaintiffs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
