Colburn, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5q\">The question here presented has not been directly decided in this Commonwealth. There is a <em>dictum </em>in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating </em>Liquors, 105 Mass. 595, which expresses the opinion that the rule of evidence is the same as in ordinary criminal cases ; but the point was not directly in issue in that case, and no ruling upon this point was given or refused in the court below. The proceeding is primarily a process <em>in rem </em>in which the Commonwealth, on the ground that the liquors, by their sale, are or are about to become a statutory nuisance, confiscates and destroys them. This is not done as a punishment for the crime of selling or intending to sell. That is another and distinct offence, for which there is an appropriate penalty, and the owner of the liquors is not exempt from that punishment by reason of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>seizure and confiscation of the property. If we consider the forfeiture as a punishment for the crime of keeping with intent to sell, we impose two distinct penalties, reached by two distinct processes, for the same offence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-4\">A forfeiture of property, under a proceeding against it specifically, differs essentially from a forfeiture in a proceeding against the owner directly. The latter is a fine, as a punishment or partial punishment, for an offence. The former is the exercise of a right of protection to society by the destruction of a thing liable to be dangerous to life, health or morals. Similar provisions exist for the forfeiture and destruction of obscene books; Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>165, \u00a7 16 5 St. 1862, <em>c. </em>168; and of diseased or unwholesome provisions and drugs. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>166, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 5. <em>Barnicoat </em>v. <em>Gun</em>powder, Thach. Crim. Cas. 596. <em>Trueman </em>v. <em>Gunpowder, </em>Ib. 14. 1 Bishop, Crim. Law, (5th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 821-829, 944. Generally where goods are forfeited by proceedings <em>in rem </em>the rules of law applicable to civil suits apply. Gen. Sts. c. 153, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6, 12,15,16. <em>Barnaeoat </em>v. <em>Gunpowder, </em>1 Met. 225.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">This is a statutory and not a common law forfeiture, which was a consequence of a judgment of conviction against a person. <em>The Palmyra, </em>12 Wheat. 1, 13, 15. The provision in the statute is that the liquor shall be forfeited, and not that the claimant or supposed owner shall forfeit the liquor. St. 1869, <em>e. </em>415, \u00a7 51 In bastardy complaints, which seem to partake more of the nature of criminal actions than seizure eases, the charge is proved by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Burleigh, </em>3 Allen, 479. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Makepeace, </em>103 Mass. 50.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b159-6\">Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATC\">A proceeding under the St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>415, for the forfeiture of intoxicating liquors illegally kept and intended for sale, is of a criminal nature. The statute requires that both in the complaint on oath by which the proceeding is commenced, and in the search warrant issued thereon, the place to be searched, the liquors to be seized, and the person by whom they are owned or kept and intended for sale, shall be particularly designated, and \u201c the offence fully, plainly and substantially described.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 44, 46. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, </em>13 Allen, 52. Notice is to issue to the person complained against as the keeper of the liquors seized, and to all other persons claiming any interest therein, to appear and answer the complaint and show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>cause why the liquors should not be forfeited; and \u201c time and opportunity for trial and defence shall be given to persons interested.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 48, 49, 50. If the person complained against, or any other person claiming an interest in the liquors appears, \u201che shall be admitted as a party on the trial; \u201d and whether there is any such appearance or not, the liquors are to be adjudged forfeited only upon satisfactory proof that they were owned or kept by the person alleged in the complaint, for the purpose of being sold in violation of law. \u00a7 51. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating </em>Liquors, 113 Mass. . If no person appears as a claimant, or judgment is rendered in favor of all who so appear, \u201c the cost of the proceedings shall be paid as in other criminal cases; \u201d if any person appearing fails to sustain his claim, judgment is to be rendered and execution issued against him for costs, and, in case of non-payment thereof, he is to be committed to jail, and not discharged until he has paid the same and the costs of commitment, or been imprisoned thirty days. \u00a7 54. From the judgment of a justice of the peace or police court, the person complained against, as well as any claimant whose claim is not allowed, has \u201c the same right of appeal, and to the same court, as if he had been convicted of a crime,\u201d first entering into a recognizance to the Commonwealth to prosecute his appeal and \u201c to abide the sentence \u201d of the court appealed to. \u00a7 55. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating </em>Liquors, 13 Allen, 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">It is upon the ground that these proceedings are in the nature of a criminal prosecution, that they have been held by this court not to be within the statute making the Commonwealth liable to costs \u201c in civil suits and proceedings; \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating </em>Liquors, 14 Gray, 375; and to be within the statute which allows the Commonwealth a right to peremptorily challenge jurors \u201cin all criminal cases.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating </em>Liquors, 107 Mass. 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The distinction between proceedings of this character, prosecuted exclusively on behalf of the Commonwealth, and those commenced in the name of an individual and carried on for his own benefit, as in <em>Barnacoat </em>v. Gunpowder, 1 Met. 225, and under the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>153, was pointed out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, </em>14 Gray, 375, and in <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Justices of Municipal Court, </em>103 Mass. 456, 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>It was therefore rightly said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating </em>liquors, 105 Mass. 595, that \u201c the intent to sell contrary to law, in which the whole criminality of the keeping consists, must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, according to the ordinary rule of criminal cases, before a decree of forfeiture can be had.\u201d The jury in the present case having been instructed otherwise, the <em>Claimant's exceptions must be sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
