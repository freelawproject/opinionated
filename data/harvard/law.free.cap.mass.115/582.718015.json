At the trial in the Superior Court, before Wilkinson, J., the following facts appeared:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-4\">The mortgagor signed the mortgage and notes by making his mark. The attesting witness, an attorney at law, who drafted the mortgage, testified that he witnessed the execution of the mortgage by the mortgagor, on September 22, 1856, but that bis recollection of the transaction was general; that he could not say whether the defendant asked him to attest the mortgage and notes or not; and could not say from his recollection whether or not the defendant knew that he signed his name as attesting witness, but that he made and witnessed the paper, in the usual course of business. The tenant contended that this testimony was not sufficient to prove the execution of the mortgage and notes. But the presiding judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-5\">The tenant also objected to the plaintiff\u2019s reading the mortgage in evidence, upon the gro\u00fand that it contained no description of the land, the only description being as follows: \u201c That tract of land this day conveyed by her [the mortgagee] to Daniel McKinney, and by Daniel McKinney conveyed to me by deed of this date.\u201d These deeds were not at that time on record. The mortgage did not name the town, county or state in which the land is situated, and the tenant objected to the introduction of evidence <em>aliunde </em>to show what land was meant to be conveyed by the mortgage. But the presiding judge overruled the objection, and allowed the demandant to introduce the deed from Mrs. Friel, the mortgagee, to Daniel McKinney, and the deed from Daniel McKinney to the tenant, which deeds contained a description of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-6\">The jury found a verdict for the demandant, and the tenant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b599-7\"><em>A.
