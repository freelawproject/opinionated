The only question here to be determined is, whether upon the facts in the case the defendant, who is the owner of the building, is liable. Had the building been leased to different ten&amp;rts, each one having a lease of different portions, all the questions would have been fully settled by the case above cited. But the defendant insists, that, as this was all leased to one tenant, the tenant had the full control of the entire building, and therefore the defendant is not liable. This might be so, if the accident had happened in consequence of any nuisance which the tenant had erected, or any change in the structure of the roof which he had made. But the roof is in the same condition as when the lease was made. The tenant has not reconstructed it, or in any way interfered with it, and by the terms of the lease he had no right to make any change, only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>make repairs, and then only to put it in as good condition as it was before. The lease provides what the tenant shall do, but does not provide for any change in the roof. The accident then did not happen by any neglect of duty on the tenant\u2019s part, but was occasioned by the shape or slope of the roof, and from the proximity of the building to the street. The owner alone being responsible for the shape or slope of the roof, is alone liable. <em>Shipley </em>v. <em>Fifty </em>Associates, <em>supra. </em>In this lease, the landlord reserved the right \u201c at all seasonable times to enter or send agents, into and upon the same,\u201d (to wit, the building,) \u201cto examine the condition thereof,\u201d therefore, \u201c he was not excluded from going upon the roof, and so altering its construction, that at all seasons of the year it should not produce any inconvenience or danger to travellers on the highway below.\u201d Again, if it is said that the defendant had parted with his entire control of the roof of the building, he is guilty of negligence in putting it beyond his control, in an unsafe condition, without providing that the tenant should put it in safe condition, or at least give him permission to so do, which he did not do in this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-4\"><em>J. P. </em>Healy, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF1\">The defendant had neither the duty nor the right to remove the snow from the roof, or to interfere in any way in the general management and care of the building. The plaintiffs therefore have no cause of action against him. Their remedy must be sought, if at all, against the tenant. <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Boylston Market </em>Association, 14 Gray, 249, and cases cited. <em>Boston </em>v. Worthington, 10 Gray, 496.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b104-5\">Ames, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUa\">It does not appear that the defendant had any con-</p>\n<p id=\"AKv\">nection with the injury complained of, except that he was the owner of the building in front of which it occurred. The whole of this building had been leased for a long term of years to a tenant who was in actual occupation at the time of the accident. By the terms of the lease, the tenant had bound himself to make certain specific alterations in the lower story of the building, and also to make at his own expense \u201c all needful and proper repairs, both internal and external, of the demised premises.\u201d The lessee was the occupant of the entire estate, and, as between himself and the public, was bound to keep the building in such a state of repair that the adjoining highway should be safe for the use of travellers thereon. \u201c It is the occupier who is <em>prim\u00e9 facie </em>liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>to third persons for damages arising from any defect.\u201d <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Boylston Market Association, </em>14 Gray, 249, and cases there cited. The control of the tenant included the roof of the building, as well as its interior, and it does not appear that he might not have cleared the roof of snow by the exercise of due care, or that he could not by proper precautions have prevented the accident. We cannot say upon this report that any neglect of duty, or any wrongful act, on the part of the defendant, was the cause of the injury. In <em>Shipley </em>v. <em>Fifty Associates, </em>101 Mass. 251, and 106 Mass. 194, it appeared that the roof was not in the control of the various occupants of the building, but of the owners, who were therefore held responsible for its condition. As the judgment of the court below does not appear to have been erroneous, it is therefore <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
