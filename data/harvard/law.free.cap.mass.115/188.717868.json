It is undoubtedly true, as was held in <em>Harvard College </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Boston, </em>104 Mass. 470, that such an assessment is, in its legal character, a tax; but, as was also said in that case, p. 483, \u201c In a covenant for the payment of taxes by a lessee, it is to be ascertained by construction what was contemplated by the parties in the use of the terms employed. Those terms are not necessarily to be taken in their strict legal signification.\u201d Taking the most favorable view for the plaintiffs, here is an assessment made only sixteen days before the expiration of the short term of the lease, and of an amount larger than the annual rent. It has never been held that the word \u201c taxes \u201d in a covenant in a lease embraces these assessments. In <em>Codman </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>104 Mass. 491, the lease was for a long term, twenty years; and in this case and in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Whittemore, </em>112 Mass. , the covenant was to pay \u201c all taxes and assessments.\u201d The word \u201c taxes,\u201d as used in the covenants in leases for short terms, means the ordinary annual taxes, and not extraordinary impositions or assessments \u201c in view of a permanently increased value of the estate by reason of a public improvement in its vicinity.\u201d And, when it is intended to embrace extraordinary rates, other and additional words are introduced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-6\">2. The assessment was not \u201c levied during the term.\u201d The order of September 30, 1872, was under the St. of 1871, <em>c. </em>382, | 2, and was a reassessment. Until this statute was passed there vas no power to increase or reduce or change an assessment for a betterment. By that section it was provided that all \u201c assessment upon real estate, invalid by reason of any error,\u201d &amp;c., may be remade. The assessment, therefore, of December 15,1870, was abrogated, and was never paid by the plaintiffs; and consequently they cannot recover for it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZX\">The words of the covenant in this case are less comprehensive than in the case of <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Pierce, ante, </em>186. But it was made while statutes were in force authorizing assess\u00bb ments for betterments similar to that here sought to be recovered. It must therefore be held to include assessments of this character, levied on the premises during the term. <em>Codman </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>104 Mass. 491. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>10 Johns. 96. <em>Astor </em>v. <em>Miller, 2 </em>Paige, 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The orders laying out the street and assessing the betterment were passed during the term of the lease. The order of September, 1872, did not lay a new assessment, but merely made a deduction from that formerly laid. For the balance of that assessment, therefore, <em>The plaintiffs must have judgment.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
