H. Chandler &amp; Co., of Boston, two car-loads of oats, and took railroad receipts therefor, in which Botsford, Hibbard &amp; Co. were named as the consignors and consignees. Botsford, Hibbard &amp; Co. indorsed on said receipts these words: \u201c Deliver Messrs. C. H. Chandler <em>&amp; </em>Co., or order, Botsford, Hibbard <em>&amp; </em>Co.,\u201d and drew on C. H. Chandler &amp; Co. two sight drafts for the price of each car of oats respectively, and attached said drafts to the receipts, and sent them to the Second National Bank of Boston for collection, and forwarded invoices of said oats to Chandler &amp; Co., who went to the bank, and accepted the drafts, April 14, 1871. On April 17, 1871, Chandler <em>&amp; </em>Co. called on the plaintiff, a commission merchant in Boston, with the invoices of the two car-loads of oats, and showed them to him, and said the drafts and receipts for the oats were at the Second National Bank, and were due that day ; and they requested the plaintiff to go to said bank, and pay the drafts, and take the oats for himself, and said they would wait at the office and indorse the receipts over to the plaintiff on his return from the bank, and if after the plaintiff sold the oats there was any balance after taking out the amount of the drafts paid, and his commissions for selling, he was to account to them for it, which the plaintiff agreed to do. In pursuance of this agreement the plaintiff went to the bank, paid and took up the drafts and brought them to the plaintiff\u2019s office, with the receipts attached. The drafts were not paid at the bank in any other manner, and both the drafts and receipts were to be, and were retained by the plaintiff, and are still held by him. Chandler <em>&amp; </em>Co. indorsed these words on the receipts, viz.: \u201c Deliver J. J. Newcomb, or order, C. H. Chandler &amp; Co.,\u201d in presence of the plaintiff at his office when he returned from the bank, but neither of said drafts or receipts was ever delivered to Chandler <em>&amp; </em>Co., and the plaintiff furnished out of his own funds all the money to take up said drafts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-4\">About the time the oats were\" due at Salem, the plaintiff called on the agent of the defendant there, offered to pay the charges for freight, and requested the agent to deliver the oats to him, but was informed by the agent that the oats had been deliv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>ered a few days before to Beckford &amp; Dodge of Salem, and the defendant has never delivered the oats, or any part thereof, to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-4\">On April 4, 1871, Chandler <em>&amp; </em>Co. sold to J.

Ho receipt or invoice was shown to Beckford &amp; Dodge, and they had no knowledge or information of any claim of the plaintiff, or any other party, upon said oats.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-6\">Within a few days after April 15, both of said car-loads of oats arrived at Salem, and by order of Beckford &amp; Dodge, who claimed them as theirs, were sent by the defendant to Gloucester. Beck-ford &amp; Dodge showed the defendant\u2019s agent at Salem the bill of sale from Chandler &amp; Co., of the car-load purchased of them, but no bill of sale of the other car-load, and no receipt or order for delivery of either car-load. The other car-load was ordered to Gloucester by Beckford &amp; Dodge, by mistake, they supposing it to be a car-load which they were expecting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-7\">The plaintiff had no notice of any claim of Beckford &amp; Dodge, or of J. V. <em>&amp; </em>J.

They continued to be held by the bank, after the drafts had been accepted by Chandler <em>&amp; </em>Co., and until, at Chandler &amp; Co.\u2019s request, they were paid by the plaintiff, and the receipts, with the drafts still attached, were indorsed and delivered by Chandler <em>&amp; </em>Co. to the plaintiff, to secure the reimbursement to him of the amount so paid, and of his commissions for selling the goods. This indorsement and delivery to the plaintiff gave him at least a special property in the goods to the extent of such advances and commissions, as against Chandler &amp; Co., who never had any possession of the receipts, and, having no title or right of possession as against the plaintiff, could convey none to Beckford &amp; Dodge. <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>105 Mass. 272. <em>National Bank of Green Bay </em>v. <em>Dearborn, ante, </em>219. <em>Stollenwerck </em>v. <em>Thacher, ante, </em>224.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The case having been submitted to the court upon an agreed statement of facts, all objections to the form of action are <em>waived; </em>no point is made by the defendant of the amount for which judgment shall be rendered; and the case must be referred to an assessor to ascertain that amount, unless the parties agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
