The articles alleged to have been taken, were taken out from their places in the building by the defendant necessarily, in making the alterations which he agreed to make, and to the making of which the plaintiff\u2019s attorney assented ; there was room enough on the premises to allow the materials to remain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\">The attorney of the plaintiff testified on the trial of the case, that, some time after the repairs had been made, he asked the defendant whether or not he had taken away the granite plinth noth the glass therein set, as laid in the declaration; and the defendant replied that he had; that he, the attorney, demanded its return, and the defendant replied that he might have it by going for it to his, the defendant\u2019s locker; that the attorney refusing to go for it to the locker of the defendant, demanded that the defendant should return it to the premises from whence he had taken it, and defendant refused so to do ; that subsequently, after the lapse of about nine months, the same attorney demanded from the defendant the return of the said property, and that the de*\u00bbndpnt refused to return it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>This, with the following answers of the defendant to inter-* rogatories, was the only evidence of the taking and conversion offered by the plaintiff: \u201c Somebody demanded of me a piece of stone with a glass in it, and I told the party if there was any such stone in my locker, it belonged to me, but if he wanted it he could have it. Same party came second time, and I told him tie could have it by going for it to my locker, although it belonged to me.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-3\"><em>M.

Upon all matters of fact his determination was final, and every reasonable inference is to be made in favor of his finding. The evidence reported warranted the judge in deciding that the defendant\u2019s second refusal to return the property, like his first refusal, was merely a refusal to take it back to the plaintiff\u2019s house, and that the defendant did not claim any right to retain it as his own, and did no act amounting to a conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
