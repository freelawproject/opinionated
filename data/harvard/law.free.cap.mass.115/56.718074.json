Sts. <em>c. </em>115, \u00a7 11. The petitioner was the defendant in the case of <em>Gilman </em>v. Brown, tried in the Superior Court, Norfolk County, at September term, 1872, before Lord, J. The docket entries showed that a verdict was entered for the plaintiff September 25, 1872, that the defendant filed exceptions September 28, that the court adjourned without day October 2, and that during the term the following entry was made: \u201c Time extended for filing amended exceptions; \u201d that at September term, 1873, of said court, judgment was ordered on the verdict, and that the court adjourned without day October 10. The following was indorsed on the bill of exceptions: \u201c Disallowed, Otis P. Lord. This entry is made February 14, 1874.\u201d \u201c Filed February 21, 1874.\u201d The petition to prove the exceptions was filed in this court February 25, 1874, and it was admitted that the petitioner had complied with the formal requirements of the twenty-eighth rule of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-8\"><em>R. Lund </em>S. <em>W. </em>Harmon, for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABJ\">The exceptions sought to be proved are the same filed at September term, 1872. The presiding judge objected to some statements therein, and the exceptions- were amended and presented to him, and we were unable to get him to either allow them or disallow them until February 14, 1874.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-9\"><em>W. </em>Colburn, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b72-10\">Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW6\">The statute provides that \u201c if the justice disallows or fails to sign and return the exceptions, or alters any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>statement therein, and either party is aggrieved, the truth of the exceptions presented may be established before the Supreme Judicial Court upon petition.\u201d Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>115, \u00a7 11. The twenty-eighth rule of this court requires that the petition shall be filed \u201c within twenty days after notice of such refusal.\u201d Taking the most favorable view for the petitioner, it is clear that he fails to bring himself within the rule. Even if the judge before whom the case was tried in the court below did not fail to sign and return the exceptions before September term, 1873, it is clear that as at that term a final judgment was entered for the plaintiff, with the knowledge of the other party, as he admits, and no continuance entered for any purpose, there was then a failure to sign and return the exceptions, and the petitioner should have filed his petition within twenty days after that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
