On cross-examination he testified that he held a similar appointment for the town of Water-town ; that at and about the time of the alleged assault he worked in Watertown; that he boarded in Watertown, and slept sometimes while on duty in the police station in Newton, and that he had another room in Newton in which he sometimes slept and also a room at the house of his brother in Newton in which he kept his clothes, and that he claimed to be an inhabitant of Newton. Upon this evidence the counsel for the defendant asked the court to rule as a matter of law that Hinds could not legally be a police officer of Newton. But the court declined so to rule, and instructed the jury that to be a police officer of Newton he must oe an inhabitant of Newton, and left the question whether he was such inhabitant to the jury to determine, with instructions, to vhich no exception was taken, as to what constitutes an inhalv itant of a town.\u201d The defendant excepted to the above rulings.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-9\"><em>J.
