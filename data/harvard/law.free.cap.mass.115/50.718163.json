The defendant admitted that he entered into an agreement in writing with the plaintiff for the purchase of the property; that the plaintiff tendered a deed in due form and at the time agreed, and that he refused to accept the deed, and justified the refusal on the ground that the plaintiff was not seised in fee simple; that part of the estate was sold to the plaintiff\u2019s grantor by the executor of Thomas Emmons, under a license from the probate court, and that the notice of the sale was defective. This notice was as follows: \u201c Executor\u2019s sale of real estate by order of the Probate Court. To be sold at public auction, the land and buildings situated on Warren Street and Pleasant Street, in the city of Boston, late the residence of Thomas Emmons, deceased, being numbered 21 on said Warren Street, bounding northeasterly thereon, there measuring 39 feet <em>4^ </em>inches, more or less, and number 6 Pleasant Street, bounding southwesterly thereon 40 feet 9| inches, running through' from street to street; being bounded southerly by land of Warren Street Chapel on three lines 122 feet 6^ inches ; northerly and easterly by land of Charles Rollins, Charles H. Parker, and unknown persons, about 140 feet; whole premises containing 5057 square feet, more or less. Sale on premises, entering from Pleasant Street, on Wednesday, July 15 next, 4 o\u2019clock, p.

In a city the number of an estate on a street is relied upon in preference to the description. No one carries in his mind the points of the compass as to the situation of estates in relation to streets, or any other given boundary. The notice was further calculated to mislead because it read \u201c Sale on premises entering from Pleasant Street; \u201d that is from 6 Pleasant Street. The boundary by land of Warren Street Chapel, mentioned in the notice, does not cure the defect, for no one would suspect from the appearance of the building that it was used as a chapel.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b67-8\">Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak\">The notice identifies the premises to be sold so clearly that no one disposed to bid at the sale would have any difficulty in ascertaining what estate was meant. It describes the estate as \u201clate the residence of Thomas Emmons,\u201d and truly names the owners of estates bounding it on either side, and the streets on which it abuts at either end. The further description by numbers which designate estates on the opposite side of each street, being an impossible description, <em>falsa demonstrate, </em>does not render the notice invalid. <em>Decree for the plaintiff\u00bb.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
