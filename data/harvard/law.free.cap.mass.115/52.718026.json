S. St. 1867, c. 176, such a claim is not provable against his estate, under \u00a7 19 of said act, and he is not entitled to a continuance of the action to await the proceedings in bankruptcy, but the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\">Tort to recover damages for slander and malicious prosecution of the plaintiff. After verdict and before judgment the defendant filed his petition in the District Court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts, for proceedings in bankruptcy upon his estate, and was duly adjudicated a bankrupt under the bankrupt law of the United States. These proceedings having intervened between verdict and judgment, the defendant moved for a continuance of this action to await the proceedings in the Bankrupt Court, and the plaintiff moved for judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-7\">At the hearing in the Superior Court, <em>Lord, </em>J., overruled the motion of the defendant and allowed the motion of the plaintiff, and ordered' judgment to be entered on the verdict, to which order the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-8\"><em>B. E. Perry &amp; S. W. Creech, Jr., </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai8\">It is admitted that the claim is not a \u201c debt \u201d until judgment; but it is contended that it is a \u201cliability\u201d within the meaning of the fourth clause of \u00a7 19 of the bankrupt act, which is as follows : \u201c In all cases of contingent debts, and contingent liabilities contracted by the bankrupt, and not herein otherwise provided for, the creditor may make claim therefor, and have his claim allowed, with the right to share in the dividends, if the contingency shall happen before the order for the final dividend.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-9\"><em>A. Russ T. H. Tyndale, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b68-10\">Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAb\">The bankrupt act of 1867, <em>c. </em>176, \u00a7 19, declares, that no debts, other than those therein specified, shall be proved against the bankrupt\u2019s estate. The plaintiff\u2019s claim does not come within either of the specified classes. It is conceded that it was not \u201c a debt existing at the time of the adjudication of bankruptcy,\u201d because a claim for damages in an action of tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>does not become a debt by verdict before judgment. It was not a demand for or on account of goods taken or withheld, nor a liability upon any contract. The only \u201c contingent debts and contingent liabilities \u201d allowed to be proved are those \u201c contracted by the bankrupt.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action did not arise out of any contract, or any injury to property, but out of a personal tort. It was therefore not provable under the bankrupt act, and the provision of \u00a7 21 for a stay of proceedings has no application. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
