Plea the general issue, which was joined. At the trial in the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Court, before <em>Lord, </em>J., the jury were directed to find a verdict for the tenant, and the following facts were reported for the determination of this court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-4\">\u201c On September 5, 1870, the demandants commenced an action in the Superior Court against William D. A. Whitman, in which action all the real estate of Whitman in Suffolk County was attached on mesne process on the day aforesaid. Judgment was recovered in said action against Whitman, April 2, 1872, upon which judgment execution issued, by virtue of which the demanded premises (which were subject to a mortgage) were taken and sold at public auction by a deputy sheriff on May 18, 1872, these demandants becoming the purchasers. \u25a0 A deed of said premises in due form was executed by said deputy sheriff and delivered to the demandants, which deed was duly recorded. Mo question was raised as to the legality or validity of the above proceedings. The demandants thereupon rested their case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-5\">\u201cThe tenant offered in evidence a certified copy of-a paper from the office of the clerk of the Supreme. Judicial Court for Suffolk, purporting to bear date August 11,1871, and to be signed by George W. Searle, who was shown to have been at that time the attorney of record of the demandants in their aforesaid suit against Whitman.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The demandants objected to the admission of said copy on the ground that it was immaterial, and that it did not appear that Searle had sufficient or any authority to execute such instrument or to discharge said attachment, but the objection was overruled and the paper admitted. The tenant then offered in evidence a certified copy of a memorandum from the record of this attachment in the attachment book in the office of the clerk of the Supreme Judicial Court, which was admitted under the same objection.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The tenant also put in evidence a deed of the demanded premises from Whitman to Joseph F. Wilson, dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>December 17, 1870, and a deed of the same premises from said Wilson to the tenant, dated August 31,1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-4\">\u201c The demandants then offered to prove that Searle in discharging or attempting to discharge said attachment acted without any authority from them, without their knowledge and in fraud of their rights. The demandant Moulton was called and testified that he directed his attorney, the said Searle, to cause the real estate of said Whitman to be attached in the aforesaid suit, that he never authorized the discharge of said attachment, that said Searle never consulted or communicated with him in relation thereto, and that he had no knowledge of said attempted discharge until some time after it was made, and after said Searle had ceased to be his attorney in said suit. The other demandant, Thompson, was called, and the tenant admitted that he would testify to the same facts. The foregoing testimony of the demand-ants was objected to, but was admitted <em>cle bene esse.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">\u201c It is agreed between the parties that the only legal question raised or ruled upon was whether an attorney of record can discharge an attachment under the circumstances above testified to by Moulton, so that a subsequent purchaser without fraud on his part would take a good title. The presiding judge ruled that such discharge by the attorney of record would enable the defendant in the original action to give a valid title to the tenant, who it was agreed was cognizant of no fraud.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b54-6\"><em>R.
