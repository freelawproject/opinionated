The answer set up the defence of infancy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Lord, J., the jury found for the defendant, and the following bill of exceptions was allowed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\">\u201c The defendant, among other things, offered in evidence the baptismal records of St. Patrick\u2019s Parish, in the city of Boston (late Roxbury), in which was inserted the following entry: \u2018 1852, October 3, James, born the 2d inst., son of Lawrence McLaughlin and Ann, his wife; sponsors, John and Ann Tobin. (Signed) Thomas Lynch.\u2019 It was shown by the present priest of the parish, that Father Lynch died about three years ago; that said book was found in his house after his death by the witness, and has ever since been in his possession; that by the canons of the church, the priest is the proper officer to have the custody of it; that the witness succeeded Father Lynch as priest of the parish, and has continued the record; that Father Lynch was priest of the parish for thirty-five years; that the witness does not know his handwriting. He further testified in answer to questions by the presiding judge, that baptism is a sacrament in the Catholic Church, and that the priest is required by the canons of the church to record all baptisms ; that there is no particular rule fixing the time within which infants of confirmed catholics shall be baptized; but it is generally supposed that children will be baptized within nine or eleven days under pain of sin. The book was admitted in evidence against the objection of the plaintiffs. The defendant also offered in evidence a volume entitled \u2018 The Life of the Virgin Mary,\u2019 containing a record of births and deaths, &amp;c., purporting to be a record of the births and deaths in the family of Lawrence McLaughlin, the father of the defendant, James R.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">\u201c Lawrence McLaughlin testified that he kept a record of the births of his children on the fly-leaf of his wife\u2019s manual until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>about 1858, when, upon having the above volume presented to him, he copied said original record into the book offered, and after that time continued to enter births and deaths therein. He further testified that he made said entries in said first book just according to the truth, the same day the children were born; that they were correctly copied, and that said book is lost. The boob was admitted in evidence against the objection of plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-4\">\u201c The plaintiffs excepted to the admission of the above evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-5\"><em>A. </em>Cottrell, for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APnX\">cited, to the point that the baptismal record was not evidence of the age of the defendant: <em>Burghart </em>v. Angerstein, 6 C. &amp; P. 690; <em>Rex </em>v. Clapham, 4 C. &amp; P. 29; <em>The King </em>v. <em>North Petherton, </em>5 B. &amp; C. 508; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Trinity Church, </em>5 Watts &amp; S. 266; <em>Childress </em>v. <em>Cutter, </em>16 Mo. 24.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-6\"><em>W. F. Slocum, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b185-7\">Colt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHl\">Under the plea of infancy, the issue was whether the defendant was of age at the time of the promise declared on. To prove that he was not, the defendant was permitted to put in the entry of his baptism contemporaneously made by a Roman Catholic priest since deceased in a book which appeared to be a church record of baptisms, and which was produced from the proper custody. In <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>10 Allen, 161, this was held competent evidence for the purpose of proving the date of the baptism. It was treated as an entry made by a third person in the discharge of an official duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The plaintiffs contend that it was not admissible to prove the time of the defendant\u2019s birth. But assuming this to be so, the exception cannot be maintained, unless it affirmatively appears that the evidence was improperly used for that purpose. The date of the baptism, with the aid of other evidence tending to fix the defendant\u2019s age at that time, would become material, and the entry was competent to prove that date. We must presume that such evidence was in the case. The bill of exceptions indeed shows that the entry was offered in evidence \u201c among other things.\u201d If the entry was admissible for any purpose, the plaintiff has no ground of exception, unless the judge refused at the trial to limit its effect and permitted it to be used for a purpose for which it -was not competent. In the absence of anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>showing the contrary, it must he presumed that the proper limitation was given. A general objection to its admissibility will not be sustained; and where evidence is admitted which is competent when connected with other evidence, it is held to be no ground of exception unless it appears from the bill of exceptions that such other evidence was not introduced. <em>Liverpool Wharf </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>4 Allen, 22. <em>Burghardt </em>v. <em>Van Deusen, </em>4 Allen, 374, 377. <em>Merritt </em>v. Morse, 108 Mass. 270. <em>Earle </em>v. Earle, 11 Allen, 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The preliminary facts which must have been shown to make the record entry evidence at all, such as that the book was regularly kept by the proper official, was in his handwriting, and came from the proper custody, it was the province of the judge who presided at the trial to pass upon ; and his decision is conclusive, unless he saves the question on report, or it is brought up on exceptions which state the evidence upon which his finding is made. <em>Gorton </em>v. Hadsell, 9 Cush. 508. There is no attempt to revise his findings in this respect. And it does not appear that the record was erroneously admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">As to the second exception, the court must have found as fact that the original family record was lost; secondary evidence of its contents was therefore admissible. The copy produced with evidence of its accuracy was competent secondary evidence. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Mar den, </em>12 Pick. 169. <em>Pxceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
