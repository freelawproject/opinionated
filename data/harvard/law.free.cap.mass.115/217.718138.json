The plaintiffs do not allege that they have any easement or right of light and air across the front of the defendant\u2019s house, and could not have, except by grant or agreement intended for their benefit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number><em>Keats </em>v.

In the absence of any such grant or agreement, neither the interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 prospect, nor the general diminution of the value of their estate, by the building of the window, affords any ground for the interposition of a court of equity, unless it amounts to a nuisance, which cannot be seriously predicated of the injury alleged in the bill. <em>Attorney General </em>v.
