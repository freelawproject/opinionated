The bill of exceptions was certified by the presiding judge to be conformable to the truth and was allowed. Afterwards during the same term the defendant moved in arrest of judgment, and assigned as one of the grounds, \u201c that a verdict, as in this case, in these words, and in form as follows: <em>\u2018 </em>Each guilty of an assault without intent \u2019 is, in fact, a verdict of not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>guilty.\u201d This motion was also overruled, and the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-4\"><em>D.
