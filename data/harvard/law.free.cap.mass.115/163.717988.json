At and before the date of the order Harriman owed the plaintiffs the amount of said order. At the time said order was drawn and the defendant wrote on it as above stated, Harriman had made a contract, referred to in said order, with the defendant to build and complete for the defendant a house in Randolph, according to certain terms and specifications mentioned in said contract. Harriman never performed said contract, nor completed the house, but failed, neglected and refused so to do, without any excuse on his part, and without any fault on the part of defendant; but the defendant, on account of such failure, was damaged some $800, which said Harriman still owes defendant. A large amount of work was done on the house by the defendant after said failure, and the house was occupied by Seth A. Thayer as a residence a short time before this action was brought, and has been occupied by him ever since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u201c There was nothing due from the defendant to Harriman, bu he had been overpaid when said order was drawn by Harriman and signed as above by the defendant, but Harriman was at that time at work upon the house towards the performance of said contract, and there was never anything due Harriman from the defendant after said order was signed as above by the defendant.

The order refers to the contract subsisting between Harriman and the defendant. It is made payable on the completion of the house which Harriman was then building in Randolph, for the defendant, and it directs that when paid it is to be charged to Harriman on account of that contract. The order looks to the future; to work to be done and to materials to be supplied by the drawer for the use and benefit of the acceptor according to contract. The acceptance was an agreement to the request expressed in the order, and as that was contingent, the acceptance was an undertaking on the same contingency. Nothing was to be paid until the building should be finished. The direction to charge the payment to Harriman on account of that contract, and the terms of the order generally, are in their legal effect equivalent to a designation of a time of payment, and also of the fund out of which the payment was to be made, both of which were to depend upon the completion of the house by Harriman, according to his contract. As he has not fulfilled his contract, the time of payment never arrived, and the fund which was expected to accrue, and from which payment was to be made, never existed. The defendant therefore is not liable on his acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">In <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Wolfendale, </em>105 Mass. 401, which is relied upon by the plaintiffs, the acceptance was given in consideration of lumber furnished to the contractor to be used in building the house for the acceptor. And the terms of the order contained no reference to the building contract, but merely fixed the time of payment as the time when the building should be \u201c ready for occupancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\"><em>Judgment for </em>defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
