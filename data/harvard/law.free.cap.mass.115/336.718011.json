Among other proof offered to establish its case, the plaintiff was permitted to introduce, against the exceptions of the defendant, the record of the defendant town, kept under the provisions of the Sts. of 1863, <em>go. </em>65, 229, showing the enlistment of Thomas, as part of the quota of the defendant town, on August 9, 1862, for three years, and the payment to him of bounty by said town ; also, under exception, the General Order No. 26, dated July 7, 1862, of the Governor, calling for troops, and assigning quotas; also the discharge of Thomas from the service of the United States. The discharge was dated June 2, 1865, and stated that \u201c no objection to his being reenlisted is known to exist.\u201d On the margin of the paper, in red ink, was the following: \u201c The Adjutant General U. S. A. reports this soldier to have deserted April 6, 1863. The charge has not at this date been reversed. 2d Auditor\u2019s Office, Sept. 6,1871.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-4\">It appeared that the red ink writing in the margin had been added after the discharge had been originally granted, and in the possession of Thomas, and upon its return to Washington upon a pension application. The defendant objected to the admission of the paper, but it was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-5\">The defendant contended that Thomas had no military settlement, because he had been guilty of \u201c wilful desertion,\u201d and in support of this, offered the certificate, a copy of which appears in the margin,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and also a duly certified copy of the muster-roll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>of the company to which Thomas belonged, from February 28, 1863, to April 30, 1863. On this paper Thomas was reported as a deserter. The presiding judge refused to admit the certificate of the assistant adjutant general, but admitted the copy of the muster-roll.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-4\">It appeared in evidence that Thomas came home upon a furlough of eight days, granted February 24,1863, on account of the alleged sickness of his wife. On April 13, he was arrested at his home by a deputy sheriff, as a deserter, upon the authority of a letter from his colonel; from thence he was taken to Surgeon General Dale, then to Fort Independence, afterwards to the convalescent camp at Alexandria, and rejoined his regiment June 4, serving therein until discharged. It did not appear that he was ever tried for desertion or any other offence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-5\">The circumstances under which he remained at home, and his motives, were in controversy. The plaintiff offered evidence tending to show that he received an extension furlough from Surgeon General Dale on account of physical disability, and that he was taken to Boston about the time it expired; that he had made application through his attending physician for another extension, and that when taken to Surgeon General Dale he was examined and told by Dale that he was wrongfully arrested, and that he was not fit to go back to duty, and that in point of fact the soldier was in such a physical condition as to be entirely unfit to return. The defendant offered evidence to the contrary, tending to show that he had overstayed his furlough, that his sickness was feigned, and that he had wilfully deserted his duty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-6\">The articles of war were introduced; and Thomas testified that they were read to him, and that he understood them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-7\">The defendant asked the court to rule that intentional absence, without leave, from military service, constituted wilful desertion ; that the muster-roll in evidence furnished conclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>evidence of desertion. But the presiding judge declined so to rule, and instructed the jury as follows : \u201c That mere absence without leave is not sufficient to constitute the offence; that if Thomas had an extension furlough, which he believed gave him liberty to remain. at home, up to the time of his arrest, and remained at home under such belief, it is immaterial to this issue whether the furlough was regularly or irregularly granted; that if he remained at home independently of the furlough, and in violation of military regulations, with an honest belief that his state of health unfitted him for military duty, and with an intention to return to that duty as soon as he deemed himself able, then it would not be wilful desertion ; that to constitute this offence there must have been the intent, in known violation of his duty, to quit or abandon the service permanently, or at least for some indefinite time; that the muster-roll' and the entry thereon did not furnish conclusive evidence of wilful desertion, but was merely evidence to be weighed with other evidence in the case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-4\">If there was error in the admission or rejection of evidence, or in the other refusals or rulings, prejudicial to the defendant, the verdict may be set aside, otherwise, judgment on the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-5\"><em>J.

As, however, by the latter statute \u201c acts done and proceedings commenced \u201d are excepted from its operation, the present action is not affected thereby, it having been commenced some months previous to the passage of the repealing statute. It presents the question whether the pauper Thomas, for the expense of the support of whom the action was brought, had acquired under the earlier statute, in the defendant town, what is sometimes called a military settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The record of the defendant town kept in pursuance of the Sts. of 1863, <em>cc. </em>65, 229, was of the nature of a public record, and therefore competent evidence of what was required to be contained in it, and the general order of the Governor of the Commonwealth was also competent evidence of the call for troops under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the acts of Congress, and the assignment of its quota to the defendant town, although that this call was made and quotas were assigned to all the towns, were historical facts recognized by the terms of the St. of 1865, <em>e. </em>230. <em>Wayland </em>v. Ware, 104 Mass. 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The certificate of discharge was also competent for the purpose of showing that Thomas did not leave the service otherwise than by reason of an honorable discharge. The defendant did not ask for any ruling as to the effect to be given to the indorsements upon it subsequently made at the office of the Adjutant General of the Army of the United States; but objected generally to its admissibility apparently for any purpose. What effect was given to these by the presiding judge is not shown by the exceptions; but its admissibility was not affected by indorsements, which, without the consent of the soldier, had subsequently been placed upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In <em>Fitchburg </em>v. Lunenburg, 102 Mass. 358, reported since this cause was tried, it was held that a certificate in due form from the proper military officer of an honorable discharge from the military service of the United States was conclusive evidence of the cause and manner of leaving the service by a soldier, and that evidence, which in that case had been offered of the soldier\u2019s previous absence from duty and of his arrest for \"desertion, unaccompanied by any evidence that he had been convicted or sentenced therefor, was incompetent, and rightly rejected. Under this decision much of the evidence which was admitted for the defendant was immaterial, and it remains only to be seen whether it was in any way prejudiced as to the true issue of the case by the refusal to give the instructions requested, or to receive such other evidence as was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The defendant requested the court to rule that the rolls admitted were conclusive evidence of desertion. Upon the muster-roll, which is made every two months, the reasons and time of absence of each soldier are required to be entered, (Articles of War, Art. 13, U. S. St. of 1806, <em>c. </em>20,) and entry of the word \u201c deserted \u201d by the commanding officer of the company, who is then to account for all the men of his command, against the name of the soldier, is in the nature of a charge against such soldier of the crime of <em>desertion; </em>but it is not an adjudication that he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>guilty of the offence, which, as it is one of the gravest offences known to the military law, can be made only by a court martial. The court, therefore, in permitting this evidence of the entry upon the muster-roll to be weighed with the other evidence in the case upon the question of wilful desertion, gave it a consideration at least as great as that to which it was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The defendant also requested the court to instruct the jury that intentional absence without leave from the military service constituted wilful desertion. Upon this point the instructions were correct. By the Articles of War, <em>supra, </em>there are defined the two offences of desertion (Article 20) and absence without leave, (Article 21,) which are treated by the punishments prescribed as offences of very different grades. By the use of the term \u201c wilful,\u201d the Legislature did not, in our opinion, intend to do anything more than to mark and emphasize that distinction. Mere absence without leave does not constitute the offence of desertion under the Articles of War, or of \u201cwilful\u201d desertion. When committed by a soldier it is a violation of duty, but as it is accompanied always by an intention to return and to submit himself necessarily to punishment, if it has been incurred, it is a very different offence from that of abandoning the service permanently or for some indefinite time, unaccompanied by an intent to return, which constitutes desertion. In the instruction of the presiding judge this distinction was clearly and accurately pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The certificate from the Adjutant General\u2019s Office, signed by one of the assistant adjutants general, of what appeared from the records of that office, did not profess to be a transcript of the records, but was simply a statement of what the certifying officer, under whose hand it was, deemed to be shown by them; and was rightly rejected, even if otherwise competent, for the reason that it was clearly possible that the officer might have been mistaken as to the true conclusions to be drawn from the records. <em>Oakes </em>v. <em>Hill, 14 </em>Pick. 442. <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>20 Pick. 345. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
