That the St. of 1869, c. 415, and the acts in addition thereto, prohibiting the manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>turc and sale and the transporting for sale of intoxicating liquors, impair the obligation of the contract contained in the charter of said company, and are in violation of the Constitution of the United States, and not therefore binding, on said company. 3. That the said company could lawfully manufacture, own and transport said ale, and the vessels containing the same, for the purpose of being sold by it at its place of business in Boston; and that therefore the seizure of said ale and vessels was wrongfully made, and that they should be returned to said claimant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-4\">The presiding judge declined to give such instructions, but instructed the jury, that as it was agreed and admitted that the said company was the manufacturer and owner of the ale at the time of said seizure, and was then transporting the same by its agent, O\u2019Connell, for the purpose of sale in this Commonwealth, contrary to the provisions of the St. of 1869, it was lawfully seized, and was liable to forfeiture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-5\">The jury found that the ale described in the complaint, and seized upon the warrant, was at the time of the making of the complaint deposited and kept by O\u2019Connell, as agent of the claimant, in the vehicle named in the complaint, for the purpose of being sold in this Commonwealth, contrary to the provisions of the St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>415.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-6\">The claimant excepted to the foregoing rulings and instructions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-7\"><em>F.

We do not think this position is tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">By its charter \"the claimant is a private manufacturing corporation, with the same power as a natural person to do that which its charter authorizes ; and by implication with the same power as an individual to deal with and sell its property so manufactured. But the authority of the legislature over the property or the use of the property of a corporation is not lost because no power is reserved to repeal or amend its charter. Any laws the sovereign power may find it necessary or salutary to enact, regulating, controlling, restricting or prohibiting the sale of a-particular kind of property for the general benefit, apply as well to the property of corporations, like the claimant, as to individuals. Such laws are in the nature of police regulations, and individuals and corporations are alike subject to them. Indeed all property is held subject to such restriction, and it is immaterial that the restriction is imposed after the property is acquired or becomes valuable, or after the charter is granted, or before it became necessary in the judgment of the legislature to pass a law on the subject. Every such law limits, restrains, impairs, and in some cases destroys the uses, which were previously enjoyed, of the property so made the subject of legislation, but the extent to which it may do so does not affect the validity of such laws, or their equal application to all owners of such property. They are presumed to be passed for the common good, and to be necessary for the protection of the public, and cannot be said to impair any right, or the obligation of any contract, or to do any injury in the proper and legal sense of these terms. <em>Commonwealth </em>v.
