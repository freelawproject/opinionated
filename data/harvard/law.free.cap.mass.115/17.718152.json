Trial in the Su perior Court before Putnam, J., who, after a verdict for the plaintiff,' allowed the following bill of exceptions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-7\">\u201c The evidence introduced by the plaintiff to show ordinary care on his own part and negligence on the part of the defend ant\u2019s servant, was as follows: The plaintiff testified: \u2018 I keep store on Federal Street. On Friday, September 8, 1871, at quarter past seven o\u2019clock in the morning, I was going to my store and crossing Federal Street. I looked both ways, and hat\u2019 t me to go through. A wagon going very fast knocked me down. The shaft hit me on the head and the back wheel went over me. I knew nothing till I was taken into the house.\u2019 <em>Cross-examination. </em>\u2018 I looked up and down the street, both ways, before 1 undertook to cross, but saw no carriage. I could see a quarts of a mile up the street in the direction from which the wagon came. I saw the wagon at the same time it knocked me down. The street is paved. I did not hear the wagon nor the men. I was a few minutes crossing. I was right in the middle of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>street, in the horse car track, when I was struck. I was moving, not standing still, looking straight ahead.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-4\">\u201c Dennis J. Callahan testified: \u2018 I was at my store, 273 Federal Street, and saw the mail wagon coming with unusual speed. Saw the plaintiff crossing. The team struck him and knocked him down. The team went the length of this room before it stopped. I can\u2019t tell the rate of speed, but the wagon was going faster than usual. The plaintiff was almost in the middle of the street when I saw him, walking leisurely. Was going at an ordinary rate. I am certain he was not standing still when he was struck. The wagon was going pretty fast,\" ten miles an hour. Have seen the same wagon every morning for a year and a half, and never saw it going so fast as on this occasion. After striking plaintiff, driver did not slacken his speed until after going the length of this court room. Did not hear the driver shout at all.\u2019 <em>Cross-examined. </em>\u2018 I was near where the plaintiff crossed. I was two houses from there, and in the opposite direction from which the wagon was coming. The team was fifty yards up the street when I saw it coming. It did not make a great deal of noise. I can\u2019t tell how far I heard it.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-5\">\u201c James Dillon testified: \u2018 I was hanging out things at my store on Federal Street when the plaintiff was run over. The wagon could be seen forty or fifty yards before it reached the plaintiff, I first saw it ten or fifteen yards from the place where the man was run over, and after the crowd had collected about him, heard nothing from the driver. The wagon did not stop less than forty or fifty yards from the same. It was going unusually fast.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-6\">\u201c James Mahan testified: '1 saw the accident. I was standing op \u00ab\u00edfite East Street, looking down Federal Street. The team was coming pretty lively, eight or ten miles an hour. I saw the old man crossing. I don\u2019t suppose they saw him. I did not see him till he was hit. Wagon went about a hundred feet before it hauled up.\u2019 <em>Cross-examined. </em>\u2018 I was on the sidewalk, twenty-five or thirty feet off. Saw the team come into Federal Street from Broad Street. I saw and heard it four hundred or five hundred feet off. There were other people crossing and passing, but there was no other carriage. The wagon was rattling considerable. Did not hear men cry out; the wagon made noise enough to drown their voices.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u201c Phebe Schienfeldt testified: 6 The driver told me he saw the plaintiff six feet off.
