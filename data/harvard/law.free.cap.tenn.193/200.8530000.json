Chiee Justice Neil</author>\n<p id=\"Ai9\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\">The complainant filed his original bill in the chancery-court to collect damage for breach of an oral lease, or an oral contract to lease certain real estate, \u201cfor as long as the complainant wanted it.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">The defendants demurred to the bill on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\u201c(1) There is no equity on the face of the Bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">\u201c (2) Said Original Bill shows on its face that it seeks to enforce an oral or verbal contract, agreement or lease of land for more than one year in violation of the Statutes of Frauds as set forth in Section 7831 of the 1932 Code of Tennessee, which provides in part as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">\u201c \u2018No action shall be brought * * * upon any contract for the sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments or the making of any lease thereof for a longer term than one year * * * unless the promise or agreement upon which such action shall be brought or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writing and signed by the parties to be charged therewith or some other person by him there unto lawfully authorized.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The Chancellor sustained the demurrer and his reason for so doing is thus clearly stated: \u201cThe Court holds that the expression in the original bill on page 3, \u2018that the complainant could have said location as long as the complainant wanted it * * is equivalent to a life estate under Section 4 of the Statute of Frauds in Section 7831 of the 1932 Code of Tennessee, and is therefore not good unless the same has been reduced to writing. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The complainant appealed and the sole question made in the assignments of error is that the Chancellor erred in his decision and upon the grounds stated. In support of the assignment the counsel says: \u201c It is our conception of the law governing verbal agreements concerning the leasing of real estate that, where it is capable of being performed within a year, however indefinite it may be and regardless of the fact that it may extend over a period of years, the contract is valid; that the parties by their language must have made such a contract which by its own terms could not be terminated within a year to render it void. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The leading case cited is that of <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Arrington, </em>108 Tenn. 494, 68 S. W. 44, and which was reaffirmed in <em>Hight </em>v. <em>McCulloch, </em>150 Tenn. 117, 263 S. W. 794, 796, by Special Justice Malone, speaking for the Court as follows: \u2018\u2018The parol lease for one year was good under the statute of frauds, although it did not expire, according to its terms, for more than one year after the date of the parol contract to lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In <em>East Tennessee V. </em>&amp; <em>G. Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Staub, </em>75 Tenn. 397, the Court ruled that an oral promise by the railroad to pay an injured employee a certain sum of money per day, whether \u201cthe plaintiff labored or not\u201d, and \u201cretain plaintiff in the company\u2019s employ\u201d, was not void under the statute of frauds, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>We feel bound by tbe Court\u2019s construction of tbe statute in <em>Hight </em>v. <em>McCulloch, </em>supra, 263 S. W. at page 795, as quoted in tbis opinion. But tbe bolding in that case, and others cited on tbe brief, bas no application to tbe case at bar. In those cases tbe oral lease was for \u201ca term of one year\u2019\u2019, whereas in tbe present case tbe term is \u201cas long as tbe complainant wanted it.\u201d Tbe contract in <em>East Tennessee V. </em>&amp; <em>G. Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Staub, </em>supra, was not a contract for tbe <em>lease of land. </em>It is clear that Subsection 5 of Section 7831 was applicable in that case, it relating to contracts in general. In tbe case at bar tbe only applicable Section of 7831 is Subsection 4, which provides: \u201cNo action shall be brought: (4) upon any contract for tbe sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments, or tbe making of any lease thereof for a longer term than one year * * * \u201d unless the same is in writing, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Tbis Subsection of tbe Code provides against both an oral contract for tbe <em>sale </em>of land and an oral <em>lease </em>of land for \u201ca longer term than one year\u201d. But, as pointed out in <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Arrington, </em>supra, it is not invalid if tbe term of one year should terminate more than one year from tbe \u201cmaking thereof\u201d. It rests upon tbe conclusion reached in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>May, </em>57 Tenn. 84, 90, wherein it was said: \u201cWhen, therefore, our statute speaks of a lease for a term not exceeding one year, and a contract for a lease for a period not longer than one year, it bas reference to tbe time for the tenant to possess and occupy the premises, and does not include any previous or intermediate time. A lease, therefore, for tbe term of one year may as well be made to commence at a future day, as at tbe day of making it. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Dake, </em>[5 N. Y. 463] 1 Seld., N. Y., 463; Brown on Statute of Frauds, 36; Taylor\u2019s Landlord and Tenant, 21.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The language of the lease contract now before us is capable of no other construction than that the complainant may continue in possession of the leased property during his natural life, if he should elect to do so. This in our opinion being a fair and reasonable construction of the contract it amounts to an oral conveyance of a life estate in the land. This is contrary to both the letter and spirit of the law. \u201cA life estate in land cannot be created, reserved, relinquished, conveyed, or sold by a parol executory agreement.\u201d 37 C. J. S., Frauds, Statute of, Section 88, p. 590; <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Shultz, </em>184 Tenn. 235, 198 S. W. (2d) 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In <em>Sutherland </em>v. <em>Drolet, </em>154 Wis. 619, 143 N. W. 663, 664, the owner of property made an oral lease to the effect that the tenant might continue to occupy the premises <em>until the same were sold. </em>The Court held: \u201cThe oral agreement cannot in any proper sense be called a lease for \u2018a term not exceeding one year,\u2019 for its terms may last for many years, and in the present case actually did last for more than two years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>107 Minn. 122, 119 N. W. 797, 21 L. R. A., N. S., 575, the Court considered at length the following expression in a lease contract as creating a life estate in the property: \u201cTo have and to hold the above-rented premises unto the said party of the second part, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, <em>for the full term of while he shall wish to live in Albert Lea, </em>from and after the 1st day of December, 1904.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) To the same effect are the following' cases cited in the opinion, viz.: <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>38 Ohio St. 118. In <em>Mickie </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>5 Rand., Va., 571, 574, \u2018 \u2018 the grant was to continue so long as the tenant \u2019 should pay the stipulated rent. It was held a life estate.\u201d In <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>17 N. J. Eq. 356, a right given \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>occupy at a specified annual rent, certain premises 'so long as the devisee may desire to occupy the same as a drug store\u2019, amounted to an estate for life.\u201d It is not deemed necessary to refer to other cases cited in the opinion and annotations.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">We think the Chancellor was correct in holding that the oral lease in the case at bar fell within the Statute of Frauds. The assignment of error is overruled and the decree is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-10\">. The factual situation as set forth in the complainant's bill, and which is conceded to be true by the demurrer, is that prior to March 1948 complainant was operating a \u201cservice station\u201d on Magnolia Avenue in Knoxville under an oral lease from the defendant. Whether it was a periodic tenancy or otherwise does not appear in the bill. The building that was thus occupied under the aforesaid lease was torn down when the City of Knoxville undertook the widening of Magnolia Avenue. Following the erection by the defendants of a new building on the old site, it was leased to a new tenant. The bill alleges that the complainant had an understanding with the defendants that when the new building was ready for occupancy \u201che could have it as long as he wanted it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">It appears that pending the completion of the new building the complainant leased two other filling stations which he operated at a loss. The bill charges the defendants with a breach of the oral agreement which gave complainant the right \u201cto have it as long as he wanted it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
