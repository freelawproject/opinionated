The contract in question followed .whereby the county agreed to deposit all its funds for a period -of one year with a provision for four one year renewals in consideration of the bank paying $1 per year interest and in further consideration of the bank cashing county warrants and holding some without interest until the county had funds available with which to take up and discharge the warrants. The defendant trustee refused to deposit the funds in said bank, and the suit resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">We think the Chancellor was correct in holding that the defendant trustee is bound by the resolution adopted by the county court and contract entered into in accordance with said resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">It further appears that the contract entered into is in accordance with the Sections of the Code above referred to. There is nothing in the record to show but that the committee accepted the highest and best bid to pay interest on the daily balances of the county\u2019s funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Objection is also made to the fact that the contract is for five years. However, it must be noted that the contract provides that it must be approved each year by the county judge, who is Chairman of the Finance Committee.. We cannot say that a contract of this nature for five years is an unreasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We have considered all the assignments of error and find them without merit. The decree of the Chancellor is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b103-8\">All concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
