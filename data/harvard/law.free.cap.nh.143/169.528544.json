Cohen, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year. We appointed a Judicial Referee <em>(Dunn, </em>J.) to conduct a hearing on the committee\u2019s petition. The referee found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent violated New Hampshire Rules of Professional Conduct (Rules) 1.15(a)(1), 8.4(a), and 8.4(c). We agree that the respondent committed several violations of Rule 8.4(c), find that those violations warrant disbarment, and therefore need not address the other violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">The referee found that the respondent was retained by James Oriani to represent him in connection with his divorce from Virginia Albanese (formerly Virginia Oriani). During the divorce proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ings, the parties agreed to cooperate toward a joint filing of bankruptcy, and Ms. Albanese agreed to have the respondent represent both her and Mr. Oriani for that purpose. In December 1992, the parties met with the respondent to discuss the proposed bankruptcy. Mr. Oriani paid the respondent a retainer of $910.00. The respondent was aware that Ms. Albanese planned to reimburse Mr. Oriani for one-half of that amount. The parties completed in handwritten form the necessary schedules for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing and signed a blank signature form and blank acknowledgment form. Ms. Albanese expected that the bankruptcy petition would be filed shortly after the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">On March 1,1993, the superior court approved the parties\u2019 divorce decree. Later that month, the respondent prepared typed bankruptcy forms and handwrote the date \u201cMarch 16, 1993\u201d next to the parties\u2019 signatures on the forms. The respondent did not, however, file the bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">On or about March 24, 1993, Ms. Albanese telephoned the respondent. During the conversation, she inquired about the bankruptcy petition. The respondent stated that the petition had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">On May 27, 1993, Ms. Albanese met with another attorney and learned both that she probably did not need to file for bankruptcy and that no petition had yet been filed with the bankruptcy court. Ms. Albanese thereafter twice called the respondent\u2019s office. As she was unable to speak with the respondent, she left messages with the respondent\u2019s secretary indicating that she did not want the bankruptcy petition to be filed and that she wanted her money back.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">In early June, Ms. Albanese spoke with the respondent and told him that she did not want the petition filed and that she wanted her money back. The respondent indicated that it was too late for such a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Thereafter, on June 15, 1993, the respondent attempted to file a joint bankruptcy petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Hampshire. The filing was rejected because the signature page was not the correct form. The respondent obtained the correct form, and on June 16 the respondent signed the names \u201cJames Oriani\u201d and \u201cVirginia Oriani\u201d to the form in a manner that tried to emulate their actual signatures. This was done without the parties\u2019 knowledge or consent and despite Ms. Albanese\u2019s express instruction not to file the petition. The respondent mailed the form to the bankruptcy court, and the bankruptcy petition was entered on the court docket on June 25, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>In July 1993, Ms. Albanese received a notice from the bankruptcy court of a creditors\u2019 meeting in her case. She obtained a copy of her file from the court and noticed that somebody else had signed her name and her ex-husband\u2019s name on the petition. She contacted the United States Trustee\u2019s Office and informed an Assistant United States Trustee that the bankruptcy petition had been filed against her instructions and that the signature was not hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The Assistant United States Trustee filed a complaint against the respondent with the committee. In the course of the disciplinary proceedings, in answer to an interrogatory question as to whether he had ever been sued for any reason (other than two suits specifically mentioned in the question), the respondent answered, \u201cNo.\u201d In fact, the respondent had been a party to at least eleven other law suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The referee concluded that the respondent committed several violations of Rule 8.4(c), which provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cengage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d The referee found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the respondent violated this rule by falsely stating to Ms. Albanese that he had filed her bankruptcy petition when he had not done so, by signing her name to the bankruptcy petition without her consent, by filing the bankruptcy petition after Ms. Albanese instructed him not to do so, and by falsely answering bar counsel\u2019s interrogatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\"> When we review the referee\u2019s factual findings, \u201cour only function is to determine whether a reasonable person could have reached the same decision as the referee on the basis of the evidence before him.\u201d <em>Basbanes\u2019 Case, </em>141 N.H. 1, 4, 676 A.2d 93, 95 (1996) (quotation omitted). We find ample evidence in the record to support the factual findings set forth above. Although the respondent argues that his testimony conflicted with that of other witnesses relied upon by the referee, \u201cany conflicts as might be found in the testimony, questions about the credibility of witnesses, and the weight to be given to testimony are questions to be resolved by the referee.\u201d <em>Budnitz\u2019 Case, </em>139 N.H. 489, 491, 658 A.2d 1197, 1198 (1995) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Although our role in reviewing the referee\u2019s factual findings is limited, we retain the ultimate authority to determine the appropriate sanction for violation of the Rules. <em>See Wood\u2019s Case, </em>137 N.H. 698, 701, 634 A.2d 1340, 1342 (1993); Sup. Ct. R. 37(13)(f). \u201cThe purpose of this court\u2019s disciplinary power is to protect the public, maintain public confidence in the bar, preserve the integrity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>legal profession, and prevent similar conduct in the future.\u201d <em>Doherty\u2019s Case, 142 </em>N.H. 446, 450, 703 A.2d 261, 264 (1997) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u201cThe privilege of practicing law does not come without the concomitant responsibility of truth, candor and honesty. . . . [Because no single transgression reflects more negatively on the legal profession than a lie, attorney misconduct involving dishonesty . . . justifies disbarment.\u201d <em>Nardi\u2019s Case, </em>142 N.H. 602, 606, 705 A.2d 1199, 1200 (1998) (quotations and brackets omitted). In light of the respondent\u2019s repeated dishonest conduct, which included his attempt to emulate the handwriting of Mr. Oriani and Ms. Albanese when he signed their names to the bankruptcy petition without their consent, we conclude that the appropriate sanction in this case is disbarment. <em>See id.; Basbanes\u2019 Case, </em>141 N.H. at 8, 676 A.2d at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Accordingly, the respondent is hereby disbarred and is ordered to reimburse the committee for its expenses in investigating and prosecuting this case. <em>See Sup. Ct. R. </em>37(16).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b224-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
