(NHMA-PLIT), and Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London (Lloyd\u2019s), appeal an order of the Superior Court <em>(Smith, </em>J.) granting summary judgment for the plaintiffs, Roderick C. and Kathleen Hull, and denying summary judgment for the defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-18\">The facts before the trial court were as follows. Roderick Hull sustained injuries in an automobile accident while working as a police officer for the town. He received workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>benefits from the town and the maximum amount of liability coverage carried by the other driver involved in the accident. Because such amounts did not fully compensate him for his injuries, he brought this declaratory judgment action to determine his entitlement to compensation under the uninsured/underinsured motorist provision of the town\u2019s liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">NHMA-PLIT, a pooled risk management program authorized by RSA chapter 5-B (1988 &amp; Supp. 1998), insures the town for up to $500,000 in uninsured/underinsured motorist claims. Lloyd\u2019s insures the town for such claims in excess of those covered by NHMA-PLIT. The defendants objected to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and filed a cross-motion, asserting that the plaintiffs were barred by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, RSA ch. 281-A (Supp. 1998), from receiving uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits from the town or its insurers. The trial court held that the plaintiffs were not barred from seeking such coverage. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we look at the evidence, and all inferences that properly may be drawn therefrom. <em>Cf. N.E. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. City of Franklin, </em>141 N.H. 449, 452, 685 A.2d 913, 916 (1996). We will affirm the grant of summary judgment if we find that there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The trial court\u2019s decision was based primarily on its interpretation of \u201cinsurance carrier\u201d as used in RSA 281-A:8, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">I. An employee of an employer subject to this chapter shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the provisions of this chapter and, on behalf of the employee or the employee\u2019s personal or legal representatives, to have waived all rights of action whether at common law or by statute or provided under the laws of any other state or otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">(a) Against the employer or the employer\u2019s insurance carrier or an association or group providing self-insurance to a number of employers ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">As defined in the statute, the term \u201cinsurance carrier\u201d \u201cshall include any corporation licensed to sell insurance in this state from which an employer has obtained a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy in- accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\u201d RSA 281-A:2, XII. The trial court found that under the plain meaning of the statute, the insurer against which RSA 281-A:8 bars a cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>action is the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, not its automobile insurer. The court therefore held that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the defendants for uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage were not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The defendants argue that by using the words \u201cshall include\u201d in the definition of insurance carrier, the legislature did not exclude other kinds of insurers. They contend that \u201cthe plain, common sense meaning of \u2018insurance carrier\u2019 is simply any entity providing insurance to the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">We interpret statutes according to the plain meaning of the words the legislature used. <em>See South Down Recreation Assoc. v. Moran, </em>141 N.H. 484, 487, 686 A.2d 314, 316 (1996). We focus \u201cnot on isolated words or phrases,\u201d but \u201con the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201cOur goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them, and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In a statutory definition, the word \u201cinclude\u201d is not generally considered a term of limitation. <em>See </em>2A N. SINGER, SUTHERLAND STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION \u00a7 47.07, at 152 (5th ed. 1992). The term \u201cinsurance carrier,\u201d however, is used fairly consistently throughout the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law to refer specifically to an insurer providing workers\u2019 compensation insurance to an employer. <em>See, e.g., </em>RSA 281-A:23, :28, :31. <em>But see </em>RSA 281-A:23, V (using terms \u201cinsurer\u201d and \u201cinsurance company\u201d), :25 (using term \u201cinsurance company\u201d). The use of the term \u201cinsurance carrier\u201d in the statute as a whole provides no indication that it was intended to apply to carriers of other types of insurance except, perhaps, when those insurers are required by the statute to also provide compensation coverage as part of their policies. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:6. Thus, a plain reading of the statute supports the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Even though we hold that the statute is clear on its face, the defendants contend that this interpretation is contrary to the legislative history behind RSA 281-A:8. In 1961, the legislature explicitly granted the employer\u2019s insurance carrier immunity by amending the statutory predecessor to RSA 281-A:8. <em>See Thone v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>130 N.H. 702, 706, 549 A.2d 778, 781 (1988) (discussing amendment of RSA 281:12 (repealed 1988)); Laws 1988, 194:1, I (noting that \u201cRSA 281-A is a reenactment of the substance of RSA 281\u201d). The Senate Journal states that the amendment \u201c[clarifies the original intent of the law to provide, that for the purposes of employer liability, the employer and the employer\u2019s insurance carrier are one and the same.\u201d N.H.S. JOURNAL 636-37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>(1961). The 1961 amendment was a direct response to our decision in <em>Smith v. American Employers\u2019 Insurance Co., </em>102 N.H. 530, 163 A.2d 564 (1960), that an employee could bring a claim against the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier for negligent inspection. <em>See Thone, </em>130 N.H. at 706, 549 A.2d at 781. We revisited the question of the carrier\u2019s independent tort liability in <em>Thone, </em>where the plaintiffs claimed that the workers\u2019 compensation insurer failed to properly inspect the workplace, and thus caused an explosion that killed several employees. We held in <em>Thone </em>that RSA 281-A:8 was a permissible bar to the negligence action brought against the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier. <em>See id. </em>at 706-07, 549 A.2d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The legislative history suggests that the amendment to RSA 281-A:8 was intended to protect the workers\u2019 compensation, carrier from independent tort liability for employees\u2019 work-related injuries. The foregoing does not persuade us that RSA 281-A:8 indiscriminately immunizes the employer\u2019s various other insurance carriers from employee claims and actions. Thus, for instance, while the employer\u2019s immunity normally insulates its third party liability carriers from coverage obligations to injured workers, <em>cf. Hughes v. Chitty, </em>283 F. Supp. 734, 739 (E.D. La. 1968), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>415 F.2d 1150 (5th Cir. 1969), such carriers may be held liable for work-related injuries caused by their independent torts, <em>see Sims v. American Casualty Company, </em>206 S.E.2d 121, 130-31 (Ga. Ct. App.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>209 S.E.2d 61 (Ga. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The defendants next argue that \u201cthe question of insurance carrier immunity under the Workers\u2019 Compensation [Law] should turn upon a <em>quid pro quo </em>analysis, not upon the subject matter of the insurance provided.\u201d Such analysis, however, does not support the defendants\u2019 position. The workers\u2019 compensation scheme is based on a \u201cfundamental <em>quid pro quo,\u201d Thompson v. Forest, </em>136 N.H. 215, 219, 614 A.2d 1064, 1067 (1992), which is \u201cthe <em>tort immunity </em>conferred on the employer ... [in exchange] for providing no-fault workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 614 A.2d at 1066 (emphasis added) (quotation omitted). At issue here, however, is not tort liability, but the uninsured/underi\u00f1sured motorist carrier\u2019s contractual liability.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">[ T]he uninsured motorist carrier does not insure the tortfeasor against liability, but insures the employee against the risk of inadequate compensation if he is injured in an accident with an uninsured motorist. The obligation of the uninsured motorist carrier arises out of contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>although that obligation is precipitated by a third-party\u2019s tortious act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><em>Merchants Mut. Ins. Group v. Orthopedic Prof. Ass\u2019n, </em>124 N.H. 648, 657-58, 480 A.2d 840, 845 (1984). The employer\u2019s tort immunity is left wholly intact by the employee\u2019s recovery of uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits, and the possibility of double recovery is offset by the availability of a workers\u2019 compensation lien. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:13, I(b); <em>Rooney v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>138 N.H. 637, 641, 645 A.2d 52, 54-55 (1994). Thus, allowing an employee to collect benefits from the employer\u2019s uninsured/underinsured motorist insurer does not upset the fundamental <em>quid pro quo </em>upon which the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Finally, the defendants urge us to follow a number of cases from other jurisdictions holding that their workers\u2019 compensation statutes bar an employee from obtaining uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits from the employer\u2019s insurer. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b437-7\">JOHNSON and Thayer, JJ., sat but did not participate in the decision; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
