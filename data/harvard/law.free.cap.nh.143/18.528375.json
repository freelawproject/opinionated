Doughty appeals a decision of the Superior Court <em>(Groff, </em>J.), challenging its ruling as to the location of the plaintiffs\u2019 deeded right-of-way. The plaintiffs, John C. Greenan, Jr., Albert and Louise Jordan, Richard and Janet Miller, Cloyed and Carol Ross, David Seely, and Philip Tapply, cross-appeal the superior court\u2019s conclusion that the defendants\u2019 properties extend to the natural high water line of Newfound Lake, and that the plaintiffs therefore have no right to use the beach. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The defendants, Sarah L. Decker, Richard C. Doughty, James H. Hand, Nancy T. Hand, Dorothy D. Lobban, Richard A. Lobban, Jr., and Jean L. Thompson, own beachfront lots on the shore of Newfound Lake in Bridgewater. The plaintiffs own lots near the lake but not directly adjacent to the beach, and have a ten-foot-wide right-of-way which they use to access the beach. The source of title for all parties is a 1909 deed from Frank E. Dickerman to James G. Young, which reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">Northerly by the Hoyt Brook, so-called; Easterly by the Mayhew Turnpike, so-called; Southerly by the highway leading over the point, so-called; and Westerly by Newfound Lake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Young eventually subdivided the property and sold it in several conveyances. The first deed, to William Bailey, describes the property that is currently owned by defendant Doughty. The deed describes the northern boundary of the lot as \u201c[beginning at a stake on the shore of Newfound Lake . . . thence running Westerly along the shore of said lake one hundred (100) feet to a stake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Young subsequently conveyed to James A. Lobban a parcel of land \u201ccommencing at a stone bound on said road . . . thence northerly about one hundred and fifty five feet to Newfound Lake to a stone bound, thence northeasterly on said Lake fifty feet to a stone bound.\u201d Approximately thirty years later, Young\u2019s heirs conveyed to James A. Lobban two additional parcels. These deeds describe the land currently owned by defendants Richard A. Lobban, Jr., Jean L. Thompson, Sarah L. Decker, and Dorothy D. Lobban, and similarly characterize the northern boundary as running along the shore between artificial monuments.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Around the time of the second conveyance to James A. Lobban, G. Thornton Young, one of Young\u2019s heirs, exchanged letters with Lobban concerning the property. In a letter dated December 23, 1939, Lobban wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>I note in the deed that the line on the east extends \u201cnortherly by said roadway to a stone post on the shore of Newfound Lake.\u201d I believe in our original notation I indicated \u201cto Newfound Lake through a stone post on the shore.\u201d I am concerned about getting complete title to the shore. Would you ask your attorney whether the wording in the deed grants complete title to the shore.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">G. Thornton Young responded affirmatively with the following, which he extracted from a letter he received from his attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">There is no doubt that the other line carries the bound to the lake because the stone post is described as being \u201con the shore of Newfound Lake\u201d and the next course runs by the shore of the lake, so, in our opinion, there is no chance for any question here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The monuments in the defendants\u2019 deeds are referred to as stone posts, stone bounds, or stakes. Although the type of monument may vary among the deeds, the parties continuously refer to the line connecting these monuments as the \u201cartificial high water line.\u201d The beach property north of the artificial high water line is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 title to their properties derives from Young\u2019s heirs\u2019 conveyance to Edward Melius in 1940. In addition to conveying the property, these deeds conveyed \u201ca strip of land 10 feet wide leading from Point Road, so-called, to the shore of Newfound Lake between land of James A. Lobban on the West and land of F. E. Litchfield and land of Grantor on the East.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 deeds all grant to them \u201cthe right to pass and repass\u201d over this right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">The plaintiffs and their predecessors in title have used the beach at issue for at least forty years. Although they have primarily used the area of the beach in front of the right-of-way, their use of the beach has extended beyond the right-of-way\u2019s boundaries. In the 1980s, the defendants began asking the plaintiffs not to use the beach area outside of the boundaries of the right-of-way. The defendants claimed that they owned the beach, and, therefore, the plaintiffs had no right to use it. Defendants Lobban and Doughty each posted \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs and constructed barriers beginning at the right-of-way\u2019s boundaries at the artificial high water line and extending across the beach to the lake, thus creating a small passageway within which the plaintiffs\u2019 use of the beach was confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The plaintiffs filed a petition to quiet title in superior court claiming the right to use the beach, up to the natural high water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>mark, by deed and by prescription. The superior court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and concluded that the defendants owned the beach in front of their properties to the natural high water mark and had \u201cexclusive littoral rights in the water and lake bed adjacent to their property to the exclusion of the Plaintiffs.\u201d The plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The superior court also determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 ten-foot right-of-way extended \u201cbeyond the existing markers to the natural high water line of Newfound Lake,\u201d and that the plaintiffs could use the beach contained within the boundaries of the right-of-way. In addition, the superior court explained that \u201c[t]he delineation of the right of way on the \u2018beach\u2019 shall be the continuation of the course of the present boundaries of the right of way.\u201d The court referred to defendant Hand\u2019s exhibit as accurately illustrating the general location of the parties\u2019 properties. Defendant Doughty appeals this determination, contending that the right-of-way as established by the trial court erroneously bisects his property, and results in an unreasonable use for the plaintiffs because the right-of-way ends at Dick Brown Brook rather than Newfound Lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">We first address the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal. The interpretation of deeds in a quiet title dispute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. See Flanagan v. Prudhomme, </em>138 N.H. 561, 565, 644 A.2d 51, 55 (1994). \u201cOur determination of disputed deeds is based on the parties\u2019 intentions gleaned from construing the language of the deed from as nearly as possible the position of the parties at the time of the conveyance and in light of surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565-66, 644 A.2d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">[2] \u201cA deed is patently ambiguous when the language in the deed does not provide sufficient information to adequately describe the conveyance without reference to extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 644 A.2d at 56. According to the deeds, the northern boundary of the defendants\u2019 properties runs between stone monuments \u201calong the shore.\u201d The defendants argue that \u201calong the shore\u201d refers to the natural high water line and, because natural monuments prevail over artificial monuments, <em>see Mast\u00edn v. Prescott, </em>122 N.H. 353, 355, 444 A.2d 556, 558 (1982), the northern boundary of their lots is at the natural high water line rather than the artificial high water line formed by the monuments. The plaintiffs, however, argue that the phrase \u201calong the shore\u201d is a general description, and because particular descriptions in a deed control over general descriptions, <em>see Sorenson v. Wilson, </em>124 N.H. 751, 755, 476 A.2d 244, 246 (1984); 14 R. Powell, Powell on Real Property \u00b6 899[3][b], at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>81A-110 (1998), the boundary should be at the artificial high water line. After considering the parties\u2019 arguments, we conclude that the terms of the defendants\u2019 deeds are ambiguous. Thus, we look to extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intentions in interpreting the deeds. <em>See Flanagan, </em>138 N.H. at 566, 644 A.2d at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The letters exchanged between G. Thornton Young and James A. Lobban provide powerful evidence of the grantor\u2019s intent. According to G. Thornton Young\u2019s letter responding to Lobban\u2019s concerns, he intended to convey complete title to the shore. We agree with the trial court that these letters are probative of the grantor\u2019s intent and clarify the terms of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Furthermore, in a 1962 conveyance by Young\u2019s heirs to Frances and Elizabeth Seely, the deed stated that the conveyance constituted the \u201cremaining portion of the premises conveyed to James G.-Young by Frank E. Dickerman by deed dated July 7, 1909.\u201d This language suggests that after his conveyance to the Seelys, Young believed he had conveyed all of his property, including the beach. We therefore agree with the trial court that the northern boundary of the properties belonging to defendants Lobban, Thompson, Decker, Doughty, and Hand is at the natural high water line.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The plaintiffs alternatively claim that they have a prescriptive easement to the beach. \u201cTo establish a prescriptive easement, the plaintiff must prove by a balance of probabilities twenty years\u2019 adverse, continuous, uninterrupted use of the land claimed in such a manner as to give notice to the record owner that an adverse claim was being made to it.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices (Public Use of Coastal Beaches), </em>139 N.H. 82, 92, 649 A.2d 604, 610 (1994) (quotation and brackets omitted). The trial court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 prescription claim because, <em>inter alia, </em>the plaintiffs failed to prove that their use of the beach was not permissive. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u201c[T]he absence of permission is an element of a \u2018claim of right,\u2019 which is in turn an essential element of a claim for a prescriptive easement that the claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Town of Warren v. Shortt, </em>139 N.H. 240, 244, 652 A.2d 140, 142 (1994). Prior to the 1980s, the defendants maintained a friendly relationship with the plaintiffs and their predecessors in title, and allowed them to use the beach outside of the right-of-way\u2019s boundaries. The plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence to compel a finding that their use of the beach was not permissive. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>We next address defendant Doughty\u2019s appeal, in which he contends that the superior court erroneously concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 right-of-way bisects his property. Specifically, Doughty argues that the court erred in referencing and attaching defendant Hand\u2019s exhibit D to its order. According to exhibit D, the plaintiffs\u2019 right-of-way would end at Dick Brown Brook, not Newfound Lake, if it continued the course of its present boundaries as the trial court ordered. Doughty argues that this result contradicts the express language of the deeds, as the right-of-way would bisect his property instead of lying between his property and defendant Lobban\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">We agree that the superior court\u2019s order regarding the location of the plaintiffs\u2019 right-of-way is erroneous. The superior court\u2019s referral to exhibit D, according to which the plaintiffs\u2019 right-of-way would lead to Dick Brown Brook, was internally inconsistent with its other findings. First, the court specifically determined that the right-of-way runs to the \u201cnatural high water line of Newfound Lake.\u201d Second, the court found that the grantor\u2019s intent in conveying the right-of-way was \u201cto provide a travel route between the lake and the road.\u201d These findings are inconsistent with the court\u2019s finding that the right-of-way ends at Dick Brown Brook. More importantly, a right-of-way leading to Dick Brown Brook cannot be reconciled with the plaintiffs\u2019 deeds, which explicitly provide that the right-of-way should extend \u201cto the shore of Newfound Lake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We also agree that the right-of-way south of the artificial high water mark should lie between Lobban\u2019s property, which borders the right-of-way on the west, and Doughty\u2019s property, which borders the right-of-way on the east. This conclusion is in accordance with the language of the defendants\u2019 deeds, describing the boundaries of their lots, as well as the plaintiffs\u2019 deeds, describing the boundaries of their right-of-way. We therefore vacate the superior court\u2019s ruling as to the location of the plaintiffs\u2019 right-of-way and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; vacated in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-7\">BRODERICK, J., sat but did not participate in the decision; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
