We affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The SEA, through its general counsel, represented Murray Howlett, a New Hampshire Department of Transportation employee, in his workers\u2019 compensation claim before a department of labor hearing officer and then, on appeal, before the board. <em>See </em>RSA ch. 281-A (Supp. 1998) (amended 1998). Howlett was a member of the SEA, a labor union that provides its members with legal assistance in pursuing workers\u2019 compensation claims against the State. Howlett\u2019s only expenses incurred as a result of the SEA\u2019s representation were his SEA dues and any costs associated with his claim. After losing before the department of labor hearing officer, Howlett received a favorable decision from the board on appeal awarding him benefits in the amount of $886.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Following this decision, the SEA filed a petition with the board requesting that the State pay the SEA $1,185.00 in attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to RSA 281-A:44. The petition itemized 7.9 hours of attorney time at a rate of $150.00 an hour. The board approved the SEA\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">The State argues that RSA 281-A:44, I, authorizes the award of attorney\u2019s fees only when the employee has actually incurred legal expenses. The employee in this case did not incur any legal expenses because he received free legal representation as a benefit of his SEA membership. Thus, the State argues that neither he nor the SEA is eligible to receive attorney\u2019s fees. \u201cWe will overturn the board\u2019s decision only for errors of law, or if we are satisfied by a clear preponderance of the evidence before us that the order is unjust or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Appeal of Newcomb, </em>141 N.H. 664, 666, 690 A.2d 562, 564 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>RSA 281-A:44,1, provides: \u201cIn any dispute over the amount of the benefit payable under this chapter which is appealed to the board or supreme court or both, the employee, if such employee prevails, shall be entitled to reasonable counsel fees and costs as approved by the board or court . . . .\u201d The State argues that the statute authorizes the award of attorney\u2019s fees only when the employee actually incurs legal expenses; however, the statute is silent on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">When the language of a statute is ambiguous, \u201c[o]ur goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them, and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Appeal of Mascoma Valley Reg. School Dist., </em>141 N.H. 98, 100, 677 A.2d 679, 681 (1996) (citations omitted). The legislature enacted this statute to \u201cprovideG proper protection to the working man,\u201d N.H.S. JOUR. 537 (1969), by reimbursing employees for their legal expenses. Additionally, the legislature intended to discourage appeals by employers in workers\u2019 compensation cases. <em>See Seppala &amp; Aho Constr. Co. v. Elton, </em>119 N.H. 634, 636, 406 A.2d 460, 462 (1979). This deterrent purpose suggests that an employer should not be relieved of its obligation to pay attorney\u2019s fees simply because the employee belongs to an organization that provides legal representation as a membership benefit. <em>Cf. Safeway Rental &amp; Sales Co. v. Albina Engine &amp; Machine Works, </em>343 F.2d 129, 134 (10th Cir. 1965) (reasoning that prevailing party\u2019s liability insurance should not relieve negligent party of its obligation to indemnify for fees); <em>Lesmark, Inc. v. Pryce, </em>334 F.2d 942, 945 (D.C. Cir. 1964) (holding that prevailing party\u2019s liability insurance and lack of responsibility for attorney\u2019s fees does not relieve losing party of obligation to indemnify for counsel fees); <em>Futrell v. Martin, </em>600 P.2d 777, 783 (Idaho 1979) (awarding attorney\u2019s fees even though prevailing party did not incur any fees because statute\u2019s purpose was to impose actual costs of litigation on losing party).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">This analysis is consistent with the result reached by other jurisdictions in cases where pro bono organizations requested attorney\u2019s fees. The SEA\u2019s position is closely analogous to that of a pro bono organization because neither organization receives legal fees from its clients. Moreover, the federal civil rights statute under which many pro bono organizations collect legal fees contains language similar to that in RSA 281-A:44,1. Specifically, the federal statute provides for the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated that awarding attorney\u2019s fees under a federal civil rights statute was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>appropriate \u201cregardless of whether plaintiff is represented by private or non-profit counsel.\u201d <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 895 (1984). Since <em>Blum,, </em>courts that have addressed this issue have unanimously concluded that pro bono organizations are entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Alexander S. By and Through Bowers v. Boyd, </em>929 F. Supp. 925, 933 (D.S.C. 1995); <em>see, e.g., Blanchard v. Bergeron, </em>489 U.S. 87, 94 (1989); <em>A.J. by L.B. v. Kierst, </em>56 F.3d 849, 864-65 (8th Cir. 1995); <em>Johnson v. Lafayette Fire Fighters Ass\u2019n Local 472, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Fire Fighters, </em>51 F.3d 726, 732 (7th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">These courts have unequivocally concluded that \u201c[a]n award of attorney\u2019s fees to a successful plaintiff is not contingent upon an obligation to pay an attorney and is not affected by the fact that no fee was charged.\u201d <em>Martin v. Heckler, </em>773 F.2d 1145, 1152 (11th Cir. 1985). The Third Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Rodriguez v. Taylor, </em>569 F.2d 1231, 1245 (3d Cir. 1977), also applies to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">As a general matter, awards of attorneys\u2019 fees . . . are not obviated by the fact that individual plaintiffs are not obligated to compensate their counsel .... The statutory policies underlying the award of fees justify such shifting without regard to whether the individual plaintiff initially assumed the financial burdens of representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). We find that the reasoning of these courts in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to pro bono organizations lends powerful support to our conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Finally, the legal services offered by the SEA benefit employees by providing them with legal representation at a relatively low cost, without regard to the potential profitability of their claims. Without the SEA, some employees might have difficulty finding legal representation given that recovery in these cases may be small. This service that the SEA provides to employees is consistent with the overall purpose behind RSA 281-A:44, I. Thus, we conclude that the board\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to the SEA under this statute was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">The State also argues that the SEA is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because it is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law pursuant to RSA 311:11 (1995). RSA 311:11 prohibits a corporation from \u201chold[ing] itself out to the public or advertising] as being entitled to practice law . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">We disagree with the State\u2019s argument. The SEA\u2019s provision of legal services to its members falls within a constitutional exception to this statutory rule, established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Mine Worker's v. Illinois Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>389 U.S. 217, 221-22 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>(1967). In <em>Mine Workers, </em>a case strikingly similar to this case, the Court held that a union, which provided free legal representation to its members bringing workers\u2019 compensation claims, did not engage in the unauthorized practice of law. <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned that \u201cthe freedom of speech, assembly, and petition guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments gives petitioner the right to hire attorneys on a salary basis to assist its members in the assertion of their legal rights.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. In re N.H. Disabilities Rights Center, Inc., </em>130 N.H. 328, 336, 541 A.2d 208, 213 (1988) (recognizing legal services organization\u2019s first amendment right of associating to advocate legal rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The State argues that <em>Mine Workers </em>does not apply because in that case the attorney received no part of any settlement or award. <em>Id. </em>at 221. We do not find this argument persuasive, however, because attorney\u2019s fees are not drawn from the claimant\u2019s award. The United States Supreme Court has endorsed this view, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">there are differences between counsel fees awarded by a court and traditional fee-paying arrangements which militate against a presumption that . . . sponsorship of litigation is motivated by considerations of pecuniary gain .... [Counsel fees] are not drawn from the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, and are usually premised on a successful outcome ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\"><em>In re Primus, </em>436 U.S. 412, 429-30 (1978). Therefore, we conclude that RSA 311:11 does not prevent the SEA from collecting attorney\u2019s-fees pursuant to RSA 281-A:44, I.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">There remains an issue of the appropriate measure of attorney\u2019s fees in this situation. The board based its award of attorney\u2019s fees on the prevailing market rate for similar legal services, rather than the actual cost incurred by the SEA. We are aware, however, that an award of attorney\u2019s' fees based on the prevailing market rate to a salaried lawyer of a non-legaJ entity may constitute improper fee sharing. N.H. R. PROF.:CONDUCT 5.4; <em>see Curran v. Department of Treasury, </em>805 F.2d 1406, 1407-08 (9th Cir. 1986); <em>Nat. Treasury Emp. U. v. U.S. Dept. of Treasury, </em>656 F.2d 848, 851-53 (D.C. Cir. 1981); <em>Harper v. Better Business Services, Inc., </em>768 F. Supp. 817, 820-22 (N.D. Ga. 1991), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>961 F.2d 1561 (11th Cir. 1992). Although this issue is not before us, by affirming the award of attorney\u2019s fees based on the prevailing market rate, we may facilitate a violation of New Hampshire Rule of Professional Conduct 5.4. \u201cThe-task of <em>supervising </em>and disciplining attorneys within this State falls squarely upon the shoulders of this court.\u201d <em>In Re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>Proposed Public Protection Fund Rule, </em>142 N.H. 588, 590, 707 A.2d 125, 126 (1998) (quotation omitted). Thus, we would be remiss in affirming a result that may be contrary to the Rules of Professional Conduct. Accordingly, a separate order shall be issued referring this matter to a judicial referee for findings, rulings, and a recommendation concerning the basis for and the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">After considering the State\u2019s remaining arguments, we conclude that they are without merit and warrant no further discussion. <em>Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322, 627 A.2d 595, 596 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; further order to issue.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
