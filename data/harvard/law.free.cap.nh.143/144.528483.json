We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>The record reveals the following facts. Myron Crowe owned a parcel of land in the town of Lyme in a rural zoning district. On February 8, 1995, the town planning board met and approved an application, with certain conditions, that Crowe had submitted for subdividing one parcel into two lots, lot 1 and lot 2. The Tausanovitchs had contracted to purchase lot 2 from Crowe in January 1995. One of the conditions for subdividing the parcel required Crowe to obtain a building permit from the zoning board of adjustment (ZBA) before building a residence or bed and breakfast because the proposed areas for development contained agricultural soil. On February 12, 1995, Crowe applied to the town for a permit to build on twenty-five percent of lot 1. An administrative officer of the town denied his request and referred it to the ZBA for consideration of a special exception to allow construction on the lot\u2019s agricultural soil.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The ZBA scheduled a public hearing for March 2, 1995, regarding an application submitted by Crowe for a special exception. <em>See </em>LYME, N.H., ZONING ORDINANCE art. TV; \u00a7 4.64B (1996) (governing uses and special exceptions for agricultural soils conservation district). During the hearing, which a representative of the petitioners attended, the ZBA discussed Crowe\u2019s proposed subdivision and building plans. The ZBA voted to continue the application until Crowe submitted more specific information.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Crowe submitted additional information, and on March 23, 1995, the ZBA reviewed a site plan for lot 1, which included a table showing the amount of agricultural soil on the lot, the amount to be developed, and the \u201cplanned development including the <em>bed and breakfast, </em>allowance for septic area, driveway, [and] maintenance buildings.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The ZBA granted Crowe a special exception but required him to meet certain conditions before he could obtain a building permit. The conditions limited the develop-able acres to a maximum of 3.55 acres of agricultural soil, required Crowe to grant a conservation easement to the town, and required a map displaying the development and easement as substantially conforming with a proposed subdivision drawing previously submitted by Crowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">On May 22, 1996, Crowe submitted a building permit application with maps and plans to the town for the proposed construction of a bed and breakfast on lot 1. On June 12, 1996, the zoning administrator issued Crowe the permit. The zoning administrator wrote on the notice approving the permit that he did not refer the application to the ZBA because a \u201cspecial exception [was] granted before this application on 3/23/95.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>On August 6, 1996, the petitioners appealed the issuance of the permit to the ZBA and asked the Lyme Board of Selectmen (board) to \u201ctake legal steps to stop further construction on [the] lot.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) On August 15, 1996, the ZBA heard the merits of the appeal, including testimony from the zoning administrator, the abutters, the petitioners, Crowe, and the public. The ZBA denied the appeal, reasoning, <em>inter alia, </em>that all notice provisions under the ordinance had been met, that the petitioners were present or represented at the planning board meeting and ZBA meeting approving the subdivision and conditionally approving the building of a bed and breakfast, that the special exception granted in 1995 covered the construction of a bed and breakfast, and that the issue of whether construction falls within the parameters of the permit was not properly before it. Subsequently, the ZBA denied the petitioners\u2019 motion for a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The petitioners appealed the ZBA\u2019s decision to the superior court. The respondents moved to dismiss, arguing that the petitioners\u2019 appeal to the ZBA was not timely filed. The trial court granted the motion, finding that the petitioners failed to file the appeal with the ZBA within a reasonable time as required by a town ordinance. <em>See </em>Lyme, N.H., Zoning Ordinance art. x, \u00a7 10.20 (1996). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The petitioners argue that the trial court erroneously applied the reasonable time standard for administrative appeals. In accordance with RSA 676:5 (1996), article X, section 10.20 of the Lyme Zoning Ordinance provides that appeals, other than from denials by the ZB\u00c1, \u201cshall be taken within a <em>reasonable period of time </em>by filing with the [ZBA] a notice of appeal specifying the grounds for appeal.\u201d Neither the statute nor the ordinance defines \u201creasonable period of time.\u201d <em>See generally </em>RSA 676:5; LYME, N.H., ZONING ORDINANCE art.'X.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The petitioners assert that they \u201cdid not have actual or constructive notice that the building permit had been issued until late July or early August, 1996,\u201d and that they \u201cappealed to the ZBA within just a few days of learning that the building permit had been issued.\u201d The petitioners argue that the superior court erred in concluding that they chose to delay the filing of their appeal to the ZBA until August 6, 1996, and in applying a <em>per se </em>rule in determining that the passage of fifty-five days from the issuance of the permit until the appeal was unreasonable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s granting of the motion to dismiss, we evaluate whether the petitioners\u2019 allegations may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>reasonably construed to permit relief. <em>See, e.g., Hickingbotham v. Burke, </em>140 N.H. 28, 29-30, 662 A.2d 297, 298-99 (1995). \u201cWe assume the truth of the [petitioners\u2019] well pleaded allegations of fact and construe all reasonable inferences from them most favorably to the [petitioners].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 662 A.2d at 299 (quotation and ellipsis omitted). The trial court, however, accepts \u201c[a]ll findings of the zoning board of adjustment . . . upon all questions of fact properly before the court [as] prima facie lawful and reasonable.\u201d <em>Ray\u2019s Stateline Market v. Town of Pelham, </em>140 N.H. 139, 143, 665 A.2d 1068, 1070 (1995). \u201cThis court, in turn, will uphold the decision of the superior court unless that decision is not supported by the evidence or is legally erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 665 A.2d at 1071 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We first interpret the zoning ordinance. The interpretation of a zoning ordinance is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. See, e.g., Healey v. Town of New Durham, </em>140 N.H. 232, 236, 665 A.2d 360, 365 (1995). \u201cIn general, the traditional rules of statutory construction will govern here. Thus, the words and phrases of an ordinance should always be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Generally, the time for an appeal from the administrative officer\u2019s decision begins to run when the appealing party knows or should have known about the decision. <em>See Zeilstra v. Barrington Zoning Bd. of R., </em>417 A.2d 303, 308 (R.I. 1980); <em>State v. Strange, </em>960 P.2d 1016, 1018 (Wyo. 1998). The precise meaning of the phrase \u201creasonable time,\u201d or \u201creasonable period of time,\u201d for appealing, however, depends upon the circumstances in a particular case. <em>See Long v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc., </em>60 N.E.2d 805, 807 (Ohio Ct. App. 1945); <em>Zeilstra, </em>417 A.2d at 308; 75A Am. Jur. 2d <em>Trial </em>\u00a7 755 (1991). Whether the facts in a particular case support a finding that a party appealed a decision to the ZBA within a \u201creasonable time\u201d is ultimately a question of fact. <em>See Long, </em>60 N.E.2d at 807. To determine whether a period of time is reasonable, the interests of the party benefiting from an administrative officer\u2019s, or a town\u2019s, actions should be balanced against the interests of the aggrieved party appealing to the ZBA. <em>Cf. Keating v. Zoning Board of Appeals of City of Saco, </em>325 A.2d 521, 523-25 <em>&amp; </em>n.5 (Me. 1974) (balancing the interests of the parties receiving building permits against the interests of the aggrieved party).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">A reasonable time is \u201cthat time which upholds and saves to each of the interested parties the rights to which they are entitled and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>protects them from injury or loss.\u201d <em>Meers v. Frick-Reid Supply Corporation, </em>127 S.W.2d 493, 498 (Tex. Civ. App. 1939) (discussing personal property right). Some factors relevant to determining the reasonableness of a period of time include the knowledge of the parties, their conduct, their interests, the possibility of prejudice to any party, and any reason for the delay in appealing. <em>Cf. Healey, </em>140 N.H. at 241, 665 A.2d <em>at </em>368 (discussing unreasonable delay necessary to finding laches). Although the party relying on an administrative officer\u2019s action is entitled to know when the order becomes final, the parties objecting to the officer\u2019s action should be given sufficient time to file an appeal to protect their interests. <em>Keating, </em>325 A.2d at 523-25. In this case, the Tausanovitchs were aware that Crowe was planning to build a bed and breakfast when they purchased some of Crowe\u2019s land. The ZBA further found that the notices provided to the petitioners for the hearings held in February and March 1995 complied with the administrative procedures in effect at that time. Additionally, the planning board approval of Crowe\u2019s proposed subdivision of the parcel stated that Crowe could build a bed and breakfast on lot 1 if he obtained the necessary building permit. Even if the actual notices from the ZBA and planning board failed to alert the petitioners that they should act, the petitioners were on constructive notice that the ZBA approved the special exception and building permit for Crowe to build a bed and breakfast.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The petitioners stated in their motion for reconsideration to the superior court that they \u201cdid not fully comprehend that construction of the new bed and breakfast facility\u201d had commenced. They also stated in their objection to Crowe\u2019s motion to dismiss to the superior court that \u201c[d]uring the months preceding and the weeks following the issuance of the building permit, Crowe\u2019s contractors were engaged in site clearing activities . . . .\u201d Despite the petitioners\u2019 admissions, they claim that they could not observe the extent of construction from the road and that they believed that the construction was for the renovation of an existing residential structure. We find their arguments unpersuasive, especially in light of their admission that a building permit, which they had observed to be blank, was posted on Crowe\u2019s property. The record is not clear whether the petitioners ever attempted to clarify the purpose of the permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The facts support a conclusion that the petitioners had actual or constructive notice in June about the building permit and Crowe\u2019s construction activities. Accordingly, we agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>superior court\u2019s finding that the petitioners\u2019 \u201cdecision to wait until August 6, 1996 to file their appeal does not constitute filing within a reasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">After further review of the record, we conclude that the parties\u2019 remaining arguments are without merit and warrant no further discussion. <em>See, e.g., Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322, 627 A.2d 595, 596 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b201-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
