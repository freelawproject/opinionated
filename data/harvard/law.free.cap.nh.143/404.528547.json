We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The petitioner is the sole proprietor of a cleaning business. On November 1, 1995, the petitioner went to the home of Wayne and Vera Young to perform certain household services. After washing an outside window, the petitioner fell from a ladder and suffered a spinal cord injury that left him partially paralyzed. Neither the petitioner nor his business carried workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The petitioner filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the Youngs\u2019 homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. The homeowner\u2019s policy, issued by Commercial Union Insurance Company (Commercial Union), contained an endorsement that provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance for \u201cdomestics.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:6 (Supp. 1998). Commercial Union denied the claim based on the absence of an employer-employee relationship between the Youngs and the petitioner. After following the necessary procedural requirements, the petitioner filed this appeal from an order of the board ruling that the petitioner was not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">On appeal, the petitioner argues that he is a domestic entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits pursuant to RSA 281-A:6. Further, he argues that even if he is not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits under RSA chapter 281-A (Supp. 1998) (amended 1998), he falls within the workers\u2019 compensation coverage provided by the Youngs\u2019 homeowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">\u201cWe will uphold an order of the board unless it is erroneous as a matter of law or the claimant has demonstrated that the order is unjust or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Appeal of Gelinas, </em>142 N.H. 295, 297, 700 A.2d 870, 871 (1997). We have consistently held that \u201cthe rights and remedies of parties under the workers\u2019 compensation law . . . are purely statutory.\u201d <em>Rooney v. Fireman\u2019s Fund, Ins. Co., </em>138 N.H. 637, 638, 645 A.2d 52, 53 (1994) (citation and quotation omitted). \u201cThis court is the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole, and when the issue raised presents a new question of statutory construction, we begin our analysis with an examination of the statutory language.\u201d <em>Atwood v. Owens, </em>142 N.H. 396, 398, 702 A.2d 333, 335 (1997) (quotation omitted). When interpreting legislative intent from a statute as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>written, \u201cwe will not consider what the legislature might have said or add words that the legislature did not include.\u201d <em>Petition of Walker, </em>138 N.H. 471, 474, 641 A.2d 1021, 1024 (1994). \u201cWhere the statutory language is ambiguous or where more than one reasonable interpretation exists, we review legislative history to aid in our analysis.\u201d <em>K &amp; J Assoc. v. City of Lebanon, </em>142 N.H. 331, 332, 703 A.2d 253, 254 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We begin our analysis by examining RSA 281-A:6, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, of title XXXVII, or of any other law to the contrary, all insurance companies authorized to provide comprehensive personal liability, tenant\u2019s or homeowner\u2019s insurance in this state shall, in connection with such insurance, provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance covering domestics unless the employer has a separate policy of workers\u2019 compensation insurance covering domestics. Such insurance companies shall not be subject to RSA 281-A:9 or to the financial or other requirements with respect to workers\u2019 compensation insurance in addition to those requirements for writing comprehensive personal liability, tenant\u2019s or homeowner\u2019s insurance. Premium rates and policy forms or endorsements used by a company to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be subject to the approval of the insurance commissioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The petitioner argues that he falls within the definition of a domestic because he was performing household duties and maintenance to the Youngs\u2019 home. The respondents argue, and the board found, that the petitioner is not a domestic because he was not an employee of the Youngs. The petitioner does not contest this finding. Rather, the petitioner argues that the plain language of the phrase, \u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, of title XXXVII, or of any other law to the contrary,\u201d eliminates the necessity of an employment relationship between the parties. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Contrary to the petitioner\u2019s assertions, RSA 281-A:6 mandates insurance companies to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance with all comprehensive personal liability, tenant\u2019s, or homeowner\u2019s insurance policies issued in this State unless the employer has a separate workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy for domestics. The express language of this statute does not eliminate the requirement of an employment relationship for domestics. If the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>intended to eliminate the requirement of an employment relationship, it could have easily drafted the statute to do so. <em>Cf. </em>RSA 281-A:18 (Supp. 1998) (legislature eliminated requirement of employment relationship by expressly stating that contractor who subcontracts is liable for workers\u2019 compensation to subcontractor\u2019s employees); <em>Brewster Academy v. Town of Wolfeboro, </em>142 N.H. 382, 385, 701 A.2d 1240, 1242 (1997) (if legislature wanted particular land to be taxable, it would have expressly stated so in the statute). We note, however, that the term \u201cdomestics\u201d is not defined in RSA 281-A:6 or elsewhere in RSA chapter 281-A. Furthermore, we cannot glean the meaning of \u201cdomestics\u201d from the context of RSA 281-A:6. Accordingly, we review legislative history to aid in our analysis. <em>See K &amp; J Assoc., </em>142 N.H. at 333, 703 A.2d at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The petitioner argues that the legislative history of RSA 281-A:2, :6 (Supp. 1998) indicates a legislative intent to provide him with coverage. He supports this assertion by focusing on the legislative history of the definitions of \u201cemployee,\u201d <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:2, VI, and \u201cemployer,\u201d <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:2, VIII. Prior to 1976, domestic and casual employees were excluded from workers\u2019 compensation coverage. <em>See </em>Laws 1973, 481:1, :2. Effective January 1, 1976, the legislature expanded the scope of workers\u2019 compensation coverage to include household employees who were covered by the Social Security Act. <em>See </em>Laws 1975, 475:1, :2. At the same time, the legislature provided a means to finance workers\u2019 compensation coverage for domestics by enacting the predecessor to RSA 281-A:6. <em>See </em>Laws 1975, 475:13. Furthermore, the legislature contemporaneously amended the predecessor to RSA 281-A:5 (Supp. 1998), by requiring an employer to secure compensation \u201c[b]y insuring and keeping insured, the payment of compensation to their <em>domestic employees </em>with a company providing workmen\u2019s compensation insurance in accordance with RSA [281-A:6].\u201d Laws 1975, 475:12 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The express words of this statute mandate employers to provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage for their domestic employees in accordance with RSA 281-A:6. <em>See Appeal of HCA Parkland Medical Ctr, </em>143 N.H. 92, 94, 719 A.2d 619, 622 (1998). Thus, the term \u201cdomestic employees\u201d in RSA 281-A:5, II and the term \u201cdomestics\u201d in RSA 281-A:6 are interchangeable. The plain meaning of \u201cdomestic employees\u201d in RSA 281-A:5, II shows an intent by the legislature to require an employment relationship. Because the terms \u201cdomestic employees\u201d and \u201cdomestics\u201d are interchangeable, the direct reference of RSA 281-A:5, II to RSA 281-A:6 shows an intent by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>legislature to require an employment relationship between homeowners and domestics.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In 1983, the legislature further broadened workers\u2019 compensation coverage by removing the domestic employee exception from the definitions of \u201cemployee\u201d and \u201cemployer.\u201d <em>See </em>Laws 1983, 18:1, :2. The petitioner relies on legislative discussions regarding these amendments to show that RSA 281-A:6 provides coverage for him as a domestic. Specifically, the petitioner relies on comments by Senator Freese, a proponent of the amendment, who stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">HB 165-FN . . . extends workmen\u2019s compensation coverage to certain household employees. The bill eliminates the previous limitations on workmen\u2019s compensation coverage. In 1975 a bill was passed to cover household employees and it passed the Senate and got into the House and there was an amendment put on. Then it went to a Committee of Conference. In the Committee of Conference there was an exception made to the bill . . . [which] made it mandatory that before the claim could be engaged, in other words, before you could make a claim, $50 had to be earned by that employee to pay for some of this compensation coverage, and therefore the $3 was being charged on the insurance policy by the homeowner was no good because they couldn\u2019t collect on it. I know circumstances, and there were quite a few people who found that after they thought they had the coverage, didn\u2019t. This corrects that inequity and now there is no condition for the $50 up-front earning. When somebody gets hurt working around the house, inside or outside, mowing the lawn, washing windows and so forth, and are hired on a very short-term basis, if they get hurt they are covered by workmen\u2019s compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">N.H.S. JOUR. 145 (1983). It is clear from Senator Freese\u2019s comments that this amendment extended workers\u2019 compensation coverage only to \u201ccertain household employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The comments, however, indicate an assumption, at least by Senator Freese, that individuals hired on a very short-term basis who are injured while working around the house, mowing the lawn, washing windows and so forth will be covered by workers\u2019 compensation. <em>See id. </em>We are reluctant to give too much weight to comments offered by proponents of bills. <em>See Appeal of Reid, </em>143 N.H. 246, 253, 722 A.2d 489, 494 (1998) (quotation omitted). Furthermore, the senator\u2019s comments are inconclusive on the question of whether domestics are exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>from an employment relationship. <em>Cf. In Re Estate of Martin, </em>125 N.H. 690, 692, 484 A.2d 1188, 1184 (1984). \u201cAbsent a formal legislative history of the statute, we must glean the intent of the legislature from the plain meaning of the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691, 484 A.2d at 1184. Because the express language of RSA chapter 281-A is silent on this question, we conclude that the petitioner\u2019s argument is without formal statutory support. Accordingly, we hold that a domestic must be an employee of the homeowner in order to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">We note, however, that it would be a formidable challenge to find an individual who mows a lawn or washes a window to be an employee of a homeowner under the existing test for an employment relationship. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:2, VI; <em>Petition of City Cab of Manchester, </em>139 N.H. 220, 221, 652 A.2d 1202, 1202-03 (1994). Because it is unclear what the legislature intended to include in the term \u201cdomestic,\u201d from its plain meaning, we encourage the legislature to define the term \u201cdomestics\u201d rather than requiring us to define it on a case-by-case basis. <em>Cf. Disco v. Board of Selectmen, </em>115 N.H. 609, 612, 347 A.2d 451, 453 (1975) (encouraging legislative enactment defining petition procedure and thereby eliminating need for court to define procedures post-petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Additionally, the petitioner argues that an endorsement to the Youngs\u2019 homeowner\u2019s insurance policy provides him with workers\u2019 compensation coverage regardless of the coverage provided under RSA chapter 281-A. If we assume, without deciding, that the petitioner can be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation coverage independent of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, the homeowner\u2019s policy does not help him. \u201cThe interpretation of insurance policy language is ultimately a question of law for this court to decide. In this effort, we look to the plain and ordinary meaning of words in their context, and construe the terms of the policy . .. based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Concord Gen. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mitchell, </em>138 N.H. 229, 231, 637 A.2d 903, 904 (1994) (citations and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The question before us is whether the petitioner was a \u201cresidence employee\u201d as defined in the policy. The petitioner relies solely on the endorsement to the Youngs\u2019 homeowner\u2019s policy to define \u201cresidence employee.\u201d The endorsement, however, states that \u201cresidence employee\u201d has the meaning stated in the policy. The policy defines \u201cresidence employee\u201d as \u201c[a]n employee of an \u2018insured\u2019 whose duties are related to the maintenance or use of the \u2018residence premises\u2019, including household or domestic services.\u201d Thus, whether the petitioner has coverage under the homeowner\u2019s policy depends on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>whether the petitioner is an employee of the Youngs. <em>See Allen v. Sentry Insurance, </em>137 N.H. 579, 581-82, 630 A.2d 780, 781-82 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\">The board ruled that the petitioner was not an employee of the Youngs. The petitioner does not challenge this ruling. Accordingly, we uphold the board\u2019s decision not to extend workers\u2019 compensation coverage to the petitioner absent an employment relationship with the Youngs.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b462-5\">BRODERICK, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
