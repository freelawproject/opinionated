Atkins, III, was denied court-appointed appellate counsel under RSA 604-A:2 (1986 &amp;Supp. 1998). He challenges whether his wife\u2019s income and assets should be included in the determination of financial need. We now set forth the instances when a spouse\u2019s assets and income may be taken into account in determining financial need, and order the office of cost containment, <em>see </em>RSA 21-I:7-b (Supp. 1998), to review the defendant\u2019s request for court-appointed counsel in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The defendant, formerly a pharmacist, was charged with falsifying a physician\u2019s prescription and applied to the superior court for court-appointed counsel. With the application, the defendant filed a financial affidavit listing $100 in cash as available money, several hundred dollars worth of stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit or trust assets, a monthly income of approximately $950, and approximately $800 of monthly expenses. The defendant left blank all spaces on the preprinted affidavit that asked for his spouse\u2019s assets or income.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The defendant\u2019s application was initially approved. The State moved to vacate the appointment of counsel, however, because the defendant failed to disclose his wife\u2019s financial information on the affidavit. The defendant then filed a second application and affidavit listing his wife\u2019s income and available funds. The affidavit explained, however, that the defendant and his wife \u201chave maintained [their] finances separately since [their] marriage\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s wife had informed him that \u201cshe will not pay for [his] attorney.\u201d The defendant\u2019s second application was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">On May 16, 1995, the grand jury indicted the defendant on a number of perjury and unsworn falsification charges related to alleged false statements made in the financial affidavits filed with the superior court. Following his conviction in Superior Court <em>0Coffey, </em>J.) on one charge of perjury, <em>see </em>RSA 641:1 (1996), and seven charges of unsworn falsification, <em>see </em>RSA 641:3 (1996), where he was represented by private counsel, the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">The defendant applied for court-appointed counsel on appeal and requested a hearing before this court to determine whether his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>wife\u2019s income and assets should be considered in the determination of his financial need. We granted the motion for hearing in part and requested that the parties brief only the single issue presented therein. After oral argument, we ordered the defendant to file a new application for court-appointed counsel and an updated financial affidavit including information on both the defendant and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The defendant argues that, as a matter of both statutory interpretation and constitutional mandate, his spouse\u2019s income and assets cannot be considered when determining his eligibility for court-appointed counsel. In matters of statutory interpretation, \u201c[tjhis court is the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as \u25a0expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Cheever v. Southern N.H. Regional Med. Ctr., </em>141 N.H. 589, 590-91, 688 A.2d 565, 566-67 (1997) (quotation omitted). We \u201capply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them, and . . . the policy sought to be advanced.\u201d <em>South Down Recreation Assoc. v. Moran, </em>141 N.H. 484, 487, 686 A.2d 314, 316 (1996) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">RSA 604-A:2 governs the appointment of counsel for indigent defendants. In <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>121 N.H. 531, 431 A.2d 144 (1981), we reviewed a proposed amendment to RSA 604-A.-2 that would have required the court to appoint counsel for a defendant \u201conly if the court is satisfied that the defendant <em>and </em>persons liable for his support under RSA 546-A:2 are financially unable to obtain counsel.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>121 N.H. at 534, 431 A.2d at 147 (quotation and ellipses omitted). We indicated that the statute as amended would be unconstitutional because it might \u201cinterfere with an indigent\u2019s right to counsel during every stage of the criminal proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 534-35, 431 A.2d at 147-48 (quotation omitted). We stated that a court could not reject a defendant\u2019s request for counsel simply because a person liable for the defendant\u2019s support is financially able, but unwilling, to hire counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 534, 431 A.2d at 147. We unambiguously stated that in determining eligibility, \u201cthe court need inquire only into the <em>defendant\u2019s own </em>financial status.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">This is not to say, however, that the State Constitution mandates that an inquiry into a defendant\u2019s ability to obtain counsel be limited to reviewing that defendant\u2019s income and assets in a vacuum. A spouse\u2019s income and assets may be considered insofar as they may reduce a defendant\u2019s other expenses and free more of his income to pay for counsel. <em>See People v. Whisenand, </em>44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 501, 507 (Ct. App. 1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1128 (1996); <em>cf. </em>RSA 604-A:2-c (Supp. 1998) (for purposes of calculating financial need, defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>income is reduced by \u201camount of expenses which are reasonably necessary for the maintenance of the defendant\u201d). In addition, courts have considered the assets of persons other than the defendant when they find that the defendant transferred assets to such persons in an attempt to qualify for court-appointed counsel. <em>See Vincent v. State, </em>817 S.W.2d 190, 191-92 (Tex. Ct. App. 1991). \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s claim of indigency certainly should be rejected when he puts his own assets into his relatives\u2019 names and those assets remain at his disposal.\u201d <em>United States v. Rubinson, </em>543 F.2d 951, 964 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 850 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Furthermore, a spouse\u2019s assets not only are relevant to ascertain the defendant\u2019s reasonable living expenses, but must be considered by the court to determine whether the State is entitled to reimbursement for the cost of court-appointed counsel. In <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>we stated that a court could \u201corder a person who has a statutory duty to support the defendant to obtain counsel for the defendant, enforce its order through its contempt powers, and stay the criminal prosecution pending resolution of the matter,\u201d provided that the defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial was not impaired. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>121 N.H. at 534-35, 431 A.2d at 147. In apparent response to that opinion, the legislature enacted RSA 604-A:2-a (1986), which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">Whenever a court appoints counsel pursuant to the provisions of RSA 604-A:2, the court shall conduct an appropriate inquiry as to whether any person who, pursuant to RSA 546-A:2, is liable for the support of the defendant is financially able to pay for such defendant\u2019s counsel. If the court determines that the person liable for support is financially able to pay for said counsel, in whole or in part, the court shall enter an appropriate order requiring said person to reimburse the state for the representation provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">This provision clearly <em>requires </em>the court to inquire into the finances of the defendant\u2019s spouse. <em>See Petition of Mone, </em>143 N.H. 128, 136, 719 A.2d 626, 632 (1998) (the term \u201cshall\u201d in a statute makes enforcement mandatory). Indeed, the defendant concedes that the court may consider the assets and income of persons other than the defendant for purposes of <em>reimbursement. </em>In this case, the court is required to take any additional steps, consistent with RSA 604-A:2-a and the defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s statutory duty of support, <em>see </em>RSA 546-A:2 (1997); <em>cf. Opinion of the Justices, </em>121 N.H. at 534-35, 431 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>A.2d at 147, to secure reimbursement for the State for court-appointed counsel. .</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Accordingly, we' order the office of cost containment to review the defendant\u2019s new application for counsel to determine whether the defendant is eligible for court-appointed appellate counsel. Thereafter, appropriate steps shall be taken, if counsel is appointed, to determine whether the defendants spouse .may be responsible for reimbursing the State.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae3\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b298-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
