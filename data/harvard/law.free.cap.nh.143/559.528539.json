The defendant argues that the State failed to allege in her indictment, and later prove at trial, that she knew the legal classification of the underlying crime. She also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>argues that the State failed to specify the grade of the offense charged in the indictment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">On October 22, 1994, the defendant\u2019s friend allegedly robbed the Ca\u00f1ad Cinema in Somersworth at gunpoint. At the defendant\u2019s trial, the- State introduced evidence, including police reports and the defendant\u2019s statement, establishing that the defendant accompanied the alleged perpetrator to the Somersworth cinema on the day of the robbery, and later assisted him by driving the car in which he fled. The State also introduced testimony indicating that the defendant knew the alleged perpetrator used the defendant\u2019s stiletto knife during the robbery, and that the defendant concealed physical evidence of the crime. Specifically, Detective Arthur Williams testified that during a search of the defendant\u2019s apartment and car, the defendant produced the knife that the alleged perpetrator used to cut the cinema\u2019s phone lines, and the detective recovered rolled coins taken during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The defendant moved, pretrial and at the close of the State\u2019s case, to dismiss the hindering apprehension indictment as defective. She also moved at the close of the State\u2019s case to dismiss the hindering apprehension charge, arguing that the State had failed to adduce evidence that she knew the legal classification of the underlying offense. The superior court denied the motions. A jury convicted the defendant of felony hindering apprehension and acquitted her of accomplice liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s argument that her indictment was inadequate because the State failed to specify the grade of the charged offense. RSA 642:3, which defines the crime of \u201cHindering Apprehension or Prosecution,\u201d states in pertinent part: \u201cThe offense is a misdemeanor unless the actor knows that the charge made or liable to be made against the other is murder or a class A felony, in which case it is a class B felony.\u201d RSA 642:3, II. If the defendant should have been able to reasonably infer the grade of the offense charged from the face of the indictment, then the indictment will not fail for indefiniteness. <em>Cf. State v. Allard, </em>128 N.H. 437, 438, 514 A.2d 824, 825 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The indictment states in pertinent part that the defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">did with the purpose to hinder, prevent or delay the . , . apprehension ... of another for the commission of armed robbery concealed [sic] physical evidence that might have aided in the . . . apprehension ... of that person, in that; Shelley Williams did store a roll of dimes, a roll of nickels, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>and a stiletto knife in her apartment; . . . the stiletto knife being one of the weapons used in the armed robbery at Ca\u00f1ad Cinemas ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The indictment specifically alleges in its factual narrative that the underlying crime, in relation to which the defendant hindered authorities, was armed robbery, which is always a class A felony. <em>See </em>RSA 636:1, III (1996). Accordingly, the indictment sufficiently informed the defendant that she was being charged with a felony offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The defendant next argues that the State must allege that she knew the <em>legal classification </em>of armed robbery, that is, that she knew that armed robbery is a class A felony. Under the defendant\u2019s construction of RSA 642:3, II, the indictment would be defective for failing to include that allegation. <em>Cf. State v. Shannon, </em>125 N.H. 653, 666, 484 A.2d 1164, 1174 (1984). The defendant also argues that the State failed to prove that she knew the legal classification of armed robbery. Both of the defendant\u2019s arguments require us to determine whether RSA 642:3, II requires actual knowledge of an underlying crime\u2019s legal classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The defendant, advocating a literal construction of RSA 642:3, II, urges us to ascribe to the words of the statute their \u201cusual and common meaning.\u201d She asks us to read the phrase, \u201cunless the actor knows the charge made or liable to be made against the other is murder or a class A felony,\u201d RSA 642:3, II, as meaning, unless the actor knows that the legal classification of the underlying crime is murder or a class A felony. The State argues that RSA 642:3, II requires that the defendant know of the perpetrator\u2019s conduct constituting the underlying felony, without requiring knowledge of the felony\u2019s legal classification. When \u201cstatutory language is clear and unambiguous, its meaning is not subject to modification by judicial construction.\u201d <em>State v. Melcher, </em>140 N.H. 823, 826, 678 A.2d 146, 148 (1996) (quotation omitted). We will \u201clook elsewhere only when the plain statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d <em>State v. Telles, </em>139 N.H. 344, 346, 653 A.2d 554, 556 (1995). Because RSA 642:3, II may reasonably be read either as requiring knowledge of the legal classification or knowledge of underlying facts that constitute murder or a class A felony, we expand our analysis beyond the plain statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">In construing RSA 642:3, II, we draw counsel from RSA 625:3 (1996), which states: \u201cThe rule that penal statutes are to be strictly construed does not apply to this code. All provisions of this code shall be construed according to the fair import of their terms and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>promote justice.\u201d RSA 625:3 represents New Hampshire\u2019s substantial deviation from the- common law rule requiring a strict construction of criminal statutes. <em>See State v. Harper, </em>126 N.H. 815, 818, 498 A.2d 310, 313 (1985). Using RSA 625:3 as a guide, we consider whether the legislature intended to limit felony liability to the small class of persons who hinder apprehension knowing the legal classification of the underlying crime. A principal factor in the analysis of RSA 642:3, II is whether the defendant\u2019s argument fairly construes the term \u201ccharge.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 625:3. We are hard pressed to find, and the defendant does not offer, a reasonable justification for such a narrow construction of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">\u201c[W]e do not assume that the legislature would enact statutory language that would lead to an absurd result.\u201d <em>Atwood v. Owens, </em>142 N.H. 396, 398, 702 A.2d 333, 335 (1997). Limiting felony liability only to those with knowledge of an underlying crime\u2019s legal classification renders an impermissibly, absurd result based on the language of RSA 642:3. We would expect, if the legislature intended such a limited category of potential defendants, to find some indicia of that intent in the statute\u2019s language or its legislative history. We find no such indication in support of the defendant\u2019s argument. <em>Compare </em>REPORT OF COMMISSION TO RECOMMEND CODIFICATION OF CRIMINAL LAWS \u00a7 587:3 comments (1969) (hereinafter REPORT OF COMMISSION) with REPORT OF COMMISSION \u00a7 587:4 comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The legislative history of RSA 642:3 states that the hindering apprehension or prosecution statute \u201cis drawn from the Model Penal Code, \u00a7 242.3.\u201d <em>See </em>REPORT OF COMMISSION \u00a7 587:3 comments. The reasonable import of the comment is that our legislature meant to adopt the Model Penal Code\u2019s version of hindering apprehension. <em>Cf. State v. Maloney, </em>126 N.H. 235, 237-38, 490 A.2d 772, 774-75 (1985). The defendant argues, however, that our legislature consciously modified Model Penal Code \u00a7 242.3, so that RSA 642:3, II requires knowledge of the underlying crime\u2019s legal classification. As \u201c[i]t is not to be presumed that the legislature would pass an act leading to an absurd result and nullifying to an appreciable extent the purpose of the statute,\u201d <em>Raudonis v. Ins. Co. of North America, </em>137 N.H. 57, 61, 623 A.2d 746, 749 (1993), we decline to adopt the defendant\u2019s construction in the absence of clearer legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Moreover, the-commentary to Model Penal-Code \u00a7 242.3 expressly rejects the defendant\u2019s contention that an accused must know the legal classification of the underlying crime'. <em>See </em>MODEL PENAL CODE AND COMMENTARIES \u00a7 242.3 comment 6, at 238-40 (1980). The commentary states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Of course, it is <em>not necessary that the defendant know the law of the crime </em>for which the other is sought. For this reason the grading provision for the offense requires only that the aider know that the conduct charged or liable to be charged against the other person is of the sort proscribed by one of the more serious degrees of felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 239 (emphasis added). The enhancement provision in Model Penal Code \u00a7 242.3 requires an actor\u2019s knowledge that the underlying conduct is of the sort proscribed by a serious felony, and not actual knowledge of the underlying crime\u2019s legal classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Accordingly, we hold that RSA 642:3, II does not require that the defendant know the legal classification of the underlying crime. Having established that RSA 642:3, II does not require that the defendant know the legal classification of the underlying armed robbery, we conclude that the indictment provides sufficient notice of the crime for which the defendant was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Finally, in light of our holding, we need not address the defendant\u2019s argument that the State failed to prove her knowledge of the underlying crime\u2019s legal classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b615-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
