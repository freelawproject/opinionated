In addition, Brown requests that we grant a motion for attorney\u2019s fees associated with a prior appeal to this court. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">This is Brown\u2019s second appeal on the issue of notice. Both appeals arose from the following facts as adduced at the most recent hearing before the board in October 1995. Brown was employed as a laborer during the construction of the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in January 1982. A subsidiary of respondent Perini Construction (Perini) was a subcontractor at the Seabrook construction project. The respondent\u2019s insurer, Commercial Union Insurance Company (Commercial Union), was the workers\u2019 compensation carrier for the entire Seabrook project. Brown testified that on January 13, 1982, he suffered an injury to his elbow and upper arm while lifting some construction materials at the Seabrook site. Brown stated that he continued working despite the pain in his arm. He further testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>that when the pain failed to subside two days later, he reported the injury to two of Perini\u2019s foremen who told Brown to \u201cget it on the record\u201d by reporting the injury to the on-site nurse, Kenneth Weller. Although Nurse Weller did not remember Brown\u2019s visit to the first-aid station at Seabrook, he did complete a \u201cMinor Injury Report\u201d detailing the time and date of Brown\u2019s treatment and nature of the injury. The report indicates that Nurse Weller instructed Brown to obtain an orthopedic evaluation and \u201ckeep us informed.\u201d Brown subsequently saw Dr. Albright, who recommended that Brown have surgery on his arm. According to Brown, he refused surgery and continued working at Seabrook because he could not afford to take time off from work. Brown testified that he sought no further treatment until 1991, and he eventually had surgery on his elbow in January 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u25a0 Brown filed a notice of accidental injury form with the department of labor in October 1991 and was subsequently denied benefits by Commercial Union. Brown\u2019s claim with the department of labor was denied in April 1992 on the basis that he had failed to give his employer timely notice. <em>See </em>RSA 281:16, :17 (1977) (repealed) (employee must give notice of <em>injury </em>to employer in a timely fashion); <em>cf. </em>RSA 281-A:21-a (Supp. 1997) (enacted after the employee\u2019s alleged accident, statute requires that employee file claim for benefits within three years of date of injury). Brown appealed to the board which held, on May 5, 1993 (1993 decision), that even if the respondent and its insurer had received defective, but timely notice, they were prejudiced by Brown\u2019s nine-year delay in filing his claim. <em>See </em>RSA 281:17 (1977) (repealed) (defective notice will <em>not </em>bar a claim unless employer is prejudiced by the defect). This court reversed the board in an unpublished order dated December 14, 1994, on the basis that although the respondent received actual, albeit defective notice, there was no evidence in the record to support the board\u2019s finding of prejudice. We remanded the case for further proceedings on that issue. On remand, the board held an evidentiary hearing on October 25, 1995, and, in April 1996, denied Brown\u2019s claim (1996 decision) on the basis that the respondent and its insurer had shown that they were prejudiced by Brown\u2019s defective notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">One week after our 1994 decision remanding the case to the board for further proceedings, Brown filed a request for attorney\u2019s fees with the department of labor. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:44 (Supp. 1997); RSA 281:37-a (1987) (repealed). The respondent objected, claiming that Brown was not entitled to fees because he had not yet received any workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Although Brown included issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>regarding fees in his request for findings of fact and rulings of law before the board on remand, Brown\u2019s attorney informed the board at the October 1995 hearing that it could \u201cignore for now\u201d those findings and concentrate on the issue of prejudice. Brown subsequently filed a motion with this court for attorney\u2019s fees associated with his 1993 appeal to the board and the first appeal to this court. The respondent objected, and we subsequently accepted the fee issue for briefing and oral argument in conjunction with the pending appeal regarding the board\u2019s 1996 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\n<em>I. Prejudice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Brown contends that the board erred in finding that the respondent was prejudiced by his failure to file written notice until 1991. \u201cWe will not overturn the board\u2019s decision, except for errors of law, unless the petitioner has shown it to be clearly unreasonable or unjust.\u201d <em>Appeal of Lalime, </em>141 N.H. 534, 537, 687 A.2d 994, 997 (1996); <em>see </em>RSA 541:13 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In this case, the respondent bore the burden of proving that it was prejudiced by Brown\u2019s defective notice. <em>See Bolduc v. Company, </em>97 N.H. 360, 366, 89 A.2d 539, 541 (1952); RSA 281:17 (1977) (repealed). Whether an employer or carrier is prejudiced by defective notice of injury is a question of fact. <em>See, e.g., Pike v. Gas Service Co., </em>573 P.2d 1055, 1057 (Kan. 1978). \u201cThe board\u2019s findings of fact will not be disturbed if they are supported by competent evidence in the record upon which the board\u2019s decision reasonably could have been made.\u201d <em>Appeal of Kehoe, </em>141 N.H. 412, 415, 686 A.2d 749, 752 (1996) (citation omitted). Although the determination of prejudice is one of fact, when it may properly be asserted is a question of law, <em>see Bunten v. Davis, </em>82 N.H. 304, 311, 133 A. 16, 20 (1926), reviewable <em>de novo </em>by this court. <em>Cf. Appeal of Hooker, </em>142 N.H. 40, 47, 694 A.2d 984, 988 (1997); RSA 541:13.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The board found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">had Commercial Union/Perini received proper notice, this case would have been investigated, reserved and tracked in a manner [which] is now impossible. Even activities which are not impossible at this stage . . . are likely to be unduly expensive to the carrier/employer due to the absence of information on witnesses\u2019 whereabouts. Memories have clearly faded. It is impossible to encourage early medical treatment which may have reduced the severity of the harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>On appeal, Brown contends that because the respondent and its insurer failed to properly follow workers\u2019 compensation procedures established by statute and their own policies regarding injury reporting, the respondent cannot now claim prejudice. We agree. Three witnesses testified that given the sheer size of the Seabrook project \u2014 which employed over ten thousand workers \u2014 the respondent and its insurer, apparently with the blessing of the department of labor, developed their own method of reporting workplace injuries. Specifically, when an employee was injured at the site, he or she would report to the on-site nurse, who would fill out a \u201cminor injury card.\u201d Only if the injury required outside care and the expenditure of money would a first report of injury be filed with the department of labor and insurance carrier. Normally, the insurance carrier would not be put on notice to manage and adjust the claim until after the first report of injury was filed. Notably, this <em>ad hoc </em>policy was in direct conflict with the then-existing statute that required employers to file a first report of injury with the department of labor within five days of the accident. <em>See </em>RSA 281:46 (1987) (repealed). An official of Commercial Union testified that the purpose of this policy was to assist the employer, department of labor, and carrier in managing the injury reporting system given the large volume of minor injuries that occurred at the Seabrook construction site.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The on-site nurse testified further that \u201cnotice of accidental injury forms\u201d to be completed by the employee, <em>see </em>RSA 281:18 (1977) (repealed) (employee must inform employer in writing of accidental injury), were not available on-site, and that employees were not instructed to fill them out. Instead, the nurse testified that \u201c[a]ll the paperwork, as far as [workers\u2019 compensation], was to go through my office.\u201d The on-site nurse further admitted that even if an injured employee was sent to an outside physician for additional treatment, the employee was not ordinarily informed that if the employee failed to report back to the on-site nurse, a first report of injury would not be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Accordingly, we find that it is unreasonable as a matter of law for the respondent now to claim that it was prejudiced by lack of notice under a reporting system established for the respondent\u2019s convenience. Brown acted in accordance with the procedures set up by the respondent and its insurer by going to the on-site nurse to \u201cget [an account of his injury] on the record.\u201d Although the evidence on the record supports the board\u2019s finding that had the respondent and its insurer received proper notice, Brown\u2019s claim would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>been more promptly investigated, making it less difficult for the respondent and its insurer to process the claim, we hold as a matter of law that prejudice of the employer\u2019s own doing is not sufficient to bar the claim. <em>Cf. McIntire v. Woodall, </em>140 N.H. 228, 230, 666 A.2d 934, 936 (1995) (party\u2019s failure to cure potential prejudice precludes finding of prejudice). Brown cannot now be faulted for the fact that neither the respondent nor its agents apparently followed up a report of injury made pursuant to the respondent\u2019s own procedures. Accordingly, we reverse the board\u2019s ruling and remand this case to the board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\n<em>II. Attorney\u2019s Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Brown filed requests with both this court and the department of labor for attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with Brown\u2019s first appeal to both the board and this court. As a preliminary matter, the respondent argues that we should decline to decide the issue of attorney\u2019s fees because Brown\u2019s attorney informed the board at the October 1995 hearing that it could \u201cignore for now\u201d the issue of fees. Furthermore, the respondent asserts that Brown did not file a motion for fees directly with the board and likewise failed to raise the issue in his motion for rehearing of the board\u2019s 1996 decision. Review of board decisions is governed by RSA chapter 541. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:43, I(c) (Supp. 1997). RSA 541:4 (1997) provides that a motion for rehearing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">shall set forth fully every ground upon which it is claimed that the decision or order complained of is unlawful or unreasonable. No appeal from any order or decision of the [board] shall be taken unless the appellant shall have made application for rehearing as herein provided, and when such application shall have been made, no ground not set forth therein shall be urged, relied on, or given any consideration by the court, unless the court for good cause shown shall allow the appellant to specify additional grounds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">In his motion for fees and in his brief, however, Brown argued that RSA 281-A:44, I, is vague as to the procedure to be followed for requesting an award of fees and costs. We agree. The current version of RSA 281-A:44, I (Supp. 1997) and its predecessors in effect during the pendency of this case, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:44, I (Supp. 1992) (amended 1990, 1993); RSA 281:37-a (1987) (repealed), state only that reasonable fees shall be approved by the appellate body, but do not establish any procedural rules for applying for those fees. <em>See also </em>Laws 1969, 187:1 (enactment of fee provision). Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>given the unique nature of this case, <em>cf. Appeal of </em>Griffin, 140 N.H. 650, 654, 671 A.2d 541, 543 (1996), and the fact that heretofore claimants have not received any guidance on the proper procedure to be used to apply for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, we believe that the issue is properly before us. <em>See </em>RSA 541:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Accordingly, we turn to the issue of whether Brown is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs under the workers\u2019 compensation statute. RSA 281-A:44, I (Supp. 1997) currently provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">In any dispute over the amount of the benefit payable under this chapter which is appealed to the board or supreme court or both, the employee, if such employee prevails, shall be entitled to reasonable counsel fees and costs as approved by the board or court ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\"><em>See </em>N.H. ADMIN. RULES, Lab 510.05. As a preliminary matter, we note that the provision for \u201ccosts\u201d was added to the statute in 1993, <em>see </em>Laws 1993, 105:1, and it is unclear whether an employee injured before the effective date of the statute is entitled to collect costs. Because the parties did not raise or argue this issue in the present appeal, and in light of our disposition of this issue, we express no opinion as to whether Brown is entitled to \u201ccosts.\u201d <em>See Raudonis v. Ins. Co. of North America, </em>137 N.H. 57, 60, 623 A.2d 746, 748 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The current version of RSA 281-A:44, I (Supp. 1997), and its predecessors, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:44, I (Supp. 1992) (amended 1990, 1993); RSA 281:37-a (1987) (repealed); Laws 1969, 187:1, require that an employee prevail before fees will be awarded. Brown contends that he is entitled to fees related to his appeals to the compensation appeals board and this court from the April 1992 denial of benefits by the department of labor. He argues that he \u201cprevailed\u201d under the statute when we reversed the May 1993 decision of the board in December 1994. The respondent contends that Brown did not \u201cprevail\u201d in December 1994 because Brown had yet to receive any monetary benefits under the statute. Accordingly, we must determine whether Brown prevailed under the statute, and if so, to what extent he prevailed and is <em>entitled </em>to collect fees. <em>See City of Manchester v. Doucet, </em>133 N.H. 680, 683, 582 A.2d 288, 290 (1990) (term \u201cshall\u201d in statute signifies entitlement of prevailing party) (decided under prior law).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">We are the final arbiter of the meaning of the workers\u2019 compensation statute, and \u201c[t]he nature and extent of compensation to the injured employee ... is governed by the express statutory language and that which can be fairly implied therefrom.\u201d <em>Rooney v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>Ins. <em>Co., </em>138 N.H. 637, 638-39, 645 A.2d 52, 53 (1994) (quotation omitted). If the language of the statute is ambiguous, we will adopt a construction favorable to the claimant \u201cin order to give the broadest reasonable effect to the remedial purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation laws.\u201d <em>Appeal of Griffin, </em>140 N.H. at 654, 671 A.2d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The term \u201cprevail\u201d is not defined in the statute. <em>See generally </em>RSA 281-A:2 (Supp. 1997); RSA 281:2 (1987) (repealed). Accordingly, we first look to its plain meaning for guidance. <em>See Board of Water Comm\u2019rs, Laconia Water Works v. Mooney, </em>139 N.H. 621, 626, 660 A.2d 1121, 1125 (1995). \u201cPrevail\u201d has been defined as \u201cto be or become effective or effectual: be successful.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1787 (unabridged ed. 1961). Applying that definition would lead us to conclude that Brown is entitled to fees because he was \u201csuccessful\u201d in the first appeal before this court. That narrow definition, of course, does not answer the central question of this appeal; namely, to what <em>extent </em>a claimant must succeed before entitlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">We conclude that the remedial purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation law is best served by a rule that encourages claimants with meritorious appeals to seek compensation through the appeals process, <em>cf. Galloway v. Chicago-Soft, Ltd., </em>142 N.H. 752, 759-60, 713 A.2d 982, 986 (1998) (awarding attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to wage claim statute), while discouraging unnecessary litigation, <em>see Bothwick v. State, </em>119 N.H. 583, 589, 406 A.2d 462, 466 (1979). Further, the compensatory purpose of the statute is advanced when competent counsel is available to all injured workers. <em>See Wise Mechanical Contractors v. Bignell, </em>718 P.2d 971, 975 (Alaska 1986). <em>See generally Seppala &amp; Aho Constr. Co. v. Elton, </em>119 N.H. 634, 636-37, 406 A.2d 460, 462 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Accordingly, we hold that in order for a claimant who initiates the appeal process to \u201cprevail\u201d for purposes of RSA 281-A:44, I, that claimant, as a result of the appeal to that appellate body, must have secured a legal right or financial benefit greater than he or she had received prior to the appeal. <em>Cf. Petition of Blake, </em>137 N.H. 43, 50, 623 A.2d 741, 745 (1993); <em>Bothwick, </em>119 N.H. at 589, 406 A.2d at 466. If the employer initiates the appeal, fees are appropriate when the claimant prevails in the defense of his or her entitlement. <em>See Appeal of Staniels, </em>142 N.H. 794, 797, 709 A.2d 1325, 1327 (1998); <em>cf. Doucet, </em>133 N.H. at 681-83, 582 A.2d at 289-90 (claimant entitled to fees in appeal by employer after superior court affirmed decision of labor department). Of course, any fee awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>must still be reasonable. <em>See Doucet, </em>133 N.H. at 683, 582 A.2d at 290 (setting forth criteria to determine reasonableness of fee awarded under workers\u2019 compensation statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The respondent argues that it is inappropriate to award fees in this instance because Brown has not yet recovered payments under the statute. In <em>Bothwick, </em>119 N.H. at 589, 406 A.2d at 466, we concluded that payment of fees was not appropriate where the claimant unsuccessfully appealed the amount of the award granted by the labor department, since the claimant had not \u201cbenefited as a result of [the] decision.\u201d We did not, however, define the \u201cbenefit\u201d requirement alluded to, nor did we limit \u201cbenefit\u201d to monetary gain. <em>Id. </em>We hold that a \u201cbenefit\u201d entitling the claimant to fees is not limited to payment of compensation. It could include the grant of a nonmonetary benefit, such as a new hearing. Accordingly, the respondent\u2019s argument that Brown is not entitled to fees because Brown has not received any workers\u2019 compensation benefits in excess of those ordered by the hearing officer is correct to the extent that thus far Brown has not received any additional rights or compensation as a result of his 1993 and 1995 appeals to the board. If on remand, however, the board awards compensation to Brown, he will then be entitled to receive reasonable attorney\u2019s fees associated with all proceedings before the board. Brown is entitled, however, to fees incurred on his appeals to this court because in both cases he received a right \u2014 the right to have a hearing on prejudice in the first appeal and a hearing on entitlement to benefits on remand from this appeal \u2014 that he did not possess prior to either appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">We note that fee provisions in some States\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation statutes specifically define \u201cprevail\u201d as including only cases where a claimant receives benefits under the act. Courts in those jurisdictions will grant fees only after compensation has been awarded. <em>See Estes v. N.C. State University, </em>449 S.E.2d 762, 764-65 (N.C. Ct. App. 1994); <em>Ayotte v. United Services, Inc., </em>567 A.2d 430, 434 (Me. 1989); <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Guerra, </em>582 P.2d 819, 824 (N.M. 1978). Our statute contains no such limitation, and since \u201c[t]he legislature must be presumed to know the meaning of words, and to have used the words of a statute advisedly,\u201d <em>Caswell v. BCI Geonetics, Inc., </em>121 N.H. 1048, 1050, 437 A.2d 321, 322 (1981) (quotation omitted), we will not add words to the statute, and thereby establish limitations on recovery, that the legislature did not choose to include. <em>See Olson v. Town of Fitzwilliam, </em>142 N.H. 339, 344, 702 A.2d 318, 321 (1997); <em>cf. Corson v. Brown Prods., Inc., </em>119 N.H. 20, 23, 397 A.2d 640, 642 (1979) (\u201cthis court cannot speculate upon any supposed legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>intent not appropriately expressed in the language of the act itself\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The respondent next asserts that Brown is not entitled to recover fees incurred during the first appeal to this court because we did not adopt Brown\u2019s arguments made during that appeal. We disagree. Where the unsuccessful claims are severable analytically from the successful ones, any fee award should be reduced to exclude time spent on unsuccessful claims. <em>See Staniels, </em>142 N.H. at 798, 709 A.2d at 1327; <em>cf. Funtown USA, Inc. v. Town of Conway, </em>129 N.H. 352, 356, 529 A.2d 882, 885 (1987). The purpose of this rule is to ensure that employers are not responsible for fees associated with ancillary nonmeritorious claims simply because claimant\u2019s counsel has mounted a successful appeal on an unrelated issue. Any alleged inadequacy in Brown\u2019s arguments is relevant not to entitlement to fees, but to the degree that the amount of fees requested is reasonable. <em>See Doucet, </em>133 N.H. at 683, 582 A.2d at 290 (factors in determining reasonableness of fees include the \u201cskill employed\u201d and \u201cextent to which the attorney prevailed\u201d); <em>cf. </em>RSA 281-A:44, II (Supp. 1997). The extent to which this court adopted Brown\u2019s arguments in the first appeal, and the resulting impact, if any, on the <em>amount </em>of the fee award, is a finding of fact, to be determined after supplemental proceedings as set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Finally, given that Brown is correct in asserting that there is no clear procedure for awarding fees and costs pursuant to RSA 281-A:44, I, we take this opportunity to clarify the manner in which fees and costs will be awarded under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">As set forth above, we employ a two-step process to determine an award of costs and fees, namely: (1) whether the claimant prevailed and is entitled to fees and costs under the statute; and (2) whether the amount of the fees and costs requested are reasonable. <em>See Staniels, </em>142 N.H. at 798, 709 A.2d at 1327. We are in the best position to determine entitlement to fees and evaluate the reasonableness of the amount of fees requested for an appeal to this court. Likewise, the board is in the best position in the first instance to adjudicate an award for proceedings before it. Accordingly, any requests for fees and costs incurred after a denial of a motion for rehearing, <em>see </em>RSA 541:6 (1997), through issuance of a certificate of order by this court, <em>see </em>SUP. CT. R. 24, shall be made to this court by the filing of an appropriate motion, <em>see Staniels, </em>142 N.H. at 798, 709 A.2d at 1327, within thirty days after our decision is issued. Likewise, the board shall decide requests for attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred from the date of the decision of the hearing officer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>see </em>RSA 281-A:43, I(a), (b), through the board\u2019s ruling on a party\u2019s motion for rehearing. <em>See </em>RSA 541:5 (1997).

Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In light of our holding today, we reverse the board\u2019s ruling that the respondent was prejudiced by Brown\u2019s defective notice and remand this case to the board for proceedings on the issue of entitlement to benefits, and, if entitlement is found, the applicable fees for all proceedings before the board since the hearing officer\u2019s decision in April 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In addition, given our comprehensive discussion on the meaning of \u201cprevail\u201d under the statute and our clarification of the process to apply for fees, we shall, by separate order, require the parties to submit further pleadings on the appropriate fees for the first appeal to this court and the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b174-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
