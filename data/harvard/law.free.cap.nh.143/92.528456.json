We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Graves suffered a disabling accident in October 1993 at the Parkland Medical Center in Derry, New Hampshire, while working as a facilities technician. At that time, Graves held a second job as a press operator for Matheson Higgins Congress Press (Matheson Higgins) in Woburn, Massachusetts. The parties stipulated that Graves\u2019 combined average weekly wage at that time was $734.74, of which $309.94 was attributable to his employment at Parkland. For approximately seventeen months after the accident, Parkland\u2019s insurance carrier compensated Graves for his temporary total disability at a rate based on his combined earnings at both Parkland and Matheson Higgins. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:15, III. In March 1995, Parkland requested permission from the department of labor to reduce Graves\u2019 benefits to reflect the average weekly wages earned at Parkland only. Parkland argued that the concurrent earnings statute did not include wages earned at Matheson Higgins because, as an out-of-state employer, Matheson Higgins was not \u201csubject to\u201d the New Hampshire Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. <em>Id. </em>The department of labor agreed, and its administrative ruling was upheld upon Graves\u2019 petition to a hearings officer. Graves appealed this decision to the board, which ruled by a two-to-one vote that Graves was entitled to compensation based on his combined average weekly wage from both employers. Specifically, a majority of the board held that \u201c[although we recognize that Matheson Higgins is not a New Hampshire employer in the strict sense of the word,\u201d because RSA 281-A:15, III \u201cwas eligible for interpretation\u201d in favor of the claimant, Graves would prevail. This appeal by Parkland followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">On appeal, \u201c[w]e will uphold an order of the board unless it is erroneous as a matter of law or the [petitioner] has demonstrated that the order is unjust or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Appeal of Gelinas, </em>142 N.H. 295, 297, 700 A.2d 870, 871 (1997); <em>see </em>RSA 541:13 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Parkland argues that the board erred as a matter of law because the workers\u2019 compensation statute, on its face, prohibits inclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Graves\u2019 Massachusetts earnings in the calculation of his average weekly wage. RSA 281-A:15, III provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">Where the employee is employed as of the date of injury concurrently by 2 or more employers subject to this chapter and is disabled from any such employment, \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d shall be computed on the basis of the weekly wages received by the employee from all such employers at the time of the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Parkland argues that because Matheson Higgins is a Massachusetts company and Graves performed his employment responsibilities for it exclusively in Massachusetts, Matheson Higgins was not an employer \u201csubject to\u201d New Hampshire\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law at the time of injury. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">This court is the final arbiter of the meaning of a statute, as expressed in the words of the statute itself. <em>See Linteau v. Gauthier, </em>142 N.H. 460, 461, 703 A.2d 266, 267 (1997). \u201cWe interpret statutes not in isolation, but in the context of the overall statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Appeal of Ashland Elec. Dept., </em>141 N.H. 336, 340, 682 A.2d 710, 712 (1996) (quotations omitted). Although \u201cwe give undefined language its plain and ordinary meaning, we must keep in mind the intent of the legislation, which is determined by examining the construction of the statute as a whole, and not simply by examining isolated words and phrases found therein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 682 A.2d at 713 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe nature and extent of compensation to the injured employee ... is governed by the express statutory language and that which can be fairly implied therefrom.\u201d <em>Rooney v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>138 N.H. 637, 638-39, 645 A.2d 52, 53 (1994) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">In this case, we must determine whether at the time of injury, Matheson Higgins was \u201csubject to\u201d the statute. We have held that \u201c[workers\u2019] compensation may constitutionally be sought in any of the States with a legitimate interest in the employment relationship (State of employment contract, State of employment injury, or State of employee\u2019s residence).\u201d <em>LaBounty v. American Insurance Co., </em>122 N.H. 738, 742, 451 A.2d 161, 163 (1982). Parkland suggests that the determination of whether Matheson Higgins is subject to RSA chapter 281-A should be made by examining Graves\u2019 contact with New Hampshire in his capacity as a Matheson Higgins employee. It further argues that because Graves\u2019 responsibilities during the course of his employment at Matheson Higgins were performed exclusively in Massachusetts, that company was not subject to our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation laws. Graves, on the other hand, focuses on Matheson Higgins\u2019 contact with this State, namely that the company regularly sent salesmen and deliverymen, but not Graves, to New Hampshire. Graves contends that because Matheson Higgins conducted business in New Hampshire, it was \u201csubject to\u201d our workers\u2019 compensation laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"> RSA chapter 281-A in effect in 1993 did not clearly set forth the parameters of when an employer is subject to the statute. Use of the phrase \u201csubject to this chapter,\u201d however, plainly evinces an intent by the legislature to limit the employers and earnings that may be included in a concurrent earnings calculation. Graves argues, and the board held, that where the language of the workers\u2019 compensation statute is ambiguous, we construe it liberally in favor of the claimant \u201cin order to give the broadest reasonable effect to the remedial purpose of workers\u2019 compensation laws.\u201d <em>Appeal of Griffin, </em>140 N.H. 650, 654, 671 A.2d 541, 543 (1996). We will not, however, interpret the statute in favor of the claimant if such a construction is unreasonable. <em>See Petition of Correia, </em>128 N.H. 717, 721, 519 A.2d 263, 266 (1986); <em>cf. Atwood v. Owens, </em>142 N.H. 396, 398, 702 A.2d 333, 335 (1997) (refusing to interpret a statute in such a way as to lead to absurd results). An interpretation in favor of the claimant in this case would be unreasonable because it would effectively nullify the limiting language included in RSA 281-AG5, III. Further, it would make Matheson Higgins subject to our workers\u2019 compensation laws even though the company had no business locations in this State and the injured employee, as the board found and the record supports, \u201cnever did any work for Matheson Higgins in New Hampshire.\u201d <em>Cf. Lachapelle v. Town of Goffstown, </em>134 N.H. 478, 479, 593 A.2d 1152, 1153 (1991) (court wiil not redraft statute to codify intention not expressed in plain language of statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">In addition, we must interpret the limiting language of RSA 281-A:15, III reasonably in the context of the overall statutory scheme. <em>See Opinion of the Justices (Solid Waste Disposal), </em>135 N.H. 543, 545, 608 A.2d 870, 872 (1992). RSA chapter 281-A mandates that all employers, including homeowners hiring domestic help, <em>shall </em>secure workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage for all employees. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:5 (Supp. 1992) (amended 1994), :5-a, :6 (Supp. 1997); <em>cf. Town of Nottingham v. Harvey, </em>120 N.H. 889, 895, 424 A.2d 1125, 1129 (1980) (the term \u201cshall\u201d requires mandatory compliance). Failure to comply with these provisions renders an employer liable for a variety of fines and penalties. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>(Supp. 1992) (amended 1996). Employers with more than ten employees are required to file written safety programs with the department of labor, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:64, II (Supp. 1992) (amended 1994, 1997), and since 1994, may be subject to periodic safety inspections. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:64, IV (Supp. 1997). If we were to find Matheson Higgins subject to the chapter in this case, then it could be liable for fines if it has not complied with the statute\u2019s filing requirements even though, as the board found, \u201cMatheson Higgins is not a New Hampshire employer in the strict sense of the word.\u201d No evidence was presented as to whether Matheson Higgins made any of the filings required of employers under the statute, or even elected to \u201caccept its provisions by purchasing valid workers\u2019 compensation insurance.\u201d RSA 281-A:3 (Supp. 1997). Nor was there any evidence that any of Matheson Higgins\u2019 employees have filed for workers\u2019 compensation in this State. Graves contends, however, that at the time of his injury, Matheson Higgins was conducting business in New Hampshire. He thus argues that Matheson Higgins would have been subject to New Hampshire\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws if a Matheson Higgins employee had been injured in this State in the scope of that employment. We conclude that it would be an unreasonable reading of the statute to determine that an employer such as Matheson Higgins would be forced to comply with the above provisions because one of its employees, who is not the claimant, <em>might </em>have been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Finally, we have reviewed the record with respect to Graves\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit and warranting no further consideration. <em>See, e.g., Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322, 627 A.2d 595, 596 (1993). Accordingly, we reverse the board\u2019s order and remand this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b148-6\">BRODERICK, J., sat but did not participate in the decision; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
