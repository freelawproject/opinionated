We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-17\">In 1985, the plaintiffs purchased property in Meredith, including an easement over the property of defendants Gerald and Margaret Seidel for access to Lake Winnepesaukee and dock use. The easement is a ten-foot strip of land along the southwesterly boundary of the Seidels\u2019 property. In 1987, the Town of Meredith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>(town) adopted a zoning ordinance requiring a ten-foot setback for docks from any side property line. When the plaintiffs applied for a building permit to install a dock in 1994, the town code enforcement officer denied the application for failure to meet the ten-foot setback requirement. The plaintiffs appealed to the board and requested a variance. The board denied their request, and the plaintiffs appealed to the trial court which affirmed the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The plaintiffs also sought a declaratory judgment that the easement gave the plaintiffs, as dominant tenants, the right to a dock which the Seidels, as servient tenants, must accommodate. The trial court ruled that the authority to determine that issue \u201cis vested in other state and local authorities\u201d and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the wrong legal standard was used to deny their request for a variance, and that the trial court improperly declined to exercise jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\n<em>I. Variance Request</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The board denied the variance request because the plaintiffs failed to show that \u201c[gjranting the variance would be of benefit to the public interest.\u201d The trial court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The trial court shall set aside the board\u2019s decision only \u201cfor errors of law, unless the court is persuaded by the balance of probabilities, on the evidence before it, that [the] decision was unreasonable.\u201d RSA 677:6 (1996). \u201c[W]e will uphold the trial court\u2019s decision unless it is not supported by the evidence or is erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Olszak v. Town of New Hampton, </em>139 N.H. 723, 724, 661 A.2d 768, 770 (1995). The trial court affirmed the board\u2019s decision requiring the plaintiffs to show that \u201cgranting the variance would be of benefit to the public interest.\u201d The plaintiffs argue that this standard placed a higher burden on them than is required by statute. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Pursuant to RSA 674:33,1(b) (1996), the board has the power to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">[authorize ... [a] variance from the terms of the zoning ordinance as <em>will not be contrary to the public interest, </em>if, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">(Emphasis added.) When determining the meaning of a statute, we first look to its language. <em>N.E. Brickmaster v. Town of Salem, </em>133 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>N.H. 655, 658, 582 A.2d 601, 602 (1990). RSA 674:33, I(b) plainly states that a variance should be granted when it \u201cwill not be contrary to the public interest.\u201d Therefore, imposing a higher burden was an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Despite the statute\u2019s clear and unambiguous language, the board required the plaintiffs to show that \u201cgranting the variance would benefit the public interest.\u201d We used similar language in <em>Fortuna v. Zoning Board of Manchester, </em>noting that the board of adjustment found granting the variance \u201cwas not contrary to the public interest and was, in fact, beneficial to the public interest in that the present traffic congestion . . . will be reduced.\u201d <em>Fortuna v. Zoning Board of Manchester, </em>95 N.H. 211, 212-13, 60 A.2d 133, 135 (1948). This observation, however, merely noted that because the plaintiff met a burden higher than statutorily required, the board properly granted the variance. <em>See also, e.g., Labrecque v. Town of Salem, </em>128 N.H. 455, 458, 514 A.2d 829, 830 (1986) (variance grant upheld when applicant showed it would be in the public interest). In cases where a variance has been denied, our decisions have consistently rested on an applicant\u2019s failure to meet the statutory burden. <em>See, e.g., Shaw v. City of Manchester, </em>120 N.H. 529, 532, 419 A.2d 394, 395 (1980) (trial court\u2019s decision to set aside variance proper in order to avoid \u201charm to the public interest\u201d). Hence, our decision today clarifies that our prior decisions interpreting RSA 674:33, 1(b) should not be read to imply an applicant must meet any burden higher than required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The town argues that even though the board applied an erroneous standard, the plaintiffs still failed to offer any evidence to meet the statutory burden. The record, however, shows the plaintiffs presented some evidence that granting the variance would not be contrary to the public interest. Therefore, we remand to the superior court with instructions to remand to the board to determine, applying the correct standard, whether a variance should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\n<em>II. Declaratory Judgment Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">In the declaratory judgment action, the plaintiffs asked the court to find that maintaining a dock is a reasonable use of their easement, and to order the Seidels to modify their dock as necessary to allow the plaintiffs to obtain a dock permit from local and State authorities. The court found the plaintiffs had a valid easement for access to the lake. The court ruled, however, that it lacked jurisdiction to determine whether maintaining a dock is a reasonable use of the plaintiffs\u2019 property rights as granted in the easement because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>authority to regulate docks is vested in other State and local authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The superior court has jurisdiction over civil actions for which other special provision has not been made. <em>See </em>RSA 491:7 (1997); <em>see also Dumont v. Town of Wolfeboro, </em>137 N.H. 1, 5, 622 A.2d 1238, 1240-41 (1993). Further, the legislature has specifically provided for petitions to be brought in superior court to resolve disputes between persons claiming an interest in real property. <em>See </em>RSA 498:5-a (1997); <em>Radkay v. Confalone, </em>133 N.H. 294, 297, 575 A.2d 355, 357 (1990). In declining to exercise jurisdiction, the court cited the statutory authority empowering the State Wetlands Board and city councils to regulate docks. <em>See </em>RSA 482-A:3, I (1992) (amended 1996, 1997); RSA 47:17, VII (1991). RSA 482-A:3, I, in pertinent part provides: \u201cNo person shall . . . construct any structures in or . . . adjacent to any waters of the state without a permit from the wetlands board.\u201d This grant of authority to the wetlands board to regulate, however, does not include the power to determine the relative rights of property owners. RSA 47:17, VII grants authority to city councils to enact bylaws and ordinances \u201c[t]o regulate all streets and public ways, wharves, [and] docks.\u201d This statute, like RSA 482-A:3, I, does not provide towns with the authority to determine the relative rights of property owners. Because no other provision has been made by statute, <em>see </em>RSA 491:7, and the superior court has jurisdiction to resolve disputes between persons claiming an interest in real property, the court erred when it declined to exercise jurisdiction. Therefore, we remand to the superior court to determine whether the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed dock is a reasonable use of their property rights under the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">We have reviewed the record and find that the remaining issue raised before us is, \u201cunder the circumstances of this case, without merit, and do[es] not warrant further discussion.\u201d <em>Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322, 627 A.2d 595, 596 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b382-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
