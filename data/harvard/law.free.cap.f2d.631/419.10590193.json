This Court affirmed the conviction on appeal but remanded the case to determine whether the written charge given to the jurors was the same as the oral charge given to the jurors from the bench, in order to assure compliance with the Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 753(b). <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>607 F.2d 153, 154-55 (5th Cir. 1979). On remand, the District Court determined that the written charge and oral charge were in fact the same. The District Court subsequently denied Taylor\u2019s motion for leave to proceed In Forma Pauperis, on the grounds that any appeal would be \u201cfrivolous.\u201d Taylor appeals from denial of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">We pretermit a determination of the propriety of the District Court\u2019s denial of Taylor\u2019s motion for leave to proceed In Forma Pauperis and address the merits. The only issue on which Taylor is entitled to an appeal at this point is the jury charge issue. We have made an independent examination of the oral charge, which the Court Reporter has certified was given by the <em>judge </em>from the bench, and the written charge given the jurors. The District Court determined that the two charges were identical. The one technical requirement which we ordered to be satisfied on remand was, therefore, clearly satisfied and any appeal on this point is without merit. The District Court\u2019s memorandum opinion, therefore, is summarily affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-11\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this case summarily. See <em>Groendyke Transportation, Inc. v. Davis, </em>5 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d 1158.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
