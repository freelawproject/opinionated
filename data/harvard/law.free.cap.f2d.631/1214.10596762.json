BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1295-18\">This is one of a spring tide of appeals resulting from the 1972 amendments to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA or Act), 33 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>The employer, Trotti &amp; Thompson, Inc., and its workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier, Insurance Company of North America, appeal from a decision by the Benefits Review Board (BRB) awarding benefits to Lowell P. Crawford, a carpenter injured while building a pier at the Port of Beaumont, Texas. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-19\">\n<em>I. What Happened?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-20\">Crawford was a carpenter for Trotti &amp; Thompson from 1958 to 1973. During that time he worked intermittently on the construction of highways, bridges, refineries, and a number of piers. For approximately six months prior to his injury, Crawford was involved in the construction of a large pier within the Port of Beaumont, extending into the Neches River, a major navigational waterway. The new pier was to become a part of the Port and to be used in the loading and unloading of vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-21\">The pier-construction process is well-known.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the record in this case shows, in the early stages the vast majority of the work takes place on floating barges. First, numerous pilings are driven into the bottom of the waterway. Support hangers are attached to the tops of the pilings. Progressing outward from the shore, the pilings are initially connected with narrow steel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>beams.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wooden forms-built by carpenters on the floating barges-are then hoisted onto these strut beams and filled with concrete. Crawford, as most carpenters, was primarily involved in building the forms, although he also assisted in the hoisting and concrete-pouring operations. Not infrequently, in hoisting and in moving the barges from, place to place, Crawford donned a life jacket and worked in the water itself. In all, about 90% of his time was spent working on the barges; the rest was either on the pier structure or actually floating in water itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">Crawford\u2019s injury occurred as he was standing out over the water on one of the steel beams of the pier structure. He was directing a crane operator in the movement of a steel beam when the beam slipped out of the chain holding it. The beam struck Crawford, knocking him onto a concreted portion of the uncompleted pier and severely injuring his right arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-13\">The issues before us relate solely to whether Crawford was within the jurisdictional confines of the LHWCA at the time of injury. First, Crawford must have been working on a covered maritime situs<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> within \u00a7 903(a). Secondly, he must have had the status<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of a covered employee under \u00a7 902(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Our resolution of these issues is aided by the decision of the Fourth Circuit in a factually similar case, <em>Brown &amp; Root, Inc. v. Joyner, </em>607 F.2d 1087 (1979), cert. <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 2960, 64 L.Ed.2d 837 (1980), by a recent decision of the Supreme Court, <em>P.C. Pfeiffer Co. v. Ford, </em>444 U.S. 69, 100 S.Ct. 328, 62 L.Ed.2d 225, 1979 A.M.C. 2319 (1979), and by extensive discussions in decisions of our Court. <em>See Jacksonville Shipyards, Inc. v. Perdue, </em>539 F.2d 533, 1976 A.M.C. 1934 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>vacated and remanded in part, </em>432 U.S. 904, 97 S.Ct. 2967, 53 L.Ed.2d 1088, <em>aff\u2019d on remand, </em>575 F.2d 79, 1978 A.M.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>2672 (1978), <em>aff\u2019d in part sub nom., P.C. Pfeiffer Co. v. Ford, supra; Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp. v. Morgan, </em>551 F.2d 61, 1977 A.M.C. 987 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Alabama Dry Dock &amp; Shipbuilding Co. v. Kininess, </em>554 F.2d 176, 1977 A.M.C. 1650 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 903, 98 S.Ct. 299, 54 L.Ed.2d 190, 1978 A.M.C. 1894 (1977); <em>Odom Construction Co. v. United States Department of Labor, </em>622 F.2d 110 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-4\">\n<em>II. Situs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">The pre-1972 LHWCA did not require that an injured employee have a maritime status. Instead, the primary requirement was that the injury have occurred \u201cupon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock). .. . \u201d LHWCA of 1927, ch. 509, \u00a7 3(a), 44 Stat. 1426. This situs requirement was interpreted to incorporate the boundary line laid down in <em>Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, </em>244 U.S. 205, 37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086 (1917). The <em>Jensen </em>line ran along the water\u2019s edge, but also extended out along the edge of structures such as piers, which were over navigable waters but permanently attached to the land. Thus <em>Nacirema Operating Co. v. Johnson, </em>396 U.S. 212, 90 S.Ct. 347, 24 L.Ed.2d 371, 1969 A.M.C. 1967 (1969), held that an injury occurring on a pier attached to the land\u2014hence on the landward side of the <em>Jensen </em>line-was not covered by the pre-1972 Act. \u2019However, an employee knocked off the pier and injured when he hit the water was covered, since the injury was consumated on the seaward side of the <em>Jensen </em>line. <em>See id. </em>at 225, 90 S.Ct. at 355, 24 L.Ed.2d at 381, 1969 A.M.C. at 1976 (Douglass, J., dissenting) (discussing <em>Marine Stevedoring Corp. v. Oosting, </em>238 F.Supp. 78 (E.D.Va.1965), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>398 F.2d 900 (4th Cir. 1968)). The Supreme Court decried the anomaly<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in coverage of the pre-1972 Act, but stated that the remedy was up to Congress. <em>Id. </em>at 223-24, 90 S.Ct. at 353-54, 24 L.Ed.2d at 380, 1969 A.M.C. at 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-8\">Despite the fact that Crawford spent at least 90% of his time seaward of the <em>Jensen </em>line, the portion of the uncompleted pier upon which he was standing and onto which he fell when injured was apparently<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> attached to the land. Thus Crawford would not have met the situs requirement of the pre-1972 Act. Crawford\u2019s temporary presence on the uncompleted pier-even though he normally spent more than 90% of his time on barges or in the water-would have deprived him of coverage under the pre-1972 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">In 1972, Congress amended the Act to, among other things, reduce the anomalies by moving the Act\u2019s coverage considerably inland. This was done with specific thought to longshoremen who constantly walked and worked across the <em>Jensen </em>line while loading and unloading docked vessels. <em>P.C. Pfeiffer Co. v. Ford, supra. </em>In order to reduce the anomalies of shifting coverage, Congress added a list of areas to the \u201cnavigable waters . .. (including any dry dock) ...\u201d provision. As broadened, the situs requirement now covers any injury</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIlx\">occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any adjoining pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway, or other adjoin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>ing area customarily used by an employer \u25a0in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 903(a) (note 3, supra). Thus piers and wharves have joined dry docks (and by implication marine railways) as landward expansions of the Act\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">The employer-insurer appellants agree that a completed pier is covered by the express language of the amended situs requirement, but argue that an uncompleted pier is not covered. They argue that the word \u201cpier\u201d must be construed in the same fashion as the later words \u201cor other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading, offloading, repairing, or building a vessel.\u201d They argue that an uncompleted pier cannot be \u201ccustomarily used.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In support of this interpretation, appellants rely on our decision in <em>Jacksonville Shipyards, Inc. v. Perdue, supra </em>(Skipper\u2019s case.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">In Skipper\u2019s case, we considered whether a \u201cterminal\u201d-a specifically listed area, like a \u201cpier\u201d-was a covered situs. Skipper was injured in an area across the river from an active shipyard, an area which had not been used, however, for maritime fabrication for about one year. We found that such an abandoned area was not a covered situs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We did not, however, have occasion to consider an area under construction, which was intended for future maritime use. Nor did Skipper\u2019s case involve a situs such as a pier, being built over a clearly covered situs such as the navigable waters.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\">Notwithstanding some broad dictum concerning future use in <em>Perdue, </em>we feel that there is a distinction between an area which before construction is a covered situs but is in the process of being put to some future use which will also qualify as a covered situs, and an area which was once a covered situs but is now abandoned, with no plans for future use as a covered situs. <em>Perdue </em>involved only this latter type of area-the separate fabrication facility in which Skipper was injured. That separate, abandoned area is far different from the construction area of the pier or dry dock at an already covered situs on the navigable waters. The construction area of a pier or dry dock is after all simply being transformed from one defined maritime use to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-12\">Precedent from the pre-1972 Act involving dry docks, and a recent application by the Fourth Circuit under the amended Act supports our approach. In <em>Travelers Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>McManigal, </em>139 F.2d 949, 1944 A.M.C. 377 (4th Cir. 1944), a carpenter was injured while constructing a dry dock, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>situs, once completed, specifically listed by the pre-1972 Act. The construction site had previously been covered with water, making it a previously covered situs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court looked to the maritime function which the completed dry dock would fulfill and to the fact that the area in which the dry dock was being built had previously been a situs within the Act. The Court held: <em>\u201cIt is not material that in the pending case the dry dock was not finished. </em>Not only was the locality within the maritime jurisdiction, but the work was maritime in its nature.\u201d 139 F.2d at 952,1944 A.M.C. at 388 (emphasis supplied). Thus the carpenter was awarded benefits. <em>See also Travelers Insurance Co. v. Branham, </em>136 F.2d 873, 1943 A.M.C. 1419 (4th Cir. 1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\">The Fourth Circuit recently applied this precedent to a factually identical case under the amended 1972 Act. In <em>Brown &amp; Root v. Joyner, supra, </em>the Court held that the amended Act essentially incorporated the pre-1972 interpretation of such drydock areas under construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-5\">The Board also correctly ruled that the claimants satisfied the situs test. Both Stewart and Joyner worked on various projects on the shipyard construction site after the water was pumped out and retained by bulkheads. Previously we have held that the site of a dry dock, <em>which was formerly navigable water and would be used against [sic] in support of navigation, </em>remained a part of the navigable waters of the United States during construction of the dock. <em>See Travelers Insurance Co. v. McManigai, </em>139 F.2d 949, 952 (4th Cir. 1944). Our opinion was premised in part on the concept, expressed in <em>The Raithmoor, </em>241 U.S. 166, 175, 36 S.Ct. 514, 60 L.Ed. 937 (1916), that an aid to navigation, though under construction, is of sufficient maritime import to sustain admiralty jurisdiction. Consequently, the dry dock, though under construction, was considered a part of the navigable waters of the United States even before the amendment to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a). The 1972 amendment did not change this interpretation of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAyX\">607 F.2d at 1090 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">We agree with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s recent position. Congress now expressly prescribes that situs is satisfied for injuries occurring upon any pier adjoining navigable waters. And where pre-1972 injuries have been held covered, where occurring during the construction of a dry dock, a pier now being a covered situs the same rule should apply during its construction. Both are sites carved out of a clearly covered situs-the navigable water. Although we minimize their importance, both are aids to maritime commerce and are used in support of navigation even though the analogy to traditional aids to navigation is a little farfetched.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That a pier is now a part of the same parenthetical list in which prior to 1972 only a dry dock appeared, is further evidence that Congress expected an uncompleted pier to be treated like an uncomplet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>ed dry dock. <em>Cf. Burnet v. Harmel, </em>287 U.S. 103, 108, 53 S.Ct. 74, 76, 77 L.Ed. 199, 203 (1932) (construing congressional intent). In sum, we hold that under the amended Act an uncompleted pier, under active construction, is a covered situs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">\n<em>III. Status</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">While Congress broadened the situs requirement of the LHWCA in 1972, it also added the positive requirement that an injured employee have been engaged in \u201cmaritime employment,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 2(3) of the 1972 Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 902(3) (note 4, <em>supra). </em>This status requirement extends coverage under the Act only to \u201cany person engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations, and any harbor worker including a ship repairman, shipbuilder, and shipbreaker. . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>(note 4, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">In <em>P.C. Pfeiffer Co. v. Ford, supra, </em>the Supreme Court resolved two issues concerning the status requirement which are relevant to this appeal. First, the Court held that the amended Act did not necessarily cover all employees who, prior to 1972, would have walked in and out of coverage (across the <em>Jensen </em>line) during any given day. The status requirement was held to embody \u201can occupational rather than a geographic concept.. . . \u201d 444 U.S. at 78, 100 S.Ct. at 335, 62 L.Ed.2d at 234,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 1979 A.M.C. at 2330. Second, the Act\u2019s specific coverage of longshoremen, harbor workers, etc., was held to comprise only \u201ca part of the larger group of activities that make up \u2018maritime employment\u2019 . . .,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 77 n.7, 100 S.Ct. at 334 n.7, 62 L.Ed.2d at 233 n.7, 1979 A.M.C. at 2325 n.7. The status requirement therefore extends coverage to occupations beyond those specifically named by the statute. <em>See Odom Construction Co. v. United States Department of Labor, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">Beyond those general principles, however, <em>Pfeiffer </em>does not itself resolve the instant appeal. Fortunately, two of our decisions do go a great way towards that end. The first, <em>Alabama Dry Dock &amp; Shipbuilding Co. v. Kininess, supra, </em>is factually analogous. There, the shipbuilding company had purchased a disassembled crane. The crane, like a new dock under construction, had not been put to use by the company. Kininess was injured while he was sandblasting the parts of the crane as part of the crane assembly process. We first held that the employee\u2019s status was determined by whether his work directly furthered the shipbuilding goals of his employer. In the case at hand, Crawford\u2019s work undeniably furthered a similar goal of the Port of Beaumont: loading and unloading vessels. We secondly held in <em>Kininess </em>that initial construction was no different under the LHWCA than repair work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1UL\">... coverage under the Act should not depend on whether the crane was in actual operation when Kininess was injured .... Repair and maintenance of machines used in shipbuilding is an essential aspect of the business. .. . While a distinction might be drawn between a crane being held in storage pending use and an active crane disassembled for repair, the policy of liberal construction indicates that such fine lines are inappropriate when determining coverage under the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">554 F.2d at 178, 1977 A.M.C. at 1652 (citations omitted). <em>See also Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp. v. Morgan, supra </em>(no distinction between repair and construction); <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Graham, </em>573 F.2d 167, 170, 1979 A.M.C. 99, 103 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 979, 99 S.Ct. 563, 58 L.Ed.2d 649 (1978). Again, the instant case analogously involves initial construction rather than repair of an existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>dock. Thus the assembly work in <em>Kininess </em>was held within the status requirement of the Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-4\">Our very recent decision in <em>Odom Construction Co. v. United States Department of Labor, supra, </em>reinforces the teachings of <em>Kininess. </em>There, large concrete blocks which had been used for mooring barges and other vessels had slipped from the bank into a waterway. Odom Construction Co. was hired to move the blocks back ashore. One of the company\u2019s employees, Maze, was assigned to the job. Maze was usually a land-based construction worker and was not a part of the company\u2019s maritime construction group. The company made two status arguments on appeal. First, it argued that moving the blocks was not maritime work and so was not covered by the Act. We held that the work was maritime, however, because (i) maritime commerce was furthered by replacing the blocks, which could then be used to tie up barges, for loading and unloading purposes, and (ii) the restoration of such a facility was traditionally regarded as a maritime activity rather than as one only \u201cperipherally\u201d related to maritime matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">The second status argument presented was that Maze was normally a land-based construction worker and the status requirement was not met since his usual work was nonmaritime. Based on <em>Thibodaux v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>580 F.2d 841, 1979 A.M.C. 1794 (5th Cir. 1978) (dual test of either moment of injury or overall occupation), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>442 U.S. 909, 99 S.Ct. 2820, 61 L.Ed.2d 274 (1979), we expressed doubt that anything beyond Maze\u2019s job activities at the time of injury needed to be considered. Nonetheless, we proceeded to consider the overall circumstances of Maze\u2019s employment. We decided that the status requirement encompassed more than the <em>particular </em>employee\u2019s assignment. The employer\u2019s overall assignment activities had to be considered. Thus we stated that Congress did not intend the status requirement of the Act to allow employers to escape liability \u201csimply by allowing each employee to do only a limited amount of maritime work.\u201d 622 F.2d at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">The arguments presented here by the employer-insurer concerning Crawford\u2019s status are completely answered by these decisions. Any distinction between initial construction of a pier and repair of a pier is irrelevant under <em>Kininess </em>and <em>Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp. v. Morgan, supra. </em>Second, building a pier is as much a maritime activity as restoring a mooring facility, <em>Odom Construction Co. v. United States Department of Labor, supra, </em>or assembling a crane for shipbuilding, <em>Kininess.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Moreover, Crawford was assigned to his work by a company which, like Odom Construction Co., had substantial amounts of maritime construction work but which usually used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>Crawford for nonmaritime jobs. Thus the fact that Crawford usually worked land-based construction jobs does not detract from his covered status.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Consequently, our precedents establish that Crawford\u2019s work brought him within the LHWCA\u2019s status requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">The Fourth Circuit\u2019s previously discussed decision in <em>Brown &amp; Root, Inc. v. Joyner, supra, </em>again supports our determination. That \u201cCourt relied upon pre-1972 decisions construing the term \u201cemployer.\u201d The pre-1972 Act applied to \u201can employer any of whose employees are employed <em>in maritime employment </em>. ...\u201d LHWCA of 1927, ch. 509, \u00a7 2(4), 44 Stat. 1426 (emphasis supplied) (now codified at 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 902(4)). We reject the suggestion that pre-1972 constructions should be characterized as irrelevant,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and agree with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that activity which has been held to be traditionally maritime prior to 1972 \u201chas not been stripped of its maritime character by the 1972 amendments.\u201d 607 F.2d at 1090. The 1972 amendments were not intended to retract or restrict pre-1972 determinations in these respects. Although piers did not meet the <em>Jensen </em>line requirements of the pre-1972 Act, we are confident that these structures were as peculiarly maritime as any drydock, then and now. <em>Cf. Morrison-Knudson Co. v. O\u2019Leary, </em>288 F.2d 542, 1961 A.M.C. 866 (9th Cir. 1961) (construction of a dam). Certainly the work, and the attendant risk, of constructing a dry dock and a pier is very similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">In conclusion, we hold that Crawford\u2019s work in constructing a pier was \u201cmaritime employment\u201d and meets the Act\u2019s status requirement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>Because Crawford s case meets both situs and status requirements, the employer-insurer appellants fail in their challenge to the BRB\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1295-13\">. <em>E. g., Hed v.

Perdue, supra. </em>One of the fact patterns in that case was the injury to Skipper, discussed above, which occurred while he was dismantling an abandoned dock facility in order to salvage steel. But the steel was intended for construction of a nonmari-time-related manufacturing plant, and thus Skipper\u2019s work had no maritime purpose. We denied benefits because of Skipper\u2019s work was not \u201cdirectly involved\u201d with maritime functions such as loading, unloading, repairing, building or breaking a vessel. 539 F.2d at 539-40, 1976 A.M.C. at 1946. In <em>Kininess, </em>the end result of the employee\u2019s work was different from Skipper\u2019s in that there was relationship to the maritime function of shipbuilding. Just as <em>Kininess, </em>was distinguishable from Skipper\u2019s case in that respect, so too Crawford in the instant case was doing work with a substantial relationship to the maritime functions of loading and unloading vessels. Thus even assuming that this aspect of Skipper\u2019s case is still good law after <em>Pfeiffer </em>(which contains some suggestion raising doubt), <em>Kininess </em>distinguishes Skipper\u2019s case in a manner directly applicable to the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">. The employer-insurer appellants advance a further argument. They assert that a carpenter\u2019s duties are the same whether building a pier or a bridge or a highway, so that Crawford\u2019s work must have been nonmaritime. We agree that the skills used may be similar. But we also observe that many longshoremen\u2019s duties, such as those detailed in <em>Pfeiffer </em>(lifting, fastening), are the same as the duties of many nonmaritime workers. Yet those workers were held to have been engaged in maritime employment. Clearly we must look to the purpose of the work, not solely to the particular skills used.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">.Our case is even a stronger one for coverage than <em>Odom Construction Co. v. United States Dept, of Labor, supra. </em>In that case, Maze had only been assigned to the mooring restoration job for two days when injured. In our case, Crawford was working on building the pier for six months prior to his injury. The employer-insurer in our case ironically refers us to a decision by the Ninth Circuit which in a reverse sort of way we believe supports a further holding, without need to rely on the principles in <em>Odom, </em>that a six month maritime job assignment is sufficient to make Crawford\u2019s <em>overall </em>employment maritime. In <em>Cargill, Inc. v. Powell, </em>573 F.2d 561, 1978 A.M.C. 293 (9th Cir. 1977), a case recently vacated and remanded by the Supreme Court for further consideration in light of <em>Pfeiffer, supra, </em>the Ninth Circuit held that Powell was not covered by the Act even though he had been \u201coccupationally classified as a longshoreman for 17 years....\u201d 573 F.2d at 563, 1978 A.M.C. at 296. The Court found that Powell\u2019s duties during the seven months preceding his accident were nonmaritime, and held that it was his most recent tenure which controlled his status. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 1978 A.M.C. at 296. Thus, while <em>Powell\u2019s </em>result differs from the one which we reach today, its reasoning concerning the sufficiency of a seven-month time period can easily be applied to Crawford\u2019s six-month tenure on the pier construction job. Thus, <em>Powell\u2019s </em>reasoning supports our disposition of this case. But in this dynamic area it is safe to say, as the Ninth Circuit cautioned: \u201cWe do not decide whether an employee whose duties shifted every week, of every month, may ... qualify under the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564 n.4, 1978 A.M.C. at 297 n.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">. <em>Pennsylvania Rail Co. v.
