The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that Haynie was not an \u201cemployee\u201d of Tideland, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902, therefore denying his claim for compensation under the LHWCA; this decision was affirmed by the Benefits Review Board. Haynie appeals from the decision of the BRB, contending that Tideland was his employer, thus bringing him within the coverage of the LHWCA. Since under the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test there is insubstantial evidence supporting the findings of the ALJ and the Board, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-26\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-27\">Fred Haynie was a wirelining specialist involved in the oil industry. In 1973, he entered into a verbal agreement with Tideland to \u201cwork under Tideland\u2019s insurance\u201d; <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as part of the deal, Tideland received 10% of the revenue earned by Hay-nie.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>Haynie performed work for several major companies (Texaco, Kerr-McGee, etc.), (Tx. 31); at the conclusion of each job, he would submit to the particular company for which he did the work a <em>Tideland </em>work ticket specifying the time spent. This would then be invoiced by Tideland and paid by the customer directly to Tideland. Tideland would then make a check payable to Haynie for 90% of the invoice. Neither federal income taxes nor social security taxes were withheld from these checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-4\">On the basis of this arrangement, Haynie contends that he is an \u201cemployee\u201d under the provision of the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901, et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">\n<em>Proper Test of Employer-Employee Relationship</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">Haynie appeals from the decision of the BRB which affirmed the finding of the ALJ that Haynie was not an employee of Tideland for the purposes of the LHWCA. He raises two principal issues: (1) The ALJ and the Board used the improper test, <em>i. </em>e., \u201cthe right to control details\u201d test, in determining if an employer-employee relationship existed; and (2) if the proper test were used, Haynie would be found to be an employee of Tideland. The claimant also contends that, with so many factual indicia pointing to an employment relationship, the ALJ was in error in relying exclusively upon the \u201cright to control\u201d test in holding that substantial evidence obviated application of the statutory presumption that this claim falls within the coverage of the Act, see 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">\n<em>Proper Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-8\">This court has only recently articulated the proper test to be used in determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship under the LHWCA. In <em>Oilfield Safety and Machine Specialties, Inc. v. Harman Unlimited, Inc., </em>625 F.2d 1248 (5th Cir. 1980), this court held that \u201c[t]he right to control test ... is inappropriate for the LHWCA\u201d and that \u201c[t]he test that best suits the principles of the LHWCA is . . . the relative nature of the work test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-13\">We summarized the test as follows, based largely on the jurisprudential analysis and summary found in 1 C. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 43.42 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-14\">In determining the existence of an employee-employer relationship pursuant to this test, one examines the nature of the claimant\u2019s work in relation to the regular business of the employer. This examination must focus on two distinct areas: [A] the nature of the claimant\u2019s work and [B] the relation of that work to the alleged employer\u2019s regular business. In evaluating [A] the character of a claimant\u2019s work, a court should focus on various factors, including the skill required to do the work, the degree to which the work constitutes a separate calling or enterprise, and the extent to which the work might be expected to carry its own accident burden. In analyzing [B] the relationship of the claimant\u2019s work to the employer\u2019s business the factors to be examined include, among others, whether the claimant\u2019s work is a regular part of the employer\u2019s regular work, whether the claimant\u2019s work is continuous or intermittent, and whether the duration of claimant\u2019s work is sufficient to amount to the hiring of continuing services as distinguished from the contracting for the completion of a particular job.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1323-15\"><em>Oilfield Safety, </em>625 F.2d at 1253 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-16\">\n<em>Was Haynie an Employee?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-17\">The AU and the Board found that Tideland did not have the right to exercise control over the details of Haynie\u2019s work; hence, he was held not to be an employee. In reaching this determination, it was noted that Haynie always used his own equipment (Tx. 61), taxes were never withheld by Tideland,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> there was no evidence of Tideland having a right to control Haynie\u2019s work, and it was questionable if Tideland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>could remove him from a job by <em>firing </em>him. (Tx. 41, 58, 59)</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">As previously noted, however, the \u201cright to control details\u201d test, used in isolation, is not determinative of an employer-employee relationship under the LHWCA, Haynie\u2019s relation to Tideland must be examined in light of the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">The findings of the ALJ and the Board must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers Association, </em>39\u00d3 U.S. 459, 467, 88 S.Ct. 1140, 1145, 20 L.Ed.2d 30 (1968); <em>Oilfield Safety and Machine Specialties, Inc. v. Harman Unlimited, Inc., </em>625 F.2d 1248 (5th Cir. 1980). In light of the employee-employer relationship test adopted for this circuit in <em>Oilfield Safety, </em>we are unable to conclude that the finding by the ALJ and the Board of no employer-employee relationship between Haynie and Tideland was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">On the other hand, the record on appeal is inadequate to ascertain whether or not Haynie was an employee of Tideland when utilizing the relative nature of the work test, especially with regard to the factors involving the relationship of the claimant\u2019s work to the employer\u2019s business (see' [B] factors cited by <em>Oilfield Safety, supra). </em>A strong argument could be made that this hiatus should not delay recovery of benefits by the claimant, in view of the presumption in favor of coverage provided by Section 20(a) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a). Nevertheless, <em>Oilfield Safety, supra, </em>has only recently clarified the proper test for the determination of whether an employment relationship exists in agreements such as the present; we therefore deem it more fair to remand to the administrative agency for further proceedings, in the light of the views here expressed, since the hearing was held and evidence educed on the basis that a different test applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-8\">Accordingly, we vacate the denial to the claimant of compensation benefits, and we remand this claim to the administrative agency for further proceedings consistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1322-18\">. Neither the details nor the implication of \u201cworking under Tideland\u2019s insurance\u201d was described in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1323-9\">. In fact, prior to the accident, Haynie was not listed on the payroll. The sole exception to this is that taxes were withheld from Haynie\u2019s pay when he was placed on Tideland\u2019s payroll <em>after </em>his accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
