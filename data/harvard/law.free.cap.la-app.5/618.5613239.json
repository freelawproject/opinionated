The appeal was not prayed for in open court, but by petition, and the order granting the appeal does not direct that the appellee be cited and it was not cited, and has made no appearance except to move for the dismissal of the same. The appeal bond was signed by the judgment debtor only.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-26\">The motion to dismiss must prevail.
