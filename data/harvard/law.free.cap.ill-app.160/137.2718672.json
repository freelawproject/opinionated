Defendant in error, Beadles, was defendant in an action in forcible detainer brought against him in the Municipal Court by plaintiff in error, to recover possession of the first flat at 540 East Fiftieth place, Chicago, which was one of twenty-four apartments in the building. A trial by the court below, without a jury, resulted in a judgment for the defendant, and Levi brings the case here upon a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-8\" pgmap=\"155\">Beadles being the owner of the land, and having partially erected the apartment building in question, borrowed money from Levi to complete it, giving him by way of security therefor, among other things, a deed to the property, in which his wife joined. It is conceded that though absolute in form, it was in fact a deed of trust to secure the money loaned. Subsequently Levi brought suit to foreclose, and on April 2, 1906, Beadles being then, as he had for several months theretofore been, in possession of one of the twenty-four apartments in the building, a written lease for the flat was executed by Levi and Beadles, under seal, covering the period from April 1 to October 31, 1906, at $33 per month.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-9\" pgmap=\"155(11) 156(119)\">No rent in money was in fact ever paid, it being claimed by Levi, and not denied by Beadles, that Beadles\u2019 rent should be paid by his services in collecting and turning over to Levi the rent from the other twenty-three apartments, and by caring for the building. No change in the situation occurred until September 1, 1908, after which nothing was done by Beadles by way of caring for the building or collecting rents; and on September 12, 1908, Levi served a five days\u2019 notice upon Beadles, demanding payment of $33 rent for the flat for September, and notifying him that unless it was paid on or before September 17, 1908, the lease would be terminated. On the 18th day of September, 1908, this action was brought.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-5\" pgmap=\"156\">Grossberg &amp; Kompel and C. B.

Culver, for defendant in error.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b156-7\" pgmap=\"156\">Mr. Justice Baldwin</author> <p id=\"AVjP\" pgmap=\"156\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b156-8\" pgmap=\"156\">Defendant in error, Beadles, while admitting that he himself made out, signed and delivered the written lease in question to Levi, claims that it was without vitality as a lease, because, he asserts, that he prepared, executed and delivered, upon the request of Levi, who told him that it was a mere matter of form.</p> <p id=\"b156-9\" pgmap=\"156(111) 157(19)\">Beadles testifies: \u201cMr. Levi said, \u2018This is in the courts now and I may be called upon to show twenty-four leases on twenty-four flats, and I guess I will have to have you sign a lease.\u2019 I said, \u2018I am not paying any rent and I own the property, and I don\u2019t care to sign a lease.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018it is a mere matter of form; the master may require me to show twenty-four leases.\u2019 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t expect to pay any rent; I haven\u2019t paid any rent, and I don\u2019t care to sign a lease,\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 he said, \u2018I would like to have you sign this lease. You can make it out for six months or a year or any way you like.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p id=\"b157-4\" pgmap=\"157\">Beadles does not even claim that he did not understand the effect of the written lease so under seal, nor that he was in any way over-reached or deceived by Levi, except as indicated in the above testimony.</p> <p id=\"b157-5\" pgmap=\"157\">Levi concededly had the legal title to the property. Beadles saw fit to assume, by the execution and delivery of the lease, the relation of tenant, and he cannot be heard, in a proceeding at law, to deny the relationship created by the lease, until, by some act of the parties, or by operation of law, a new and different relationship is created.</p> <p id=\"b157-6\" pgmap=\"157\">Ryan v. Cooke, 172 Ill. 302, is sufficient authority for sustaining the objection to Beadles\u2019 testimony concerning his alleged conversation with Levi when the purpose of the lease was talked about.</p> <p id=\"b157-7\" pgmap=\"157\">Under section 8, chapter 80, Hurd\u2019s Statutes, the demand was sufficient.</p> <p id=\"b157-8\" pgmap=\"157\">We are satisfied that the court below erred in finding for the defendant, and the judgment is reversed and judgment entered here upon a finding of facts in favor of the plaintiff in error, for possession and costs.</p> <p id=\"b157-9\" pgmap=\"157\">We may add that it appears from the abstract and briefs that the questions involved here, as to the right of possession, are likely to be speedily determined in a chancery proceeding, and, therefore, the action of this court in this proceeding is less important.</p> <p id=\"b157-10\" pgmap=\"157\">Reversed with finding of facts.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
