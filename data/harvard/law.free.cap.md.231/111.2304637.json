The only question he raises on this appeal is the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-16\">Only the appellant and the victim, one Brantley, testified as to the circumstances surrounding the crime and their versions were conflicting. From the evidence presented the trial judge could find the following facts. After a dice game in which Brantley won the appellant\u2019s money, bad feelings developed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>and the two met in several bouts of fisticuffs during the same evening, the last of which terminated in Brantley\u2019s favor. Appellant fled, armed himself with a revolver retrieved from a hiding place, and went to a bar at which Brantley was standing. Appellant said to Brantley, \u201cI am going to kill you,\u201d took the gun from his pocket, and, when Brantley turned his back, shot him. Appellant attempted to shoot again, but the gun misfired.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We think it is obvious that there was ample evidence from which the trial court could find malice and a specific intent to murder in this assault by appellant. <em>Beall v. State, 203 </em>Md. 380. The trial court was not required to believe appellant\u2019s statement that he fired the shot when Brantley put his hand in his pocket as if to pull a gun (which, as well as the possession of a gun, was denied by Brantley). Certainly we cannot say the trial court was clearly erroneous in finding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
