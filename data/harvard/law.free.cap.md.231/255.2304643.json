Rhoads, Jr., </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-8\"><em>Russell R. Reno, Jr., Assistant Attorney General, </em>with whom were <em>Thomas B. Finan, Attorney General, William J. O\u2019Donnell, State\u2019s Attorney, </em>and <em>Joseph G. Koutz, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b274-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Appellant was convicted by a jury of assault with intent to rape Florence Scheidt, and, under another indictment, of assault upon Mildred Harmon. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in the first case, and to twenty years\u2019 confinement in the second, the sentences to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">The trial judge was correct in denying appellant\u2019s prayers relating to abandonment of purpose. The factual situation did not justify their being granted. Appellant\u2019s own testimony disclosed an assault with intent to rape. Cf. <em>Duffin v. State, </em>229 Md. 434, 184 A. 2d 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">The sentence of twenty years\u2019 confinement for assault did not constitute \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d contrary to Articles 16 and 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Cf. <em>Heath v. State, </em>198 Md. 455, 85 A. 2d 43; <em>Duff v. State, </em>229 Md. 126, 182 A. 2d 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">The fact that no members of the Negro race were upon the jury, alone, does not establish the denial of a fair and impartial trial. <em>Giles v. State, </em>229 Md. 370, 183 A. 2d 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">The fourth and fifth questions, relating to the admissibility of evidence are not before us, no objection having been made below. Maryland Rule 522 d 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">The bare allegations that appellant was \u201ca victim of circumstances,\u201d and \u201che now alleges that the State withheld evidence\u201d do not require answers. The claim, not argued in his brief (Cf. Maryland Rule 831 d 4), that \u201cthe pretrial psychiatric examination * * * [of appellant at the request of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>counsel] was only of about fifteen minutes duration and consequently incomplete\u201d was not raised below, hence it is not properly before us. Maryland Rules 885 and 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
