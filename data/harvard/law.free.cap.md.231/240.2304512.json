The officers obtained a search warrant and were admitted by the appellant to a second floor apartment to which the appellant had a key. There they found a number of lottery tickets and other paraphernalia. The tenant of the apartment testified that he had given a key to Warren and permitted him to use the apartment, but denied any knowledge of the lottery.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">We think the evidence was clearly sufficient to support the finding of the trial court that the appellant was guilty of selling lottery tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
