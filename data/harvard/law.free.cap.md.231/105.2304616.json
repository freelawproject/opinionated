This is the only question presented in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The facts are somewhat unusual. In November, 1960, the appellant obtained a judgment (in Law No. 10,852) in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, against George Washington Cemetery, Inc. Subsequently, he, as attaching judgment creditor, <em>inter alia, </em>directed the clerk of the court in Prince George\u2019s County to issue a writ of attachment on said judgment, pursuant to Maryland Rule 622 h (1958 Ed.), and to make tne writ returnable to the Superior Court of Baltimore City, to be served on American, garnishee, by leaving a copy in the hands of the State Insurance Commissioner (Code [1957], Article 48A, \u00a7 33). The clerk prepared the writ, and pursuant to Rule 622 h sent a certified copy of the docket entries in Law No. 10,852 to the Superior Court of Baltimore City. The clerk also docketed a new case, Law No. 14,817, in Prince George\u2019s County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">After service and return by the sheriff of Baltimore, American filed identical answers in the case pending in the Superior Court and in the new case (No. 14,817) in Prince George\u2019s County. The answers admitted that American had written an injunction bond on behalf of George Washington and two other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>principals for the sole protection of one Albert F. Hauser, a defendant in Equity No. B-3989 in Prince George\u2019s County in which case the bond was filed, for any loss he might sustain by reason of the issuance of an injunction; and stated that was the only \u201ccredit\u201d of George Washington held by American, therefore American had no liability to the appellant. The appellant then filed, in the Superior Court and also in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, a demand on American to produce the bond. American complied by filing photostatic copies in both courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Thereafter, appellant filed a \u201creplication\u201d and a \u201crequest for admission of facts\u201d (which was complied with) in the Superior Court, only. He also filed a motion <em>ne recipiatur </em>in the case in Prince George\u2019s County. American filed a motion for a summary judgment in the case in Prince George\u2019s County on the ground that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact. The appellant answered the motion and denied there was no dispute as to any material fact, but failed to state what material facts were disputed. In none of the papers that he filed in the case in Prince George\u2019s County did he deny the jurisdiction of the court. The appellant did not, and does not now, claim that American had any goods, chattels, credits or assets of George Washington, other than the bond (if that can come within the purview of any of the aforementioned terms). An examination of the bond, produced at appellant\u2019s request, bears out the interpretation afforded it in American\u2019s answer, mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The appellant argues that the Circuit Court of Prince George\u2019s County had no jurisdiction to entertain the motion for a summary judgment. The question gives us little difficulty. An attachment on judgment is a mode of execution and its office is essentially the same as that of a <em>fi fa. </em>Hodge &amp; McLane, <em>Law of Attachment, </em>\u00a7 251; Rule 623 a. Cf. Rule 622 h 4. But it is well recognized that even a court of general jurisdiction acts under a special and limited authority in attachment proceedings. <em>Cole v. Randall Park Holding Co., </em>201 Md. 616, 95 A. 2d 273; Hodge &amp; McLane, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 11; 6 Am. Jur. 2d, <em>Attachment and Garnishment, </em>\u00a7 13. However, such courts find ample authority in our statutes, Code (1957), Article 9, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the rules of court, Rules 622 and 623, to entertain attachment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County is such a court, and it hears and disposes of attachment cases regularly. The original judgment, upon which the attachment issued, was obtained and is recorded in that court. The principle that parties cannot confer jurisdiction, in its fundamental sense, upon a court is widely acknowledged and generally accepted. But where a court of general jurisdiction has jurisdiction over the subject matter of litigation and also the parties, it, ordinarily, has the power to decide the issues in dispute between those parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">After the clerk had inadvertently docketed the instant case, the plaintiff <em>consented </em>to an extension of time for the garnishee to plead. The garnishee, on January 17, 1961, \u201canswered,\u201d setting forth the only thing which it held that might be considered a \u201ccredit\u201d or \u201casset\u201d of George Washington, the defendant, and, at the same time, it denied that it or George Washington had any liability to the plaintiff as a result of the bond. This gave the court jurisdiction over the garnishee (Maryland Rule 124 a 1 [1958 Ed.]). And no question of prejudice to the defendant was presented, since the defendant\u2019s original liability to the plaintiff was conclusively decided by the judgment, and his liability to the plaintiff, as a result of the bond, was denied, and the denial was sustained by the court. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a formal demand that the garnishee file \u201cin these proceedings\u201d the bond or a true copy thereof, which was done. When the copy was produced as a result of the plaintiff\u2019s demand and the garnishee\u2019s answer, it gave the court jurisdiction over the bond, at least as far as the rights of the plaintiff and garnishee thereunder were concerned. Thereafter on April 25, 1962, when the plaintiff filed an answer to the motion for summary judgment, after having filed the consent to an extension of time to plead, a demand to produce the bond and a motion <em>ne recipiatur, </em>he was clearly under the jurisdiction of the court. Rule 124 a 1 (1958 Ed.); Rules 5 v, 124 a 1 (1961 Ed.); <em>McCormick v. Church, </em>219 Md. 422, 429, 149 A. 2d 768; 5 Am. Jur. 2d, <em>Appearance, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 14, 16. \u201cA person who denies that a court has jurisdiction and asks relief on that ground cannot ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>anything of the court which is inconsistent with the want of such jurisdiction.\u201d <em>McCormick v. Church, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The appellant also contends that the trial court was in error in granting judgment because no return had been made to the writ. It was held in <em>De Bearn v. De Bearn, </em>119 Md. 418, 428, 86 A. 1049, that where the garnishee voluntarily filed a list of securities, with their names and numbers, etc., the securities could be taken and condemned without actual seizure. Here, the garnishee brought in the only \u201casset\u201d it had of George Washington\u2019s. And, of course, the summary judgment rendered herein does not prevent additional attachments on the original judgment of the appellant against George Washington. Rule 622 e. We hold that the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the litigation, the plaintiff and the garnishee, and no rights of defendant were, or could have been, prejudiced; hence the court was correct in entertaining the motion for a summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In determining whether the garnishee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, it will be unnecessary to set forth the provisions of the bond in detail. As stated above, it was an injunction bond issued at the request of George Washington and others in an equity case, wherein the plaintiff here was not a party, for the sole protection of one Albert E. Hauser. The appellant, in this Court, does not even argue that he is entitled to any relief by reason of the bond, the only \u201ccredit\u201d of the defendant here involved, but contents himself with the argument relative to jurisdiction. The trial judge, we think, properly granted the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-10\">. The record in this case contains, among other things, the order for the writ of attachment on judgment, a docket entry showing that a writ of attachment had issued, a consent by the appellant to an extension of time for American to file \u201ca responsive pleading to the attachment laid on [Americanl\u201d by the appellant, and other matters which will be mentioned in the statement of facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
