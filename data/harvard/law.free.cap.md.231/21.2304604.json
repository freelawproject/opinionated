Three witnesses positively identified him as one of two men who rifled the cash register in a restaurant at revolver point. The trial court in this non-jury case was entitled to believe them, rather than an alibi witness who placed appellant elsewhere. Maryland Rule 886; <em>Knuckles v. </em>State, 228 Md. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Prior to his trial appellant requested the court to appoint another attorney in lieu of his court-appointed counsel, but, when asked whether there was any good reason for a change in lawyers, he replied: \u201cThat is all right.\u201d He now claims error in the refusal of his request. In the absence of any substantial reason for replacement of counsel (none was advanced here), an indigent defendant must accept counsel appointed by the court, unless he desires to present his own defense. <em>Brown v. United </em>States, 264 F. 2d 363, 367 (D.C. Cir.); cf. <em>Murray v. Director, </em>228 Md. 658, 660.
