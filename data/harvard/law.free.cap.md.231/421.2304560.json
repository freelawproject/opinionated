However, we are unable to discover in the record any proper reservations of questions (1) and (2) for our consideration. Maryland Rule 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">During the trial, a blackboard had been used for the purpose of listing appellee\u2019s income for several years. When appellee\u2019s counsel reached his argument concerning compensation for pain and suffering, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">\u201c(Mr. Due) Your Honor, may I have an objection to this pain and suffering <em>per diem </em>argument ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">\u201c(The Court) I don\u2019t know what the nature of the argument will be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">\u201c(Mr. Due) I take it it will be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-12\">\u201c(The Court) You [appellee\u2019s counsel] go ahead. I may interpose some instruction or comment, but we will wait and see.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">Thereupon appellee\u2019s counsel placed on the blackboard his <em>per diem </em>figures with respect to pain; and he made it clear to the jury that his figures were argument and that it was the jury\u2019s function to determine the amount of money that would reasonably compensate appellee for his injuries. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected \u201cto this matter on the blackboard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">Appellant\u2019s counsel now insists that the trial judge \u201cdeclined to allow\u201d him to state the grounds of his objection, and the trial judge was duty bound, under our decision in <em>Eastern Shore P. S. C. v. </em>Corbett, <em>227 </em>Md. 411, 177 A. 2d 701, to instruct the jury that appellee\u2019s counsel\u2019s argument was not evidence. The trial judge\u2019s statement was, we think, no more than an assertion that he could not rule upon the propriety of counsel\u2019s argument before he knew what it was to be, but he would do so from time to time if objection were made, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>depending upon what developed, he might interpose \u201csome instruction or comment\u201d on the <em>per diem </em>argument. It will be noted that the judge was not requested to instruct the jury that counsel\u2019s <em>per diem </em>argument was not evidence, and he probably would have done so anyway, but for the fact that appellee\u2019s counsel had made it clear to the jury that his argument was not evidence. In any event, we find nothing in the above colloquy that raises the question that appellant now argues, namely, that the trial judge, whether requested or not, was required specifically to instruct the jury that counsel\u2019s <em>per diem </em>argument was not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">There is nothing in the record to show that this point was raised in the trial below. It was not argued to the jury, no jury instruction thereon was requested, and it was not mentioned in appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial nor in his memorandum in support thereof. It was mentioned for the first time in argument in support of the motion for a new trial (apparently with reference to future losses of income, not as to pain and suffering). We do not think the question is before us for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The <em>Corbett </em>case, <em>supra, </em>was decided after it had been carefully briefed, argued, reargued and maturely considered. We reaffirm our decision therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
