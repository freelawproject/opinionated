In 2010, petitioner commenced a proceeding alleging that the child was permanently neglected. In January 2011, Family Court adjudged the child to be permanently neglected, but suspended judgment for one year. A few months later, petitioner filed a petition alleging that respondent violated the terms of the suspended judgment, and then filed another petition seeking immediate suspension of visitation. Following a hearing, the court found that respondent violated the terms of the suspended judgment and terminated her parental rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondent appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Family Court\u2019s determination that respondent violated the terms of the suspended judgment is supported by a sound and substantial basis in the record. The court may revoke a suspended judgment and terminate parental rights if the petitioner establishes the parent\u2019s noncompliance by a preponderance of the evidence <em>(see Matter of Clifton ZZ. [Latrice ZZ.], </em>75 AD3d 683, 684 [2010]; <em>Matter of Leala T., </em>55 AD3d 997, 998 [2008]). Petitioner presented evidence establishing that respondent violated numerous conditions of the suspended judgment. Testimony from petitioner\u2019s caseworker and respondent\u2019s probation officer, as well as respondent\u2019s medical records,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> demonstrated that she violated the conditions requiring her to cooperate with caseworkers, sign releases for information, abide by the terms of her probation, inform her caseworker and probation officer if she left the area, take psychotropic medications as prescribed, accept techniques of effective discipline offered by a parent educator, avoid yelling at the child on the telephone, lead a law-abiding life and avoid the use of street drugs. The medical records state that respondent tested positive for cocaine (although that initial test was not confirmed), and tests for levels of her prescribed medication indicated that she had not been taking the prescribed dosage. Although respondent\u2019s counsel cross-examined the witnesses and raised questions about some of their testimony or conclusions, we defer to Family Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>credibility determinations and will not disturb its findings as they are supported by a sound and substantial basis in the record (see <em>Matter of Clifton ZZ. [Latrice ZZ.], </em>75 AD3d at 684-685).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Family Court\u2019s determination to terminate respondent\u2019s parental rights is also supported by a sound and substantial basis in the record. While a parent\u2019s failure to comply with the conditions of a suspended judgment does not automatically compel termination of parental rights, that noncompliance constitutes \u201cstrong evidence that termination is, in fact, in the best interests of the child[ ]\u201d <em>(Matter of Clifton ZZ. [Latrice ZZ.], </em>75 AD3d at 685; <em>see Matter of Ronnie P. [Danielle Q.], </em>85 AD3d 1246, 1247 [2011]). Here, despite petitioner\u2019s provision of numerous appropriate services, respondent was unable to comply with the conditions or behave as an appropriate parent would. She suffered psychotic breaks due to her failure to comply with her medication regimen, was hostile and belligerent during visits and exhibited poor parenting techniques that caused the child to feel frightened and unsafe. In contrast, the child was making significant progress in foster care, and the foster parents intend to adopt him. We decline to disturb Family Court\u2019s determination that termination of respondent\u2019s parental rights is in the child\u2019s best interests, as that determination is supported by a sound and substantial basis in the record <em>(see Matter of Ronnie P. [Danielle Q.], </em>85 AD3d at 1247; <em>Matter of Clifton ZZ. [Latrice ZZ.], </em>75 AD3d at 685; <em>Matter of Travis A. [Daisy B.], </em>4 AD3d 632, 634 [2004], <em>lv denied </em>2 NY3d 706 [2004]).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Mercure, J.P., Spain and Stein, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-6\">. This Court previously affirmed an order terminating the father\u2019s parental rights to this child <em>(Matter of Marquise JJ. [Jamie KK.], </em>91 AD3d 1137 [2012], <em>lv denied </em>19 NY3d 801 [2012]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\">. Although respondent now contends that the medical records were hearsay, she did not object to their admission at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
