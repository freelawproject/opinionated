The order determined that defendant is a level three risk pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act.</p><p id=\"b1029-3\">It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is unanimously reversed on the law without costs, and the matter is remitted to Steuben County Court for further proceedings in accordance with the following memorandum: Defendant appeals from an order determining that he is a level three risk under the Sex Offender Registration Act ([SORA] Correction Law \u00a7 168 <em>et seq.). </em>We agree with defendant that County Court did not perform the requisite searching inquiry when evaluating defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se, and we therefore reverse the order and remit the matter to County Court for a new SORA proceeding in accordance with defendant\u2019s right to counsel <em>(see generally People v Allen, </em>99 AD3d 1252, 1253 [2012]).</p><p id=\"b1029-4\">It is well settled that defendants have a statutory right to counsel in SORA proceedings <em>(see </em>Correction Law \u00a7 168-n [3]; <em>People v David W., </em>95 NY2d 130, 138 [2000]; <em>People v Bowles, </em>89 AD3d 171, 178-179 [2011], <em>lv denied </em>18 NY3d 807 [2011]; <em>People v Wyatt, </em>89 AD3d 112, 117 [2011], <em>lv denied </em>18 NY3d 803 [2011]). A defendant\u2019s right to proceed pro se is also well settled <em>(see People v McIntyre, </em>36 NY2d 10, 17 [1974]). In order to invoke that right, however, \u201c(1) the request [must be] unequivocal and timely asserted, (2) there [must be] a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel, and (3) the defendant [must not have] engaged in conduct which would prevent the fair and orderly exposition of the issues\u201d <em>(id.; see People v Chicherchia, </em>86 AD3d 953, 954 [2011], <em>lv denied </em>17 NY3d 952 [2011]). \u201cIf a timely and unequivocal request has been asserted, then the trial court is obligated to conduct a \u2018searching inquiry\u2019 to ensure that the defendant\u2019s waiver is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary\u201d <em>(Matter of Kathleen K. [Steven K.], </em>17 NY3d 380, 385 [2011]; <em>see People v Crampe, </em>17 NY3d 469, 481-482 [2011]). The requisite inquiry \u201c \u2018should affirmatively disclose that a trial court has delved into a defendant\u2019s age, education, occupation, previous exposure to legal procedures and other relevant factors bearing on a competent, intelligent, voluntary waiver\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Arroyo, </em>98 NY2d 101, 104 [2002], quoting <em>People v Smith, </em>92 NY2d 516, 520 [1998]).</p><p id=\"b1029-5\">Here, the trial court failed to conduct the necessary \u201csearching inquiry\u201d to ensure that defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel was unequivocal, voluntary, and intelligent <em>(Allen, </em>99 AD3d at 1253 [internal quotation marks omitted]). The only statement made by the court regarding the dangers of proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>ing pro se was the comment, \u201c[y]ou might be better served by going with your original impulse to have assigned counsel represent you.\u201d The court did not inquire about defendant\u2019s age, experience, intelligence, education, or exposure to the legal system, nor did it explain the risk inherent in proceeding pro se or the advantages of representation by counsel <em>(see People v Lott, </em>23 AD3d 1088, 1089 [2005]). The court\u2019s failure to conduct a searching inquiry renders defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel invalid and requires reversal <em>(see Crampe, </em>17 NY3d at 481-482; <em>see also Allen, </em>99 AD3d at 1253; <em>Lott, </em>23 AD3d at 1089-1090).</p><p id=\"b1030-3\">In light of our decision, we do not address defendant\u2019s remaining contentions.
