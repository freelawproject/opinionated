There is no indication in the record that the release was not executed in good faith. Therefore, pursuant to General Obligations Law \u00a7 15-108 (b), the third-party defendants are relieved from liability to the third-party plaintiffs for contribution <em>(see Ziviello v O\u2019Boyle, </em>90 AD3d 916, 917 [2011]; <em>Kagan v Jacobs, </em>260 AD2d 442 [1999]). Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have granted that branch of the motion of the third-party defendants which was pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (5) to dismiss the contribution cause of action in the third-party complaint as barred by the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">In considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (7), the court must \u201caccept the facts as alleged in the [pleading] as true, accord plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the benefit of every possible favorable inference, and determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory\u201d <em>(Leon v Martinez, </em>84 NY2d 83, 87-88 [1994]). \u201c[T]he key element of a common-law cause of action for indemnification is not a duty running from the indemnitor to the injured party, but rather is \u2018a separate duty owed the indemnitee by the indemnitor\u2019 \u201d <em>(Raquet v Braun, </em>90 NY2d 177, 183 [1997], quoting <em>Mas v Two Bridges Assoc., </em>75 NY2d 680, 690 [1990]; <em>see Lovino, Inc. v Lavallee Law Offs., </em>96 AD3d 909, 909-910 [2012]).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Here, the third-party complaint does not allege the existence of any duty owed by the third-party defendants to the third-party plaintiffs <em>(see Raquet v Braun, </em>90 NY2d at 183; <em>Breen v Law Off. of Bruce A. Barket, P.C., </em>52 AD3d 635, 638 [2008]; <em>Keeley v Tracy, </em>301 AD2d 502, 503 [2003]). Furthermore, the third-party plaintiffs would not be compelled to pay damages for the alleged negligent acts of the third-party defendants <em>(see Lovino, Inc. v Lavallee Law Offs., </em>96 AD3d at 910; <em>Jakobleff v Cerrato, Sweeney &amp; Cohn, </em>97 AD2d 786, 786-787 [1983]). Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have granted that branch of the motion of the third-party defendants which was pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (7) to dismiss the common-law indemnification cause of action in the third-party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The third-party plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contention is without merit. Skelos, J.P, Hall, Roman and Cohen, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
