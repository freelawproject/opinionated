This case was restored to the calendar on an application, dated August 17, 1942, and is not therefore a case under section 25-a. <em>(Matter of Whitmyre </em>v. <em>International Business Machines Corp., </em>274 N. Y. 61.) II. In any event, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board has jurisdiction to hear this case against the Special Fund for Reopened Cases. The exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>mentioned in the first sentence of section 123 of the Workmen\u2019s \u2022Compensation Law, applies to employers and carriers only. <em>(Matter of Tipton </em>v. <em>Lang\u2019s Bakery, Inc., </em>250 App. Div. 696; <em>Matter of Watkins </em>v. <em>Cornwall Press, </em>270 App. Div. 615.) III. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board has jurisdiction to hear this c\u00e1se by virtue of section 25-a. <em>(Matter of Watkins </em>v. <em>Cornwall Press, </em>270 App. Div. 615.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b245-5\">Conway, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae2\">On August 24, 1935, the deceased slipped or fell from a ladder and <em>\u201c </em>strained himself \u201d. He continued working until August 29th, remained at home under a physician\u2019s care until September 3d and then returned to work. He continued at work until September 12, 1935, when he sustained injury while lifting a refrigerator. On that same evening he suffered from pain in his head, collapsed and died from \u201c a ruptured cerebral aneurysm of the first middle cerebral artery</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">His widow filed a claim for death benefits on September 23, 1935, but, after a trial upon the merits, her claim was disallowed on October 13, 1936, upon the ground that she had failed to establish causal relation* between the death and the accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">On August 17, 1942, the widow made application to reopen the case and to have it placed on a referee\u2019s calendar for the purpose of introducing expert or opinion medical proof on the question of the existence of causal relation between 'the injuries and death of her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">There is a finding by the board that the application to reopen was \u201c made and filed <em>after </em>a lapse of seven years from the dates of the aforesaid accidents or death (Emphasis supplied.) That finding is clearly erroneous as a matter of law since it is mathematically incorrect. Manifestly, the application was made within the seven-year period. Nevertheless, on November 16, 1942, it was denied. One week later on November 23, 1942 (a date which was more than seven years subsequent to the accidents and death) an application in the nature of a motion for reconsideration or reargument was made. In that application the attention of the board was called to the fact that, in connection with the denial of November 16th, the board member wrote that <em>\u201c </em>The mere fact that <em>cumulative </em>evidence has been found which might bear affirmatively upon a question of fact, <em>already sufficiently provided </em>is not sufficient in my opinion to grant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>reopening of the record in order that such evidence might be submitted.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) It was pointed out by the claimant that the \u201c error of this statement is contained in the phrase# \u2018 already sufficiently provided.\u2019 At no time heretofore has any evidence been submitted by a brain specialist, and because only the evidence of causal relation was considered by the Board as its reason for refusing to make an award, it is the most important evidence that could be obtained.\u201d Thereupon the board restored the case to the calendar under date of March 25, 1943, in a memorandum which read in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><em>\u201c Saving again considered the application of claimant\u2019s attorney, and his accompanying C-27 from Dr. Ward Williams, </em>the Board is of the opinion that this matter should be restored to the calendar to afford the claimant\u2019s attorney an opportunity to present his.evidence on the question of causal relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\"><em>\u201c Previous denial of the Board is hereby rescinded </em>and the case is restored to a calendar in accordance with the above directions.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The application and the C-27 mediqal report accompanying it, mentioned in the quotation, obviously referred to the application papers of August 17,1942. We think, therefore, in view of the ground of the application for reconsideration of November 23, 1942, that the case was restored to a calendar so that the matters contained in the application of August 17th might have proper, consideration. It was the denial of November 16th which was promptly \u201c rescinded \u201d on the application of November 23d. It is urged by the appellants that if the board be permitted to employ a \u201c theory of recission \u201d so that it may reopen a claim \u201c at any time by merely rescinding a former decision \u201d there will be no effective limitation on the jurisdiction of the board despite the limitation thereon contained in the statute of its creation. We think in this instance there was merely a rescinding of a ruling, made a week, prior to the application for reconsideration, due to the fact that such application had called \u25a0 attention to an incorrect assumption of fact. We pass upon no other questio\u00f1.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In view of the foregoing it is clear that, since the application for reopening was made on August 17, 1942, which was within seven years of the date of accident or death, section 25-a of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The order should be affirmed, with costs. The first question certified should be answered in the affirmative and the second question certified not answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Lotjghran, Oh. J., Lewis, Desmond, Thacher, Dye and Fuld, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
