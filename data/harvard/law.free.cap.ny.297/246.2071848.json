We are further of the opinion that the Appellate Division was without jurisdiction to review the order of the commission because the order did not affect a substantial right of the appellant (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 631). It seems entirely clear that under the reservation in the Public Service Commission\u2019s order there can and will be no determination with respect to the cost of improvements to be paid by the railroad company under the provisions of the Grade Crossing Elimination Act of 1939 (L. 1939, ch. 289, \u00a7 4) until after a hearing <em>de nova </em>with respect to the extent to which the plans include railroad improvements and the nature and cost thereof, entirely without prejudice to the respective contentions of the State of New York and the New York Central Railroad Company, and without prejudice to the right of any person to offer further and additional proof at that time upon such issues. Inasmuch as the entire cost of construction will be advanced by the State, and the railroad company will not be required to pay or contribute to the cost of construction until after the work is completed and such a determination has been made, and since that determination will be subject to review in the courts, \u00bb it cannot be said that the order reserving all of these matters to future determination affects any substantial right of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">The appeal should be dismissed, without costs, and the matter remitted to the Appellate Division, with directions to dismiss the appeal taken to that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Loughran, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Desmond, Thacher, Dye and Fuld, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
