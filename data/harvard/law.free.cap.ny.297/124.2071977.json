Co. </em>(293 N. Y. 379) did not intend to lay down the general rule that whenever a lease (a) is for a long term (b) and includes all the lessor\u2019s property (c) and provides that the rent shall be payable directly to the lessor\u2019s stockholders, but contains no covenant to pay taxes or to keep the property free from tax liens, the lessee is obligated to pay the Federal income taxes assessed against the lessor by reason of the rent paid to the stockholders. The <em>\u201c </em>General Plan or Scheme \u201d was referred to not as an independent ground of decision, but as the background for the construction of the express tax covenant. II. The general plan or scheme could not have been an independent ground of decision, for as defined in the majority opinion the general plan or scheme to which they referred included the tax covenant. That the tax covenant alone was the substantive ground of decision is clear from the fact that the court held that Western Union was obligated to pay not only the lessor\u2019s income taxes but all its debts. III. If the majority in the <em>Johnson </em>case intended to hold that even in the absence of any tax covenant the inclusive nature of the lease, its long term, and the method of payment of rent required the lessee to pay income taxes, such holding was unnecessary to the decision, is contrary to the uniform current of authority, and should not be extended to other cases such as those now at bar. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Western Union Tel. Co., </em>50 F. 2d 102; <em>Harwood </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>68 F. 2d 12; <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Western Union Tel. Co., </em>68 F. 2d. 16, 292 U.

S. 751.) IV. The Court of Appeals did not overrule or disapprove <em>Brainard </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. R. R. Co. </em>(242 N. Y. 125). It qualified the holding in that case, which was to the effect that the lessee was not to be held liable for income taxes unless income taxes were mentioned by name, to the extent of holding that they need not be mentioned by name if some other express words were used which meant the same thing. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Warren R. Co., </em>127 F. 2d 134.) V. The judgment cannot be sustained on the ground that the covenant to pay the rent \u201c without deduction or abatement for taxes \u201d or for any other purpose required lessee to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>income taxes.

This absorption was accomplished through long term leasing of all the assets of its erstwhile competitors. The lawyers and businessmen who made these arrangements, and drew the leases, devised covenants to take care of such contingencies as they could foresee, but, not being prophets, they did not forecast the high income taxes of the twentieth century. When these imposts grew to important size, controversies arose as to whether, under the leases, the income tax on the rentals was an obligation of lessor Or lessee. In 1944, we answered that question, as to one such Western Union lease, in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Western Union Tel. Co. </em>(293 N. Y. 379, 383). There we held that Western Union, by agreeing to keep that particular leased property \u201c \u2018 clear from all incumbrances arising from tax * * * liens \u2019 \u201d and to deliver it back at the end of the time as free from * * * incumbrance thereon as they were, when received \u2019 \u201d had, without mentioning the lessor\u2019s income taxes, obligated itself to pay them. In 1926, interpreting a railroad lease in <em>Brainard </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. R. R. Co. </em>(242 N. Y. 125, 129), this court had ruled that a covenant by the lessee to \u201c \u2018 pay all taxes and assessments which may be levied or become chargeable on the said road or property, or upon the said [lessor] Mahoning Company, by reason of its ownership thereof \u2019 \u201d described property taxes only and had no reference to income taxes. Essentially, the question in the three cases now before us is whether the bargains as to taxes written into these three leases, are governed by the <em>Brainard </em>case <em>(supra) </em>or by the <em>Johnson </em>case <em>(supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The <em>Pacific and Atlantic </em>lease was made in 1873 to run for 999 years, while the <em>Southern and Atlantic </em>and <em>Empire and Bay States </em>grants were for 99 years and were made in 1876 and 1890, respectively. In all three agreements (as in the lease in the <em>Johnson </em>case, <em>supra) </em>the annual rental was to be a stated percentage of the owner corporation\u2019s outstanding capital stock, which amounts were to be paid direct to the lessor\u2019s stockholders, ratably in proportion to their holdings of stock. In all four cases <em>(Johnson </em>and these three) the lessor corporation was to be preserved as a mere shell without inner substance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the cost of such bare existence to be paid by Western Union. None of the three agreements in our present cases included any clause like the ones we construed in the- <em>Johnson </em>case, binding lessee Western' Union to keep the property free of tax liens and to hand it back with the title similarly unclouded.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u2022 The sole references to taxes in the three documents now before us. are in an entirely .different form. In the <em>Western Union </em>v. <em>Pacific and Atlantic </em>case plaintiff promised to pay the yearly accruals \u201c without any deduction or abatement for or on account of taxes or assessments or for any other purpose whatsover \u201d while in the other two writings <em>(Southern and Atlantic </em>and <em>Empire and Bay States' </em>cases) the stated obligation of Western Union was to make the annual payments <em>\u201c </em>without any deduction or abatement for or on account of taxes or assessments on the aforesaid demised property \u201d. (In the <em>Southern and Atlantic </em>lease the covenant goes on to say: \u201c or for any other purpose whatsoever \u201d.) Those forms of words, whatever be their precise purpose, were certainly not promises by the lessee to pay all lessors\u2019 taxes, including their income taxes. They amount to no more than assurance that each stockholder will get his share of the rent, with nothing taken out by the lessee for taxes. Inferentially, those clauses, above quoted from these three leases, call upon the lessee to pay all property taxes on the demised telegraph systems. Such covenants, as held in the <em>Brainard </em>case <em>(supra) </em>and restated in the <em>Johnson </em>case <em>(supra) </em>do not include income taxes. The <em>Brainard </em>rule is still the law: \u201c Unless the lease expressly provides for the payment of taxes on the income from rentals received under the lease, the imposition of such a burden on the lessee is not justified.\u201d (242 N. Y. at p. 132.) In the <em>Johnson </em>lease we found no mention of income taxes by name, but a promise to keep and return the telegraph line unspotted by tax liens, an undertaking which could not be performed unless the lessee paid the lessor\u2019s income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">A careful examination of the other language in each of the three leases here under scrutiny brings to light nothing which could be treated as an engagement by the lessee to assume and pay lessors\u2019 own income taxes. No such meaning can be given to the recitals, in the preambles of the <em>Pacific and Atlantic </em>and. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>Southern and Atlantic </em>writings: \u201c Whereas the interests both of stockholders and of the public demand unity of action to the end that said stockholders may receive a proper return from their investment \u201d. Nor are defendants in the <em>Empire and Bay States </em>case helped by the fact that Western Union agreed to, and did, indorse on each <em>Empire and Bay States </em>stock certificate a guarantee of the quarterly payment of <em>1% </em>on the par value of the stock \u201c subject to the terms and provisions of the lease \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Special Term, while. deciding the present cases in favor of defendants, came to the same conclusion as we do herein, as to the meaning of the several references to taxes in the three leases. The tax clauses here, held Special Term, were not sufficient, as the tax covenant was in the <em>Johnson </em>case <em>{supra), </em>to transfer the income tax obligation. But, said Special Term in these cases, this court in the <em>Johnson </em>case gave a separate and independent reason for construing the <em>Johnson </em>lease as requiring Western Union to pay its lessor\u2019s .income taxes. In the <em>Johnson </em>case, according to the Special Term opinions in the present litigations, this court found Western Union\u2019s liability for the income taxes not only in the specific language as to taxes, but also in <em>11 </em>the general plan of the contract.\u201d So, reasoned Special Term, while there is no \u201c Johnson case \u201d tax lien covenant in the three cases now before us, the \u201c general plan \u201d of these three grants is the same as the \u201c general plan \u201d of the <em>Johnson </em>contract, and the result therefore must be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">That was not the meaning of our opinion in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Western Union Tel. Co. (supra). </em>The majority opinion in that case grounded the income tax liability flatly on the clauses as to tax liens. We looked at and wrote about the \u201c general plan of the contract \u201d in the <em>Johnson </em>case only to show that the plain meaning of the tax clauses therein was not altered or affected by anything in the lease\u2019s <em>\u201c </em>general plan \u201d. The <em>Brainard </em>case\u2019s holding <em>(supra), </em>not overruled but reaffirmed in the <em>Johnson </em>case, was that such lessors must pay their owii income taxes unless there be found forthright language whereby the lessee assumes that obligation. Such language was in the <em>Johnson </em>case lease. It is not in any of the three leases now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Besides asking for a declaratory judgment that it need not pay these taxes in addition to the agreed rents \u2014 a declaration to which we hold it entitled \u2014 plaintiff demands a decree that it may, nevertheless, deduct lessor\u2019s income taxes, ratably, from the rental payments to lessor\u2019s stockholders, and pay them into the Federal Treasury, for the lessor\u2019s account. The reason plaintiff seeks this relief is that plaintiff is itself a substantial stockholder in each of the lessor corporations, and fears that it, as such stockholder, may in the end be compelled by the Treasury, to pay lessor\u2019s income taxes, or part of them, under a \u201c transferee \u201d theory <em>(see Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>v. <em>Western Union Tel. Co., </em>141 F. 2d 774, certiorari denied 322 U. S. 75\u00cd). Whether or not some such arrangement is to be ordered made, and what formula, if any, is to be used, is for Special Term to decide and the cases must be sent back for that purpose. On such retrial Special Term will pass also on plaintiff\u2019s prayer for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">It appears that in some past years Western Union has paid its lessors \u2019 income taxes, sometimes under stipulations that such payments should be regarded as advances by the lessee to the lessor. The courts below, responsive to a counterclaim, ordered those loan agreements cancelled. We hold those agreements valid. Since, as we conclude, Western Union was not bound as lessee to make any income tax payments, for the lessors, such payments could not amount to a \u201c practical construction \u201d of the lease, against the lessee (see <em>Brainard </em>case, <em>supra, </em>242 N. Y. at p. 133).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In each case the judgments should be reversed, with costs to the appellant in all courts, and each case remitted to the Special Term for further proceedings Pot inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Loughran, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Fuld and Dye, JJ., concur; Thacher, J., taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
