The Fair Trade Act (L. 1935, ch. 976, as amd.), as applied below, denies legal effect to the approved rebottling label on which the industry is based. II. Resale of perfume under a label which states the rebottler and the rebottling and mentions the perfumer\u2019s name and brand in a true statement of fact, has been generally recognized not to infringe or involve the perfumer\u2019s trade-mark, name or brand or to constitute unfair competition. <em>(Farina </em>v. <em>Silverlock, 6 </em>De G. M. &amp; G. 214; <em>Hennessy </em>v. <em>White, </em>6 Wyatt, Webb &amp; A\u2019Beckett Eq. 216; <em>Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>13 Wall. 311; <em>Krauss </em>v. <em>Jos. R.

S. 183.) III. The Fair Trade Act did not destroy, or give the perfumer the right to fix resale prices in, the rebottling industry conducted under approved labels with merely a collateral reference to the perfumer\u2019s trade-mark, name and brand. In economics rebottling is opposite to \u201c loss leader \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>cut price \u201d. <em>(F. S. De Voin </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant, </em>13 Cal. S. B. J. No. 3, 3 C.C.H. Trade Reg. Serv. P25\u00cd06.) IV. The terms' of the Fair Trade Act exclude rebottling from the scope of the act. <em>(Prestonettes, Inc., </em>v. <em>Coty, </em>264 U. S. 359.) V. Authoritative construction has excluded rebottling from the scope of the Fair Trade Act. <em>(Old Dearborn Distributing Co. </em>v. <em>Seagram-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>Distillers Corp., </em>299 U.

Canons of construction are against construing the Fair Trade Act as extending resale price control to the rebottling industry. <em>(Straus </em>v. <em>Victor Talking Mach. Co., </em>243 U.

Section 2 of the Fair Trade _Act, as applied below, impairs this defendant\u2019s rights under section 6 of article I of the State. Constitution and under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution in that it allows, beyond plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark monopoly, control of resale prices in defendant\u2019s business and destroys defendant\u2019s business in rebottled perfumes long established and conducted under judicially approved labels. <em>(Darweger </em>v. <em>Staats, </em>267 N.

The sale of Nips by appellants does not violate the Fair Trade Act. The commodities sold by the parties are different. There is no competition and the statute is inapplicable. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Univis Lens Co., </em>316 U. S. 241; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb Co., </em>321 U. S. 707; <em>Mallinson Fabrics Corp. </em>v. <em>Macy &amp; Co., Inc., </em>171 Misc. 875; <em>Calvert Distillers Corp. </em>v. <em>Nussbaum Liquor Store, Inc., </em>166 Misc. 342.) II. Plaintiff is attempting by this action to use the Fair Trade Act for a purpose not contemplated by the Legislature.' It is attempting to destroy the rebottling business of this appellant and to control the seller, not the price. <em>(Coty, Inc., </em>v. <em>Hearn Dept.

The inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>pretation of section 2 of the Fair Trade Act applied by the Appellate Division in this ease violates defendants\u2019 rights under the Constitutions of the United States and of the State of New York. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb Co., </em>321 U.

The rationale of the decisions upholding the Fair Trade Act is that its purpose is to protect the name and good will of the manufacturer. <em>(Old Dearborn Distributing Co. v. Seagram-Distillers Corp., </em>299 U. S. 183; <em>Bourjois Sales Corp. </em>v. <em>Dorfman, </em>273 N. Y. 167; <em>Lentheric, Inc., </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., </em>257 App. Div. 348, 282 N.

Defendants\u2019 right to rebottle plaintiff\u2019s perfume does not entitle it to ignore plaintiff\u2019s price schedule. <em>(Guerlain, Inc., </em>v. <em>Woolworth Co., </em>170 Misc. 150; <em>Bourjois, Inc., </em>v. <em>Hermida Laboratories, Inc., </em>106 F. 2d 174; <em>Prestonettes, Inc., </em>v. <em>Coty, </em>264 U.

III. If defendants have actually produced a new commodity, they may mot designate it as Guerlain\u2019s Shalimar. IV. The Fair Trade Act is applicable to defendants\u2019 sales of rebottled perfumes because use of plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark is use of its good will. <em>(Old Dearborn Distributing Co. </em>v. <em>Seagram-Distillers Corp., </em>299 U. S. 183.) V. Plaintiff has suffered damage and is confronted with further.damage as a result of defendants\u2019 activities. <em>(Yale Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>26 F. 2d 972.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b61-6\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai3\">Plaintiff manufactures and distributes high-grade perfumes and cosmetics which are sold in fair and open competition with other similar products. Among the registered trade-marks owned and used by it are the words <em>\u201c </em>Guerlain \u201d and \u201c Shalimar \u201d. Pursuant to the Feld-Crawford Act (L. 1935, ch. 976, as amd.; now General Business Law, art. XXTV-A), plaintiff and certain of its retailers entered into so-called \u201c fair trade contracts \u201d which set, <em>inter alla, </em>a minimum resale price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>of $1.60, plus retail sales tax, for plaintiff\u2019s \u201c Shalimar \u201d perfume in quantities of \u201c one dram or less</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Defendant Nips, Inc., whose entire business consists of rebottling perfumes, buys plaintiff\u2019s perfumes in the retail market and rebottles them in small glass ampules holding 1/70 of a dram. The ampules of \u201c Shalimar \u201d are individually packed in little paper containers.bearing, the label:</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u201c NIPS</p>\n<p id=\"Ag\">Perfumes</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Genuine French Extracts</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\">Guerlain\u2019s Shalimar</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">\u25a0 Rebottled by Nips, Inc., N. Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Wholly Independent of</p>\n<p id=\"AB\">Guerlain \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The perfume thus rebottled is sold to a number of variety and chain stores, among them defendant Woolworth Co., which resells to the ultimate consumer for ten cents a package.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">In 1938, plaintiff advised both defendants of its fair trade contracts and requested defendant Woolworth to stop selling its products at less than the established minimum resale price. Woolworth refused, and the sales at ten cents a package continued. Consequently, plaintiff seeks injunctive relief under the Fair Trade Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">Section 1 of that statute (now General Business.Law, \u00a7 369-a) recognizes and affirms the legality of contracts fixing the prices at which the immediate buyer and all subsequent vendees may sell or resell a commodity \u201cwhich bears, or the label or content [sic] of which bears, the trade mark, brand, or name of the producer or owner of such commodity * * Section 2 (now General Business Law, \u00a7 369-b) provides that the willful and knowing advertisement, offer or sale.\u2014 regardless of whether or not it be by a party to such contract \u2014 of \u201c any commodity at less than the price [so] stipulated # <em>* * </em>is unfair competition and is actionable at the suit of any . person damaged thereby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">Defendants seek to escape the effect of the statute by urging that in distributing and selling the ampules they are dealing with a commodity other than and different from the product covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>by plaintiff\u2019s fair trade contracts. That claim, lacking substance, ignores reality and the dictates of common sense. The ampule contains perfume \u2014 of that there can be no possible doubt \u2014 and the label explicitly announces that it is <em>\u201c </em>Guerlain\u2019s Shalimar \u201d. It is a less quantity than \"that contained in the original bottle, but still it is perfume \u2014 plaintiff\u2019s perfume \u2014 and it is the perfume itself which the purchaser desires and buys, not just the \u201c patented applicator \u201d in which the perfume is rebottled by defendant. Were it otherwise, there would, of course, be no need to identify on the label the specific kind or brand of perfume contained in the ampule. The present case is far removed from those involving dresses made from trade-marked cloth <em>(Mallinson Fabrics Corp. </em>v. <em>Macy &amp; Co., Inc., </em>171 Misc. 875) or lenses ground from trade-marked \u201c blanks \u201d. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co., </em>321 U. S. 707; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Univis Lens Co., </em>316 U. S. 241.) There, the very form and character of the basic product is altered; a new article, possessing a completely different function, is created. There is, in fact and in effect, a new and different commodity. Here, the original commodity \u2014 Guerlain\u2019s Shalimar perfume \u2014 undergoes not the slightest change in form, content, quality or character; the difference is purely quantitative, the product remains the same, identical save in amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Defendants likewise contend that \"the Feld-Crawford Act was aimed solely at price cutting and therefore does not cover such a situation as the present where the aggregate amount charged for the number of ampules necessary to make up one dram of Guerlain\u2019s Shalimar is $7, far more than the minimum price of $1.60 set by plaintiff. While it is true that the statute prevents price cutting, its <em>\u201c </em>primary aim \u201d, the Supreme Court of the United States has observed \u2014 in discussing the virtually identical Illinois Fair Trade Act \u2014 \u201c is to protect the property, namely, the good will, of the producer which he still owns. The price restriction is adopted as an appropriate means to that perfectly legitimate end, and not as an end in itself.\u201d <em>(Old Dearborn Distributing Co. </em>v. <em>Seagram-Distillers Corp., </em>299 U. S. 183, 393.) More than that, however, defendants\u2019 entire argument disregards the fact that, in determining <em>\u201c </em>the price stipulated \u2019 \u2019, the price set by the contract must always be related to the <em>quantity </em>which the contract ties to that figure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>There is nothing in the Feld-Crawford Act about proportioning prices to quantity; plaintiff was within its undoubted legal rights in fixing a price of $1.60 for quantities of \u201c one dram <em>or less </em>\u201d, and Woolworth violated that law whenever it sold any fraction of a dram of Guerlain\u2019s Shalimar for less than $1.60. (See <em>Lentheric, Inc., </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., </em>257 App. Div. 348, affd. 282 N. Y. 638; <em>Lentheric, Inc., </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co., </em>338 Pa. 523.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Finally, defendants urge that the Feld-Crawford Act does not apply to r\u00e9bottled goods bearing a label of the type approved in the <em>Prestonettes </em>case. <em>(Prestonettes, Inc., </em>v. <em>Coty, </em>264 U. S. 359; same case <em>sub nom. Coty, Inc., v. Prestonettes, Inc., </em>3 F. 2d 984.) The gist of their argument is that the words <em>\u201c </em>Guerlain\u2019s Shalimar \u201d are here used to <em>describe the contents </em>of the ampule, not as a trade-mark to <em>identify the source </em>of those contents, and that, consequently, the label does not <em>\u201c bear </em>\u201d plaintiff\u2019s \u201c trade mark, brand, or name \u201d, within the intendment of section 1 of the Act (now General Business Law, \u00a7 369-a). The argument, thus revolving around a nice distinction drawn in the law of trade-mark infringement lacks validity in the present situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The statute was manifestly aimed and designed to protect the good will of the owner or producer from injury when his trade-mark or name is employed in the resale of goods originally owned or produced by him. As Mr. Justice Sutherland, speaking for the Supreme Court, wrote in the <em>Old Dearborn </em>case (299 U. S., <em>supra, </em>at p. 195): <em>u </em>Section 2 of the act [enacted in Illinois] does not prevent a purchaser of the commodity bearing the mark from selling the commodity alone at any price he pleases. It interferes only when he sells with the aid of the good will of the vendor; and it interferes then only to protect that good will against injury. It proceeds upon the theory that the sale of identified goods at less than the price fixed by the owner of the mark or brand is an assault upon the good will, and constitutes what the statute denominates * unfair competition. \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">That legislative purpose \u2014 to protect the vendor\u2019s good will \u2014 frames the issue before us: is the disposition of defendants \u2019 ampules being accomplished with the aid of plaintiff\u2019s good will? To us, the answer is clear. In employing the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u201c G-uerlain\u2019s Shalimar \u201d, in placing them on the label, defendants are using plaintiff\u2019s good will \u2014 as symbolized by those words \u2014 to facilitate sales. They are not merely <em>describing </em>the contents of the ampule, but are, in practical effect, <em>identifying </em>the product as plaintiff\u2019s, and to that extent they are violating the plain mandate of the Feld-Crawford Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">It may well be that the reference by defendant Nips on its Z/ label to plaintiff\u2019s mark and name does not constitute an infringement \u2014 as held in the <em>Prestonettes </em>case (264 U. S. 359) \u2014 but that fact does not in and of itself remove defendants from the purview of the Fair Trade Act. That statute does not draw any distinction between a use of plaintiff\u2019s mark <em>qua </em>trade-mark and a collateral reference to the mark in describing the product being sold, and we cannot, consonant with the manifest legislative purpose, construe the act as embodying any such distinction. (Cf. e.g., Penal Law, \u00a7 2354, subd. 6.) The fact remains that the commodity involved bears the trade-mark and name of the producer of the perfume \u2014 the sole condition necessary to render the statute applicable. Defendants are indisputably sharing in plaintiff\u2019s good will in the marketing of their ampules, and, -while they may be privileged to do this under the law of trade-marks, they are not permitted to do so by the Fair Trade Act. What constitutes a trade-mark or name use under the fair trade statute is not necessarily the same as an infringing use under i rade-mark law.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In conclusion, then \u2014 defendants are engaged in the distribution, display and sale of a commodity which bears the brand and name of the.producer and owner and which is being resold for less than the minimum price specified in fair trade contracts. Such conduct, constituting as we have said, a violation of the Feld-Crawford Act, is properly restrained by injunctive relief. A similar determination lias been reached in other States, <em>(Lentheric, Inc., </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co., </em>338 Pa. 523, <em>supra; De Voin </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., </em>Super. Ct. Cal, Feb. 11, 1938, 3 C. C. H. Trade Reg. Serv., par. 25106 [ not officially reported].)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The judgment should he affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Loughran, Cb.
