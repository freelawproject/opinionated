The trust agreement \u2022 did not create a reversion in the decedent and the courts below properly disposed of the principal of the trust as a remainder. <em>(Doctor </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>225 N.

The trust company\u2019s contentions that if no reversior was created, the legatees under the will of decedent are entitle! to the principal of the trust or in the alternative that that wih. was an exercise of the power in favor of his general estate, are without merit. IV. The property vested as a remainder to the next of kin of decedent as a class; the widow was not one of his next of kin within the meaning of the trust agreement. <em>(Matter of Waring, </em>275 N.

Sullivan and Paul M. Herzog.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">It is conceded by all the parties that the life beneficiary of the trust \u2014 one Blanche Malli \u2014 had, or claimed to have, a cause of action against an undisclosed client of Sullivan, that the trust was created solely for the purpose of freeing him from annoyance by the beneficiary, and that he \u2014 the undisclosed client \u2014 was the original owner and source of the securities which formed the corpus of the trust as created.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The trust agreement provides that, upon the death of the life beneficiary, the principal is .to be paid over to Sullivan, if living, or to such person as he may nominate in a specified manner; if, at his death, there has been no such nomination, then the. principal shall pass \u201c to such person or persons as may be entitled to receive the same as specific or residuary legatees under the Last Will and Testament of the said nominator, and in default of any such Last Will and Testament, then to such of the next of kin of said nominator as would be entitled to receive the same under the statute of distributions of- the State of New York if the said principal had been owned by him at the time of his death intestate with respect thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The beneficiary is still alive. Sullivan, however, died in April, 1932, survived by his widow and Ms four sisters. By Ms will, he left Ms residuary estate \u20141 \u2018 including all property over which I may have or hereafter acquire power of appointment \u201d \u2014 to Ms executor upon a trust made dependent upon the lives of Ms widow and his youngest surviving sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The courts below have held the residuary clause of Sullivan\u2019s will invalid to the extent that it suspends for three lives in being the absolute ownership of the principal of the <em>inter vivas </em>trust (Personal Property Law, \u00a7 11). It is now urged that Sullivan, as creator of the trust, retained a reversionary interest in the corpus. If that be so, the residuary clause incorporating that reversion in a testamentary trust' must, of course, be considered separate and apart from the <em>inter </em>vivas* trust agreement, and, hence, would not; entail an unlawful suspension--of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>absolute ownership. <em>(N. Y. Life Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Cary, </em>191 N. Y. 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The claim advanced must be rejected. Section 39 of the Eeal Property Law contains the statutory definition of reversion, which also applies with equal force to personal property. (Personal Property Law, \u00a7 11; see <em>Davies </em>v. <em>City Bank Farmers Trust Co., </em>248 App. Div. 380.) That section declares: \u201cA reversion is the residue of an estate left in the grantor or his heirs, or in the heirs of a testator, commencing in possession on the determination of one or more particular estates granted or devised.\u201d At its inception, then, ownership of a reversion <em>must remain </em>in the grantor or testator \u2014 or in those who take .from him by descent \u2014 since it can arise <em>only in the hands of the original owner; </em>a reversion, by definition, cannot be <em>created </em>by an instrument purportedly conveying or transferring it to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Any conclusion, therefore, that Sullivan\u2019s interest in the trust corpus constituted a reversion must necessarily depend, in the first instance, upon a determination that he was a <em>\u201c </em>grantor \u201d or \u201c testator\u201d within the intendment of section 39. That he could not be a <em>\u201c </em>testator \u201d is, of course, obvious, since the trust was created by a transfer <em>inter vivas. </em>That he may not be termed a <em>\u201c </em>grantor \u201d, without doing violence to the plain meaning of the statute, is equally clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">As already indicated, the trust was created at the behest of Sullivan\u2019s undisclosed client, its corpus formed from securities supplied by him. There can be no doubt that the person who furnishes the consideration for the creation of a trust is the settlor, even though, in form, the trust is created by another. <em>(Morgan </em>v. <em>Fiduciary Trust Co., </em>290 N. Y. 615; <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co., </em>208 App. Div. 112, affd. 238 N. Y. 592; 1 Bogert on Trusts and Trustees, \u00a7 41; 1 Scott on Trusts, \u00a7 17; 3 Scott on Trusts, \u00a7\u00a7 422A-425; Griswold on Spendthrift Trusts [2d ed.], \u00a7\u00a7 487-491; cf. <em>Matter of Blake, </em>226 App. Div. 580, affd. 252 N. Y. 613.) Since the client was thus, in legal effect, the settlor of the trust, it follows that Sullivan can hardly be regarded as <em>\u201c </em>grantor \u201d of the selfsame trust. Certainly, the word <em>fe </em>grantor \u201d, as used in the statute, must be given substantial meaning; it should not be construed to include a purely technical convey<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>oncer, a mere conduit or dummy through whom title passes from the true owner to the ultimate grantee. Even if Sullivan had had legal title to the securities \u2014 which is not at all clear from the record before us \u2014 the equitable title would have remained in his client and, had the express trust failed for one reason or another, Sullivan would have held the property upon a resulting trust for him. (3 Scott on Trusts, \u00a7\u00a7 422A-425.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Since Sullivan\u2019s interest did not constitute a reversion, the residuary clause of his will is, in effect, an attempted exercise of the power of appointment granted him by the <em>inter vivas </em>agreement. (Personal Property Law, \u00a7 18; cf. <em>Low </em>v. <em>Bankers Trust Co., </em>270 N. Y. 143, 147-148.) The power, of course, relates back to and becomes a part of that agreement for the purpose of measuring lives; consequently, Sullivan\u2019s <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>residuary \u2019 \u2019 trust is invalid to the extent that it suspends the absolute ownership of the <em>inter vivas </em>trust corpus for more than two lives in being. (Personal Property Law, \u00a7 11; Real Property Law, \u00a7 178; see <em>Low </em>v. <em>Bankers Trust Co., supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Ineffective exercise of a power of appointment is the same as nonexercise, and, hence, upon termination of the <em>inter vivas </em>trust, the principal will pass, as specified in the trust agreement, \u201c t\u00f3 such of the next of kin of said nominator [i.e., Sullivan] as would be entitled to receive the same under the statute of distributions of the State of New York if the said principal had been owned by him at the time of his death intestate with respect thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Thus, we are brought to the only remaining question in the case, namely, whether Sullivan\u2019s widow is within the content of the above language. In the light of settled authority, the answer is clear: use of the phrase \u201c next of kin \u201d in an agreement executed prior to September, 1930 \u2014 when amendment to the Decedent Estate Law (L. 1929, ch. 229) made a surviving spouse a distributee \u2014 does not include a widow. <em>(Matter of Waring, </em>275 N. Y. 6; <em>Matter of Battell, </em>286 N. Y. 97; <em>Trowbridge </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>294 N. Y. 785; <em>Matter of Cohn, </em>297 N. Y. 536, decided herewith.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Loughran, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Desmond, Thacheb and Dye, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
