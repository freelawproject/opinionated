The commissioner\u2019s order is invalid under the commerce clause, section 8 of article I of the United States Constitution, inasmuch as it denies petitioner the right to purchase milk in interstate commerce. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Rock Royal Co-op., Inc., </em>307 U.

The commissioner had denied the application of petitioner for an extension of its milk dealer\u2019s license issued pursuant to section 257 of the Agriculture and Markets Law. The extension would have permitted petitioner to operate a milk receiving plant at Greenwich, New York, in addition to petitioner\u2019s other similar plants already licensed and operating at Eagle Bridge, Salem and Norfolk, in this State. Eagle Bridge is in Rensselaer County and Salem and Greenwich are in Washington County, Rensselaer County being adjacent to Washington County on the south, and both these counties being on the easterly edge of New York State, bordering on Massachusetts and Vermont. Petitioner\u2019s Norfolk establishment is in St. Lawrence County in another part of New York State, and serves a different area and a different group of milk producers. The present Eagle Bridge and Salem depots, however, are quite close together and the proposed Greenwich plant, for which a license has been refused, is ten miles from Salem and twelve miles from Eagle Bridge. Petitioner\u2019s main contentions on the appeal are: first, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>that the commissioner\u2019s order is violative of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3); and second, that the order is not supported by the commissioner\u2019s findings made after the hearings conducted by him, or by the evidence. The two concurring opinions in the Appellate Division both said that the commissioner had acted on adequate proof and appropriate findings. Neither opinion discussed the constitutional point and it was not raised in the petition for review under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act. However, it was argued in petitioner\u2019s brief in the Appellate Division, and so is available to appellant in this court (see <em>Jongebloed </em>v. <em>Erie R. R. Co., </em>296 N. Y. 912).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Petitioner\u2019s business is wholly interstate in character. It purchases, at its several locations, milk delivered there by farmer-producers, weighs, tests and cools it (if not already cooled), then ships it, the same day, without any processing, to the Boston, Massachusetts, marketing area. Petitioner\u2019s procedures at the proposed Greenwich plant would be exactly the same. It appeared \u2014 and the commissioner found \u2014 that the new Greenwich plant would to some extent serve the convenience of petitioner and its suppliers. The Eagle Bridge and Salem depots have experienced some difficulty in the past in handling, before the 9:00 a.m. daily deadline for shipment out, the large quantities of milk brought there during the flush season. If the Greenwich facilities were added, petitioner would divert thither, and away from Salem and Eagle Bridge, some 300 cans of milk now arriving daily at Salem and Eagle Bridge, and would allow, but not require, any individual dairy farmer to use the depot nearest his farm. In addition, petitioner hoped, when and if it should go into operation at Greenwich, to take on some twenty to thirty new producers at the new place. Several other milk dealers have plants near Greenwich and some of them have facilities for handling more milk than they are now getting. The commissioner found all these things as facts, and found also that some Troy, New York, retail milk distributors now obtain milk in the area where applicant purchases and that \u201c the supply of milk for the Troy market during the last short season of October through January was inadequate.\u201d It was the commissioner\u2019s \u201c conclusion \u201d that the opening of another milk plant by petitioner and the taking on by it of producers now delivering to other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>dealers, would tend to reduce the volume at those other dealers\u2019 plants, thus tending to increase milk handling costs there, that there would be a tendency to deprive Troy and other local markets of their milk supply in flush seasons, that all producers now had outlets for their milk, that the licensing of the new Greenwich establishment would tend to destructive competition in an already adequately served market, and would not be in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Petitioner\u2019s whole business, present and proposed, is interstate commerce <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Rock Royal Co-op,, Inc., 307 </em>U. S. 533; <em>Milk Control Board </em>v. <em>Eisenberg Farm Products, </em>306 U. S. 346). A State cannot embargo the importation or exportation of legitimate articles of trade (see <em>City of Buffalo </em>v. <em>Reavey, </em>37 App. Div. 228) since, if such power existed, to quote the classic language of <em>Oklahoma </em>v. <em>Kansas Natural Gas Co. </em>(221 U. S. 229, 255): <em>\u201c </em>Pennsylvania might keep its coal, the Northwest its timber, the mining States their minerals.\u201d The order here attacked is of course not a direct prohibition of such exports, nor a prohibition in form, but petitioner insists that it is a prohibited interference with interstate commerce, since, according to petitioner, it \u2018 \u2018 by its necessary operation prevents, obstructs or burdens such transmission \u201d <em>(Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>262 U. S. 553, 596-597; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Cunard White Star, Ltd., </em>280 N. Y. 413). Similar attacks were made in <em>Milk Control Board </em>v. <em>Eisenberg Farm Products (supra) </em>on the enforcement, against milk bought for interstate shipment, of a Pennsylvania statute requiring that milk dealers like this petitioner, obtain State licenses, file surety bonds and pay to producers at least the minimum price fixed by the Pennsylvania Milk Control Board. The Supreme Court, by Justice Roberts, said (p. 352) that the real question was whether the prescription of prices fixed in an effort to control local conditions in the milk business, <em>\u201c </em>constitutes a prohibited burden on interstate <em>commerce, or </em>an incidental burden which is permissible until superseded by Congressional enactment.\u201d Describing the Eisenberg Company\u2019s purchase of milk at its receiving stations in Pennsylvania as a \u201c local business \u201d and \u201c essentially local in Pennsylvania \u201d, the Supreme Court .pointed out that the receiver\u2019s transaction with the farmer was completed when the price was paid and that the receiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>thereafter engaged \u201c in conserving and transporting its own property.\u201d Distinguishing a number of earlier cases, the <em>Eisenberg </em>decision held that in licensing these dealers and fixing their prices, Pennsylvania did not \u201c essay to regulate or to restrain the shipment of the respondent\u2019s milk into Hew York or to regulate its sale or the price at which respondent may sell it in Hew York.\u201d We say the same as to the action of the Hew York commissioner (respondent here) in dealing with an essentially local situation. Petitioner, under its present, unenlarged license, may still buy, at its Eagle Bridge, Salem and Horfolk locations, as much milk as it can get, and may send it where it will. Petitioner proved that an additional location would serve the convenience of some of the dairymen and of itself. The commissioner, however, found that the producers were adequately served by existing facilities, and that petitioner\u2019s proposed new branch would have a tendency to draw customers and milk away from local markets, and set up undesirable competition between petitioner and other dealers. That was the kind of local milk situation with which the State is authorized to deal <em>(Nebbia </em>v. <em>New York, </em>291 U. S. 502) and any interference with the free flow of interstate commerce was incidental only. It may be remarked that there is here no showing as to how much Hew York milk is exported across the State line. Absent such a showing, we cannot tell what proportion such interstate shipments bear to the whole of the production as to which the State licensing statute operates. In the <em>Eisenberg </em>case, where it was shown that only a small fraction of the milk produced in Pennsylvania went out of the State, the court found that to be another reason why \u201c the effect of the law on interstate commerce is incidental and not forbidden by the Constitution, in the absence of regulation by Congress \u201d (306 U. S. at p. 353). Hew York\u2019s activity, it seems to us, is within the <em>\u201c </em>residuum of power in the state to make laws governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect interstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it \u201d (see <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>325 U. S. 761, 767). Petitioner\u2019s answer to all this is that the determination here does not regulate, but in fact prohibits. As w\u00e9 see it, there is neither form nor substance of prohibition, only permissible regulation of local business.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Petitioner argues, further, that the commissioner\u2019s order here under attack,\u2019 conflicts with Federal milk order No. 4 issued pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (U. S. Code, tit. 7, \u00a7 671 <em>et seq.) </em>which order regulates the handling, price, etc., of milk sold in interstate commerce in the Boston area and which Federal order is valid as to this petitioner and its business (see <em>Hood &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>307 U. S. 588). We see no conflict between the Federal control set up by order No. 4 and the local' licensing of dealers, here under scrutiny. If the New York licensing laws conflict with Federal order No. 4, then the Pennsylvania licensing held valid in the <em>Eisenberg </em>case <em>(sufra), </em>was equally inconsistent with the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s so-called \u201c New York Price Order \u201d, or order No. 27, effective September 1, 1938, similar to the Boston order No. 4 and called to the Supreme Court\u2019s attention in the briefs in the <em>Eisenberg </em>case which was decided in February, 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Petitioner\u2019s final attack on the commissioner\u2019s determination assails it as unreasonable and unsupported by any evidence. The Agriculture and Markets Law (\u00a7 258-e) forbids the issuance of such a license \u20181 unless the commissioner is satisfied * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">that the issuance of the license will not tend to a destructive competition in a market already adequately served, and that the issuance of the license is in the public interest.\u201d The commissioner, as hereinabove noted, found, in petitioner\u2019s proposal, a tendency to destructive competition in an adequately served market, and that the public interest would not be served thereby. There was a basis for those findings, and we could not oppose any contrary views of ours, if we had any, to that of the State officer commissioned to make such decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Lotjghrau, Ch. J., Lewis, Couway, Thacher, Dye and Fuld, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
