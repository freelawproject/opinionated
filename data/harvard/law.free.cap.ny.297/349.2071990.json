Attempting to open a window in the employer\u2019s office, claimant sustained injuries to his hand when the pane broke. There is no doubt that the injuries arose out of and in the course of his employment. Question is raised, however, as to whether the nature of his employment was such as to entitle him to an award of workmen\u2019s compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Claimant testified that his work was \u201c engineering \u201d in connection with the planning of electrical work on his employer\u2019s school buildings. When additions were to be built onto existing buildings, he, in order \u201c to find out what the existing conditions in the buildings \u201d were, had to \u201c go out in the field \u201d to \u201c examine the existing electrical installations.\u201d At times that involved going up on a stepladder, taking covers off electrical boxes, counting wires, following electrical circuits, and using pliers, a flashlight and a ruler. Claimant had held the same position with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the board of education for about sixteen years before the accident, and during about ten of those years his trips into \u201c the field \u2019 \u2019 averaged thirty a year. For the five years before the accident, however, little or no actual construction work, old or new, had been done by the board, and so claimant\u2019s duties during that period and at the time of his injury were all performed in his employer\u2019s office. On that proof the compensation board decided in favor of claimant. It held, in an opinion, that <em>\u201c </em>claimant\u2019s work involves the operation and maintenance of electrical equipment \u201d and made findings that he, at the time of the accident, <em>\u201c </em>was engaged in a hazardous occupation \u201d, also that his employer <em>\u201c </em>was engaged in a hazardous employment as enumerated in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u201d, and that claimant\u2019s employment <em>\u201c </em>was incidental thereto.\u201d The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed, stating in its memorandum that claimant\u2019s duties (draughting) when injured were, under the broad definition in subdivision 13 of section 2 of the act, sufficiently related to actually hazardous work to bring the claim under the act. We granted the Board of Education leave to appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In <em>Matter of Leahy </em>v. <em>City of New York </em>(285 N. Y. 443) we pointed out that group 17 of subdivision 1 of section 3 of the act, and subdivision 4 of section 2 thereof, read together, made workmen\u2019s compensation available not only for employees of municipal corporations actually working at hazardous employments, but also for all the employees of any municipal corporation whose principal business is that of conducting a hazardous employment. In other words, as we there held: \u201c group 17 of section 3 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law makes the coverage of municipal employments co-extensive with that of the private employments covered by the law \u201d (285 N. Y. at p. 446). The present award, therefore, is valid if either of the two requirements thus stated in the <em>Leahy </em>opinion <em>{supra) </em>is here satisfied \u2014 that is, either if the board of education\u2019s principal business is that of conducting a hazardous employment, or if claimant himself was in a hazardous employment, within the meaning of the law, when his hand was lacerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The board of education\u2019s <em>\u201c </em>business \u201d is education and so . it cannot reasonably be held that claimant, as an employee of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>that hoard, was \u201c in the service of an employer whose principal business is that of carrying on or conducting a hazardous employment \u201d (Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 2, subd. 4; <em>Matter of Beeman </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>195 App. Div. 357, affd. 231 N. Y. 624). This award, therefore, depends for its validity on the correctness of the compensation board\u2019s finding, above referred to, that claimant himself \u201c was engaged in a hazardous occupation.\u201d This court, in <em>Matter of Griffin </em>v. <em>Cruikshank Co. </em>(253 N. Y. 303, 305) carefully and precisely stated the settled rule that1 \u2018 although the principal business of the employer was not a hazardous employment within the enumeration of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u201d, nonetheless, a claimant-employee could have his award if he himself was engaged, when injured, \u201c in one of the hazardous employments so enumerated \u201d. Employments classified by the act as \u201c hazardous \u201d are listed in subdivision 1 of section 3 of the act, in twenty different groups. The Appellate Division\u2019s memorandum here shows that court thought this claimant\u2019s employment came within group 4, which includes: <em>\u201c </em>installation of electric light and power lines or appliances \u201d, and/or group 6, which lists: \u201c manufacture of electric fixtures \u2019 \u2019 and/or group 7, which includes: \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>operation of electric light and power lines or appliances \u201d. Respondent suggests two other of section 3\u2019s groups to which claimant\u2019s job might be assigned: group 2, \u20181 care of buildings \u2019 \u2019, and group 5, <em>\u201c </em>laying of wires \u201d. Any argument that claimant\u2019s work, which had to do with the.designing or planning of electrical wiring layouts, and included going out into \u201c the field \u201d when necessary in that connection, did not amount to <em>\u201c </em>manufacture \u201c construction \u201d, <em>\u201c </em>operation \u201d or <em>\u201c </em>installation \u201d, is answered by the definition of those terms found in subdivision 13 of section 2 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. That subdivision reads: \u201c 13. \u2018 Manufacture, \u2019 \u2018 construction,\u2019 \u2018 operation \u2019 and \u2018 installation \u2019 shall include \u2018 repair,\u2019 \u2018 demolition,\u2019 \u2018 fabrication \u2019 and 1 alteration \u2019 and shall include all work done in connection with the repair of plants, buildings, grounds and approaches of all places where any of the hazardous employments are being carried on, operated or conducted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The fact that, on the day of the accident and for a long time theretofore, claimant had not been doing any of the more dan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>gerous parts of Ms work, is of no consequence. The test is simply whether his \u201c employment \u201d (meaning his general work or occupation) can be found listed in section 3. Cases like <em>Matter of Newman </em>v. <em>Newman </em>(218 N. Y. 325) and <em>Matter of Glatzl </em>v. <em>Stumpp </em>(220 N. Y. 71) dealing with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law before its 1916 amendments, are of historic interest only. In those days an injured workman, to get benefits, had to establish that his own employment and his employer\u2019s business were <em>both </em>hazardous. The word <em>\u201c </em>employee \u201d (see L. 1914, ch. 41) then meant \u201c a person who is engaged in a hazardous employment in the service of an employer carrying on or conducting the same \u201d. The 1916 amendments put into subdivision 4 of section,2 the definition of \u201c employee \u201d that we find there now. As Judge Pound noted in <em>Matter of Glatzl </em>v. <em>Stumpp (supra), </em>which was governed by the 1914 law although decided after the 1916 change, the Legislature in 1916, changed the law so as to make the <em>\u201c occupation </em>\u201d of the employee the test of coverage, whether or not the master\u2019s general business is a dangerous one and whether or not the injured worker, whose own general occupation is listed as <em>\u201c </em>hazardous \u201d, is doing, when hurt, work usually considered perilous. Whatever this court said to the contrary in <em>Matter of Glatzl </em>v. <em>Stumpp </em>(220 N. Y. at p. 74), had to do with special facts and a statute which was later radically changed. Since 1916, there has been applied in countless cases the rule of <em>Matter of Dose </em>v. <em>Moehle Lithographic Co. </em>(221 N. Y. 401), <em>Matter of Krinsky </em>v. <em>Ward &amp; Gow </em>(193 App. Div. 557, affd. 231 N. Y. 525, affd. <em>sub nom. Ward &amp; Gow </em>v. <em>Krinsky, </em>259 U. S. 503), and <em>Matter of Europe </em>v. <em>Addison Amusements, Inc. </em>(231 N. Y. 105), that if the definition of <em>\u201c </em>employee \u201d in subdivision 4 of section 2 be satisfied, the injury, to be compensable, need not be from any hazard specially inherent in, or peculiar to, the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Loughran, Oh.
