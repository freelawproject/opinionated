Preston (Preston) appeals from the decision of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of the Idaho State Tax Commission (the Commission). Preston sought judicial review of a deficiency assessment for Idaho income tax, penalties and interest for the years 1989 through 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-23\">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b549-24\">During the years at issue \u2014 1989 through 1991, Preston, a resident of Tennessee, held an interest as either a partner or shareholder in approximately 100 nursing homes and retirement centers throughout the United States. He was also the sole shareholder in Life Care Centers of America (LCCA). LCCA managed nursing homes and retirement centers, including the homes and centers in which Preston held an interest. LCCA was a subchapter S corporation for federal income tax purposes, whereby its income and losses were not taxed at the corporate level, but at the shareholder level. LCCA was Preston\u2019s only business that operated in Idaho during the years at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-25\">During 1989 through 1991, LCCA operated at a profit. Pursuant to section 63-3027A of the Idaho Code (I.C.), the Commission determined that three percent <em>(3%) </em>of the income earned by LCCA was taxable revenue generated in Idaho. The remainder of Preston\u2019s entities were unprofitable, and Preston reported losses on his federal income tax returns. He filed an amended personal tax return in Idaho, claiming that under the unitary business doctrine he may combine the profits from LCCA with the losses from his remaining entities. This combination would result in significant losses during each of the years at issue. Therefore, Preston <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>contends that he is entitled to allocate to Idaho a share of his aggregate net losses from all of his entities, rather than merely reporting the profits earned by LCCA. The Commission concluded that individuals are not entitled to use the unitary business doctrine that is available to corporations. The Commission also found that a nonresident individual may not deduct losses of partnerships that do not do business in Idaho and do not file tax returns in Idaho. Preston appealed the Commission\u2019s findings to the district court. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Commission, holding that there were no cogent reasons not to afford considerable weight to the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In an appeal of agency actions, the Court reviews the record independently of the district court\u2019s appellate decision. <em>Howard v. Canyon County Bd. of Comm\u2019r </em>s, 128 Idaho 479, 480, 915 P.2d 709, 710 (1996). \u201cUnless otherwise provided by statute or law, judicial review of agency action shall be based upon the record created before the agency.\u201d I.R.C.P. 84(j)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The \u201cstandard of \u2018free review5 is not applicable to agency determinations.\u201d <em>J.R. Simplot Co. v. Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>120 Idaho 849, 862, 820 P.2d 1206, 1219 (1991). To determine the appropriate level of deference that a court should give to an agency\u2019s construction of a statute, the Court in <em>Simplot </em>established a four-prong test. First, the court must determine if the agency has been entrusted with the responsibility to administer the statute at issue. Second, the agency\u2019s statutory construction must be reasonable. Third, the court must determine that the statutory language at issue does not expressly treat the precise question at issue. Finally, under the fourth prong of the test, a court must ask whether any of the rationales underlying the rule of deference are present. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the underlying rationales are absent then their absence may present reasons justifying the court in adopting a statutory construction which differs from that of the agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the four-prong test is met, then courts must give \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute. <em>Id. </em>Preston contends that the second and fourth prong of the test were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The statutes at issue are I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 63-3024, 63-3027 and 63-3027A. Preston seeks to employ combined reporting pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 63-3027, which allows taxpayers to treat a group of commonly owned corporations as a single corporation for purposes of combined reporting, if the group of corporations is deemed to be a unitary business. Preston seeks to set off income earned by LCCA with the losses experienced by the other entities in which he held an interest, by computing his tax liability under I.C. \u00a7 63-3027 and chapter 35.01.27 of the Idaho Administrative Procedures Act (IDAPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">The Commission contends that combined reporting is limited to corporations and may not be used by nonresident individuals, arguing that the legislature repealed the applicability of I.C. \u00a7 63-3027 to nonresident individuals, and that those individuals must compute their tax liability under I.C. \u00a7 63-3027A and IDAPA 35.01.27. According to the Commission, a nonresident individual may take into account income and losses from a partnership, corporation or other business entity only if the entity has an Idaho business situs. None of Preston\u2019s unprofitable businesses had a business situs in Idaho. Consequently, those losses cannot be taken into account in his Idaho nonresident individual income tax returns. The same regulation also requires that Preston, as the sole shareholder of an S corporation with an Idaho business situs, must be taxed on his pro rata share of that portion of the S corporation\u2019s income that is apportioned to Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">The issue presented is whether the Commission\u2019s statutory construction of I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 63-3024, 63-3027 and 63-3027A met the four prong test and should therefore be entitled to \u201cconsiderable weight.\u201d Because Preston only argues that the second and fourth prong of the test were not met, the Court will only address whether the Commission\u2019s statutory construction satisfies the second and fourth prongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>hi.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">THE COMMISSION MET THE SECOND PRONG OF THE TEST.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The second prong requires that the agency\u2019s statutory construction be reasonable. \u201c[DJeferenee [is] not ... appropriate when an agency interpretation \u2018is so obscure and doubtful that it is entitled to no weight or consideration.\u2019\u201d <em>J.R. Simplot Co., </em>120 Idaho at 862, 820 P.2d at 1219 (citing <em>State v. Omaechevviaria, </em>27 Idaho 797, 808, 152 P. 280, 281 (1915)). In <em>Simplot </em>the Court found that the Commission\u2019s statutory interpretation was a \u201c \u2018reasonable\u2019 one in the face of a statute that does not directly address the question at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 863, 820 P.2d at 1220. The statutes do not expressly treat the issue of whether an individual nonresident taxpayer who is the sole shareholder of an S corporation with an Idaho business situs may set off the taxable revenue from that corporation apportioned to Idaho with the non-Idaho losses suffered by his other partnership and business entities. The Commission\u2019s statutory interpretation is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">THE COMMISSION MET THE FOURTH PRONG OF THE TEST.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">If an agency with authority to administer a statutory area of law has made a reasonable construction of a statute on a question without a precise statutory answer then, under the fourth prong of the test, a court must ask whether any of the rationales underlying the rule of deference are present.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">If the underlying rationales are absent then their absence may present \u201ccogent reasons\u201d justifying the court in adopting a statutory construction which differs from that of the agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">When some of the rationales underlying the rule exist but other rationales are absent, a balancing is necessary because all of the supporting rationales may not be weighted equally. Therefore, the absence of one rationale in the presence of others could, in an appropriate case, still present a \u201ccogent reason\u201d for departing from the agency\u2019s statutory construction____ If one or more of the rationales underlying the rule are present, and no \u201ccogent reason\u201d exists for denying the agency some deference, the court should afford \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d to the agency\u2019s statutory interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-14\"><em>J.R. Simplot Co., </em>120 Idaho at 862, 820 P.2d at 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">The five rationales underlying the rule of deference are: (1) the rationale requiring that a practical interpretation of the statute exists, (2) the rationale requiring the presumption of legislative acquiescence, (3) the rationale requiring agency expertise, (4) the rationale of repose, and (5) the rationale requiring contemporaneous agency interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 858-59, 820 P.2d at 1215-16. The district court held that the first three of the five rationales were present and, therefore, the Commission\u2019s decision was entitled to \u201cconsiderable weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-16\">Preston contends that the first rationale requiring a practical interpretation of the statutes does not exist. The statute at issue, I.C. \u00a7 63-3027, as it read in 1989, clearly stated in its title that the section was to be used when \u201c[e]omputing [the] taxable income of <em>corporations.\u201d </em>I.C. \u00a7 63-3027 (1989) (emphasis added). Idaho Code \u00a7 63-3024, however, stated that a tax shall be imposed on the \u201ctaxable income of any nonresident individual, trust or estate derived from sources within the state of Idaho computed as required by section 63-3027A, Idaho Code.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 63-3024 (1989). Idaho Code \u00a7 63-3024 then directed nonresident individuals to compute their taxable income using 63-3027A which was entitled, \u201cComputing taxable income of part-year or <em>nonresident </em>individuals____\u201d I.C. \u00a7 63-3027A (1989) (emphasis added). A practical reading of these statutes indicates that Preston, as a nonresident individual, should have computed his taxes pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 63-3027A, not I.C. \u00a7 63-3027. Therefore, the Commission\u2019s interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 63-3027 is practical.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-19\">The second rationale requiring the presumption of legislative acquiescence is also present. To find legislative acquiescence, the <em>Simplot </em>court held that \u201c \u2018something more than mere silence is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>quired\u2019____ [W]e require \u2018something more\u2019 to determine <em>actual </em>legislative intent than merely reenacting the statute after it has received an agency construction.\u201d <em>J.R. Simplot Co., </em>120 Idaho at 864, 820 P.2d at 1221 (citations omitted). In this case the legislature evidenced its intent by more than \u201cmere silence\u201d when it repealed the statute that gave nonresident individuals the right to use combined reporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Until 1974 the combined reporting provisions of \u00a7 63-3027 applied to both nonresident individuals and corporations. In 1975 the Idaho Legislature deleted the reference to \u201cnonresident persons\u201d from the text and title of \u00a7 63-3027 and enacted \u00a7 63-3027A. During 1975, \u00a7 63-3027A permitted \u201ccorporations\u201d and \u201cany other taxpayer\u201d to use the allocation and apportionment provisions of \u00a7 63-3027. <em>See </em>1975 Idaho Sess. Laws Ch. 32, \u00a7 2, p. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Idaho Code \u00a7 63-3024, which imposes a tax on an individual\u2019s income, was amended in 1976 to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">63-3024. Individuals\u2019 Tax and Tax on Estates and Trusts. A tax is hereby imposed ... upon that part of the taxable income of any nonresident individual ... derived from sources within the state of Idaho as set forth in section 63-3027A, Idaho Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">1976 Idaho Sess. Laws Ch. 76, \u00a7 1, p. 247. Section 63-3024, therefore, directed nonresident individuals to compute their taxes pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 63-3027A, which does not provide for combined reporting. Furthermore, in 1976 the legislature deleted the cross-reference to \u00a7 63-3027 from the text of \u00a7 63-3027A. <em>See </em>1976 Idaho Sess. Laws Ch. 89, \u00a7 1, p. 303. These changes in the Idaho Code evidence an intent by the legislature to prevent nonresident individuals from using combined reporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">The final rationale, agency expertise, is also present in this case. The <em>Simplot </em>court noted that, \u201cbecause the judiciary in Idaho is intended to apply a general background to the law, the expertise of an agency is often useful in technical areas of the law where the risks of failing to understand all of the implications of a decision are great.\u201d <em>J.R. Simplot Co., </em>120 Idaho at 859, 820 P.2d at 1216. The area of tax is a technical area, and the Commission is an expert in this area. Accordingly, its decision should be given \u201cconsiderable weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">Because three of the rationales supporting the rule of deference are present in this ease, there is no \u201ccogent reason\u201d for departing from the agency\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">IT WAS WITHIN THE COMMISSION\u2019S DISCRETION TO APPLY THE LATE FILING PENALTY PURSUANT TO</p>\n<p id=\"A4P\">I.C. \u00a7 63-3046(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">The Commission assessed a late filing penalty against Preston in the amount of five percent (5%) of the tax per month of the delinquency, not to exceed twenty five percent (25%). Preston argues that the Commission did not have authority to assess a penalty against him pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 63-3046(c). According to Preston, the Idaho courts may assess the penalty, and the Commission collects it after it has been assessed by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-17\">The version of I.C. \u00a7 63-3030 in effect during the years at issue provided that every non-resident individual who was entitled to file a joint individual federal income tax return, and whose gross income from Idaho sources, combined with the gross income from Idaho sources of his spouse, exceeded Five Thousand Four Hundred Dollars ($5,400) was required to file an Idaho income tax return. It is undisputed that LCCA\u2019s Idaho source income for the years in question was at least $5,400. Pursuant to the version of ID APA 35.01.30 in effect during the years at issue, a shareholder\u2019s pro rata share of an S corporation\u2019s gross income constitutes the shareholder\u2019s gross income. Preston was the sole shareholder of LCCA. Therefore, Preston individually had gross income from Idaho sources during the years at issue in excess of the threshold requirement for filing an Idaho income tax return. Preston filed a joint individual federal income tax return with his wife for the years at issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>yet it is undisputed that he did not file an Idaho income tax return for those years.</p>\n<p id=\"AKP\">Idaho Code \u00a7 63-3046(c) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\">In the event that a return required by this act is not filed, ... there may be collected a penalty of five per cent (5%) of the tax due on such returns for each month elapsing after the due date of such returns until such penalty amounts to twenty-five per cent (25%) of the tax due on such returns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0n\">I.C. \u00a7 63-3046(c) (1989).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Preston argues that the Commission is without the power to impose a penalty because the language of the statute stated that a penalty \u201cmay be <em>collected </em>\u201d rather than <em>assessed. </em>This argument is without merit because part (a) of the statute specifically read: \u201cIf any part of the deficiency is due to negligence or disregard of the rules and regulations ... five per cent (5%) of the total amount of the deficiency ... shall be <em>assessed, </em>collected and paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, Preston does not offer any authority to support his contention that the courts are the only entities with have the power to assess a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Preston does cite <em>Ryder v. Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>130 Idaho 245, 939 P.2d 564 (1997), to support his contention that the imposition of a penalty is an abuse of discretion when the taxpayer has relied upon the opinion of the Commission. This is a correct statement of the law. However, <em>Ryder </em>is not on point. The Commission never advised Preston not to file Idaho tax returns. The Commission\u2019s imposition of a penalty is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The decision of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of the Commission is affirmed. Costs are awarded to the Commission.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-9\">TROUT, C.J., JOHNSON and SILAK, JJ., and HERNDON, J. Pro Tem, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-11\">. The current version of I.C. \u00a7 63-3046 is essentially identical to its 1989 version, except for a few minor revisions which are not relevant to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
