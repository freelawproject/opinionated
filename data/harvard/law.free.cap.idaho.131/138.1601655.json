Legal title to the property is vested in Board\u2019s Mill and Sunset Ranches, Inc. (Board\u2019s Mill). The lease agreement between the Allens and Board\u2019s Mill allows renewals which may extend the lease for a term not to exceed fifty (50) years. The Allens do not have an option to purchase the property. The lease describes the property by metes and bounds and includes land that is presently comprised of lots 24A and 24B.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">On December 1, 1989, Board\u2019s Mill obtained the County\u2019s approval to file a plat entitled \u201cBoard\u2019s Lower Ranch.\u201d The plat designates lot 24B, which is a portion of the Allens\u2019 leased property, as a \u201cnon-buildable lot.\u201d The plat was signed by a representative of Board\u2019s Mill but was not signed by the Allens. Legal notice was published in the Wood River Journal relating to all public hearings held regarding the plat, but the Allens did not receive personal notice of the proceedings and were unaware of the recording of the plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">Idaho Code section 50-1302, which was applicable at the time, provided that \u201c[ejvery owner proposing a subdivision ... shall cause the same to be surveyed and a plat made thereof ... and shall record said plat.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 50-1302 (1988). Section 50-1301(3) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Idaho Code defined owner as \u201c[t]he proprietor of the land, (having legal title).\u201d I.C. \u00a7 50-1301(3) (1988). The Allens maintain that, at the time the plat was recorded, they were owners as a consequence of their long-term leasehold interest and that the plat restrictions affecting the property in which they have an interest are not valid since they did not receive notice of the proceedings and did not sign the plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">On October 1, 1991, the Allens and Board\u2019s Mill entered into a settlement agreement with Board\u2019s Mill whereby Board\u2019s Mill consented to and approved the Allens\u2019 application to begin construction of certain improvements on their leased property, and the Allens\u2019 partial assignment of their lease concerning lot 24B to Geoffrey Parker which was made under a prior written lease assignment, dated July 12, 1991. Any dispute the Allens may have had with Board\u2019s Mill relating to the recording of the plat without the Allens\u2019 consent or approval is not before this Court. This case concerns only the dispute between the Allens and Blaine County which arose when the Allens submitted an application to the County for approval to build a rental home on their leased property. The County applied the plat restrictions to the property, including the \u201cnon-buildable lot\u201d restriction on lot 24B, and denied the Allens\u2019 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">The Allens filed a complaint requesting judicial review of the County\u2019s denial of their application pursuant to the Idaho Adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>trative Procedure Act and a declaratory-judgment under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, declaring the plat restrictions null and void as applied to them and their assignee. As to their claim for judicial review, the Allens alleged that imposing the plat restrictions upon them deprived them of a present possessory interest in the property without just compensation, asserting that the restrictions arose only after the acquisition of their leasehold interest and without their consent. Further, they alleged that the County\u2019s denial of their application was arbitrary and capricious, without support in the record, not. supported by the evidence, in excess of the County\u2019s authority, and an abuse of discretion. As to their claim for a declaratory judgment, the Allens alleged that the plat restrictions were void as to them and their assignee because such restrictions had arisen outside their chain of title and without their consent. The Allens moved for summary judgment, supporting the motion with their affidavits and the affidavits of two other lessees of real property within the platted property, each asserting that they did not have notice of the plat recording or an opportunity to object or consent to the plat recording. The Allens asserted that the term \u201cowner\u201d as defined in I.C. \u00a7 50-1301(3) included leasehold interests, and, consequently, their consent and signatures were required before the plat restricting the use of their leased property could be validly recorded and enforced against them and their assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The district court denied the Allens\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment for the County, holding that the legislature did not intend to include a lessee as an owner in the provision in chapter 13, title 50 of the Idaho Code, requiring that \u201c[e]very owner proposing a subdivision\u201d have a plat made and recorded. Consequently, the plat recorded by Board\u2019s Mill, as titleholder to the property, was validly recorded and enforceable by Blaine County against the Allens and their assignee, despite the fact that the plat was recorded absent the Allens\u2019 signature or consent.. The Allens appeal this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Under the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act (IDAPA), a party who has been aggrieved by a final agency action may file a petition for review or declaratory judgment in the district court of the appropriate county after exhausting all administrative remedies. I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 67-5270 \u2014 5272. Under the IDAPA, \u201cagency\u201d is defined as \u201ceach state board, commission, department or officer authorized by law to make rules or to determine contested eases.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-5201(2). Although a county board of commissioners does not fall within this definition, a decision by a county board of commissioners is subject to judicial review \u201cin the same manner as provided in [Idaho\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act].\u201d I.C. \u00a7 31-1506(1). Thus, a county board of commissioners is treated as an administrative agency for purposes of judicial review. <em>See Intermountain Health Care, Inc. v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>107 Idaho 248, 251, 688 P.2d 260, 263 (Ct.App.1984), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds by Intermountain Health Care Inc. v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Blaine County, </em>109 Idaho 299, 707 P.2d 410 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">1. Summary Judgment: When this Court reviews the district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment, it employs the same standard properly employed by the district court when originally ruling on the motion. <em>City of Chubbuck v. City of Pocatello, </em>127 Idaho 198, 200, 899 P.2d 411, <em>413 </em>(1995); <em>Friel v. Boise City Hous. Auth., </em>126 Idaho 484, 485, 887 P.2d 29, 30 (1994). Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. I.R.C.P. 56(c); <em>Mutual of Enumclaw v. Box, </em>127 Idaho 851, 852, 908 P.2d 153, 154 (1995). Both this Court and the district court shall liberally construe the record in favor of the party opposing the motion for summary judgment, drawing all reasonable inferences and conclusions supported by the record in favor of that party. <em>City of Chubbuck, </em>127 Idaho at 200, 899 P.2d at 413. In this ease, summary judgment was granted to the non-moving party. <em>See Spencer-Steed v. Spencer, </em>115 Idaho 338, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>345, 766 P.2d 1219, 1226 (1988) (\u201cDavid was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on this issue, even though he had not moved for summary judgment.\u201d); <em>Juker v. American Livestock Ins. Co., </em>102 Idaho 644, 645, 637 P.2d 792, 793 (1981) (\u201cAlthough appellant made no motion for summary judgment, where one party moves for summary judgment and the other is entitled to it, the court may grant summary judgment in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d). In this instance, the Court liberally construes the record in favor of the party against whom summary judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">2. Agency Review: On appeal, this Court reviews agency decisions directly, independent of the district court\u2019s determination. <em>Willig v. Idaho Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Welfare, </em>127 Idaho 259, 261, 899 P.2d 969, 971 (1995); <em>Boise Group Homes, Inc. v. Idaho Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Welfare, </em>123 Idaho 908, 909, 854 P.2d 251, 252 (1993); <em>Dovel v. Dobson, </em>122 Idaho 59, 61, 831 P.2d 527, 529 (1992). Erroneous conclusions of law made by an agency may be corrected on appeal. <em>Love v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Bingham County, </em>105 Idaho 558, 559, 671 P.2d 471, 472 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">THE ALLENS WERE NOT OWNERS OF THE REAL PROPERTY WITHIN THE MEANING OF CHAPTER 13, TITLE 50</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The plat in question was executed with a purported \u201cowner\u2019s certificate,\u201d thus, requiring certification of \u201cthe owner or owners of the land included in said plat,\u201d pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 50-1309(1). Section 50-1301 of the Idaho Code defines \u201cowner\u201d as \u201c[t]he proprietor of the land, (having legal title).\u201d I.C. \u00a7 50-1301(3) (1988). Whether the term \u201cowner\u201d includes a person with a leasehold interest is a question of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">When interpreting the meaning of statutory language, the Court is to give effect to the legislative intent and purpose of the statute. <em>Davaz v. Priest River Glass Co., </em>125 Idaho 333, 336, 870 P.2d 1292, 1295 (1994) (\u201cA construing court\u2019s primary duty is to give effect to the legislative intent and purpose underlying a statute.\u201d); <em>Umphrey v. Sprinkel, </em>106 Idaho 700, 706, 682 P.2d 1247, 1253 (1983) (\u201cThe principal rule governing statutory interpretation is to give effect to the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d). \u201cThe legislature\u2019s intent in enacting a statute may be implied from the language used or inferred on grounds of policy or reasonableness.\u201d <em>Black v. Reynolds, </em>109 Idaho 277, 280, 707 P.2d 388, 391 (1985), <em>overruled on other grounds by Stewart v. Rice, </em>120 Idaho 504, 817 P.2d 170 (1991). Where statutory terms are ambiguous, the true meaning of the terms can be found from extraneous circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">Whether leasehold interests are included within the meaning of \u201cowner\u201d under I.C. \u00a7 50-1301 has not been addressed by this Court. On its face the definition of \u201cowner\u201d as \u201c[t]he proprietor of the land, <em>(having legal title)\u201d </em>appears to exclude leaseholders from the status of owners. (Emphasis added). The Allens argue, however, that the holder of a lease interest has been recognized as an owner, citing to <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>which defines \u201cowner\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-13\">The person in whom is vested the ownership, dominion, or title of property; proprietor. He who has dominion of a thing, real or personal, corporeal or incorporeal, which he has a right to enjoy and do with as he pleases, even to spoil or destroy it, as far as the law permits, unless he be prevented by some agreement or covenant which restrains his right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-14\">... The primary meaning of the word as applied to land is one who owns the fee and who has the right to dispose of the property, but the term also includes one having a possessory right to land or the person occupying or cultivating it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 996 (5th ed.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-16\">The Allens also rely upon <em>Hare v. Young, </em>26 Idaho 682, 689, 146 P. 104, 106 (1915), in which this Court held that a lessee of personal property was the \u201cowner\u201d of the property where the lessee had retained possession of the property for many years, \u201cdealt with [the property] as his own, sold and otherwise disposed of portions of it, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>mortgaged it without objection upon the part of the lessors.\u201d The <em>Hare </em>court essentially stated the definition of \u201cowner\u201d as set forth in <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, the dispute in <em>Hare </em>was between two private parties and involved personal property. The present case involves a dispute with a governmental entity and centers around real property. To the extent <em>Hare </em>speaks of real property, the language is dicta. More importantly, the Court in <em>Hare </em>was not dealing with a statute comparable to I.C. \u00a7 50-1301 which specifically limits the definition of owner to the proprietor \u201chaving legal title.\u201d Legal title is defined by <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">One cognizable or enforceable in a court of law, or one which is complete and perfect so far as regards the apparent right of ownership and possession, but which carries no beneficial interest in the property, another person being equitably entitled thereto; in either case, the antithesis of \u201cequitable title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 807-08 (5th ed.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Had the legislature intended \u201cowner\u201d as defined in I.C. \u00a7 50-1301(3) to include \u201clessee,\u201d it would have done so, as it did in section 36-1604 of the Idaho Code which sets forth the extent of a landowner\u2019s liability. Section 36-1604 defines \u201cowner\u201d as \u201cthe possessor of a fee interest, a tenant, lessee, occupant or person in control of the premises.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 36-1604(b)(2). No such language is included in I.C. \u00a7 50-1301(3). Instead, the legislature restricted the definition of owner to one \u201chaving legal title,\u201d indicating that the legislature did not intend \u201cowner\u201d to include a \u201clessee.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 50-1301(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The district court was correct in determining that the leasehold interest held by the Allens did not make them owners of the real property for purposes of determining who must sign the subdivision plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">THE BUILDING RESTRICTIONS IN THE SUBDIVISION PLAT RECORDED BY THE OWNERS ARE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE AL-LENS BY THE COUNTY</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Section 50-1309 of the Idaho Code sets forth the requirements for a valid plat executed by an owner\u2019s certificate. Pursuant to this section,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">[t]he owner or owners of the land included in said plat shall make a certificate containing the correct description of the land, with the statement as to their intentions to include the same in the plat, and make a dedication of all public streets and alleys shown on said plat, which certificate shall be acknowledged before an officer duly authorized to take acknowledgments and shall be indorsed on the plat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">I.C. \u00a7 50-1309(1) (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">In view of this Court\u2019s determination that the term \u201cowner,\u201d as used in I.C. \u00a7 50-1301(3), does not include a leasehold interest, the plat in question was validly recorded and is, therefore, enforceable by the County against the Allens. Board\u2019s Mill was the owner of the property encompassed within the subdivision plat and executed the plat prior to approval by the County. Accordingly, the subdivision plat is valid and enforceable by the County as recorded, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 50-1309, irrespective of whether the Allens consented or executed the plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">NO ATTORNEY FEES ARE AWARDED</p>\n<p id=\"b188-17\">The County seeks an award of attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-121. Attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121 are not available to parties in an appeal from an agency decision because it is not \u201ca civil action ... commenced by filing a complaint with the court.\u201d I.R.C.P. 3(a) as contemplated by I.R.C.P. 54(e)(1); <em>Lowery v. Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>County Comm\u2019rs for Ada County, </em>117 Idaho 1079, 1081, 793 P.2d 1251, 1253 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">However, under the IDAPA, a party aggrieved by a final agency action may file a petition for review or a declaratory judgment in the appropriate district court after exhausting all administrative remedies. I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 67-5270 \u2014 5272. Even if the Court were to treat the petition for a declaratory judgment as a \u201ccomplaint,\u201d constituting a civil action, as contemplated by I.C. \u00a7 12-121,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an award of attorney fees would not be appropriate. The main issue on appeal involved the statutory interpretation of a term under chapter 13, title 50 of the Idaho Code, which this Court had not construed. The law in this area was not well settled. Accordingly, no attorney fees are awarded. <em>See Minich v. Gem State Developers, Inc., </em>99 Idaho 911, 918, 591 P.2d 1078, 1085 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Blaine County and the Board of Commissioners of Blaine County is affirmed.
