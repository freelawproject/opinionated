The district court held that (1) Michelle Osborn failed to give timely notice of her tort claim pursuant to section 6-906A of the Idaho Tort Claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Act (ITCA), and (2) any federal claims brought by Osborn were barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Michelle Osborn attended Centennial High School from 1989 to 1991. During that time Oscar Salinas was employed as a teacher at Centennial High School by the Meridian School District. On December 13, 1995, Osborn filed a complaint against Salinas alleging assault, battery and sexual abuse. Osborn also filed a complaint against the School District alleging negligence and civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The School District moved for summary judgment on the basis that: (1) Osborn failed to give timely notice of her claims pursuant to section 6-906A of the ITCA, and (2) the \u00a7 1983 claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the School District.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Osborn argues that: (1) section 6-906A of the ITCA does not govern sexual abuse actions brought by minors; instead, Chapter 17 of the Idaho Code, entitled \u201cTort Actions in Child Abuse Cases,\u201d is applicable as it was specifically intended to address the sexual abuse actions brought by minors, (2) the applicable statute of limitations for a \u00a7 1983 claim involving sexual abuse is section 6-1704 of the Idaho Code (I.C.), and (3) a showing of gross negligence is sufficient to maintain an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">On appeal from a summary judgment order, this Court applies the same standard of review as that used by the district court when originally ruling on the motion. <em>Avila v. Wahlquist, </em>126 Idaho 745, 747, 890 P.2d 331, 333 (1995); <em>Farm Credit Bank of Spokane v. Stevenson, </em>125 Idaho 270, 272, 869 P.2d 1365, 1367 (1994). The Court must liberally construe the facts in the existing record in favor of the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences from the record in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Avila, </em>126 Idaho at 747, 890 P.2d at 333; <em>Bonz v. Sudweeks, </em>119 Idaho 539, 541, 808 P.2d 876, 878 (1991). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the nonmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>McCoy v. Lyons, </em>120 Idaho 765, 769, 820 P.2d 360, 364 (1991) (quoting I.R.C.P. 56(c)). If there are conflicting inferences contained in the record or reasonable minds might reach different conclusions, summary judgment must be denied. <em>Bonz, </em>119 Idaho at 541, 808 P.2d at 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">IDAHO CODE \u00a7 6-906A APPLIES TO ALL ACTIONS BROUGHT BY MINORS, INCLUDING ACTIONS ALLEGING SEXUAL ABUSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-17\">The Idaho Tort Claims Act requires any party bringing a claim against a governmental entity to file a timely notice of a tort claim. Pursuant to this Act a minor must give notice within \u201cone hundred and twenty (120) days after said person reaches the age of majority or six (6) years from the date the claim arose or should reasonably have been discovered, whichever is earlier.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 6-906A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is undisputed that under I.C. \u00a7 6-906A, Osborn failed to give timely notice to the School District of her tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-18\">Osborn argues that I.C, \u00a7 6-906A should not govern sexual abuse actions brought by minors. Instead, Chapter 17 of the Idaho Code entitled \u201cTort Actions in Child Abuse Cases,\u201d should apply because it specifically deals with sexual abuse actions brought by minors. Idaho Code \u00a7 6-1701 provides in relevant part: \u201cAn action may be brought by or on behalf of any child against a person who has ... [s]exually abused any child____\u201d The statute of limitations for such an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>provides that \u201can action under the provisions of this chapter must be commenced within five (5) years from the date that an aggrieved child reaches the age of eighteen (18) years.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 6-1704.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">To support her argument that I.C. \u00a7 6-1704 is applicable, Osborn relies on <em>Doe v. Durtschi, </em>110 Idaho 466, 716 P.2d 1238 (1986). In <em>Durtschi </em>the Court applied the general tolling statute, I.C. \u00a7 5-230, to toll the running of time within which \u00a7 6-906A of the ITCA required minors to give notice to the school district regarding negligence claims. Osborn\u2019s reliance on <em>Durtschi </em>is misplaced. The action arose before the enactment of I.C. \u00a7 6-906A, and the <em>Durtschi </em>Court noted that \u201c[w]ith the passage of I.C. \u00a7 6-906A, the legislature expressly applied the general tolling statute\u2019s policy of protecting minors to the notice of claim requirement in the ITCA. As a result, the subsequent discussion of \u00a7 6-906\u2019s implications for minors pertains only to actions arising before the effective date of \u00a7 6-906A, which is July 1, 1985.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475 n. 5, 716 P.2d at 1247 n. 5 (citation omitted). As the <em>Durtschi </em>Court explained, the legislature enacted I.C. \u00a7 6-906A to protect the rights of injured minors until they are old enough to take appropriate action. Accordingly, there is no reason to apply I.C. \u00a7 6-1704, when a statute exists that specifically applies to minors filing actions against governmental entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Furthermore, I.C. \u00a7 6-1704 sets a time limit within which to file an action, not to file notice of a tort claim. Even if it were intended to toll the time in which minors must give notice of their claims, the statute applies to the perpetrators of sexual abuse and does not govern claims against third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR SECTION 1983 CLAIMS IS I.C. \u00a7 5-219(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">In <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985), the United States Supreme Court sought to select the <em>one </em>most appropriate state statute of limitations for all \u00a7 1983 claims. The Court held that \u00a7 1983 claims are best characterized as personal injury claims, and as such each state shall apply their statute of limitations governing personal injury actions. Following the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wilson, </em>Idaho courts have held that \u00a7 1983 actions must meet the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions set forth in I.C. \u00a7 5-219(4). <em>Henderson v. State, </em>110 Idaho 308, 715 P.2d 978 (1986); <em>Herrera v. Conner, </em>111 Idaho 1012, 729 P.2d 1075 (Ct.App.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Nevertheless, Osborn argues that the applicable statute of limitations in \u00a7 1983 actions involving sexual abuse is I.C. \u00a7 6-1704. She reasons that minors who experience sexual abuse lack the judgment and awareness to protect their rights by filing a timely claim. While Osborn\u2019s policy argument may be compelling, it ignores the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding that all \u00a7 1983 claims should be characterized in the same way; they will not be evaluated differently depending upon the varying factual circumstances and legal theories presented in each case. <em>Wilson, </em>471 U.S. at 275, 105 S.Ct. 1938. \u201c[UJnder such an approach different statutes of limitations would be applied to the various \u00a7 1983 claims arising in the same State, and multiple periods of limitations would often apply to the same case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, 105 S.Ct. 1938. Thus, the very approach that Osborn seeks, is the approach the United States Supreme Court specifically ruled against.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">Furthermore, this Court lacks the authority to characterize \u00a7 1983 claims. \u201c[TJhe problem of characterization \u2018is ultimately a question of federal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269-70, 105 S.Ct. 1938 (citing <em>Auto Workers v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp., </em>383 U.S. 696, 706, 86 S.Ct. 1107, 16 L.Ed.2d 192 (1966)). In the interest of uniformity the United States Supreme Court characterized all \u00a7 1983 claims as personal injury. \u201c[TJhe federal interest in uniformity and the interest in having \u2018firmly defined, easily applied rules,\u2019 support the conclusion that Congress intended the characterization of \u00a7 1983 to be measured by federal rather than state standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 105 S.Ct. 1938 (internal citation omitted). Therefore, state - courts may not re-characterize any \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Because Osborn\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim is time barred, it is not necessary to address whether something less than intentional conduct is enough to trigger the protections of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">The district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment is affirmed.
