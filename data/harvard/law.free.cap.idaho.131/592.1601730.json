The defendant, David W. Hoots (Hoots), alleges that the district court erred in admitting evidence of prior uncharged sexual misconduct in his trial for lewd conduct with a minor. We affirm the district court\u2019s admission of the evidence under I.R.E. 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Hoots was charged with three counts of Lewd Conduct with Minor Child Under Sixteen, in violation of I.C. \u00a7 18-1508. At Hoots\u2019 trial, the victim, A.W., testified that she and Hoots engaged in kissing, petting, and oral sex. A.W. was fourteen years old at the time of the sexual misconduct and was friends with Hoots\u2019 daughter. All of the incidents of sexual misconduct occurred in Hoots\u2019 house when his wife and children were either asleep or not at home. The district court admitted evidence, over Hoots\u2019 objection, of Hoots\u2019 prior uncharged sexual misconduct with another minor, W.M. W.M. testified that Hoots kissed her against her will and made sexual advances toward her. W.M. was fifteen years old at the time of the sexual misconduct and was dating Hoots\u2019 son. A jury found Hoots guilty on all three counts of Lewd Conduct with Minor Child Under Sixteen. The district court entered a judgment of conviction and imposed a unified sentence of thirty years with five years fixed on each count, and ordered that the sentences run concurrently. Hoots appeals from the conviction, asserting that the district court erred in admitting W.M.\u2019s testimony as evidence under I.R.E. 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"APl\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s admission of evidence of prior misconduct, we exercise free review over the trial court\u2019s determination of the relevancy of the misconduct. <em>State v. LaBelle, </em>126 Idaho 564, 567, 887 P.2d 1071, 1074 (1995) (citing <em>State v. Grube, </em>126 Idaho 377, 883 P.2d 1069 (1994)). We review for an abuse of discretion the trial court\u2019s determination that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Lewis, </em>126 Idaho 77, 82, 878 P.2d 776, 781 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-16\">TESTIMONY OF PRIOR MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b639-17\">Hoots alleges on appeal that the district court erred in admitting evidence of prior uncharged sexual misconduct in his trial\u2019 for lewd conduct with a minor. The district court permitted the testimony of W.M., who stated that Hoots engaged in sexual misconduct with her while she was a minor. The State .contends that the evidence was properly admitted pursuant to I.R.E. 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-18\">I.R.E. 404(b) provides that evidence of a defendant\u2019s other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the defendant\u2019s character in order to show that the defendant acted in conformity therewith. However, such evidence may be admissible for other purposes, including \u201cproof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d <em>See </em>I.R.E. 404(b). <em>See, e.g., State v. LaBelle, 126 </em>Idaho 564, 887 P.2d 1071 (1995); <em>State v. Phillips, </em>123 Idaho 178, 845 P.2d 1211 (1993); <em>State v. Tolman, 121 </em>Idaho 899, 828 P.2d 1304 (1992); <em>State v. Moore, </em>120 Idaho 743, 819 P.2d 1143 (1991). In determining whether evidence of a defendant\u2019s uncharged misconduct should be admitted, the court must apply a two-tiered analysis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>See Moore, </em>120 Idaho at 745, 819 P.2d at 1145. First, the court must determine whether \u201cthe evidence is relevant to a material and disputed issue concerning the crime charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, the court must determine whether \u201cthe probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">When a defendant is charged with lewd conduct with, or sexual abuse of, a minor, testimony of the defendant\u2019s prior sexual misconduct may be admissible if it shows a \u201cgeneral plan to exploit and sexually abuse an identifiable group of young female victims.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>120 Idaho at 745, 819 P.2d at 1145. Such testimony is relevant as to the credibility of the victim. <em>Id. </em>Although the Court has applied Rule 404(b) in a number of cases, the facts of the present case are most similar to those in <em>State v. Phillips, </em>123 Idaho 178, 845 P.2d 1211 (1993). In <em>Phillips, </em>the defendant was charged with two counts of sexual abuse of a minor under the age of sixteen. <em>Id. </em>at 179, 845 P.2d at 1212. The victim was the defendant\u2019s niece, and was friends with the defendant\u2019s daughter. <em>Id. </em>The trial court permitted the testimony of three women who claimed that when they were minors and were friends with the defendant\u2019s daughter, the defendant would invite them into his garage to view pornographic materials, and would then touch them inappropriately. <em>Id. </em>at 180, 845 P.2d at 1213. The Court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision admitting evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior uncharged sexual misconduct, finding that the victim\u2019s credibility was squarely at issue for the jury to decide because the defendant did not testify. <em>Id. </em>at 181, 845 P.2d at 1214. The Court stated that the testimony of the three women demonstrated the defendant\u2019s general plan to exploit and sexually abuse minor females who were relatives or friends of the defendant\u2019s daughter and visited the defendant\u2019s home. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In this case, A.W. was fourteen years old at the time of the sexual misconduct with Hoots. A.W. was a friend of Hoots\u2019 daughter and, therefore, was often at the Hoots\u2019 residence. The sexual misconduct always occurred in Hoots\u2019 house, either when his wife and children were not home or were asleep. W.M., who offered testimony concerning pri- or uncharged sexual misconduct by Hoots, was fifteen years old at the time of the misconduct. W.M. was dating Hoots\u2019 son and, therefore, was a visitor to the Hoots\u2019 residence. W.M. testified that Hoots kissed her against her will, and made sexual advances toward her when his wife and children were not around. Based upon the above, there exists sufficient similarities between Hoots\u2019 sexual misconduct with A.W. and W.M. to demonstrate a general plan by Hoots to exploit and sexually abuse minor females who were friends of his children and visited his home. Thus, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that W.M.\u2019s testimony was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The district court weighed the probative value of W.M.\u2019s testimony against the danger of unfair prejudice to Hoots, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">I\u2019ve read the whole series of cases that have evolved over this, starting with Moore, and Phillips, and Labell [sic], and gave those all some thought and looked at it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">Now, in weighing it as far as prejudice, whether its prejudice would outweigh its relevance, which is the second part of the analysis, this evidence that we\u2019re talking about is not near as prejudicial in that sense as some of those in the cases that were sustained under which these concepts have been developed. There isn\u2019t any testimony here of actual sexual touching other than a kissing incident, at least in the offer of proof here. So we don\u2019t have any of the oral/genital or the hand to the breasts or anything like that type of contact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Hoots\u2019 misconduct with W.M. was limited to a kiss and some sexually suggestive comments. Although a jury would likely find such conduct offensive, W.M.\u2019s testimony is more helpful to the jury in assessing the credibility of A.W. than it is prejudicial to Hoots. Applying our three-part standard of review of a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion, <em>State v. Hedger, </em>115 Idaho 598, 768 P.2d 1331 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>(1989), we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the probative value of W.M.\u2019s testimony was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Hoots.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Thus, we conclude that the district court did not err in admitting evidence of Hoots\u2019 prior uncharged sexual misconduct under I.R.E. 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">We affirm the district court\u2019s admission of W.M.\u2019s testimony as evidence under I.R.E. 404(b). First, the district court did not err in finding that W.M.\u2019s testimony was relevant. Second, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the probative value of W.M.\u2019s testimony was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Hoots.</p>\n<judges id=\"b641-9\">JOHNSON, SILAK, SCHROEDER and WALTERS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
