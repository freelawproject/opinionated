We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Pena-Reyes\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-19\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b702-20\">On November 3, 1995, the State of Idaho (State) filed a complaint charging Pena-Reyes with one count of trafficking in cocaine and one count of trafficking in methamphetamine. Pursuant to a plea agreement with the State, Pena-Reyes entered an unconditional plea of guilty to one count of trafficking in cocaine. Four days prior to the sentencing hearing, Pena-Reyes filed a motion challenging the constitutionality of I.C. \u00a7 37-2732B(a)(7), the statute under which he was to be sentenced. I.C. \u00a7 37-2732B(a)(7) imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for a guilty plea to trafficking in cocaine, which \u201cshall not be suspended, deferred, or withheld.\u201d The district court denied Pena-Reyes\u2019 motion on the basis that it was untimely, and imposed a five-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-21\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-22\">CONSTITUTIONALITY OF</p>\n<p id=\"b702-23\">I.C. \u00a7 37-2732B(a)(7)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-24\">On appeal, Pena-Reyes asserts that I.C. \u00a7 37-2732B(a)(7) violates Article 5, Section 13, of the Idaho Constitution because it prohibits the sentencing judge from exercising the inherent judicial power to suspend sentences. The State argues that the Court should not consider Pena-Reyes\u2019 constitutional challenge because he did not obtain a ruling below on the merits of his motion; rather, the district court denied Pena-Reyes\u2019 motion on the basis that it was untimely, stating that Pena-Reyes\u2019 constitutional challenge to the sentencing statute should have been brought prior to Pena-Reyes\u2019 entry of an unconditional guilty plea. Although the district court denied Pena-Reyes\u2019 motion as untimely, the district court addressed the merits of Pena-Reyes\u2019 motion at the sentencing hearing, stating: \u201cIf I had discretion in this matter, I think I could fashion a better sentence that would meet all of the goals that a court should be meeting in sentencing, but a court has no discretion in the areas [sic] of trafficking in cocaine.\u201d The district court\u2019s statement contains an implicit ruling that</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>I.C. \u00a7 37-2732B(a)(7) is constitutional, and thus, we will address Pena-Reyes\u2019 constitutional challenge on appeal. <em>See Northcutt v. Sun Valley Co., </em>117 Idaho 351, 356-57, 787 P.2d 1159, 1164-65 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The Idaho Supreme Court, in <em>State v. McCoy, </em>94 Idaho 236, 486 P.2d 247 (1971), held the judiciary had the inherent right to suspend sentences. In 1978, in response to <em>McCoy, </em>the legislature proposed and the people adopted an amendment to Article 5, Section 13, of the Idaho Constitution, which added the following language: \u201cprovided, however, that the legislature can provide mandatory minimum sentences for any crimes, and any sentence imposed shall be not less than the mandatory minimum sentence so provided. Any mandatory minimum sentence so imposed shall not be reduced.\u201d Idaho Const, art. V, \u00a7 13. This amendment effectively circumscribes the power of our courts to suspend a mandatory minimum sentence contained in a statute enacted pursuant to the authority of our constitution. Thus, we find that I.C. \u00a7 37-2732B(a)(7) does not violate Article 5, Section 13, of the Idaho Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Pena-Reyes\u2019 motion challenging the constitutionality of I.C. \u00a7 37-2732B(a)(7). We decline to address the other issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b703-8\">JOHNSON, SILAK, SCHROEDER and WALTERS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
