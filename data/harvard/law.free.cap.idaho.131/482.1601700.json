We conclude that pursuant to section 49-1007 of the Idaho Code (I.C.), the Idaho Transportation Department (the Department) is immune from liability for its activities in weighing a tanker truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">THE BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">On March 1,1995, a V-l Oil Company (V-1) tanker truck (the truck) filled with liquid propane was stopped and weighed at a temporary port of entry by employees of the-Department using a portable scale unit. As a result of this weighing, the Department issued V-l an excess weight citation. The prosecuting attorney dismissed the citation with prejudice on May 31, 1995, one day before trial. V-l then sued the Department alleging that the Department, through its employees, acted \u201cmaliciously, intentionally, recklessly, willfully and wantonly, grossly negligently and/or negligently\u201d in weighing the truck because \u201cth\u00e9 location where the weight of the vehicle was obtained was clearly not proper as to level or surface conditions\u201d and the Department\u2019s employees \u201cfailed to [thereafter] take the truck to a certified scale.\u201d V-l demanded damages for loss of use of the truck and driver and interruption of its business in the amount of $500 plus $3,412 in attorney fees and costs for defending the overweight citation. The magistrate judge dismissed V-l\u2019s suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to rule 12(b)(6) of the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure (I.R.C.P.), concluding that the Department is immune from liability pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 49-1007. V-l appealed this decision to the district judge. The district judge, employing a somewhat different rationale, affirmed the magistrate judge\u2019s ruling and dismissed V-l\u2019s suit. V-l then appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">I.C. \u00a7 49-1007 PROVIDES IMMUNITY TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR ITS ACTIONS IN WEIGHING THE TRUCK.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">V-l asserts that the magistrate judge was incorrect in ruling that the Department is immune from liability under I.C. \u00a7 49-1007 in weighing the truck. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">It is undisputed that the Department is a governmental actor. Therefore, both the Idaho Tort Claims Act (ITCA), I.C. \u00a7 6-901 through \u00a7 6-929, and I.C. \u00a7 49-1007 potentially control the immunity to be afforded the Department. Although ITCA generally addresses the potential immunity of all government actors, I.C. \u00a7 49-1007 specifically addresses the immunity of the Department in its weighing activities. \u201cWhere two statutes appear to apply to the same case, the <em>specific </em>should control over the general.\u201d <em>K. Hefner, Inc. v. Caremark, Inc., </em>128 Idaho 726, 732, 918 P.2d 595, 601 (1996) (emphasis added). Consequently, I.C. \u00a7 49-1007 is controlling in this case. In addition, ITCA itself demands that I.C. \u00a7 49-1007 control the immunity issue in this case. I.C. \u00a7 6 \u2014 903(f) (\u201cAny immunity or other bar to a civil lawsuit under Idaho ... law shall remain in effect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">Title 49 of the Idaho Code addresses and encompasses all matters concerning motor vehicles within the state of Idaho. Specifically, Title 49, Chapter 10, discusses allowable weights of vehicles on the roads of Idaho and the penalties and liabilities attached for violations of those allowable weights. In order to ensure that vehicles within the state comply with the weight regulations of Title 49, Chapter 10, the Legislature granted the Department the authority to establish temporary and permanent ports of entry in order to weigh vehicles and to issue misdemeanor citations for violations of the weight regulations. I.C. \u00a7 40-510(1), (2), and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">The Legislature has limited the Department\u2019s liability for its weighing activities under Title 49, Chapter 10. I.C. \u00a7 49-1007 (formerly I.C. \u00a7 49-908). Since its initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>enactment in 1929, this statute \u201climiting [the] liability of authorities\u201d has gone unmodified and has contained the identical language that no suit can be brought against the Department \u201cbecause of their compliance with any of the terms of this chapter, the exercise of any authority, or the performance of any duties granted or prescribed by this chapter.\u201d Each of these are independent clauses, sufficient to invoke immunity for the Department\u2019s actions. Therefore, the immunity provided by I.C. \u00a7 49-1007 will apply since the Department, pursuant to \u201cthe exercise of any authority ... granted\u201d by both Title 49, Chapter 10, and Title 40, Chapter 5, set up a temporary port of entry, pulled the truck into that port of entry to be weighed, and issued a citation to the truck for being overweight. In weighing the truck, even if it did so erroneously, the Department engaged in \u201cthe exercise of any authority ... granted\u201d to it by statute, and is therefore immune from liability for its actions in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">V-l contends that although I.C. \u00a7 49-1007 does purport to \u201climit\u201d liability, it only does so when the Department performs flawlessly. This interpretation would completely nullify and defeat the purpose and intent behind liability limiting statutes; if the Department performed its weighing activities perfectly, there would be no need for a statute limiting its liability because no liability would arise in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">We affirm the order dismissing V-l\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">We award costs on appeal to the Department.</p>\n<judges id=\"b530-9\">TROUT, C.J., and SILAK, SCHROEDER and WALTERS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
