Apthorp, as trustee of Sylvester M. Smith and Charles F. Burt, their heirs and assigns, to secure the payment of the sums found necessary to be paid to make just and equal an assignment by said court to Delano of said undivided two sixth parts, in which Smith and Burt were supposed to be interested. The mortgage contained the following condition: \u201c That whereas the said Delano has, under the order and direction of the Superior Court, given two certain notes of hand for one hundred and fifty dollars each, payable, one to Sylvester M. Smith and his lawful representatives, or bearer, and the other to Charles F. Burt and his lawful representatives, or bearer, with interest, which said notes are given and deposited with said Harrison O. Apthorp, to make just and equal certain partition and assignment of the estate above mentioned, in which said Sylvester M. and Charles F. are supposed to be interested; therefore, if the said Charles Delano, his heirs, executors, or administrators, or either of them, shall well and truly pay to the said Harrison O. Apthorp, in trust as aforesaid, his executors, administrators, or assigns, or either of them, the full contents of the said notes according to the tenor thereof, then the foregoing deed to be void, otherwise to remain in full force.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-7\">The petitioner also offered in evidence the record of the assignment of said estate, from which it appeared, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>things, that said Delano, at the date of his petition for partition, as tenant in common with said Smith and Burt, was seised in fee simple of four undivided sixth parts of the same estate of which said Smith and Burt, as children of one Keziah Burt, were believed to be seised each of one undivided sixth part; that they had been absent for several years previously, and were still absent from the Common wealth at the date of said partition, and their residence, if living, was unknown; that the remaining heirs of Keziah Burt known to be living and interested in the estate, namely, James M. Smith, Mary A. Babbitt, Maria M. Babbitt, and Sarah A. Horton, had each duly conveyed to Charles Delano all their respective right, title, and interest which they had in the same by their deeds dated and delivered March 20, 1865, and February 6, 1865; that said Smith, Mary A. Babbitt, Maria M. Babbitt, and Sarah A. Horton had, at the same time, so far as in their power, bargained and sold, supposing themselves to be entitled thereto by inheritance, the said shares of their absent brothers, for the sum of $150 a share, and had agreed that said Delano\u2019s notes on .demand, each for the sum above mentioned, should be deposited with the said Apthorp in trust and for the benefit of the parties who should ultimately show themselves entitled thereto; that this provisional payment and security were declared to be adequate and ample, and acceptable to all parties known to be in full life and interested in the premises; and that said mortgage- was given to secure these notes. The petitioner also proved that Charles Delano and those subsequently having his estate in the premises, namely, the Northampton Institution for Savings and the petitioner, had been in uninterrupted possession of said real estate for twenty years after the expiration of the time limited in the mortgage for the performance of the conditions thereof, namely, from April 1, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-4\">No evidence was offered of any payment on account of the mortgage debt, and the judge found as a fact that it had not been actually paid; nor was evidence offered of any act within twenty years, or at any time, in recognition of its existence as a valid mortgage, except by certain deeds subsequently executed by Charles Delano, in which said mortgage was mentioned as an existing incumbrance. Nor was any evidence offered that said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Smith and Burt, or either of them, had died since the date of said partition, or that any of the remaining heirs of Keziah Burt had succeeded to their interest within said period, or that said Delano had been shown by them to be established and assured in the possession of the estate assigned him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-4\">If the foregoing facts would authorize the court to enter a decree thereon, as prayed for by the petitioner, and as provided by the St. of 1882, <em>e. </em>237, and if such a decree ought to be entered, then it was to be entered by the court; otherwise, the petition was to be dismissed without prejudice.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-5\"><em>O.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7_\">The petitioner alleges in her petition that no payment has been made, at any time, of the debt secured by the mortgage; and this is also found as a fact in the report. There is no room, therefore, for a presumption of fact to the contrary. <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Shurtleff, </em>2 Met. 26, 28. <em>Cheever </em>v. Perley, 11 Allen, 584. At the time of the deeds to Mr. Delano, and of the partition, it was not known who were the owners of two undivided sixth parts of the land, and he sought to obtain a good title thereto in two ways, in view of this uncertainty. In the first place, he took deeds from the four heirs of Keziah Burt who were known to be living, and these deeds were effectual to convey said interests, provided these four grantors had succeeded by inheritance to the interests of their two absent brothers. If Mr. Delano\u2019s title should turn out to be valid under these deeds, then, by the agreement made when the notes were given, those four grantors were and still are entitled to the benefit of the notes and the mortgage security. In the second place, Mr. Delano procured an assignment of the two sixths to be made to him by the Superior Court, on his petition for partition. The petitioner now contends that this assignment was invalid; but, if so, she has no standing here, because, independently of the assignment, she does not show that she has a title to the two sixths which she seeks to have cleared of the incumbrance of the mortgage. If, on the other hand, Mr. Delano\u2019s title was valid under the assignment, then this furnished a good consideration for his promise to pay the price, and, by the agreement, the notes and mortgage would stand for the benefit of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>who should ultimately show themselves entitled thereto. In any aspect of the case, these two sixths have never been paid for, except by the notes and mortgage. The parties who owned them have never alleged the invalidity of the assignment, or sought to recover possession of two sixths of the land, and when they appear or are ascertained, they may not wish to do so. The petitioner cannot now be heard to say that the assignment was invalid, because she claims under it. The notes by their terms were not payable till something should be shown in respect to the title. That has not yet been done, and the condition of the mortgage has not yet been broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
