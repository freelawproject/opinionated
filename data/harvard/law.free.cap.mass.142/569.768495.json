It is found that the plaintiff acquired a good title by deed to eight acres and twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>eight rods, and if it did not, by the same deed, acquire title to the remaining five acres and seventy rods, it, in 1852, took possession of all the land under a deed purporting to convey the whole land, and exercised acts of ownership by cutting off all the wood and timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The defendant contends that there was evidence for the jury that he had acquired title by adverse possession after the plaintiff took possession under its deed. The land was woodland when cut over by the plaintiff, and had been left to grow up to wood, and, at the commencement of the action, \u201c consisted of sprouts, about one acre of pasture, and some wet land, and all of it had been occupied by the defendant\u2019s cattle more or less ever since 1852.\u201d It was entirely surrounded by the defendant\u2019s land, and the defendant had fenced his own land, and had thus included, within the fence, the land of the plaintiff; but we do not understand that any fence had been built on any of the boundary lines between the plaintiff\u2019s land and the land of the defendant. The defendant had \u201c used the lot as a pasture and place for his cattle to run, feed, and drink upon, without any hindrance or objection made by any one, for more than twenty years.\u201d By this we understand that the defendant\u2019s cattle, put upon his own land, went upon the plaintiff\u2019s land and used it, as well as the defendant\u2019s adjoining land, as a pasture. The defendant had also repaired a road through this lot of the plaintiff\u2019s, and had used the road in going to and from his own land, and had \u201cfrom time to time, from 1856 to 1877,\u201d cut one or two cords of wood upon the plaintiff\u2019s land, and had allowed it to remain on the land \u201cfor some time before taking the same away, so that it could be seen by any one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The defendant testified that he claimed this lot as his own since 1856 or 1857, and that he \u201c ever since had had full and exclusive possession and control of the same, unmolested by any one; \u201d but this must mean that his possession had been such as has been described. As the land upon which the defendant entered and cut the wood, and which he used in connection with his own land as a pasture, was wild, unenclosed land, we think the evidence did not tend to show a title in the defendant by adverse possession, as against the plaintiff\u2019s prior title, whether the plaintiff acquired it by deed, or by the possession which it took under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>deed before the defendant entered upon the land. <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Hollis, </em>3 Met. 125. <em>Williston </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>10 Met. 17. <em>Slater </em>v. <em>Jepherson, </em>6 Cush. 129. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>11 Cush. 206. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>1 Allen, 245. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Callanan, </em>105 Mass. 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
