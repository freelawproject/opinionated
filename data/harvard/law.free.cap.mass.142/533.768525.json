Trial in the Superior Court, on appeal, before Blodgett, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-4\">The government offered one Kenney as a witness, who testified as follows: \u201c I know a place in Clinton, kept by Johq. Molter, on Main Street; the sign is 1 Railroad Restaurant.\u2019 Between seven and half-past seven o\u2019clock P. M., on Sunday, July 4, I stopped on the platform of the railroad station, in sight of Molter\u2019s place; there are two doors opening into the place of business from the street, one leads into the restaurant, the other to the bar-room; the door to the former was open, people were going in thereat, and I followed. I passed through the restaurant, and into the bar-room. There were a settee and some chairs before the bar, four or five men were in the room, a man was behind the bar, and some one called for lager beer; Molter was behind the bar, he served the liquor, and I saw two payments made. This bar-room faces the street, and the bar comes pretty close to the Avindow; one could see right in from the street, as it was daylight; I saw the bar and fixtures behind the bar, such as bottles and the like; the bar is fifteen feet long; behind the' bar are shelves; saw no one come into or go out of the bar-room by the front door; there were quite a number of persons in the restaurant, and four or five in the bar-room. I think the man behind the bar was called John, but I am not positive; this is my impression.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">On cross-examination, the witness testified that, in the lower court, he testified that he could not identify the man behind the bar; that he could not now identify him; and that he could not now identify the defend\u00e1nt, or any one in the bar-room or restaurant.. He further testified, on cross-examination, as follows: \u201cI saw two different persons make payments. I think there were two or three persons in the bar-room when I went in. I went in with \u00edavo or three other persons. I could not say which party paid for the beer. As soon as I saw the payments, I went out. Ho one spoke to me, and I spoke to no one.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\">Abbot A. Jenkins, a deputy sheriff residing in Clinton, was called by the government, and testified that \u201c John Molter keeps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>a small hotel and restaurant, called the Railroad Restaurant; there is'a bar-room on the premises, and it is quite a good-sized place.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-4\">The government offered in evidence a license of the first class under the Pub.
