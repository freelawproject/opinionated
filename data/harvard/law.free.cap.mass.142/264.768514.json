It is not agreed as a fact, and we do not judicially know, that it is impossible to measure the quantity of water and the head of water sufficient \u201c to carry .... three breast-wheels each twelve feet in diameter and fifteen feet in length, with the machinery and works that may be attached to or connected with the same.\u201d There may be more difficulty in measuring the quantity or head of water sufficient to \u201c cony a fulling-mill,\u201d but all the facts are not before us which might be competent in determining the construction that should be given to this part of the reservation. On the case as it stands, we cannot attempt to regulate the use of the water by the defendant, or to determine the effect of the acts and usages of the parties upon the quantity of water each is entitled to use. We can find nothing in the facts as expressly agreed, or as admitted by the pleadings, that prevents the defendant from substituting turbine or other wheels for breast-wheels; and this is all that we are now called upon to decide. The fact that the city of Boston took part of the waters of Sudbury River, which is a \u201c feeder to the Concord River,\u201d is immaterial upon this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
