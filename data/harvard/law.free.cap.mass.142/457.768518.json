At the request of the district attorney, the witness produced a small bottle of fluid, which he said was the same whiskey which he bought of the defendant, in the bottle in which it was delivered ; and it was admitted in evidence, against the objection of the defendant.

The court properly took judicial notice of the establishment of this additional term. It was the only term to which the defendant could appeal, being the term \u201cthen next to be held in the same county,\u201d and the appeal was properly entered at that term.</p>\n<p id=\"Axr\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
