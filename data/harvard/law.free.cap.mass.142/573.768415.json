Sts. <em>c. </em>101, \u00a7 7, for keeping and maintaining a common nuisance, to wit, a certain tenement in West Stockbridge, used for the illegal sale and illegal keeping of intoxicating liquors, on May 1, 1884, and on divers other days and times between that day and July 5, 1884. At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Knowlton, </em>J., the following facts appeared:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-12\">The defendant at the time named in the complaint was licensed as an innholder, but not as a common victualler, and kept a hotel on Main Street in West Stockbridge, called the West Stockbridge House. On the same street was a school-house in which a public school was kept. The defendant occupied for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>business of said hotel parts of two buildings, one of which was wholly within the distance of four hundred feet from said schoolhouse, and the other was adjacent to the first, and its nearest portion was distant from said school-house about three hundred and seventy feet. In this latter building, which was known as the Campbell Hotel, the defendant had a room where he kept and was accustomed to sell intoxicating liquors, under a license of the first class, in the usual form. This was the northeast room upon the first floor. No part of this room was within four hundred feet of said school-house. This building was the property of the defendant\u2019s wife, and portions of it were rented by her to tenants. Other portions which were within four hundred feet of said school-house were not used, because the defendant had no occasion to use them; but, with his wife\u2019s permission, they were in his possession for use in his hotel business when occasion might require, and in the same way as were those portions of the same building which were more than four hundred feet from said school-house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-4\">The distance from the Campbell Hotel to the school-house, if measured in a line to the street, and thence along the street to a point opposite the school-house, and thence from the street to said school-house, was more than four hundred feet. The language of the license descriptive of the premises was as follows: \u201cAt the West Stockbridge House, northeast room, first floor, known as the Campbell Hotel, in said West Stockbridge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-5\">Upon these facts the judge ruled that the license was void under the St. of 1882, <em>e. </em>220; and, the jury having returned a verdict of guilty, the case was reported, with the consent of the defendant, to this court, for its decision of the question of law involved. If said ruling was wrong, the verdict was to be set aside and a new trial <em>granted; </em>otherwise, judgment to be entered on the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b590-6\"><em>S. J. Dunham, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b590-7\"><em>D. J. </em>Sherman, Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b590-8\">Gardner, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2R\">This case presents the question as to the construction of the St. of 1882, <em>e. </em>220, \u00a7 1, which is as follows: \u201c No license .... shall be granted for the sale of intoxicating liquors in any building or place on the same street within four hundred feet of any building occupied in whole or in part by a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>school.\u201d The defendant\u2019s license authorized him. to sell \u201c at the West Stockbridge House, northeast room, first floor, known as the Campbell Hotel, in said West Stockbridge.\u201d No part of this northeast room was within four hundred feet of the schoolhouse. But portions of the Campbell Hotel, in which was the licensed room, were within four hundred feet of the schoolhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">The -language of the statute is plain. It does not use the word \u201croom,\u201d or \u201ctenement,\u201d but \u201cbuilding.\u201d Its apparent object was to prevent the sale of liquor in any building on the same street with a public school-house, and within four hundred feet of it. If the defendant sold intoxicating liquors in the northeast room of the Campbell Hotel, and the Campbell Hotel was within four hundred feet of a public school-house and on the same street with it, then his license to sell intoxicating liquors in such northeast room would be no defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The defendant contends that the language of the statute, \u201cbuilding or place,\u201d should be construed to mean that, if a license limits the sale to a particular room in a building, that room is a \u201cplace,\u201d and its location is to be considered without regard to the rest of the building. We do not understand that the statute is limited to so narrow a construction. The word \u201c place \u201d is intended to cover the case where there is no building, but where a tent, booth, excavation in the ground, or something similar, is used for the purpose of selling liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The school-house and the building containing the licensed room were on Main Street, and each had entrances from the same street. The distance from the Campbell Hotel to the school-house, if measured in a line to the street, thence along the street to a point opposite the school-house, and thence to the school-house, is more than four hundred feet. The defendant contends that this measurement should be used to determine the distance of the two buildings, under the statute. If the two buildings are situated upon the same street, that is, if they have entrances from a common street, the four hundred feet are to be determined by the distance between the two buildings, without any other measurement. The distances of the buildings from the street form no part of the distance of the buildings from each other. It is not necessary that the buildings should be situated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>on the line of the same street. They may perhaps be some distance from the line of the street, with a walk leading to them, but they are situated as completely on the same street as they would be if the buildings abutted upon the line of the street. Whenever the school-house and the building in which a license is granted are situated upon the same street, whether close to the street or some distance from it, the four hundred feet between them are to be determined by measuring the nearest point of each house to the other. This will determine the distance required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The rulings of the Superior Court were in accordance with the views we have expressed, and the entry, according to the terms of the report, must be,</p>\n<p id=\"A8M\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
