The court rightly ruled that this order was unmeaning and unintelligible, and that it could not be construed as an order for a piece of counter railing. It presents a case of incurable uncertainty; and the court properly refused to submit it to the jury to determine whether the letters \u201c pice \u201d meant \u201c piece \u201d or \u201cprice.\u201d These letters do not mean anything, and neither the court nor the jury can construe them as meaning \u201c piece.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">There was no valid written order; and the question whether the defendants intended to order a piece of counter rail, and, either expressly or by implication, promised to pay for it, was submitted to the jury with instructions of which the plaintiff does not complain, and which were sufficiently favorable to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
