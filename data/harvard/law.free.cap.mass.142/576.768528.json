Plea, nul disseisin. At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Bacon, </em>J., without a jury, the tenant claimed title to the demanded premises under a deed from the collector of taxes of Sandisfield, dated May 24, 1875. The demandant contended that the deed was insufficient to convey to the tenant a valid title to the premises. The judge so ruled, and found for the demandant; and the tenant alleged exceptions. The facts material to the point decided appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-10\"><em>A. J.

The Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>12, \u00a7 35, required that the deed \u201c shall state the cause of sale; \u201d and \u00a7 22 provided that taxes on real estate may be levied \u201c by sale thereof, if the tax is not paid within fourteen days after a demand of payment.\u201d This deed recites that \u201c no person has appeared to discharge said tax; \u201d and that the collector \u201c has demanded the same of John J. Stewart, the reported owner of said real estate; \u201d but there is no statement that fourteen days elapsed after the demand before advertising the premises for sale, or that the tax was not paid within fourteen days after the demand. A demand made on the day of the sale would satisfy the recitals in the deed. The deed is therefore void. <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>6 Allen, 576. <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Crapo, </em>127 Mass. 39. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>126 Mass. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqn\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
