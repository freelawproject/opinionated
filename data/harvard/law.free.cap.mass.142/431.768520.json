If the jury find that the plaintiff had such information or knowledge as would enable'him, with a reasonable exercise of care on his part, to do his work with safety to himself, the defendant is not liable, and it makes no difference how, from what source, or when he derived such information or knowledge, whether from the defendant\u2019s officers or servants, from a stranger, from previous experience, or from his own perceptions and intelligence. 2. If the jury find that the plaintiff had such information or knowledge, from whatever source derived, as would enable him, with a reasonable exercise of care on his part, to do his work with safety to himself, the defendant was not bound to give him any instructions, and is not liable. 8. If the jury find that the defendant, from anything said or done by the plaintiff when he entered the defendant\u2019s employ, had reason to believe that the plaintiff had such information or knowledge as would enable him, with a reasonable exercise of care on his part, to do his work with safety to himself, the defendant was not bound to give him any instructions, and is not liable. 4. If the jury find that the plaintiff, at any time, by word or act, declined or objected to instructions from any of the defendant\u2019s officers or servants whose duty it was to give them, and that the defendant\u2019s machinery was suitable and proper for the work to be done upon it by the plaintiff, then the defendant is not liable. 5. If the jury find that the accident was caused partly by the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence, then it was not in a legal sense caused by the negligence of the defendant. In such case it was caused by both parties, and being-the result of a commingling of the negligence of the two parties, the plaintiff cannot recover. 6. Unless the jury find that the plaintiff was a man of manifest imbecility, their verdict must be for the defendant, because the defendant had a right to assume that the plaintiff would protect himself by whatever precautions were necessary.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>The judge gave, in substance, the first five instructions requested, and refused to give the sixth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-4\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-5\"><em>H.
