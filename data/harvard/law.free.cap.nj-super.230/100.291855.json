The decedent\u2019s will directed that the marital home be sold and that the proceeds be placed in a testamentary trust. The decedent's son, defendant Joseph G. Friedlein, was named executor of the estate and trustee. The will further provided that the income from the trust shall be paid to plaintiff during her lifetime and that upon her death the principal and any unpaid income shall be paid to defendant. Decedent devised his remaining assets directly to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">On April 16, 1987, plaintiff filed this action against defendant which sought among other things to fix and allow her elective share pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 <em>et seq. </em>On June 15,1987, the parties advised the court that they had reached a settlement pursuant to which plaintiff would receive her elective share, which would be calculated after an appraisal of the marital home and a full accounting of the estate\u2019s assets. The order formalizing this settlement, which was entered on July 8, 1987, provided that \u201cthe within Order shall be deemed a Final Judgment relative thereto and pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-14.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">On September 22, 1987, plaintiff filed a motion \u201cto amend the Consent Order erroneously entered on July 8, 1987.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel submitted an affidavit in support of the motion which alleged that his client had decided to take her elective share under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 <em>et seq. </em>\u201cwithout sufficient knowledge or information to fully and satisfactorily make such election\u201d and that \u201cit has now become clear that the election, which plaintiff was forced to make blindly, has resulted in placing her in a worse position than she would have been in had she not been compelled to make that election.\u201d Attached to the affidavit was an informal accounting prepared by defendant which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>showed that plaintiffs elective share under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 <em>et seq. </em>was zero, because the assets she had owned jointly with the decedent, with a right of survivorship, had a value in excess of one-third of the decedent\u2019s \u201caugmented estate.\u201d In addition, defendant asserted that the effect of plaintiff\u2019s election under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 <em>et seq. </em>was a relinquishment of her right under the will to receive all income generated from the proceeds of the sale of the marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The trial court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion to be relieved from the provisions of the July 8, 1987 consent order. On January 7, 1988, the court entered an order limiting plaintiff\u2019s interest in the proceeds from the sale of the marital home to one-half of the income from the corpus, which the court found she was entitled to receive as her \u201cdower interest.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>3B:28-1. Plaintiff appeals, contending that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to relieve her from the terms of the July 7, 1987 consent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">We conclude that both the parties and the trial court proceeded on the erroneous premise that an election by a surviving spouse to take one-third of the augmented estate of the deceased spouse pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 <em>et seq. </em>results in a renunciation of any specific bequests made under the will. Therefore, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 <em>et seq., </em>which was enacted in substantially its present form in 1979, L.1979, e. 483, is derived from the Uniform Probate Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 gives a surviving spouse a right to elect a one-third share of the deceased spouse\u2019s \u201caugmented estate.\u201d A decedent\u2019s \u201caugmented estate\u201d consists of the net estate at the time of death, plus property which the decedent transferred without adequate consideration before death, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-3, property which the surviving spouse transferred to third parties without adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>consideration, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-6b, and property owned by the surviving spouse at the time of, or as a result of, the decedent\u2019s death, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-6a. All of the surviving spouse\u2019s property \u201cis presumed to have been derived from the decedent except to the extent that any party in interest establishes that it was derived from another source.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Nowhere in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 <em>et seq. </em>does it state that a surviving spouse\u2019s election to take one-third of a deceased spouse\u2019s augmented estate will result in relinquishment of the surviving spouse\u2019s right to property transferred by the will. To the contrary, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-18a contemplates that any property which a surviving spouse receives as a result of the decedent\u2019s death will be applied in satisfaction of the surviving spouse\u2019s elective share. This section provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">The amount of the surviving spouse\u2019s elective share shall be satisfied by applying:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">a. <em>The value of all property, estate or interest therein, </em>owned by the surviving spouse in his own right at the time of the decedent\u2019s death from whatever source acquired, or <em>succeeded to by the surviving spouse as a result of decedent\u2019s death </em>notwithstanding that the property, estate or interest or part thereof, succeeded to by the surviving spouse as the result of decedent\u2019s death has been renounced by the surviving spouse. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Clearly, property \u201csucceeded to by the surviving spouse as a result of decedent\u2019s death\u201d includes property passing to the surviving spouse under the decedent\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Thus, the decedent\u2019s \u201caugmented estate\u201d consists of the value of all property of both the deceased and surviving spouse as well as other property transferred to third parties without adequate consideration before the decedent\u2019s death. A surviving spouse who takes an elective share under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 is entitled to one-third of the value of the augmented estate, but this entitlement may be satisfied by the surviving spouse\u2019s own property as well as any property the surviving spouse acquires as a result of the decedent\u2019s death. Consequently, an estate does not incur any liability for an elective share unless the value of the surviving spouse\u2019s own property plus any property that spouse acquires as a result of decedent\u2019s death, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>property devised by will, is less than one-third of the augmented estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Therefore, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 provides a kind of statutory safety net to assure that a surviving spouse receives at least the value of one-third of the property owned by the decedent and surviving spouse, augmented by the value of certain property transferred <em>inter vivos. </em>However, the invocation of this protective provision cannot result in a surviving spouse being deprived of property transferred by will. Bather, the only effect of the election is to provide the surviving spouse with an additional portion of the decedent\u2019s estate if the sum of the surviving spouse\u2019s own assets plus any property received under the will or by other transfer taking effect on death is less than one-third of the augmented estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">This conclusion is supported by Judge Cohen\u2019s analysis of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-18a in <em>In re Estate of Cole, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>396 (Ch.Div.1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">The quoted language [of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-18a] says two key things. The first is that the value of the survivor\u2019s own independently acquired property must be deducted from her calculated elective share. If it is greater than her share, she gets nothing more. If it is less, she gets the difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">The second key statement in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-18(a) is that the value of property coming to the survivor by reason of the decedent\u2019s death is deducted from her calculated share. That means, among other things, that, if the decedent leaves anything to his spouse in his will or by non-testamentary transfer taking effect on death, its value is deducted from her share. As a result, even though she has elected against the will, she must take her elective share first out of assets the decedent has chosen to give her by will or otherwise. [200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 403-404],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Furthermore, this conclusion is supported by the comments to Section 2-206 of the Uniform Probate Code, from which <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 <em>et seq. </em>is derived, which state in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">The election does not result in a loss of benefits under the will (in the absence of renunciation) because those benefits are charged against the elective share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>under Sections 2-201, 2-202 and 2-207(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARQ\">A scholarly commentary on the Uniform Probate Code also reflects this view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9E\">Under the [Uniform Probate Code], the surviving spouse may claim an elective share without forfeiting any property passing to the spouse by intestate or testate succession. Any share passing to the spouse by intestate or testate succession ... is first applied in satisfaction of the elective share to reduce contributions that otherwise might be due from other persons. Kurtz, \u201cThe Augmented Estate Concept Under The Uniform Probate Code: In Search of an Equitable Elective Share,\u201d 62 <em>Iowa L.Rev. </em>981, 1043-1044 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Therefore, we reverse paragraph 8 of the trial court\u2019s order of January 7, 1988, and remand the matter for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-9\"> This legislation was originally codified in 1979 as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3A:38A-1 <em>et seq. </em>and then recodified pursuant to <em>L. </em>1981, <em>c. </em>405 as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-12\"> The New Jersey Legislature did not enact section 2-206 of the Uniform Probate Code. However, the quoted part of the comment to Section 2-206 relates to the general concept of an \"elective share\" under the Uniform Probate Code rather than to the specific provisions of Section 2-206.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
