Specifically, the issue is whether Pennsylvania or New Jersey law applies where the UIM policy was written in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Pennsylvania and the accident, involving Pennsylvania residents, occurred in that state. The motion judge concluded that, since the tortfeasor, defendant Richard L. Gibson, moved to New Jersey after the accident and Colonial Penn\u2019s subrogation action against Gibson was instituted in this state, New Jersey law applies. The motion judge found that New Jersey\u2019s statutory and decisional law provides for no subrogation rights to recover UIM payments, and accordingly dismissed Colonial Penn\u2019s subrogation action against Gibson. We conclude that Pennsylvania law applies and that under that state\u2019s common law and the terms of the insurance contract, Colonial Penn has a subrogation right to recover UIM payments against a tortfeasor. We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Colonial Penn issued an automobile liability policy in Pennsylvania to its insured, June M. Cullen, which included UIM coverage. Cullen was involved in an accident in Morrisville, Pennsylvania, with defendant Richard L. Gibson. Both Cullen and Gibson were Pennsylvania residents, and both vehicles involved in the accident were registered in Pennsylvania. At the time of the accident, Gibson was insured by the Travelers Indemnity Company, having maximum liability coverage in the amount of $15,000. Under the terms of its UIM coverage, Colonial Penn paid to Cullen the sum of $32,500 for the injuries she sustained in the accident. In turn, Cullen subrogated her claim against Gibson under the terms of the subrogation clause of Colonial Penn\u2019s policy. Subsequently, Travelers tendered to Colonial Penn the amount of $15,000, representing the policy limits under its policy issued to Gibson. Colonial Penn then instituted the present action as Cullen\u2019s subrogee against Gibson to recover $17,500, representing the difference between the sum Colonial Penn paid to Cullen and the amount it received from Travelers.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">In granting Gibson\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the motion judge concluded that New Jersey law applied because of our State\u2019s overriding interest in enforcing our no-fault laws. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Citing the Law Division decision in <em>Longworth v. Ohio Casualty Gp. of Ins. Co., </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>70 (Law Div.1986), aff\u2019d <em>sub nom. Longworth v. Van Houten, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>174 (App.Div. 1988), he also concluded that there was no right of subrogation in New Jersey to recover UIM payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">This case involves the subrogation rights of an insurer under the terms of an insurance contract issued in Pennsylvania in accordance with that State\u2019s underinsured statute. <em>See </em>75 <em>Pa.C.S.A. </em>\u00a7 1731-1736. Our Supreme Court has adopted the rule, in resolving conflict of law issues involving liability insurance contract controversies, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">.. .the law of the place of the contract will govern the determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties under the insurance policy. This rule is to be applied unless the dominant and significant relationship of another state to the parties and the underlying issue dictates that this basic rule should yield. <em>[State Farm, etc., Ins. Co. v. Simmons\u2019 Estate, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>28, 37 (1980)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\"><em>State Farm, supra, </em>recognized that such a rule will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">.. .generally comport with the reasonable expectations of the parties concerning the principal situs of the insured risk during the term of the policy and will furnish needed certainty and consistency in the selection of the applicable law. [84 <em>N.J. </em>at 37].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\"><em>See also Buzzone v. Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co., </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>447, 458 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">In adopting the rule, <em>State Farm </em>incorporated the \u201cmost significant relationship\u201d standard of the <em>Restatement, Conflict of Laws </em>2d, \u00a7 188 at 575 (1971), which identifies the seven considerations pertinent to a conflict-of-law analysis: (1) the needs of the interstate and international systems; (2) the relevant policies of the forum; (3) the relevant policies of other affected states and the relevant interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue; (4) the protection of justified expectations; (5) the basic policies underlying the particular field of law; (6) certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result, and (7) ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied. <em>See Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 6 at 10; <em>State Farm, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The <em>Restatement </em>also advances the following specific principle applicable to casualty insurance policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">The validity of a contract of fire, surety or casualty insurance and <em>the rights created thereby </em>are determined by the local law of the state which the parties understood was to be the principal location of the insured risk during the term of the policy, unless with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in \u00a7 6 to the transaction and parties, in which event the local law of the other state will be applied. <em>[Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 193 at 610; emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Thus, New Jersey would control where the bulk of activities covered by a liability policy took place in New Jersey and the majority of claims against the insured were filed in New Jersey courts. <em>See Lac D\u2019Amiante Du Quebec v. Am. Home Assur., </em>613 <em>F.Supp. </em>1549, 1554 (D.C.N.J.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The foregoing choice-of-law principles dictate that since Colonial Penn\u2019s policy was issued in Pennsylvania, that state\u2019s law must govern in fixing the rights and liabilities of the parties unless other pertinent factors identified in <em>State Farm </em>and the <em>Restatement </em>compel a contrary result. <em>See Melick v. Stanley, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>271, 277 (Law Div.1980), aff\u2019d. o.b. 181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>128 (App.Div.1981). Applying these factors, we are satisfied that Pennsylvania law should apply in determining whether Colonial Penn has UIM subrogation rights against the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Firstly, the accident occurred in Pennsylvania. Both drivers were Pennsylvania residents operating vehicles registered in that state. No significant relationship with New Jersey exists other than the fact that the tortfeasor moved to New Jersey after the accident occurred. Clearly, Pennsylvania had, at the time of the accident, the most significant relationship to the parties, the insurance contract transaction and the accident which is the subject matter of this litigation. <em>See State Farm, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">Secondly, Colonial Penn was required by Pennsylvania law to provide UIM coverage to Cullen. <em>See </em>75 <em>Pa.C.S.A. </em>\u00a7 1731(a). Since Colonial Penn paid the UIM benefits in accordance with the Pennslyvania contract, Colonial Penn had \u201cjustified expecta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>tions\u201d that the corollary right of UIM subrogation under the policy would exist unless Pennsylvania expressly precluded such right. <em>See Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 6 at 10. Further, to apply New Jersey subrogation law simply because Gibson moved to New Jersey after the accident would frustrate the certainty, predictability and uniformity of result reasonably expected by Colonial Penn when it issued a Pennsylvania policy. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The question then becomes whether New Jersey has a \u201cdominant and significant\u201d public policy sufficient to override the usual choice-of-law rule and dictate that New Jersey subrogation law should apply. <em>State Farm, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 37. Sources of public policy include state legislation and state judicial decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 39-40; <em>Vasquez v. Glassboro Service Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>86, 98 (1980). Unless the differences between the state and foreign laws are fundamental, \u201c.. .foreign law need not be considered offensive or repugnant to local public policy.\u201d <em>State Farm, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 41; <em>Caribe Hilton Hotel v. Poland, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>301, 308 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Both Pennsylvania and New Jersey provide for UIM coverage in automobile liability policies. Pennsylvania makes UIM coverage mandatory, whereas in New Jersey, UIM coverage is optional but an insurer must offer the coverage. Compare 75 <em>Pa.C.S.A. </em>\u00a7 1731(a) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1b. Pennsylvania\u2019s UIM statute does not, either expressly or by implication, pre: elude an insurer from seeking recovery from the tortfeasor. The Pennsylvania courts have held that insurers, under the states\u2019s Uninsured Motorist Coverage Act, have a right of subrogation against the tortfeasor. <em>See </em>40 <em>P.S. </em>\u00a7 2000(d); <em>Walls v. City of Pittsburgh, </em>292 <em>Pa.Super. </em>18, 22-23, 436 <em>A.</em>2d 698, 701 (1981); <em>General Acc. Ins. v. City of Phila., </em>114 <em>Pa.Commw. </em>528, 531, 539 A.2d 59, 61 n. 4 (1988). These decisions allowing subrogation appear consistent with Pennsylvania\u2019s well-established policy favoring subrogation generally \u201cto compel the ultimate discharge of an obligation by him who in good conscience ought to pay it.\u201d <em>Associated Hosp. Serv. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>Phil. v. Pustilnik, </em>262 <em>Pa.Super. </em>600, 608, 396 A.2d 1332, 1336 (1979), quoting <em>Potoczny v. Vallejo, </em>170 <em>Pa.Super. </em>377, 380-381, 85 A.2d 675, 677 (1952). We have found no Pennsylvania case precluding subrogation to recover UIM payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Our UIM statute is also silent respecting whether subrogation is afforded an insurer to recover UIM payments. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1. The statute does provide that policy provisions allowing subrogation for <em>uninsured </em>(UM) coverage must be approved by the Commissioner, thus suggesting that subrogation to recover UM payments may be allowed. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1d.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Our present personal injury protection (PIP) statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1, permits an insurer to recover payments made to its insured from the tortfeasor who does not carry PIP coverage. The Law Division in <em>Longworth v. Ohio Casualty Gp. of Ins. Co., supra, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 85-86, held that the Legislature\u2019s express inclusion of subrogation rights in the PIP statute implied an intent to prohibit subrogation for UIM payments. Applying the <em>expressio unius </em>maxim, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">This court is satisfied that the history of the automobile reparation statutes indicates that where the Legislature intends that a right of subrogation should exist, it expressly and affirmatively extends the right to subrogation. <em>[Id. </em>at 87].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">The central issue in <em>Longworth </em>was whether a \u201cno-consent to settle\u201d exclusion in the UIM subrogation provision was valid, where such provision implied that if an insured settled his underlying claim against the tortfeasor the insured\u2019s entitlement to UIM benefits was forfeited. <em>Id. </em>at 75. In our affirmance of the Law Division, we focused on the \u201cno-consent to settle\u201d clause and agreed with the Law Division that the clause contravened New Jersey\u2019s public policy of assuring prompt payments to insureds. <em>Longworth v. Van Houten, supra, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 185. We did not expressly address the Law Division\u2019s observation that UIM subrogation was <em>per se </em>prohibitive. However, in <em>dicta, </em>we suggested that the right of UIM subrogation against the tortfeasor, as an \u201cabstract matter,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>may be permitted, <em>id. </em>at 183. We also directed that \u201cas a matter of future conduct\u201d the carrier may promptly offer its insured \u201can acceptable settlement offer\u201d received by the insured from the tortfeasor \u201c... in exchange for assignment to it by the insured of the claim against the tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194. There is therefore at least the suggestion in our opinion that we may not agree with the Law Division\u2019s broad rejection of UIM subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In any event, we need not here express our agreement or disagreement with the holding by the Law Division in <em>Long-worth. </em>Suffice it to say that even if the holding is correct, for purposes of choice-of-law, we cannot conclude that Pennsylvania\u2019s apparent policy permitting UIM subrogation is \u201coffensive or repugnant\u201d to New Jersey\u2019s public policy. <em>State Farm, supra, </em>84 N.J. at 41. In adopting UM and UIM statutes, both states have focused on the need to protect innocent automobile victims from financially irresponsible motorists. <em>See Fernandez v. Selected Risks Insurance Company, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>236, 240 (1980); <em>Harleysville Mutual Casualty Co. v. Blumling, </em>429 <em>Pa. </em>389, 395-396, 241 A.2d 112, 115 (1968); <em>Tallman v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., </em>372 <em>Pa.Super. </em>593, 602, 539 A.2d 1354, 1359 (1988). Pennsylvania\u2019s general policy of compelling the ultimate discharge of an obligation by the one \u201cwho in good conscience ought to pay it,\u201d <em>Associated Hosp. Serv. of Phil. v. Pustilnik, supra, </em>262 <em>Pa.Super. </em>at 608, 396 A.2d at 1336, is no different than our own. <em>Aetna Ins. Co. v. Gilchrist Brothers, Inc., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>550, 560 (1981); <em>Standard Accident Ins. Co. v. Pellecchia, </em>15 <em>N.J. </em>162, 171 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Further, to the extent that New Jersey\u2019s approach, at least as pronounced by the Law Division in <em>Longworth, </em>may conflict with Pennsylvania\u2019s approach, we note that both the New Jersey UIM and PIP statutes regulate only New Jersey policies issued to cover motor vehicles registered or principally garaged in New Jersey. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.la; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-3. Where .the accident occurs in Pennsylvania and involves Pennsylvania registered vehicles, the predicate for any New Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>statutory or decisional law preclusion of subrogation rights simply does not exist. <em>See Cirelli v. The Ohio Casaulty Insurance Co., </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>380, 387 (1977). Thus, the fact that Pennsylvania may allow subrogation where the accident occurs in that state and involves Pennsylvania vehicles, does no violence to New Jersey\u2019s statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we are satisfied that Pennslyvania law must apply in determining whether Colonial Penn has UIM subrogation rights. Since we find no Pennsylvania statutory or decisional law precluding Colonial Penn\u2019s contractual and common-law right of subrogation, we conclude that it was error to dismiss its subrogation claim against the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
