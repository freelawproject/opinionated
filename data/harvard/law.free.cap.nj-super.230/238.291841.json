The municipal court judge suspended defendant\u2019s driving privileges for six months, fined him $250, imposed a $100 surcharge and ordered that he be detained in an Intoxicated Driver Resource Center for a period of not less than 12 nor more than 48 hours. Defendant appealed to the Law Division where, following a trial <em>de novo </em>on the record below, defendant was again found guilty of violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50 and the same sentence was imposed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-16\">Defendant seeks a reversal of his conviction and a jury trial on the following grounds set forth in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>I. THE LOWER COURT ERRED BY ADMITTING BREATHALYZER TEST RESULTS INTO EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH THE BREATHALYZER OPERATOR HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED AND HAD FAILED TO TAKE A TIMELY OR LONG ENOUGH RECERTIFICATION COURSE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">II.

THIS DEFENDANT WAS ENTITLED TO A TRIAL BY JURY AS A MATTER OF FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">B. THE COMBINATION OF PENALTIES, INCLUDING LONG-TERM LICENSE SUSPENSION, WARRANT A JURY TRIAL FOR THIS DEFENDANT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">We have carefully considered these contentions and all of the arguments advanced by defendant in support of them and find that they are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). Further comment, however, may be helpful with respect to some of the issues raised by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">First, contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, Officer William Smith of the Pennsauken Police Department, who administered the breathalyzer tests to defendant, had been properly recertified to operate the breathalyzer in accordance with the provisions of the New Jersey Administrative Code and, therefore, the test results were properly admissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Officer Smith was initially certified to operate a breathalyzer upon completing a five-day course, as required by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-1.6(a), from October 25 to October 29, 1976. Pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-1.7(a), that certification was valid for the remainder of 1976 and for the next two calendar years, through December 31,1978. Because Officer Smith failed to complete a recertification course before his certification lapsed, his certification was automatically suspended beginning January 1, 1979. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-1.8(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">The certification of an operator will be automatically suspended on the date set for expiration of the operator\u2019s present valid certification as set forth at N.J.A.C. 13:51-1.7 if said operator has not satisfied the requirement for recertification as set forth at N.J.A.C. 13:51-1.6(d) before the expiration of said valid certification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Officer Smith was recertified as a breathalyzer operator after completing a recertification course from October 18 to October 20,1982, pursuant to the provisions of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51\u20141.6(f) and 13:51-1.8(c). <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51\u20141.6(f), in relevant part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">Reinstatement and special recertification of an operator whose certification is suspended pursuant to N.J.A.C. 13:51-1.8(a) and to whom the requirements as set forth at N.J.A.C. 13:51-1.8(e) apply requires satisfactory completion of training consisting of a minimum of three days of training prescribed and conducted by the Division of State Police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-9\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51\u20141.8(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">An operator whose certification is suspended for failing to be recertified as set forth at N.J.A.C. 13:51-1.6(d) or N.J.A.C. 13:51-1.6(e) and who has been automatically suspended for one year or more from the date of the automatic suspension must attend and satisfy the requirements of a reinstatement and special recertification course as set forth at N.J.A.C. 13:51\u20141.6(f) conducted by the Division of State Police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">With the completion of the three-day recertification course, Officer Smith was again qualified to operate a breathalyzer after having been suspended from January 1979 to October 1982. The recertification was valid through the end of 1982 and for two calendar years thereafter, according to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-1.7(c). Officer Smith again failed to be recertified before his license lapsed, and his certification was automatically suspended beginning January 1, 1985. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51\u20141.8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Officer Smith attended a one-day recertification course on March 22,1985. The State argues that because Officer Smith\u2019s certification had been suspended for less than one year, the one-day recertification course was sufficient to validate Officer Smith as a breathalyzer operator. The State relies upon the language of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51\u20141.6(d), <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-1.6(e) and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51\u20141.8(b). <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-1.8(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">An operator whose certification is suspended for failing to be recertified as set forth at N.J.A.C. 13:51\u20141.6(d) and who has been automatically suspended for less than one year from the date of the automatic suspension must attend and satisfy the requirements of the reinstatement and recertification course as set forth at N.J.A.C. 13:51-1.6(e) conducted by the Division of State Police. Reinstatement and recertification under this subsection must be completed before one year from the date of automatic suspension otherwise the operator must satisfy the requirements as set forth at N.J.A.C. 13:51-1.8(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-1.6(e) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">Reinstatement and recertification of an operator whose certification is suspended pursuant to N.J.A.C. 13:51-1.8(a) and to whom the requirements as set forth at N.J.A.C. 13:51\u20141.8(b) apply requires satisfactory completion of training as set forth at N.J.A.C. 13:51\u20141.6(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-8\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-1.6(d), in relevant part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">Recertification of an operator, <em>whose certification is not subject to suspension for any reason or revoked, </em>requires satisfactory completion of training consisting of a minimum one day of training as prescribed and conducted by the Division of State Police. [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Defendant, on the other hand, points to the emphasized language in <em>N.J.A. C. </em>13:51-1.6(d) in arguing that the regulatory scheme is ambiguous and should, therefore, be construed in his favor. He argues that because Officer Smith\u2019s certification had been automatically suspended for failure to recertify, Officer Smith\u2019s certification was \u201csubject to suspension\u201d and, therefore, the one-day recertification program prescribed in <em>N.J.A. C. </em>13:51-1.6(d) cannot apply. We disagree. A fair reading of the regulatory scheme contained in the Administrative Code reveals that the State\u2019s argument is the more reasonable one. The imprecise choice of words in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51\u20141.6(d) that seems to limit the one-day course to unsuspended operators does not render the provision fatally ambiguous. According to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-1.6(e) and <em>N.J.A. C. </em>13:51-1.8(b), an operator whose certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>cation has been suspended for less than one year may be recertified in a one-day course pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-1.-6(d). Despite the limiting language of <em>N.J.A. C. </em>13:51\u20141.6(d), it is clear that the drafters of the regulations intended to treat operators whose certifications had been suspended for less than one year similarly to operators \u201cnot subject to suspension for any reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Consequently, Officer Smith was validly recertified to administer the breathalyzer tests and, therefore, the results of the tests administered to defendant were properly admissible into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Further, the ampoules used in the breathalyzer tests had been validated by random sampling of ampoules from the same batch as those used in the breathalyzer tests. It is well-settled that the State need not provide an analysis of the contents of the actual ampoules used in the tests, <em>State v. Teare, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>19, 22 (App.Div.1975), and that the spot checking of a random ampoule is sufficient <em>prima facie </em>proof that the chemicals in the test ampoule were of the proper kind and mixed to proper proportion. <em>See State v. Dickens, </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>73, 79 (App.Div.1974); <em>State v. DeVito, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>478, 479-480 (App.Div.1973); <em>State v. Bryan, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>369, 373 (Law Div.1974). <em>But cf. State v. Dohme, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>485, 488 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Here, the breathalyzer was stipulated to be in proper working order, and Officer Smith was qualified to operate the breathalyzer. The State introduced the signed statement of a State Trooper that he had tested random samples of ampoules from the same batch as those used in the breathalyzer tests administered to defendant. The inspections were performed in August and November of 1987. Defendant was stopped and the breathalyzer tests administered on October 81, 1987. The State\u2019s analysis of random ampoules from the same batch of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ampoules as those used to test defendant was sufficient to satisfy the requirement of \u201cspot checking,\u201d as stated in <em>Dickens </em>and <em>DeVito. See also State v. Dohme, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>49, 56 n. 4 (App.Div.1988) (appeal after remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">It is firmly established in this State that a defendant is not entitled to a trial by jury when charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50. In <em>State v. Linnehan, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41 (App.Div.1984), certif. den., 99 <em>N.J. </em>362 (1985), we held that a defendant charged as a third offender under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50 was not entitled to a jury trial, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">Persons charged with crime are constitutionally entitled to trial by jury. Those charged with petty offenses are not. <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 <em>U.S. </em>145, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1444, 20 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>491 (1968). The New Jersey Supreme Court has held that the only reliable test for distinction is the severity of the authorized punishment, and that jury trial is not required unless the maximum penalty to which the defendant is exposed exceeds six months incarceration and a fine of $1,000. <em>State v. Owens, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>153 (1969); <em>In re Yengo, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>111 (1980). <em>See Baldwin v. New York, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>66, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1886, 26 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>437 (1970). Where factually related petty offenses are tried together whose maximum sentences total more than six months, and the defendant is not offered a jury trial, the sentences may not total more than six months. <em>State v. Owens, supra. </em>Concurrent jail sentences, each of which does not exceed six months, are permissible. <em>Id. </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>at 163.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">The penalty for a drunk driving third offender is a mandatory term of incarceration for 180 days, a fine of $1,000 and loss of license for 10 years. <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50. The statutory language, \u201ca term of not less than 180 days,\u201d was not well chosen. However, we are satisfied of the legislative intent and we adopt the reasoning of <em>State v. Ferretti, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>578 (Law Div.1983) in this regard. Defendant was ordered to be jailed for a total of 200 days less 90 days of community service, or a net 110 days. Since his total sentence exposure was to incarceration of not more than six months and a fine of $1,000, and his actual incarceration will be less, there is no constitutional infirmity. [197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 43].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-9\"><em>See also State v. Owens, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>153 (1969), <em>cert. </em>den., 396 <em>U.S. </em>1021, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>593, 24 L.Ed.2d 514 (1970); <em>Blanton v. N. Las Vegas Munic.

Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Accordingly, the judgment under review is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
