BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-30\">Florida Suncoast Villas (\u201cSuncoast\u201d) filed a complaint against the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>alleging that it had a superior lien on the corporate accounts receivable levied on by the Internal Revenue Service. The district court ruled in favor of Suncoast and entered judgment. Suncoast then filed an application for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d) which authorizes fee awards against the government to a prevailing party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In support of its application, Suncoast submitted three documents. The first document was a local attorney\u2019s affidavit stating that reasonable attorney\u2019s fees amounted to $28,-000. 00.when billed at seventy-five dollars per hour. The second itemized attorney time spent on the case at 370.25 hours. The third included an itemized statement of costs totalling $2,734.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">After indicating that the government\u2019s position was not \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d the court, absent further finding, awarded Suncoast attorney\u2019s fees of $28,000 and costs of $2,734.04. The sole issue on this appeal is whether an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA must be based on reviewable findings of fact pursuant to the guidelines set out in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-18\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d) provides that where the United States has unsuccessfully brought or defended a civil action, the prevailing party may recover its attorney\u2019s fees if the government\u2019s position was not \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d The government does not appeal from the court\u2019s finding that its position was not substantially justified. Instead the government challenges only the failure of the court to follow the <em>Johnson </em>guidelines to determine the reasonableness of the amount of attorney\u2019s fees requested by Suncoast.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-19\">Suncoast asserts that the <em>Johnson </em>factors regarding attorney\u2019s fees have been confined to cases commenced under the Fair Labor Standards Act or the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Suncoast further argues that the <em>Johnson </em>factors should not be applied in cases where Congress has set statutory guidelines regulating attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-20\">We conclude that the <em>Johnson </em>factors do apply to cases arising under the EAJA. \u201cAlthough <em>Johnson </em>... involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>the setting of an attorneys\u2019 fee award under Title VII, it is recognized as a broad precedent which is generally applicable in other fee setting contexts.\u201d <em>Watford v. Heckler, </em>765 F.2d 1562, 1565 n. 3 (11th Cir.1985). In <em>Watford, </em>we held that the attorney\u2019s fee limitation provisions of the Social Security Act were not applicable to a fee award authorized by the EAJA and specifically approved an EAJA fee award where the trial court had applied the <em>Johnson </em>factors. We now make explicit what was implicit in <em>Watford: Johnson </em>sets the standards for determining a reasonable fee awarded pursuant to the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">There has been some confusion in the lower courts as to whether the <em>Johnson </em>factors are \u201ctechnically or necessarily applicable to matters within the purview of the EAJA.\u201d <em>Cox v. United States, </em>593 F.Supp. 1238, 1240 (S.D.Fla.1984). Nonetheless, courts regularly have applied the <em>Johnson </em>factors to determine the reasonableness of an attorney\u2019s fee award under the EAJA. <em>See, e.g., Kennedy v. Heckler, </em>598 F.Supp. 124, 124-25 (D.Md.1984); <em>Cox v. United States, </em>593 F.Supp. 1238, 1240-41 (S.D.Fla.1984); <em>Ashburn v. United States, </em>577 F.Supp. 59, 66 (N.D.Ala.1983), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>740 F.2d 843 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Citizens Bank v. United States, </em>558 F.Supp. 1301, 1304 (N.D.Ala.1983). Accordingly, we reject Suncoast\u2019s proposition that the <em>Johnson </em>factors are not applied to EAJA actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Suncoast further argues that <em>Johnson </em>is inapplicable where Congress has set a ceiling for fee awards. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A) establishes a $75 per hour limit on EAJA fee awards absent special circumstances. Section 2412 is a recommended ceiling for reasonable fees. In order to determine what a reasonable fee is, however, a court first must apply the <em>Johnson </em>guidelines. <em>See Citizens Bank, supra </em>at 1304 (EAJA fee limit is an \u201cadditional constraint\u201d to be considered with <em>Johnson </em>factors). Therefore, we also reject this argument that <em>Johnson </em>is inapplicable to EAJA fee determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">Suncoast has alleged that the government\u2019s appeal based on the failure of the court to apply <em>Johnson </em>evidences further unjustified litigation and delay on the government\u2019s part. Because we conclude that application of the <em>Johnson </em>guidelines is a prerequisite for a fee award under the EAJ\u00c1, we reject Suncoast\u2019s assertion that this appeal was taken in bad faith. Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s order awarding appellee costs and attorney\u2019s fees and REMAND the case so that the district court may enter proper findings of fact and, if necessary, conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine a reasonable fee award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-8\">Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort) brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">.
