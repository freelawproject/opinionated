The trial court found as a fact,however, that the calculator produced by appellee was confected by a Dr. Wyatt, who did not \u201cknow of or use anything from the plaintiffs prototype calculators when he devised his calculator that the defendant adopted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-23\">This holding is amply supported by record evidence, including the direct testimony of Wyatt, and is fatal to Hunter\u2019s appeal. Whether or not Mr. Hunter\u2019s device constituted a trade secret, and whether or not a confidential relationship existed between him and the appellee \u2014 issues also decided adversely to Hunter by the trial court \u2014 if appellee made no use of his device, it is patent that he has no claim against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-24\">All of the above should have been obvious from the outset of this appeal, which was foredoomed by the court\u2019s amply-supported finding of no use by appellee of appellant\u2019s device. Such an appeal is frivolous. <em>Warren v. Illinois Central Gulf Railroad Co., </em>768 F.2d 709 (5th Cir.1985). We therefore grant appellee\u2019s prayer for relief pursuant to Rule 38, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, award to appellee costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees expended in responding to the appeal, and remand for calculation of these amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-25\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
