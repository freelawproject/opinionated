Because we find the position of the United States substantially justified, we affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">On July 26, 1982, Bazaldua\u2019s daughter was apprehended transporting eleven undocumented aliens in his 1973 pickup truck. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) seized the truck and four days later sent notification to Bazaldua. Bazaldua wrote the INS and requested the return of his truck, explaining that his daughter had borrowed the truck to move furniture and that he knew nothing of her involvement in transporting undocumented aliens. The INS denied Bazaldua\u2019s request because the INS found it \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that he was unaware of the activities of his daughter, allegedly a member of his own household, in the smuggling of undocumented aliens. By letter of December 17, Bazaldua was informed that steps were being taken to forfeit his truck. On December 27, notice of intended forfeiture was first published in a local newspaper. Bazaldua filed a petition for remission on January 14, 1983, and this petition was similarly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-5\">Bazaldua sought judicial review by filing a complaint in district court on February 2, 1983, and sending a claim and a cost bond to the INS on the following day. The government filed its answer on February 22. On March 15, Bazaldua filed his first set of discovery requests, and after extensions in the discovery schedule were approved by the court, Bazaldua\u2019s motion to compel was granted on November 8. Thereafter, the parties agreed to the return of Bazaldua\u2019s truck, and a consent judgment was filed on January 18, 1984. Subsequently, Bazaldua requested attorney\u2019s fees and expenses under the EAJA, and after a hearing the district court denied this request, finding the government\u2019s position to be \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d The sole issue on appeal is the denial of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-12\">Bazaldua sought attorney\u2019s fees and expenses pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d). The EAJA provides in pertinent part that a court shall award fees and other expenses incurred by a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in a suit against the United States unless \u201cthe position of the United States was substantially justified____\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that Bazaldua was a prevailing party within the meaning of the EAJA. The issue on appeal is whether the government\u2019s position was substantially justified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1350-15\">We note initially that a district court\u2019s denial of an award under the EAJA is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Realm of Louisiana v. East Baton Rouge Parish School Board, </em>679 F.2d 64, 69 (5th Cir.1982). Under the EAJA, \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1350-16\">given the same special meaning accorded that term in the review of preliminary injunctions and other preliminary orders: \u201cOn one hand, it has been interpreted to require highly deferential review of district courts\u2019 tentative findings of fact; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>such determinations are not overturned unless \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 and, in practice, are rarely subjected to critical examination.\u201d ... \u201cOn the other hand, it allows for close scrutiny of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\"><em>Houston Agricultural Credit Corp. v. United States, </em>736 F.2d 233 (5th Cir.1984) (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Spencer v. N.L.R.B., </em>712 F.2d 539, 565 (D.C.Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1908, 80 L.Ed.2d 457 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-8\">The test of whether or not a government position is substantially justified is essentially one of reasonableness. <em>Russell v. National Mediation Board, </em>775 F.2d 1284, 1289 (5th Cir.1985). Where the government shows that its position had a reasonable basis in both law and fact, no award will be made; this test is a middle ground between an automatic award to a prevailing party and a restrictive standard which would have required the prevailing party to show the government position to be frivolous and groundless. <em>Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, </em>679 F.2d at 68. The burden of demonstrating substantial justification rests with the government. <em>S &amp; H Riggers &amp; Erectors, Inc. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Commission, </em>672 F.2d 426, 430 (5th Cir.1982). The EAJA\u2019s reference to \u201cposition\u201d means, in addition to the position taken by the government in litigation, the underlying agency action. Pub.L.No. 99-80, \u00a7 2(c)(2)(B), 99 Stat. 185 (1985) (to be codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(D)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-9\">The government has advanced substantial reasons for its opposition to Bazaldua\u2019s claim. First, the government argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction based on Bazaldua\u2019s failure to timely file a claim and cost bond as required by the regulations. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 274.1-.21 (1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, the government, relying on <em>One 1977 Volvo 242DL v. United States, </em>650 F.2d 660 (5th Cir.1981), argues that a district court is generally without jurisdiction to review an administrative forfeiture. The government also defends the regulations and agency actions against Bazaldua\u2019s claim that both were violative of due process. Moreover, the government argues that even if the district court had jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s actions, those actions were reasonable and did not constitute an abuse of the agency\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court concluded that \u201ca reasonable basis existed, factually and legally for the government\u2019s defensive position,\u201d and found the position of the United States to be substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-14\">Bazaldua on appeal does not specifically challenge the substance of any of the government\u2019s defenses, but claims that the government\u2019s position \u201cwas not substantially justified because the [government] had no litigating position other than delay.\u201d Bazaldua argues that the attorney\u2019s fee hearing before the district court should not have considered the merits of the government\u2019s defenses. Bazaldua points to the government\u2019s delay in answering his discovery requests as conclusive on the issue of substantial justification. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-15\">Bazaldua\u2019s complete failure to respond to the government\u2019s showing of substantial justification precludes us from finding that the district court abused its discretion in denying fees and expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>under the EAJA. Bazaldua\u2019s arguments would have us award fees and expenses on the basis of the government\u2019s pre-settlement delay, without regard to the merits of the government\u2019s defenses. However, Bazaldua is not entitled to such an award merely because he is a prevailing party. The government is not liable for fees and expenses in every case in which it does not prevail. <em>S &amp; H Riggers, </em>672 F.2d at 430. While we need not reach the question of whether the government would have ultimately prevailed had its defenses been tested in further litigation, we agree with the district court\u2019s determination that the government met its burden of showing substantial justification.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">The government\u2019s delay in settling the case is not by itself a sufficient ground for the award of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses under the EAJA where the government has propounded defenses undisputed by Bazaldua.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The government\u2019s decision to settle Bazaldua\u2019s possibly untenable claim should not be penalized by the imposition of fees and expenses. The government\u2019s delay in responding to discovery requests exposed it to possible sanctions under the Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a)(4) (providing for award of fees and expenses to moving party). The district court did not award any sanctions against the government pursuant to its order to compel, and Bazaldua does not now challenge that determination. Bazaldua may not relitigate the issue of discovery sanctions under the guise of an EAJA request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">We therefore AFFIRM the order of the district court denying Bazaldua\u2019s application for fees and expenses.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1350-6\">. The provision in full reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1350-7\">Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort), including proceedings for judicial review of agency action, brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1350-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (as amended by Pub. L.No. 99-80, \u00a7 2(a)(2), 99 Stat. 184 (1985)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1350-17\">. We note that on October 1, 1984, during the pendency of this action, the original EAJA expired, due to a \u201csunset\" provision. Pub.L.No. 96-481, \u00a7 203[c], 94 Stat. 2327 (1980). This law explicitly provides, however, that the EAJA would \"continue to apply through final disposition of any adversary adjudication ... initiated before the date of repeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the EAJA was reenacted and amended on August 5, 1985, effective for all cases pending on that date. Pub.L.No. 99-80, \u00a7\u00a7 6(a), 7(a), 99 Stat. 186 (1985). Thus, Bazaldua\u2019s claim is governed by the amended EAJA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1351-10\">. The regulations provide for judicial review as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1351-11\">Any person claiming ownership of a seized conveyance may obtain judicial review by filing a claim within 20 days of the date of first publication of the notice of seizure, alleging that the conveyance was improperly seized, and posting bond to cover all the costs and expenses of the proceedings if forfeiture is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1351-12\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 274.10(a) (1985). Bazaldua did not file his claim and cost bond within twenty days of December 27, 1982, the date of publication of intended forfeiture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1351-17\">. The government refers to evidence admitted in the district court hearing on attorney\u2019s fees to show the reasonableness of the agency\u2019s determination that Bazaldua was aware of his daughter\u2019s smuggling. This evidence was in support of the government\u2019s allegations that Bazaldua\u2019s daughter's own truck was seized two weeks before the seizure of Bazaldua\u2019s truck, and that the agreement to smuggle the aliens on July 26, 1982, was concluded at Bazaldua\u2019s residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">. Bazaldua contends that had the government responded to his discovery requests, he would have been in a better position to support his application for attorney's fees. However, Bazaldua has failed to explain why the government's settlement of the case prior to responding to discovery requests conclusively shows that none of the facially substantial defenses are actually viable. Bazaldua\u2019s contention would have us either award fees and expenses in every such settlement (ignoring the purposes of the EAJA\u2019s substantial justification standard) or else order new discovery after judgment in order to resolve the attorney's fee issue. We decline to adopt either course of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">. Some courts have indicated that pre-settlement delay can be equated with the assumption of a litigating position that is unreasonable and not substantially justified where the government apparently lacks viable defenses. <em>See Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Watt, </em>722 F.2d 1081, 1086 (2d Cir.1983) (\u201cWe find it incumbent upon the government to abandon its opposition to the other party as soon as it becomes apparent that its litigation stance is not substantially justified.\u201d). <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>721 F.2d 357, 360-61 (Fed.Cir.1983) (remanding for consideration of whether failure to settle promptly is a litigating position not substantially justified where government liability seemed clear). Here, however, Bazaldua ignores the government\u2019s assertedly substantial defenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
