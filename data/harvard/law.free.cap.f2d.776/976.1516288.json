White that there were deficiencies in their income taxes for 1980 and 1981 in the amounts of $1,776.80 and $5,272.73 respectively, and in addition, penalties for those years in the amounts of $88.84 and $263.64. The deficiencies were due to the disallowance by the Commissioner of unsubstantiated deductions plus a failure of the taxpayers to include certain interest income and to pay self-employment taxes. The taxpayers timely petitioned the United States Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiencies. Prior to trial, however, the parties negotiated a settlement agreeing to reduced amounts of deficiencies, and stipulated to entry of judgment for deficiencies in the amounts of $1,050 for the year 1980 and $2,821 for the year 1981, with no liability for penalties. The Tax Court entered the judgments accordingly. The Whites then filed an appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-21\">Generally, a party who consents to the entry of judgment waives his or her right to appeal from it. <em>Swift &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>276 U.S. 311, 324, 48 S.Ct. 311, 314, 72 L.Ed. 587 (1928) (quoting <em>Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railroad v. United States, </em>113 U.S. 261, 266, 5 S.Ct. 460, 462, 28 L.Ed. 971 (1885)). The rule recently was applied by the Ninth Circuit in a case, like this, involving a stipulated deficiency decision of the Tax Court. <em>Tapper v. Commissioner, </em>766 F.2d 401 (9th Cir.1985). The rule also has been recognized in other contexts by the majority of circuits. <em>Haitian Refugee Center v. Civiletti, </em>614 F.2d 92 (5th Cir.1980);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>National Wildlife Federation v. Gorsuch, </em>744 F.2d 963, 968 (3d Cir.1984); <em>Thonen v. Jenkins, </em>455 F.2d 977 (4th Cir.1972); <em>Browning v. Navarro, </em>743 F.2d 1069, 1076 n. 20 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Martin Marietta Corp. v. FTC, </em>376 F.2d 430, 433-34 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 923, 88 S.Ct. 237, 19 L.Ed.2d 265 (1967); <em>United States v. Star Const. Co., </em>186 F.2d 666, 669 (10th Cir.1951). There are but two exceptions to the general rule: (1) where the party did not actually consent or (2) where the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the judgment. <em>Tapper v. Commissioner, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number><em>supra. </em>Neither exception applies here. The Whites do not question the jurisdiction of the Tax Court to enter the judgment, nor do they disavow their consent to the stipulations; rather, they challenge the dis-allowance by the Commissioner of certain business deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">We hold that by stipulating to the entry of judgment for the reduced deficiencies, the taxpayers waived their right to appeal. Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1067-17\">. The Eleventh Circuit, in the en banc decision <em>Bonner </em>v. <em>City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981), adopted as precedent decisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
