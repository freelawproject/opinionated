A finding that the material was not sold by the materialman to be used in said structure, but was sold to the contractor without any agreement or understanding where it was to be used, though purchased by the contractor to be used, and was actually used, in the construction of the building, is fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s claim of lien.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b363-6\">APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco.

Findings and judgment were for the defendahts, and the plaintiff appeals from the judgment upon the judgment-roll without any bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Among other things the court found: \u201cThat said material was purchased by said Chandler (the contractor) to be used, and was actually used, in the construction of said structure upon said lot of land, for said H. L. Van Wyck, but said material was not sold by said Whittier, Fuller &amp; Co. (plaintiff\u2019s assignors), to be used in said structure, but was sold to said Chandler without any agreement or understanding where it was to be used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">This finding is fatal to plaintiff\u2019s claim. It is not enough that the materials were in fact used in the construction of the building, but they must have been furnished by the material-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>man expressly for the particular building on which the lien is asserted.
