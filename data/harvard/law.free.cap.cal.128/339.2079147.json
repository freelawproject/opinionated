That decision has remained unquestioned and unchallenged for eighteen years. It has been consistently upheld by this court whenever the question has arisen. <em>(Estate of Dean, </em>62 Cal. 613; <em>Lutz v. Christy, </em>67 Cal. 457; <em>Estate of Cahalan, </em>70 Cal. 604; <em>In re Wiard, </em>83 Cal. 619; <em>In re Bauquier, </em>88 Cal. 302-13; <em>In re Walkerly, </em>94 Cal. 352; <em>In re Smith, </em>98 Cal. 636; <em>Iversen v. Superior Court, </em>115 Cal. 28; <em>Estate of Wittmeier, 118 </em>Cal. 255; <em>Estate of Hickey, </em>121 Cal. 378.) We are satisfied with the reasoning of these cases and the conclusions there expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
