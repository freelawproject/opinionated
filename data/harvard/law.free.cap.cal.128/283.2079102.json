The fourth ground is: \u201cOn account of illegal votes.\u201d That some other person received more votes than the person declared elected, or an equal number with such person, is not made a ground of contest. Section 1114 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows: \u201cNothing in the fourth ground of contest specified in section 1111 is to be so construed as to authorize an election to be set aside on account of illegal votes, unless it appear that a number of illegal votes has been given to the person whose right to the office is contested, which, if taken from him, would reduce the number of his legal votes \u2022below the number of votes given to some other person for the same office, after deducting therefrom the illegal votes which may be shown to have been given to such other person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Section 1123 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows: \u201cIf in any case it appears that another person than the one returned has the highest number of legal votes, the court must declare such person elected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\"Under these provisions it is obvious that the judgment annulling the election is unauthorized by the statute, or by the facts found. The judgment should have been that the contestant take nothing by the proceeding and it be dismissed, and the cause is remanded, with direction that the superior court make such modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">McFarland, J., and Henshaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
