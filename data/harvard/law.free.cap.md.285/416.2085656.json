Estep\u2019s appeal to that court of a determination, adverse to him, entered by a court in banc convened in the Seventh Judicial Circuit of Maryland, we granted his petition for a writ of certiorari to consider three questions: 1) did the Court of Special Appeals err in dismissing Mr. Estep\u2019s appeal under Maryland Rule 1035 b 1 as \u201cnot allowed by law\u201d; 2) was the court in banc correct in reversing the finding of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County that it had no jurisdiction to consider the request of petitioner\u2019s ex-wife, respondent Brenda J. Matt (formerly Estep), for modification of a child custody order issued by that court several years earlier; and 3) was the court in banc likewise correct in reversing the circuit court\u2019s decision that it should decline to hear the matter because the circuit court was an inconvenient forum to now adjudicate the custody modification request. After studying the record in this case, however, we conclude that although the Court of Special Appeals was incorrect in directing the dismissal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>petitioner's appeal to that court, we likewise do not reach the other two questions posed because the court in banc determined those issues prior to the entry of a final, appealable order by the chancellor. As a consequence, we will reverse the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 dismissal of petitioner\u2019s appeal and remand this case to that court with instructions that it vacate the judgment of the court in banc and remand the case to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">By order dated December 9, 1971, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County awarded custody of the four children of the marriage of Donald and Brenda Estep to their father on the condition that the children reside with their paternal grandparents in Woodstock, Virginia, which is a little less than 100 miles from Prince George\u2019s County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, in an independent action, petitioner and respondent were divorced <em>a vinculo matrimonii </em>by a decree of the Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court dated July 3, 1973. Although custody of the four children was not specifically raised before the chancellor as a contested issue in the divorce action, the decree nonetheless reaffirmed the custody arrangement established by the 1971 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Since February 1971 the three youngest children have lived and gone to school in Woodstock and have returned to this State only infrequently to visit their mother, who continues to reside in this State. Approximately one and one-half years after his parents were divorced, and with the consent of all the parties but without modification of the custody order, the eldest son moved from his grandparents\u2019 home to that of his mother, where he continues to reside at the present time. The father, while both employed and living in Maryland during the work week, claims Woodstock as his residence since he usually returns there to stay over the weekends.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Following her remarriage, respondent on July 15, 1977, submitted to the circuit court a petition, which was filed in the original custody case, seeking modification of the order of December 9, 1971, so as to grant her custody of each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the four children. The petitioner resisted his former wife\u2019s request by asserting that under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) as adopted in Maryland, Md. Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol., 1978 Cum. Supp.), Art. 16, \u00a7\u00a7 184-207, the chancellor was without jurisdiction to grant the modification sought and, in the alternative, that the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County was an inconvenient forum to litigate the mother\u2019s demand for a change in the custody of the children, in addition, Mr. Estep filed a cross-petition for modification of the December 9 order, demanding contribution from his ex-wife for the support of the three children living with their grandparents. By an order filed January 24, 1978, Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court Judge Robert J. Woods dismissed Mrs. Matt\u2019s motion to modify the December 9 decree as it related to the three youngest children, declaring that under the UCCJA the circuit court was without jurisdiction and was also an inconvenient forum for the prosecution of any action to change the custody of the three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">On the same day the chancellor\u2019s order was filed, acting pursuant to section 22 of Article IV of the Maryland Constitution and Maryland Rule 510, respondent sought an in banc review of Judge Wood\u2019s decision by filing a reservation of points concerning that determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the father\u2019s cross-petition for support contributions and the mother\u2019s motion for modification with regard to custody of the eldest son remained pending before the chancellor, a court in banc, with three Seventh Circuit judges presiding, was convened, heard argument by the parties on the correctness of Judge Wood\u2019s ruling, and on April 26,1978, filed its opinion and order by which it reversed the circuit court\u2019s determination. In making its ruling, the court in banc stated that the chancellor\u2019s \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction\u201d over the equity decree that gave petitioner custody of the four children had not been abrogated by the enactment of the UCCJA and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>that the circuit court was not an inconvenient forum. Petitioner, as the nonmoving party before the court in banc, noted a timely appeal of this decision to the Court of Special Appeals, which dismissed it, and we granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In addressing the initial issue of the propriety of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 dismissal of petitioner\u2019s request for review, we find that we are at somewhat of a loss because that court failed to further explain the reason for its decision, other than to say the appeal was \u201cnot allowed by law.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The requirements regulating further appeal from the decision of a court in banc are set out in section 22 of Article IV:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">[T]he decision of the said Court in banc shall be the effective decision in the premises, and conclusive, as against the party, at whose motion said points, or questions were reserved; but such decision in banc shall not preclude the right of Appeal ... in those cases, civil or criminal, in which appeal, or writ of error to the Court of Appeals may be allowed by Law. [Md. Const., Art. IV, \u00a7 22.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">See Md. Code (1974), \u00a7 12-302 (d) of the Courts Article. Being the nonmoving party to the court in banc, petitioner, as he was authorized to do, seasonably noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, thereby properly perfecting his request for review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If, as petitioner has suggested, the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Special Appeals dismissed the appeal to it as interlocutory because the court in banc, after reversing the circuit court\u2019s decision, remanded the case for further action on the respondent\u2019s petition for modification, such a ruling by the Court of Special Appeals would be in error. In holding that a nonmoving party\u2019s appeal from the decision of a court in banc to grant a new trial would be timely only if it were made immediately, rather than after the new trial was conducted, this Court in <em>Buck v. Folkers, </em>269 Md. 185, 187-88, 304 A. 2d 826, 828 (1973), clearly indicated that the court in banc acts only as an appellate tribunal so that its decisions are not those of a reconsidering trial court but are reviewable as final appellate judgments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, we find no grounds for the dismissal by the Court of Special Appeals of the petitioner's appeal and will reverse that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Having determined that this appeal is properly before us, we nonetheless find that we do not reach the substantive issues decided by the court in banc because those questions were answered by that court even though it was without jurisdiction to do so, in that it had before it \u201cno matter ... which [was] a final judgment so as to be the proper subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>of an appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Smith v. Taylor, </em>285 Md. 143, 147, 400 A. 2d 1130, 1133 (1979). In illustrating our reasons for this conclusion, we begin with the proposition that, as we have just indicated, the court in banc is a tribunal exercising appellate jurisdiction. It being established that the jurisdiction of the appellate courts of this State \u201cis at this time delimited by statute,\u201d <em>Peat &amp; Co. v. Los Angeles Rams, </em>284 Md. 86, 90, 394 A. 2d 801, 803 (1978); <em>accord, e.g., Smith v. Taylor, supra, </em>285 Md. at 146, 400 A. 2d at 1132; <em>Jolley v. State, </em>282 Md. 353, 355, 384 A. 2d 91, 93 (1978); <em>Warren v. State, </em>281 Md. 179, 182, 377 A. 2d 1169, 1171 (1977), we look to the pertinent enactment to determine the scope of the court in banc\u2019s basic authority to act. The applicable statute is section 12-301 of the Maryland Code\u2019s (1974) Courts Article which provides that an appeal shall be \u201cfrom a final judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As to whether a given order or other court action constitutes a final judgment, we have held that this is a determination that ultimately can be made only by this Court. <em>Smith v. Taylor, supra, </em>285 Md. at 146, 400 A. 2d at 1133; <em>Peat &amp; Co. v. Los Angeles Rams, supra, </em>284 Md. at 91, 394 A. 2d at 804; <em>Warren v. State, supra, </em>281 Md. at 183, 377 A. 2d at 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In acting to define, at least in part, the term \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d this Court has adopted Maryland Rule 605 a which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">a. <em>When entered </em>\u2014 As <em>to Part or All.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">Where more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>court may direct the entry of a final judgment upon one or more but less than all of the claims only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates less than all the claims shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">As is obvious from a reading of this rule, which is applicable in both law and equity actions, <em>Parish v. Milk Producers Assn., </em>250 Md. 24, 97, 242 A. 2d 512, 553 (1968), the entry of an order purporting to determine a claim or claims will not be deemed a final, appealable judgment if there remains to be decided other claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, or third-party claims unless the court makes \u201can express determination that there is no just reason for delay\u201d and specifically directs that a judgment be entered as to the order adjudicating the claim or claims. In this instance, since there was both an undecided claim\u2014respondent\u2019s motion for modification of the custody decree as it relates to the eldest son\u2014and a pending cross-claim\u2014the father\u2019s cross-petition for child support from his ex-wife\u2014and the chancellor did not enter either a specific determination that there should be no delay or an express judgment pursuant to Rule 605 a, the determination of the court in banc reversing the circuit court\u2019s order striking respondent\u2019s multiple claims concerning the custody of the three youngest children was premature and must be reversed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Brooks v. Ford </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>Motor Credit Co., </em>261 Md. 278, 282, 274 A. 2d 345, 347 (1971); <em>Picking v. State Finance Co., </em>257 Md. 554, 557, 263 A. 2d 572, 573-74 (1970); <em>Harlow v. Blocher, </em>257 Md. 1, 3-4, 262 A. 2d 58, 60 (1970). We would add, however, that, as this case will again be before him on remand, the chancellor may wish to reconsider his earlier rulings in light of the opinion filed by the court in banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\n<em>Order of the Court of Special Appeals dismissing appeal reversed and case remanded to that court with directions to remand the case to the Circuit Court for Prince George's County for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the respondent.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-8\">.

In this regard, we would hope that in the future, when dismissing appeals under Rule 1035 b 1 as \u201cnot allowed by law,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals will add a few lines of explanation to aid those involved in understanding the reason for its determination and to provide this Court with the information necessary to reach a decision on whether a request for review of the dismissal should be granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b442-9\">. In the advent of a determination by a court in banc adverse to the nonmoving party, section 22 provides that such a decision \u201cshall not preclude the right of Appeal, or writ of error to the adverse party, in those cases, civil or criminal, in which appeal, or writ of error to the Court of Appeals may be allowed by Law.\u201d Md. Const., Art. IV, \u00a7 22. This \u201cright of Appeal\u201d is nonetheless subject to the caveat, found in the final clause of section 22, that it, along with the rest of section 22, \u201cshall be subject to such provisions as may hereafter be made by Law.\u201d While prior to creation of the Court of Special Appeals in 1966, <em>see </em>1966 Md. Laws, ch. 11, \u00a7 1, this Court was the sole tribunal before which any right of appeal from a court in banc could possibly have been exercised, this is no longer the case. Acting pursuant to the power granted it by section 14A of Article IV of the Maryland Constitution, the General Assembly has enacted sections 12-307 and 12-308 of the Code\u2019s (1974, 1978 Cum. Supp.) Courts Article by which it has made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>clear its intent that, unless some specific legislative enactment provides otherwise, <em>see, e.g., </em>Md. Code (1974 <em>&amp; </em>1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-305, -403 of the Courts Article (appeal from final judgment in the District Court of Maryland is to the circuit court with further review only upon grant of writ of certiorari by the Court of Appeals), the Court of Appeals should no longer consider initially any appeal that is granted as of right, but that such appeals should be taken first to the Court of Special Appeals, and then, upon writ of certiorari being granted, to this Court. There being no statutory provision relating to section 22\u2019s grant of an appeal of right to the nonmovmg party who loses before a court in banc, such an appeal would necessarily have to conform to the normal appellate procedure established by the legislature and thus be taken to the Court of Special Appeals, with this Court exercising jurisdiction only upon the issuance of a writ of certiorari.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\">. In Dobson v. Mulcare, 26 Md. App. 699, 704-05, 338 A. 2d 898, 901-02, <em>cert. denied. </em>276 Md. 741 (1975), the Court of Special Appeals indicated that our decision in Buck v. Folkers, 269 Md. 185, 304 A. 2d 826 (1973), had established an exception to the general rule that orders granting a new trial are not appealable. This interpretation of the holding of <em>Buck </em>is erroneous, however, for while it is true that an order granting a new trial is not generally appealable, <em>e.g., </em>A. S. Abell Co. v. Skeen, 265 Md. 53, 59-60, 288 A. 2d 596, 599 (1972); Carlile v. Two Guys, 264 Md. 475, 477, 287 A. 2d 31, 33 (1972), this applies only to such orders when they are issued by a trial court and not to the ordering of a new trial following review by an appellate court. As in <em>Buck, </em>the court in banc here was an appellate court for this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b444-8\">. Neither of the parties to this appeal has raised the question of the finality of the circuit court\u2019s order, but that does not preclude us from dome: so sua sponte. <em>E.g., </em>Biro v. Schombert, 285 Md. 290. 293. 402 A. 2d 71. 73 (1979); Smith v. Tavlor, 285 Md. 143, 147, 400 A. 2d 1130. 1133 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\">. in pertinent part section 12-301 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">[A] party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court. The right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law. [Md. Code (1974), \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts Article.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\">. In so stating, we do not find there to be any conflict between this requiremei t of finality before appeal and section 22\u2019s declaration that \u201cit shall be cot petent to the party, against whom the ruling or decision is made, upon motion, to have the point, or question reserved for the consideration of the three Judges of the Circuit, ... and the motion for such reservation shall be entered of record, during the sitting, at which such decision may be made.\u201d Md. Const., Art. IV, i 22. A reservation of points, being tantamount to registering an objection coupled with a declaration that the objector, at the appropriate time, intends to seek review of the trial court\u2019s ruling, simply saves the point or points in question for determination by the court in banc when a final, appealable judgment has been entered and does not act to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the case to a halt until those issues are decided by a court in banc, unless, of course, an earlier appeal is allowed on some other recognized basis, such as the \"collateral order doctrine\u201d or as an interlocutory order appealable under Md, Code (1974, 1978 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 12-303 of the Courts Article. Further, we note that our determination in this case does not in any way conflict with this Court\u2019s holding in Medical Examiners v. Steward, 207 Md. 108, 111-12, 113 A. 2d 426, 427 (1955), that a court in banc has \u201cthe power to decide the question of its ownjurisdiction\u201d and that its decision on such a matter is not subject to review. This principle governs all appeals to a court in banc and precludes the moving party, as it aid in <em>Steward, </em>from further challenging that tribunal\u2019s determination as to its own jurisdiction; however, when, as here, an appeal of the court in banc\u2019s decision is taken by the nonmoving partv, as section 22 allows, <em>see </em>p. 420 <em>supra, </em>that court\u2019s determination becomes subject to review by the Uourt o\u00ed Special Appeals or this Court upon any ground that we, as appellate courts, are permitted to consider in any other appeal. <em>See </em>Costigin v. Bond, 65 Md. 122, 124, 3 A. 285, 285 (1886) (on appeal by nonmoving party, Court held court in banc without jurisdiction to hear case because points not properly reserved for review).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
