The matter was referred to Judge Martin B. Greenfeld of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City to make findings of fact and conclusions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>law. After conducting a hearing and considering the petition, answer, respondent\u2019s answer to the Commission\u2019s request for admission of facts and genuineness of documents and a letter from the United States Attorney\u2019s office regarding the respondent and the respondent\u2019s own testimony, Judge Greenfeld filed his findings and conclusions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\">\n<em>Findings of Fact</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">\u201cThe Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in Maryland on 9/12/67. He will be 37 years of age on 3/3/79. Pursuant to a grant of use immunity by the United States Attorney\u2019s office, the Respondent testified on 12/21/77 in the United States District Court criminal trial of one Earl Williams that during 1971 Williams, who is not an attorney, referred personal injury cases to the Respondent involving \u2018somewhere between 50 and 71 people\u2019; that the Respondent paid Williams amounts ranging from $75 to $125 for each client \u2018depending upon the severity of the case\u2019; that these payments were made to Williams in cash and \u2018would have averaged out between [$]5,000 and [$]7,500\u2019 during 1971; and that the Respondent stopped using Williams\u2019 services in late 1971 or early 1972 because he \u2018didn\u2019t particularly think that that was the way I should be running my business \u2014 and that\u2019s why I stopped.\u2019 A mistrial was declared (for reasons not here germane) and the Respondent testified to these same matters at Williams\u2019 retrial. The Federal prosecutor has written that the Respondent \u2018has been most cooperative and to our knowledge has provided information which is both complete and truthful\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">\u201cFederal investigators questioned the Respondent about the activities of a doctor who was under scrutiny for mail fraud. During that questioning, the Respondent volunteered the information about his since-terminated dealings with Williams, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>though this subject had not been raised by the Federal investigators. The Respondent could not contribute any useful information regarding the mail fraud investigation, but his testimony was used in the Williams case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">\u201cDuring the Williams\u2019 relationship, the Respondent had a partnership with one other attorney. Since 1975, the Respondent has been a sole practitioner in the general practice of law, and his personal injury work is practically nil.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u201cThe Respondent voluntarily terminated his relationship with Williams over seven years ago. He voluntarily made this information known to the Federal investigators and has not used runners since discharging Williams. The Respondent recognizes the serious impropriety of his past conduct and is remorseful for it. The Court is satisfied, after seeing and hearing the Respondent testify, that he will not hereafter engage in such unethical conduct if permitted to continue practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">\n<em>\u201cConclusions of Law</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">\u201cThe Respondent has violated the following Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">1. DR2-103(c), compensating a person for recommending or securing the attorney\u2019s employment by a client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">2. DR1-102(A) (5), engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Freedman did not take exceptions to these findings but did answer the show cause order as to the sanction to be imposed, if any, and an oral hearing was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">After carefully considering the matter, the findings of Judge Greenfeld are accepted and adopted and we think a reprimand is the appropriate sanction. Freedman will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>required to pay the costs of the transcripts of both the Inquiry Panel and the proceedings before the Supreme Bench in the amount of $141.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
