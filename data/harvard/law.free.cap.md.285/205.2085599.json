St. Comm\u2019n, </em>40 Md. App. 473, 392 A. 2d 105 (1978), and address ourselves to a number of questions of public importance. They involve the statute governing the Commission on Human Relations, Maryland Code (1957, 1979 Repl. Vol.), Art. 49B, and its interrelationship with the statute known as the \u201cLaw Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights,\u201d Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol., 1978 Cum. Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 727-734D.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">The specific controversy before us revolves around an attempt by the Commission to obtain certain records of the Police Department of Prince George\u2019s County in connection with one of the Commission\u2019s investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Since we granted the writ of certiorari the County has advised that it has turned over to the Commission so much of the records sought as ever actually existed. Accordingly, it has moved to dismiss on the ground that the cause is now moot. The Commission asserts it has not received all of the records which certain documentary evidence would seem to indicate might possibly have existed at one time. At oral argument on the motion before us, the County expressed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>willingness to deliver to the Commission all records it has which the Commission seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">We are-of the view that a determination of whether records exist or ever existed can only be made by a trier of fact and not by an appellate tribunal. Accordingly, we shall, pursuant to Maryland Rule 871 a, vacate the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to that Court for further remand to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to determine the existence in the past and at the present time of records sought but not delivered. If any of such records do exist, then under the County\u2019s agreement they must be delivered to the Commission. Obviously, this action leaves open the issues decided in the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals vacated and case remanded to that court for further remand to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for further proceedings consistent with this opinion; appellees to pay the costs; mandate to issue forthwith.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
