Schmidt, Jr. and Patricia Schmidt, his wife, executed and delivered a mortgage to Beneficial Finance Co. of Frederick, a Delaware corporation qualified to do business in Maryland, and licensed to engage in making loans under the Maryland Consumer Loan Law. The mortgage secured a loan of $3,500 made by Beneficial to the Schmidts. It called for repayment, \u201ctogether with interest on the unpaid balance thereof at the rate of Eighteen percent (18%) per annum (D/2% per month) ... in 60 successive monthly installments of $88.87 each, commencing one month from the date\u201d thereof. The indebtedness and the manner and terms of payment were further evidenced by and set forth in a promissory note of even date. The mortgage conveyed to Beneficial certain real property of the Schmidts located in Frederick County, Maryland, which was subject to a prior incumbrance and had on it a dwelling designed principally as a residence with accommodations for not more than four families. The Schmidts repaid the loan by 19 May 1977.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">A question arose as to the legality of the interest charged. The question was presented for judicial determination upon the' filing of a class action in assumpsit by the Schmidts against Beneficial in the Circuit Court for Frederick County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>on 22 February 1978. The Schmidts sought, on behalf of themselves and all other persons so similarly situated, the return of all monies over and above the principal amount of the loan proceeds, damages in the amount of three times the amount of interest and charges collected, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs of suit. Beneficial demurred. The demurrer was sustained without leave to amend. The Schmidts noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We ordered the issuance of a writ of certiorari before decision by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The Secondary Mortgage Loan Law added new \u00a7\u00a7 39-70 to Art. 66 of the Code (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol.). It was enacted, effective 1 January 1968, by Acts 1967, ch. 390, according to its title,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">to <em>generally </em>provide for the licensing of persons in the business of negotiating secondary mortgage loans, and to <em>generally </em>provide for the regulations of such persons and such loans, to give the Banking Commissioner certain duties and powers in the regulation of such persons and such loans, to provide penalties for violations and to <em>generally </em>relate to secondary mortgage transactions and the regulation of persons in this business. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">At the time Beneficial made the loan to the Schmidts, the Maryland Secondary Mortgage Loan Law, with respect to the licensing provisions, was as set out in Maryland Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol.) Art. 66, \u00a7\u00a7 39-71, and, with respect to credit provisions, was as set out in Code (1975) \u00a7\u00a7 12-401 to 12-415 of the Commercial Law Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is manifest that the Schmidt loan was the type of loan subject to regulation under the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law. Although Beneficial was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>not licensed under that law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it was permitted to make a loan under it as exempt from its licensing requirements. \u00a7 12-402 (a) .<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5Acts 1975, ch. 574, \u00a7 1, effective 1 July 1975, rewrote the licensing provisions of the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law prescribed by \u00a7 41, Article 66 of the Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Yol.). As rewritten, \u00a7 41 has two aspects. It first provides that \u201c[n]o person[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] other than any banking institution, savings bank, or association subject to Article 11 of this Code, any federal savings and loan association, insurance company, State-chartered building and loan association or any other financial institution which is subject to any other law of this State or of the United States regulating the power of such institution to engage in mortgage loan transactions shall make or negotiate, or offer to make or negotiate, any secondary mortgage loan except under the provisions of [the Secondary Mortgage Loan-Licensing Provisions] subtitle.\u201d It then requires, with five express exceptions, any person who makes a secondary mortgage loan to first obtain a license from the Bank Commissioner of Maryland or the deputy bank commissioner. Beneficial was exempt from the licensing requirements under the first exception which designates the same financial institutions excepted from the prohibition in the first aspect. Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol., 1978 Cum. Supp.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Art. 66, \u00a7 41 (1). Beneficial expressly declared in its brief and in oral argument before us that it was a financial institution which in fact was subject to a law of this State regulating the power of such institutions to engage in mortgage loan transactions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, Beneficial clearly had the authority to make a loan under the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law. \u00a7 12-402.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The loan to the Schmidts which Beneficial was authorized to make under the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law was patently \u201ca secondary mortgage loan\u201d within the meaning of that law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">\u201cSecondary mortgage loan\u201d means a loan or deferred purchase price secured in whole or in part by a mortgage, deed of trust, security agreement, or other lien on real property located in the State, which property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">(i) Is subject to the lien of one or more prior encumbrances, except a ground rent or other leasehold interest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">(ii) Has a dwelling on it designed principally as a residence with accommodations for not more than four families. [\u00a7 12-401 (j) (1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">The amount of a secondary mortgage loan is qualified only to the extent that it may be \u201cin such an amount that the net proceeds of the loan equal a predetermined sum----\u201d \u00a7 12-404 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Beneficial\u2019s exemption from the licensing requirements of the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law also served to make it a \u201clender\u201d in the contemplation of that law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-13\">\u201cLender\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-14\">(1) A licensee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-15\">(2) A person who makes a secondary mortgage loan but is exempt expressly from the licensing requirements of the Maryland Secondary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Mortgage Loan Law-Licensing Provisions. [\u00a7 12-401 (c).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">As a lender under the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law, Beneficial could not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">make or offer to make any secondary mortgage loan except within the terms and conditions authorized by [the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law] subtitle.

[\u00a7 12-411.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">A lender may \u201c[t]ake interest in advance on the full amount of the loan for the period from the date the loan is made to the date of maturity of the final installment.\u201d \u00a7 12-404 (a) (2). But</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">[t]he total amount of interest may not exceed the amount that would accrue throughout the term of the loan if charged at the rate of 12 percent per annum on the unpaid principal balances outstanding from time to time. [\u00a7 12-404 (b).] <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">With exceptions not here relevant, a secondary mortgage loan</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-13\">shall be amortized in equal or substantially equal monthly installments without a balloon payment at maturity____[\u00a7 12-404 (c).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>The mortgage here called for the Schmidts to repay Beneficial a loan in the amount of $3,500 \u201ctogether with interest on the unpaid balance thereof at the rate of Eighteen percent (18%) per annum (1M\u00ed% per month)... in 60 successive monthly installments of $88.77 each, commencing one month from the date [of the mortgage].\u201d The rate of interest charged was in excess of that permitted to be charged on a secondary mortgage loan and, thus, was in violation of the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Beneficial does not appear to dispute any of this. It recognizes, implicitly at the least, that the loan fell within the definition of a secondary mortgage loan which it was authorized to make, and that the rate of interest exceeded that authorized. But, it urges, the loan was not subject to the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law. In its view, that law did not come into play. Rather, it claims, the loan was governed by the Maryland Consumer Loan Law, Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol.) Art. 11, \u00a7\u00a7 163-206 (licensing provisions) and Code (1975) \u00a7\u00a7 12-301 to 12-316 of the Commercial Law Article (credit provisions). Beneficial\u2019s argument boils down to this. It was a licensee under the Consumer Loan Law. \u00a7 12-301 (d). As a licensee, it could engage in the business of making loans thereunder. \u00a7 12-302. The loan it made to the Schmidts was in an amount permitted for a consumer loan, that is, not to exceed $3,500. \u00a7 12-303. It was not prohibited from taking a mortgage on real property to secure the loan.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>was entitled to charge interest of 18% per annum as within the rate authorized by the Consumer Loan Law. \u00a7 12-306 (a). The Secondary Mortgage Loan Law does not expressly except loans meeting the criteria set out in the Consumer Loan Law, but Beneficial would have us read such an exception into the law. The definition of \u201csecondary mortgage loan,\u201d it urges, \u201ccan be read to include only loans such as those set forth in the definition which are not otherwise regulated by Maryland Law.\u201d But, we have often said that \u201c[a] court may not insert ... words to make a statute express an intention not evidenced in its original form.\u201d <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, </em>281 Md. 412, 419, 379 A. 2d 1007 (1977), citing <em>Harden v. Mass Transit Adm., </em>277 Md. 399, 406, 354 A. 2d 817 (1976); <em>Patapsco Trailer v. Eastern Freight, </em>271 Md. 558, 563-564, 318 A. 2d 817 (1974); <em>Giant of Md. v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>267 Md. 501, 512, 298 A. 2d 427, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>412 U. S. 915 (1973). Furthermore, we observe that the Legislature did expressly spell out an exclusion from secondary mortgage loans relating to loans to corporations. \u00a7 12-401 (j) (2) (i). And in 1975 it added a second exclusion with respect to loans for a business purpose or commercial investment. \u00a7 12-401 (j) (2) (ii). Had it intended to exclude consumer loans also, it could have easily so provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, </em>281 Md. 412, 379 A. 2d 1007 (1977), Smith, J., speaking for the Court, summarized our many holdings relative to statutory construction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intent. In determining that intent the Court considers the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>language of an enactment in its natural and ordinary signification----A corollary to this rule is that if there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of a statute, there is usually no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly.... Where two statutes deal with the same subject matter ..., they must be construed together if they are not inconsistent with one another. Thus, to the extent possible, full effect should be given to each.... This is true notwithstanding the fact that the statutes may have been enacted at different times with no reference to each other, because in that case the rule is that statutes must be harmonized to the extent possible.... <em>[Id. </em>at 418-419 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">We find no ambiguity or obscurity within the confines of the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law with respect to the interest which may be charged on a secondary mortgage loan of regarding the prohibition against charging in excess of that permitted. As we have indicated, the law unequivocally declares that \u201c[t]he total amount of interest may not exceed the amount that would accrue throughout the term of the loan if charged at the rate of 12 percent per annum on the unpaid principal balances outstanding from time to time.\u201d \u00a7 12-404 (b). It flatly forbids a lender from charging <em>any interest </em>in excess of that amount. \u00a7 12-411. It baldly proscribes the making of <em>any secondary mortgage </em>loan except within the terms and conditions authorized by it. \u00a7 12-412. In the face of this clear language we need look no further to ascertain the legislative intent. The Legislature certainly intended that the terms and conditions of the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law apply to any loan which is made by a lender as defined by the law and which is within the meaning of a secondary mortgage loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Beneficial does not suggest that there is any ambiguity within the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law. The ambiguity perceived by it is disharmony between the provisions of that law and the permissive language of \u00a7 12-306: \u201cA lender may charge interest on a loan at a rate not exceeding... 18 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>simple interest per annum.\u201d Disharmony exists only if this section is read as an overriding blanket permission to charge such a rate in all circumstances. In the face of the clear prohibitions of the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law, however, \u00a7 12-306 may not be so broadly read.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">We think that the loan to the Schmidts was controlled by the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law, and interest charged thereon was legally limited to 12% per annum, as provided in \u00a7 12-404. This view gives the greatest possible effect to both the Consumer Loan Law and the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law. An indebtedness meeting the criteria of the Consumer Loan Law is ordinarily governed by that law, but not when the lender secures it by a secondary mortgage as defined by the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Although the main thrust of Beneficial\u2019s argument is directed to the implied exception to the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law which it reads into the statute, it looks also to 59 Opinions of the Attorney General 483 (1974), in which it was concluded that a mortgage on real property could be taken as security for a consumer loan of $2,000 or more at an interest rate of 18% without violating either the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law or statutory provisions regarding interest rates permitted on first mortgages, Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol., 1974 Cum. Supp.) Art. 49, \u00a7 13 (a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Attorney General relied on the law relating to first mortgages and did not affirmatively attempt to reconcile his position with the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law. He also sought support in <em>Finance </em>Company, <em>Inc. v. Catterton, </em>161 Md. 650, 158 A. 16 (1932). That case concerned whether the Uniform Small Loan Law applied to loans secured by the pledge of real property. Our predecessors held that it did, but on the rationale that the Legislature, in repealing a limitation that small loans could only be secured by chattel mortgages or bills of sale, thereby permitted the law regarding small loans to apply to such loans on real estate, personal property, or both. <em>Catterton </em>deals with a different statutory relationship than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the one before us; it is not factually or legally apposite.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Beneficial argues that the Attorney General\u2019s opinion is a contemporaneous construction of the Consumer Loan Law which should not be disregarded except on the most imperative ground. The imperative ground here is that we do not agree with the conclusion reached by the Attorney General. We are not bound by an opinion of the Attorney General, and we do not find his opinion here to be persuasive. <em>Drug &amp; Chem. Co. v. Claypoole, </em>165 Md. 250, 257, 166 A. 742 (1933). The rule of contemporaneous construction does not preclude inquiry by the courts into the correctness of the construction. <em>Bouse v. Hutzler, </em>180 Md. 682, 687, 26 A. 2d 767 (1942). And, in any event, the rule of contemporaneous construction comes into play only when there is a statutory ambiguity. <em>Falcone v. Palmer Ford, </em>242 Md. 487, 494, 219 A. 2d 808 (1966). <em>See Hunt v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 403, 414-415, 237 A. 2d 35 (1968). We have found no ambiguity here.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Beneficial suggests that it is exempt from the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law under \u00a7 41 of Art. 66. Its notion is that as it is one of the institutions excepted from the prohibition against making secondary mortgage loans, it may, therefore, make such loans without conformance with the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law. Section 41, however, deals only with licensing, and altho\u00fagh Beneficial may make such loans without first obtaining a license thereunder, when it does, it is bound by the provisions of \u00a7 12-412 forbidding a lender to make any secondary mortgage loan except within the terms and conditions authorized by the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Consumer loans are under the supervision of the Commissioner of Consumer Credit. \u00a7 12-301 (b); Art. 11, \u00a7 163 <em>et seq. </em>Secondary Mortgage Loans are under the supervision of the Bank Commissioner. \u00a7 12-401 (b); Art. 66, \u00a7 39 <em>et seq. </em>Beneficial opines that this \u201cleads to an absurd result\u201d because \u201cConsumer Loan Licensees who take secondary mortgages in connection with consumer loans are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>thereby required to make such loans in conformity with regulations promulgated by the Banking Commissioner.\u201d It refers to the loan statement from a lender to a borrower required, as to consumer loans by \u00a7 12-308, and, as to secondary mortgage loans by regulation .09, ch. 02, subtitle 03, title 09, Code of Maryland Regulations. It declares: \"Such regulations [of the Banking Commissioner with respect to secondary mortgage loans] clearly conflict with the provisions of the Consumer Loan Law, and infringe upon the authority of the Commissioner of Consumer Credit to regulate Consumer Loan Licensees.\u201d Beneficial thinks that it is \u201cinconceivable that the legislature could have intended such a collision of regulatory authority without expressly providing a resolution for the conflict.\u201d If there be a conflict, the resolution is obvious \u2014 when a secondary mortgage loan is made, the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law and regulations promulgated thereunder prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The short of it is that the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law deals specifically with second mortgages of a carefully defined nature in such a way that there is a clear and manifest intent to limit the Consumer Loan Law with respect to them. <em>See City of Baltimore v. </em>Clerk, 270 Md. 316, 319, 311 A. 2d 261 (1973). Simply stated, if a loan within the meaning of a secondary mortgage loan under the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law is made by a lender as defined by that law, the loan is subject to the provisions of the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law. This is so even though the loan might fit into the category of loans which may be made under the Consumer Loan Law and even though the lender also might fall within the meaning of a lender or is a licensee under that law. This is the clear import of the simple, direct, plain and unambiguous language of the Secondary Mortgage Loan Law, leaving no doubt of the legislative intent and purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u201c[WJhen we consider the propriety of an order sustaining a demurrer to a bill of complaint without leave to amend, we are required to assume, for the purposes of the ruling, the truth of all material and relevant facts that are well pleaded as well as all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from those well pleaded facts.\u201d <em>Schwartz v. Merchants Mort. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>272 Md. 305, 307-308, 322 A. 2d 544 (1974). The \u201cBill of Complaint\u201d here alleged that the Schmidts and other known and unknown parties have borrowed money from Beneficial secured by means of second mortgages, that Beneficial was not licensed in Maryland to make second mortgages, that it \u201cdid knowingly and willfully charge a rate of interest on said loans that exceeds the amount allowed by law,\u201d and that it \u201chad knowledge of the secondary mortgage law at the time of the securing of said loans.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In light of our discussion, the allegations of the bill were adequate to state a cause of action. The demurrer should have been overruled. <em>See Bio-Ramo v. Abrams, </em>229 Md. 494, 499, 184 A. 2d 831 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Circuit Court for Frederick County reversed; case remanded for further proceedings; costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-12\">.

In addition, a lender who knowingly violates any provision of this subtitle also shall forfeit to the borrower three times the amount of interest and charges collected in excess of that authorized by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">There are criminal penalties for a willful violation. \u00a7 12-414.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\">. The Consumer Loan Law does not, in express language, authorize a lender to take a mortgage on real property to secure the repayment of the loan.

Section 12-312 (a) (1) permits the lender to collect, at the option of the borrower, the premiums paid to insure real property securing a loan. It seems that a lender under the law may take a mortgage on real property to secure a loan in an amount of $2,000 to $3,500 inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">We note that the Schmidts do not suggest that the loan violated any provision of the Consumer Loan Law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">.
