Yol.), Art. 95A, \u00a7 6 (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">In order to afford federal employees protection against some of the risks of unemployment, Congress enacted the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8501, <em>etseq., </em>in 1954. Essentially the Act empowers the Secretary of Labor to enter into agreements with states, under which a particular state\u2019s unemployment compensation law would control the eligibility of federal workers for these benefits. When such an agreement is in force, as is the case in Maryland <em>{see </em>Art. 95A, \u00a7 19 (a)), a discharged government employee simply follows the identical procedures and is subject to the same eligibility criteria as any other claimant for unemployment compensation in the state. The jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>where the worker \u201chad his last official station in Federal service\u201d is ordinarily the state whose unemployment insurance laws govern the claim. Under such an agreement, the state acts as an agent of the United States, and is reimbursed for any expenses incurred in providing benefits to eligible applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Section 6 (h) of Art. 95A requires an offset or reduction in unemployment compensation benefits when an applicant for these benefits is also receiving certain retirement benefits. In order to fall within \u00a7 6 (h) a person must be receiving a pension or annuity paid for in whole or in part from an employer who is a \u201cbase period employer\u201d for purposes of the unemployment compensation claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, only retirement benefits from \u201ca pension or annuity under a private pension plan\u201d result in a reduction of unemployment compensation. Unless both of these conditions are met, there will be no reduction in benefits under \u00a7 6 (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The plaintiff in this case, Gene S. Weimer, retired from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in October .1971, on a civil service pension of approximately $800.00 per month. Two months after retirement, Weimer accepted a position with the Navy Exchange at the Patuxent River Naval Station, located in St. Mary\u2019s County, Maryland. The plaintiff was hired to work as the manager of the Security Department at this facility. Since the Navy Exchange is what is known as a \u201cnon-appropriated fund\u201d instrumentality of the federal government, its employees are excluded from the federal civil service system, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105. As a consequence, Mr. Weimer, a civil service pensioner, could continue to receive' his government pension while drawing a salary from the Navy Exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">In December 1974, as a result of a scale-down in the operations performed at the Navy Exchange, Mr. Weimer\u2019s services were terminated. Upon discharge, he filed a claim for unemployment compensation benefits with the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Employment Security Administration in accordance with the provisions of the Maryland Unemployment Insurance Law, Art. 95A. This application was initially rejected because, according to the claims examiner, Art. 95A, \u00a7 6 (h), required that his civil service pension payments be offset against the unemployment benefits otherwise available. In light of the amount of his retirement payments, the Employment Security Administration found that Mr. Weimer was not eligible for any unemployment compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 7 (e) of the Unemployment Insurance Law, the plaintiff took an appeal to a \u201creferee\u201d who upheld the decision of the claims examiner. A final administrative appeal was taken under \u00a7 7 (f) to the Board of Appeals, which directed that a hearing be held on the matter. At the hearing, Mr. Weimer contended that the pension disqualification provision of \u00a7 6 (h) was inapplicable to his situation on two grounds. He first argued that \u00a7 6 (h) related only to private pension plans and had no bearing upon government retirement benefits. The plaintiff went on to maintain that, in any event, he did not fall within the scope of \u00a7 6 (h) because the Navy Exchange should not be viewed as the same employer as the one paying his civil service pension, and therefore he was not receiving retirement payments from a base period employer as required by \u00a7 6 (h). The Board rejected these contentions and upheld the denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Upon the plaintiff\u2019s action for judicial review in accordance with Art. 95A, \u00a7 7 (h), the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County reversed the administrative decision. The court, after first pointing out that \u00a7 6 (h) directed the offset of pension payments from unemployment benefits only where the pension was \u201cpaid for in whole or in part by a base period employer,\u201d determined that the plaintiffs employment positions with the F.B.I. and the Navy Exchange were \u201cseparate, distinct and unrelated.\u201d The court concluded that the plaintiff \u201cdid not receive pension benefits that were paid for by his base period employer,\u201d and it ordered the award of unemployment benefits. Because the circuit court rested its decision on the ground that the pension was not paid for by a base period employer, it did not have to deal with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>other condition for \u00a7 6 (h) to be applicable, namely that the retirement payments constitute \u201ca pension or annuity under a private pension plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The Employment Security Administration took an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and, before any proceedings in that court, we issued a writ of certiorari. The Administration argues both, as it must in order to prevail, (1) that the civil service retirement benefits were paid for in whole or part by a base period employer, and (2) that these retirement benefits constituted a \u201cpension or annuity under a private pension plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In our view, the plaintiffs civil service pension does not amount to a \u201cpension or annuity under a private pension plan,\u201d and therefore this condition for the applicability of the \u00a7 6 (h) offset was not met. We shall affirm the judgment below on this ground, and thus we need not consider the question of whether the pension was paid for in whole or part by a \u201cbase period employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The pertinent language of \u00a7 6 (h) provides for the reduction in unemployment compensation where a claimant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">\u201cis receiving or has received an amount equal to or in excess of his weekly [unemployment] benefit amount in the form of a <em>pension or annuity under a private pension plan </em>paid for in whole or in part by a base period employer.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The Employment Security Administration\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs federal civil service retirement payments are covered by the italicized language is as follows. First, the Administration invokes the principle of statutory construction \u201cthat a qualifying clause ordinarily is confined to the immediately preceding words or phrase,\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Dixon, </em>280 Md. 444, 451, 373 A. 2d 1245 (1977), and authorities there cited. Based on this, the Administration asserts that the qualifying clause \u201cunder a private pension plan\u201d modifies only \u201cannuity\u201d and not \u201cpension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">The Administration next contends that \u201cpension\u201d and \u201cannuity\u201d have different meanings, and it quotes the definitions set forth in Code (1957, 1978 Repl. Yol.), Art. 73B, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 1 (16) and 1 (17), relating to the various retirement systems for Maryland public employees, as \u201cwell established\u201d definitions of the terms. Those sections state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\">\u201c(16) <em>\u2018Annuity </em>shall mean payments for life derived from the accumulated contributions of a member. All annuities shall be payable in equal monthly installments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">\u201c(17) <em>\u2018Pension\u2019 </em>shall mean payments for life derived from money provided by the State. All pensions shall be payable in equal monthly installments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">However, the Employment Security Administration does seem to acknowledge that there is some ambiguity associated with the meanings of the two words, that the meanings may vary depending on the context, and that the word \u201cpension\u201d may be used with respect to private employment as well as public.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Nevertheless, the Administration asserts that it is not <em>who </em>pays the retirement benefits <em>(i.e., </em>government or private) which distinguishes a pension from an annuity, but \u201cit is the [monetary] source from which the retirement payments are derived rather than the type of employer which is critical.\u201d Consequently, the Administration argues, it is only a public \u201cannuity\u201d as defined in Art. 73B, \u00a7 1 (16), which is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>encompassed by the offset provision of \u00a7 6 (h) of the Unemployment Compensation Law. According to the Administration, all pensions, whether governmental or private, and private annuities, must be applied to reduce unemployment benefits. Since, as the Employment Security Administration concludes, the plaintiffs retirement payments constitute a \u201cpension\u201d rather than an \u201cannuity,\u201d the payments must be applied to reduce unemployment compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The construction of \u00a7 6 (h) advanced by the Employment Security Administration is, in our opinion, untenable in light of the language of the statute. It is true that in construing statutes, \u201ca qualifying clause <em>ordinarily </em>is confined to the immediately preceding words or phrase,\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Dixon, supra, </em>280 Md. at 451 (emphasis added). But, as the quoted language from the <em>Sullivan </em>case makes clear, this is not an absolute rule. As explained by Sutherland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">\u201cThe rule is but another aid to discovery of intent or meaning, however, and not an inflexible and uniformly binding rule. Where the sense of the entire act requires that a qualifying word or phrase apply to several preceding or even succeeding sections, the word or phrase will not be restricted to its immediate antecedent.\u201d 2A J. Sutherland, <em>Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47.33 (4th ed. C. Sands 1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\"><em>See also, e.g., United States v. </em>Babbit, 66 U. S. (1 Black) 55, 61, 17 L. Ed. 94 (1862); <em>United States v. Brandenburg, </em>144 F. 2d 656, 660-661, (3d Cir. 1944); <em>Selectmen of Topsfield v. State Racing Commission, </em>324 Mass. 309, 86 N.E.2d 65, 68-69 (1949); <em>Johnson v. Craddock, </em>228 Ore. 308, 365 P. 2d 89, 93-94 (1961). With regard to \u00a7 6 (h), the sense of the entire section makes it clear that the Legislature was not distinguishing \u201cpension\u201d from \u201cannuity\u201d based upon the source of payment, with the \u201cprivate\u201d clause qualifying only an \u201cannuity\u201d as so defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">To reiterate, the critical language of \u00a7 6 (h) is \u201cpension or annuity under a private <em>pension </em>plan\u201d (emphasis added). If the Legislature intended \u201cpension\u201d to mean retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>payments with the monetary source being the employer\u2019s funds, and to distinguish this from \u201cannuity\u201d meaning retirement payments derived from the employee\u2019s contributions, and further intended the qualifying clause to modify just \u201cannuity,\u201d it is inconceivable that it would have used the word \u201cpension\u201d again in the qualifying clause. It may have said pension or annuity \u201cunder a private <em>retirement\u201d </em>plan or \u201cunder a private <em>annuity </em>plan\u201d or merely \u201cunder a private plan.\u201d But if the Legislature were deliberately distinguishing between \u201cpension\u201d and \u201cannuity,\u201d with the qualifying clause relating only to the latter, the word \u201cpension\u201d would not likely have been repeated in the qualifying clause. The context suggests that the Legislature was not concerned in \u00a7 6 (h) with differentiating between a pension and an annuity; rather, it was using the words \u201cpension or annuity\u201d as a single phrase to mean \u201cretirement payments,\u201d with the qualifying clause modifying the entire phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Other language in Art. 95A, \u00a7 6 (h), confirms that the Legislature was not using \u201cannuity\u201d to mean payments derived solely from the employee\u2019s contributions, and \u201cpension\u201d to mean payments derived solely from the employer\u2019s contributions, which are the definitions set forth in Art. 73B. After the qualifying clause concerning a private pension plan, \u00a7 6 (h) goes on to say \u201cpaid for in whole or in part by a base period employer, as provided below....\u201d Obviously, the Legislature was not in \u00a7 6 (h) dealing with an \u201cannuity\u201d as defined in Art. 73B, <em>i.e., </em>one based entirely on the contributions of the employee. Instead, \u00a7 6 (h) is limited in its operation to retirement plans paid for in whole or part by the employer. If \u201cannuity\u201d means what the Employment Security Administration urges, and if the qualifying clause modifies only \u201cannuity\u201d as further contended for, then the entire phrase \u201cannuity under a private pension plan\u201d would be superfluous or meaningless. Such a construction would violate the well-settled principles that all parts of a statute are to be given effect and harmonized if possible, and that a statute should not be construed so as to render any language surplusage or meaningless. <em>Condominium Owners v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Supervisor, </em>283 Md. 29, 32, 388 A. 2d 116 (1978); <em>Schweitzer v. Brewer, </em>280 Md. 430, 438, 374 A. 2d 347 (1977); <em>Supervisor v. Southgate Harbor, </em>279 Md. 586, 590, 369 A. 2d 1053 (1977); <em>Blumenthal v. Clerk of Cir.

Co., </em>275 Md. 454, 457, 341 A. 2d 417 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Moreover, nothing in the normal or commonly understood definition of the word \u201cannuity\u201d compels the interpretation asserted by the Employment Security Administration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the word is sometimes defined as payments at stated intervals derived from contributions or premiums paid by the recipients,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it also sometimes is used to refer to periodic payments without regard to the source.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, courts have recognized that the word \u201cannuity\u201d is often used in statutes as synonymous with the word \u201cpension.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Holmes v. Cook, </em>45 Ala. App. 688, 236 So. 2d 352, 355 (1970); <em>Dodge v. Board of Education, </em>364 Ill. 547, 5 N.E.2d 84, 88 (1936), <em>aff'd, </em>302 U. S. 74, 81, 58 S. Ct. 98, 82 L. Ed. 57 (1937); <em>State ex rel. Wander v. Kimmel, </em>256 Mo. 611, 165 S. W. 1067, 1072 (1914); <em>Aetna Fire Ins. Co. v. Jones, </em>78 S.C. 445, 59 S. E. 148, 152 (1907); <em>City of Dallas v. Trammell, </em>129 Tex. 150, 101 S.W.2d 1009, 1015, 112 A.L.R. 997 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In light of the entire language of Art. 9 5A, \u00a7 6 (h), it would make little sense to conclude that the Legislature intended, for purposes of that statute, to distinguish between \u201cpension\u201d and \u201cannuity\u201d based upon the monetary source of the retirement payments. Instead, it is obvious that the Legislature was using the phrase \u201cpension or annuity\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>refer generally to retirement payments, with the qualifying clause \u201cunder a private pension plan\u201d modifying the entire phrase. Since the plaintiff\u2019s monthly retirement payments were not \u201cunder a private pension plan,\u201d \u00a7 6 (h) is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed. Appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\">. The first four of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the date on which an initial claim for unemployment benefits is made constitute the \u201cbase period.\u201d A \u201cbase period employer\u201d is an employer who pays base period wages for insured work to the claimant. <em>See </em>Art. 95A, \u00a7 20 (a); COMAR 07.04.02.12B(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\">. Some older cases discussing the meaning of the word \u201cpension\u201d seem to limit it to payments made by a governmental or public body. Frisbie v. United States, 157 U. S. 160, 166, 15 S. Ct. 586, 39 L. Ed. 657 (1895); United States v. Teller, 107 U. S. 64, 68, 2 S. Ct. 39, 27 L. Ed. 352 (1883); Walton v. Cotton, 60 U. S. (19 How.) 355, 358, 15 L. Ed. 658 (1857). <em>See also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, p. 1291 (rev. 4th ed. 1968). However, the modern commonly understood meaning of the word \u201cpension,\u201d insofar as it relates to retirement payments, is defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language, pp. 1811-1812 (2d ed. unabridged, 1961) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">\u201c ... 3.
