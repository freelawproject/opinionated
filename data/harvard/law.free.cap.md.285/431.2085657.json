The cause of death was \u201cpjncised wounds of the neck and chest.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The manner of death was homicide. Jeannie Yvonne Crawford, also known as Jeannie Yvonne Purnell,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was charged with the homicide. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>She was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. She appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and we ordered the issuance of a writ of certiorari on our own motion before decision by that court. The issue for decision is whether the trial court erred in admitting into evidence certain portions of taped recordings of interrogations of the accused by the police. We find that the admission was erroneous, reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The police conducted two custodial interrogations of the accused. The first was shortly after her arrest on the morning the crime was committed and lasted two hours. The second, two days later, continued for about an hour and a half. The interrogations were recorded on tape, and transcriptions were made of the recordings. The accused has never claimed that the statements she made during the interrogations were involuntary in the traditional sense or obtained in violation of the dictates of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966); at the trial she expressly waived any objection on those grounds. She filed a pretrial motion to suppress this evidence, however, which the court denied upon hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">From the moment of her arrest the accused readily admitted that she had stabbed the victim, but she maintained throughout that she had acted in self-defense. She was steadfast in her adherence to that position during the interrogations, and throughout the questioning the police attempted to have her recant her version of the incident by indicating their disbelief in her story, by exhorting her to tell the truth and arguing with her, by recounting what other persons, some named, some unnamed, had told them, by stating their opinions as to what had occurred, and by referring to what the victim had said when deposed five months before her death in a civil proceeding regarding custody of the accused\u2019s daughter Renee. At the hearing on the motion and during the trial when the challenged evidence was offered, defense counsel made clear that there was no objection to the statements made by the accused. What he wanted kept from the jury was the comments of the police: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u201cI think the record should show I have no objection to the answers she gave. I have objections to the testimony, or the alleged testimony of the officers [included in the recordings].\u201d And later he told the court: \u201cLet me just explain myself. I say \u2014 I have no objection to the statements she made. What I object to is the statement that the cops make, not only in this area [how the victim\u2019s throat was cut] but all through later on. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s their statements, not hers. The question is, should her statements be admitted? The answer is yes, everything that she said.\u201d In that context, defense counsel presented the bases for the motion to suppress. The first was that replete throughout the recordings were statements by the police which, if admitted, would deny the accused her constitutional right to be confronted by her accusers. The transcript of the hearing reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">THE COURT: Well, that is a stupid argument. Confrontation means the witnesses on the witness stand. And how confrontation and the right thereto can be involved in this motion is beyond me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">MR. [R. CLARK] KINSLEY [defense counsel]: Do you want to hear my reasons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">THE COURT: No. Next reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">MR. KINSLEY: The statements \u2014 I would, of course, like to expand upon it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">THE COURT: No. You have made the point for the record. You say that your right of confrontation has been infringed upon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">MR. KINSLEY: I think the record should also show that Your Honor is pushing this case too rapidly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">THE COURT: Mr. Kinsley, I will run this court. You have made your objection on the record. I have declined to permit you to expand on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-13\">Would you please state your next basis for objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">The next basis for objection was that the recordings contained \u201copinions of the State Police not based on fact, but opinions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>and that this type of evidence should not be presented to the jury, opinions of police officers.\u201d The court set out the procedure it thought would solve this problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">The jury will be instructed that statements made by way of questions are not evidence and are not to be considered. That is akin to the same type of questioning that occurs every day in a trial court. The jury is instructed they don\u2019t pay any attention to the question, it\u2019s the answer that they get. And this Court will instruct the jury on all occasions, perhaps even before that piece of evidence is offered, that they are not to consider anything within the content of a question or a statement made, they are merely to consider the answer given by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">All right. You have made your point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Defense counsel was not satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">MR. KINSLEY: But the statement refers to people that the police have talked to, not identifying who they are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">MR. KINSLEY: And saying what they found out, or allegedly found out, from those people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\">MR. KINSLEY: It also contains a reference to a custody proceeding and refers to alleged happenings at the custody proceeding, such as knife throwing, which is a very vital factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-14\">THE COURT: It may be. It may well be that as the testimony is offered, that there might be portions thereof that are irrelevant, and as the questions are offered to the jury, appropriate objections can be made at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-15\">MR. KINSLEY: If the Court please, throughout this, questions are repeatedly asked, and they don\u2019t even wait for an answer, so all we have coming before the jury is \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>THE COURT: If a question is unanswered, it will be stricken out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">MR. KINSLEY: But if they play a tape \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">THE COURT: They have not yet offered a tape. They may offer a printed transcript of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">MR. KINSLEY: Then I would ask that the tape be suppressed and only the written transcript be used, so that the Court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">THE COURT: I may suggest that that might be the appropriate way to handle the evidentiary problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">MR. [MARK] KOLMAN [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Your Honor, the State had intended to offer both for purposes of clarity to the jury. I think it\u2019s important in the situation, considering the type of case we have got, that the jury actually hear the defendant\u2019s words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-11\">MR. KINSLEY: They will be ringing a bell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-12\">THE COURT: Well, it may well be, but that problem can be taken up when we come to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-13\">Okay. Next objection, Mr. Kinsley.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">The next objection to the receipt of the recordings was that they contain \u201crepeated argument, not opinions, not evidence, not testimony, nothing but pure argument on the part of the troopers, arguing with the defendant, not questions, not answers, but just pure argument.\u201d The court merely said: \u201cAll right. I understand the objection. Next.\u201d Defense counsel asked that the recordings be suppressed \u201cfor those reasons.\u201d The motion to suppress was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">After discussion of other procedural matters, defense counsel returned to the matter of the tapes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-16\">MR. KINSLEY: Now, if the Court please, I would like to know how we should proceed in the introduction of the statement, questions and answers by the State Police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-17\">THE COURT: Well, we\u2019ll wait until we get to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>point. We\u2019re going to swear a jury in. That\u2019s all that\u2019s necessary. That\u2019s what you do, number one. Then you make your opening statement to the jury. That\u2019s number two. Then the State proceeds to call witnesses. That\u2019s number three. And we\u2019ll try this case just like any other. When the State offers testimony, you object to it, and we\u2019ll take it up when we come to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The jury was sworn and trial proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">There came a point in the trial when the State offered the tapes and a transcript of them. Defense counsel\u2019s objection was summarily overruled and the tapes and transcript were received in evidence. The prosecutor asked that \u201cthe jurors be allowed to view the copy of the transcript so that they may follow along with the tape, as it\u2019s played.\u201d The court said: \u201cIt certainly is preferable, because I never have seen or heard a tape yet that didn\u2019t have some static to it or difficulty.\u201d Defense counsel reminded the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">But, now, if the Court please, you know, I earlier raised this objection,' and you agreed that there\u2019s a possibility that some of the testimony, some of the questions, some of the statements of the police is purely objectionable, and you would rule it out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The court replied: \u201cWhen that time comes, I will instruct the jury to disregard it. I will follow the tapes, as well.\u201d This did not console the defense: \u201cIt would seem to me,\u201d observed Mr. Kinsley, \u201cthat it would be more appropriate if they didn\u2019t understand and the State\u2019s Attorney could read from the transcript, or the officer could.... But if they\u2019re going to read what is objectionable, then the bell has already rung.\u201d The court responded: \u201cThis is the expedient way to do it, and I think it\u2019s proper, and the Court will, as I say, as the expression goes, ride herd on it.\u201d At this point, defense counsel pointed out that his objection did not run to the answers the accused gave but to the comments of the officers. The court gave assurance that \u201c[tjhere will not be any testimony given by officers. The only thing that the jury would consider would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>be the answers to the questions by the defendant.\u201d Defense counsel persisted: \u201c[I]f the Court please, could you instruct the jury that if the officer says, we heard such and such from somebody, that is hearsay?\u201d The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">That is not evidence. The question that somebody asks is not a fact, it\u2019s the answer that you are concerned with. The jury should, of course, if during this rather lengthy questioning \u2014 it\u2019s about thirty-eight pages \u2014 if an officer says, now, this is such and such and such and such, is that not true, you listen to the answer. Just because the officer asks the question doesn\u2019t make it true. It\u2019s just like a lawyer in open court. He says, now, did this and that and the other thing happen? That\u2019s not evidence. It\u2019s the answer, yes or no. I think the jury can keep it all straight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">It is manifest that at this stage of the proceedings, defense counsel was thoroughly familiar with the contents of the recordings and that the prosecution in all probability was aware of what they contained. It seems, however, that the trial court had not listened to the tapes nor read the transcripts of them, and knew no more of their contents than could be generally gleaned from the discussions of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Each juror was given a transcript of the recordings, and the playing of the tapes to the jury was begun. The playing had proceeded only to the point at which the police were giving the <em>Miranda </em>warnings when defense counsel interrupted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">MR. KINSLEY: If the Court please, can we interrupt just for a minute? I think I have the right to interrupt. I think if the jury has the printed transcript \u2014 and I have no quarrel with it being an accurate transcript \u2014 then I see no reason for having the machine played. I think the trooper should be asked questions, and I think I should be given an opportunity to object to stuff that is extremely extraneous and damaging. It\u2019s what they think is the case. It\u2019s an opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>THE COURT: We\u2019ve gone into that. The witness is not testifying now, he\u2019s merely reciting what took place out of court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">MR. KINSLEY: It\u2019s pure theatrics on the part of this gentleman. He\u2019s trying to play Cecil B. DeMille, putting on this thing. It\u2019s theatrics. If this is the testimony, we have no objection. Why don\u2019t we let him read it and let me object to the questions as they come in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">THE COURT: You just don\u2019t have your proper time frame. This is not question and answers here in court, this is questioning and answers back on May 9th, an extra-judicial proceeding. Now, the thing either comes in or it doesn\u2019t come in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">All right. The expedient point is that if the jury is going to follow this and read it, Mr. Kolman, they can\u2019t possibly listen and understand, because if you want to understand that tape, you\u2019re going to have to listen and concentrate on that tape. You can\u2019t be reading it at the same time, I don\u2019t think. But let\u2019s try it. You can proceed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The playing of the tape resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">In order to get the full flavor of the proceedings, we set out various objections which were made and the dispositions of them in some detail. The accused was recounting how the victim was cut: \u201cIt happened on the bed and we tusseled and we landed on the floor.\u201d The interrogating officer said: \u201cJeannie, I don\u2019t buy it, how did her throat get cut?\u201d Defense counsel asked that the officer\u2019s comment that he \u201cdidn\u2019t buy it\u201d be stricken as \u201cargumentative... [i]t\u2019s opinion.\u201d The court did not agree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">We\u2019re not talking about the opinion of that statement, we\u2019re just giving the jury the whole picture of how this question took place, whether the trooper believed her or not is beside the point. It\u2019s what this jury believes the answers mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">Now, we\u2019ve gone into that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Trial counsel did not give up. He again pointed out that he was not objecting to the statements made by the accused but to those made by the police. The court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Later on the officer said to the accused: \u201cMs. Crawford it is very improbable that she received all those wounds and you didn\u2019t receive any \u2014\u201d Defense counsel objected and was overruled with this comment by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">The jury has been told three or four times not to pay any attention to the content of a question, except insofar as it provokes an answer. The matter is for the jury to decide and not the interrogating officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Defense counsel pointed out that \u201cit\u2019s not a question,\" and was again overruled with direction for the State to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Further into the interrogation the officer expressed doubt as to how the victim got on the floor, suggesting that she was rolled off the bed by the accused when she took the bed linens off. He said: \u201cNow we can tell by the injuries received on her ____We can tell exactly where she was laying and how she was laying.\u201d Defense counsel objected: \u201cIt\u2019s not a question, it\u2019s a statement by the officer.\u201d The court: \u201cGo on. Objection overruled.\u201d The accused said that \u201c[m]ost of the stabbing took place on the bed because that\u2019s where we were fighting that\u2019s where she knocked me down \u2014\u201d The officer interposed: \u201cBut she had one clear, clean cut around her throat, not a bunch of slashes that you are describing that took place in this fight.\u201d Defense counsel: \u201cObjection. It\u2019s not a question, it\u2019s an opinion of the trooper.\u201d The court: \u201cIt has to be listened to in the context of the answer. The opinion of the trooper means nothing whatever. It\u2019s up to the jury to evaluate all this testimony. Now let\u2019s proceed. Objection overruled.\u201d Inquiry about how the victim's throat was cut continued. The interrogator opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-11\">It\u2019s not the kind of <em>a </em>wound one would receive from a struggle, it appears to be one clean cut. Now, if it happened other than that let\u2019s get it all cleared up.now. I think there is a little bit more to it and admittedly you said you were frightened, you were scared. Miss Crawford, if you were protecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>yourself and then got carried away tell us so that we know exactly how it happened because the way you are describing it doesn\u2019t match up with the way it happened and she is down at the morgue now and we will have the results in a little while, other injuries and whether she fell on that floor after she was dead or before.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Again objection was made on the ground that it was not a question and again the objection was summarily overruled. As the interrogation continued the officer said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">I\u2019m sure you are frightened, you have nothing to be frightened of with us, we want to find out exactly what happened, now every time we keep on talking we find out that you are not telling the truth about something else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Objection was overruled. At another time the tapes reflected the officer\u2019s disbelief with what the accused was saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">But we are going to learn certain things from the autopsy and from what\u2019s found at the scene, the blood on the bed, the blood on the bedsheets, we gonna learn from the blood on the body whether she died on the bed or on the floor, we\u2019re gonna learn that, ok.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Defense counsel\u2019s objection was overruled and his request that it be stricken was denied. There was objection overruled to the officer\u2019s declaration: \u201cMs. Crawford I don\u2019t believe her throat was cut while she had the knife in her hand, it would have been turned around the other way.\u201d Further into the playing of the tape defense counsel again indicated his dissatisfaction with the procedure being followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">MR. KINSLEY: Your Honor, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-12\">THE COURT: Hold on a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-13\">MR. KINSLEY: You have \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-14\">THE COURT: Hold on a minute. Do you have an objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>MR. KINSLEY: I\u2019d like to explain what I have in mind. There\u2019s two troopers firing questions \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">MR. KOLMAN: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object, unless he has an objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">MR. KINSLEY: \u2014 and the statements here do not reflect that there\u2019s two different troopers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t think it makes any difference whether there were two troopers or three troopers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">The question\u2019s asked by a trooper and answered by the defendant. The objection will be overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">I agree that good police practice is better to restrict interrogation to one questioner, but they\u2019ll do it every time. They all want to get in the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">When the accused told the police that she was afraid during the argument with the victim and that the victim came after her with a knife, the officer made an observation which defense counsel characterized as \u201cthe most objectionable statement. This isn\u2019t a statement by the defendant. This isn\u2019t a question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">The officer said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-12\">When you got the knife \u2014 I think you\u2019re gonna feel better if you get all this off your chest \u2014 I think you really feel bad now, you feel guilty because you got carried away and you had your chance there and your got rid of her \u2014 you just kept doing it \u2014 and you\u2019re going to feel better after you tell somebody about it \u2014 you can\u2019t keep it all bottled up inside you Ms. Crawford \u2014 you can\u2019t keep it all inside you \u2014 you can\u2019t get all up tight in knots.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">The court was not impressed with defense counsel\u2019s objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-14\">The jury understands it\u2019s not a statement of the defendant. They can listen to it and know that it\u2019s not, and they know not to pay any attention to the questions of the interrogator. They don\u2019t constitute any proof of facts. The jury should pay no attention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>to the content of the question, what they consider are the defendant\u2019s answers, alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">Any further objections are overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">When the recording of the second interrogation and the transcript of it was offered and received in evidence, defense counsel made clear that his objections were the same as for the first tape. The court said: \u201cAll right, same objection, same ruling.\u201d The transcript of the proceedings shows further remarks by the court and the defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">THE COURT: Mr. Kinsley\u2019s objections to portions of this tape are based on the fact that during the interrogation the questioner says this is what happened, this is what happened, this is what happened, and I want \u2014 there\u2019s a good example in the first question in this tape of May the 11th, the fact that a questioner asserts something isn\u2019t proof of that fact, at all. You have to judge this tape and these interviews solely in the context of the answer given to the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">MR. KINSLEY: As well as the opinions of the troopers, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">THE COURT: Well, their opinions aren\u2019t evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">Whereupon the tape of the second interrogation was played to the jury. The police gave the accused the <em>Miranda </em>warnings again. Two troopers participated in the questioning that followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-13\">Tpr. Williams:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-14\">Ok, Jeannie, we are going to talk about a few things in this incident, first of all I am going to lay it right on the line to you, ok, tell you just what we know, ok, everything that happened to Lillie happened on that bed, you stabbed her on that bed and cut her throat on that bed and she rolled off that bed. You threatened to kill her at 7:00 o\u2019clock when those two maintenance men were changing the lock, we have signed statements from both of them, they heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>you threaten her, we know you hid the knife under the sheets of the bed, under the pillow of the bed, Renee told us that \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">Jeannie:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">I did what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">Tpr.Williams:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">Hid the knife under the pillow of the bed early in the evening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">Tpr. Gallant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">Jeannie, Renee saw you and Lillie fighting earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar5\">Jeannie:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">I told you \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-12\">Tpr.

The statements that are made by the trooper about whether they have talked to a lot of people or haven\u2019t talked to a lot of people \u2014 that is not proof of whether they did or didn\u2019t. The only thing this tape comes in for is what the defendant said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">Now, let\u2019s go ahead with it. Your objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">During the questioning Trooper Gallant asked the accused about the time she threw a knife at the victim. He remarked: \u201c[W]e\u2019ve got a deposition that Lillie gave to an attorney.\u201d Defense counsel objected and was overruled: \u201cYou have a continuing objection, Mr. Kinsley. You have made your point. Let\u2019s proceed.\u201d The tape continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">concerning the custody of Renee, with you present, where she states you threw a knife at her on one occasion and you didn\u2019t deny it, do you know what I\u2019m talking about?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The accused said that she did not recall.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">The tapes clearly brought out the obvious disbelief of the police in the accused\u2019s version of what happened, a disbelief predicated on what the police had learned from other persons. For example, Trooper Gallant said to her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-13\">Now Jeannie, the medical examiner has given us, we\u2019re talking about the medical examiner, he\u2019s not playing guessing games, man, when he fills out the report that\u2019s it period and he\u2019s gonna come to court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>and testify and he is going to come to court and make you look like a fool____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">Because it couldn\u2019t have, it couldn\u2019t have gone down that way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">And he asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">How is it that everybody else we\u2019ve talked to says it couldn\u2019t have gone down that way, and how is it that the medical examiner\u2019s report, which is physical evidence and not anybody\u2019s opinion, indicates that it couldn\u2019t have gone down that way? And, what about the fact that two individuals heard you threaten to kill Lillie earlier in the evening. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">He observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">When we ask these questions and interview these people we are not throwing things into their heads we say tell us how it is, and they are telling us how it is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">He went back to the deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">I got this morning a 58 page deposition, notarized, with you present, Lillie present and an attorney in Towson present where Lillie goes over these things saying that yes you have a drinking problem, yes, you have thrown things at her, yes, you threw a knife at her and you don\u2019t respond to that, you don\u2019t deny any of these things in that statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">Trooper Williams referred to what he said the accused\u2019s daughter had told the police:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">Ok, Jeannie, why would your daughter Renee tell us that you hid the knife under the pillow and the bed sheet if it were not true, why would your daughter lie on her own mother?----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">Your daughter is as smart as a whip ... and your daughter knows what she sees Jeannie....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">Every time we talk to you Jeannie we get another song, we get another story.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">After further interrogation Trooper Gallant said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">Why don\u2019t you do this, why don\u2019t you just, I mean, you know, as I said we developed all these things that. . . that. . . shoot holes in what you\u2019ve told us completely, now, why don\u2019t you start over again and tell us this time the truth of what happened?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">He referred later on to the medical examiner\u2019s report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">[W]e told you from the outset of this that the medical examiner, according to the medical examiner\u2019s report uh . . . five stab wounds in the back and 18 to 20 in the front and her throat cut does not constitute injuries that would have occurred in a self defense struggle, so forget that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Trooper Williams also asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">Let me ask you one more thing Jeannie, why do you suppose it is that everybody we\u2019ve talked to, all of your and Lillie\u2019s supposedly friends, family, why is it that everybody is lying to us? You tell us that you\u2019re telling the truth, now if you\u2019re telling the truth then everybody that we\u2019ve talked to, and believe me we\u2019ve talked to everybody, is lying. The medical examiner is lying about the autopsy, your daughter is lying about what she saw, this one is lying about the fact that you\u2019re not jealous and that you\u2019re not the aggressor, everybody is lying to us according to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">In the face of the accused\u2019s persistence that she was telling the truth, Trooper Gallant reiterated disbelief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-13\">Jeannie, like I told you before this investigation that we are doing and will continue to do is going to be very detailed and very specific and the wounds, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>autopsy report as I said earlier has shot what you told us full of holes, the medical examiner knows and we know how you cut her throat, whether you did it from the front or the back we know. Now why don\u2019t you just tell us what happened and forget this bit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">And this remark by Trooper Williams led defense counsel to move for a mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">I\u2019ll tell you what your daughter told us, ok, your daughter said she saw Lillie on top of you, take the knife away from you and lay the knife on the chair, your daughter took that knife and hid it in the third drawer of her dresser in her room, Lillie came and asked your daughter where the knife was, your daughter gave it to Lillie and Lillie put it in the dishwasher, you took it out of the dishwasher and hid it under the pillow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The court asked the reason for the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">MR. KINSLEY: This isn\u2019t the defendant testifying, it\u2019s these officers. The proper groundwork \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">THE COURT: If the State brings the witness in \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">MR. KINSLEY: I move for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">THE COURT: Overruled. The jury knows that they don\u2019t gauge a case on what somebody says outside the courtroom, all they get is here. Now, they should pay no attention to what these interrogators said. That is not evidence of any fact. They should merely listen to the answers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">The jury heard the police say that they interviewed people who said that the victim was terrified of the accused, scared of her because she was \u201cso insanely jealous,\u201d that they had proof, \u201cenough proof\u201d of what actually happened, that \u201cno matter how many times you hit us with that story T was in a struggle,\u2019 we know that\u2019s not what happened, we know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The statements of the accused, the admission of which she did not challenge, showed that for about six years she and the victim had lived together in a lesbian relationship with the victim assuming the dominant role. The placidity of the arrangement had come to be disturbed by the victim\u2019s excessive drinking, her use of marihuana and her interest in other women. The credibility of the accused was all important in the determination by the jury of the validity of her claim throughout the interrogations that she killed in self-defense. There is no doubt that the challenged comments of the police which were heard by the jury, whether in the form of questions, assertions of disbelief, opinions (not as expert witnesses), argument, recounting of what others were purported to have said contrary to the version of the accused, hearsay, or otherwise, tended to seriously prejudice the defense. We think that they did so improperly in the circumstances. Defense counsel made abundantly clear, time and time again, that he objected to the procedure under which the challenged matters went before the jury and to the substance of those matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The general rule, well settled in Maryland, is that \u201cthe trial judge has a wide discretion in the conduct of a trial and that the exercise of discretion will not be disturbed unless it has been clearly abused.\u201d <em>Bartholomey v. State, </em>260 Md. 504, 530, 273 A. 2d 164 (1971). <em>See Plank v. Summers, </em>203 Md. 552, 554-555, 102 A. 2d 262 (1954). The principle that the overall direction of the trial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge encompasses the admission of evidence. <em>Boblits v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 391, 400, 256 A. 2d 187 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>256 Md. 743 (1970); <em>Tomolillo v. State, 4 </em>Md. App. 711, 716, 245 A. 2d 94 (1968); <em>Koprivich v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 147, 153, 228 A. 2d 476 (1967). <em>Cf. Nizer v. Phelps, </em>252 Md. 185, 198, 249 A. 2d 112 (1969); <em>Sanner v. Guard, </em>236 Md. 271, 277, 203 A. 2d 885 (1964). But even though a trial judge, as the judge here early in the trial declared, \u201cruns the court,\u201d the right of an accused to a fair trial, although not a perfect trial, is paramount. <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U. S. 123, 135, 88 S. Ct. 1620 (1968); <em>Lutwak v. United States, </em>344 U. S. 604, 619, 73 S. Ct. 481 (1953). \u201cA fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>requirement of due process [guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal constitution.1\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>In re </em>Murchison, 349 U.

But our system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the <em>probability </em>of unfairness. <em>\\Id. </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The Court said in <em>Tumey v. Ohio, </em>273 U. S. 510, 532, 47 S. Ct. 437 (1927): \u201cEvery procedure which would offer a possible temptation to the average man... not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused denies the latter due process of law.\u201d \u201c[Tol perform its high function in the best way \u2018justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murchison </em>at 136, quoting <em>Offutt v.

Ct. 1628 (1965).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">The aim of the requirement of due process is not to exclude presumptively false evidence, but to prevent fundamental unfairness in the use of evidence whether true or false----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">As applied to a criminal trial, denial of due process is the failure to observe that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice. In order to declare a denial of it we must find that the absence of that fairness fatally infected the trial; the acts complained of must be of such quality as necessarily prevent a fair trial. . . . <em>[Lisenba v. </em>California, 314 U. S. 219, 236, 62 S. Ct. 280 (1941).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-9\"><em>See Blackburn v. Alabama, </em>361 U. S. 199, 206, 80 S. Ct. 274 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>In the particular circumstances of this case, we believe that the placing before the jury of the challenged portions of the interrogations did not meet the \u201ccivilized standards for a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>Madison v. State, </em>205 Md. 425, 434, 109 A. 2d 96 (1954). To permit the jury to hear them failed to observe that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice and was \u201cinconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure,\u201d <em>see United States v. Timmreck, </em>441 U. S. 780, 784, 99 S. Ct. 2085 (1979), as related \"to the overall fairness of the trial considered in its entirety,\u201d <em>see Kentucky v. Whorton, </em>441 U. S. 786, 788, 99 S. Ct. 2088 (1979). We find that the absence of that fairness fatally infected the trial. Therefore, the accused was deprived of her liberty without due process of law and is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">It is plain that in light of the trial judge\u2019s comments in consistently overruling defense counsel\u2019s persistent and emphatic objections to the challenged portions of the interrogations that he accepted that they were not properly to be considered by the jury and that the putting of them to the jury was in actuality erroneous. It is equally clear, however, that he believed that his cautions to the effect that the jury were \u201cnot to pay any attention to the context of a question, except insofar as it provokes an answer,\u201d satisfied him that the jury would not \u201cpay any attention to the questions of the interrogator\u201d and thus cured the error. The State follows this notion on appeal, urging that \u201cany error was cured by the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Our predecessors stated the rule regarding an instruction for the jury to disregard certain matters in <em>Nelson v. Seiler, </em>154 Md. 63, 72, 139 A. 564, 567 (1927):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">Generally, the choice of measures to protect the fair, unprejudiced, working of its proceedings is left to the discretion of the trial court, and only in exceptional cases will its choice be reviewed in this court. In the greater number of instances the injection into a trial of matter other than that involved in the issue to be decided is cured by withdrawal of it and an instruction to the jury to disregard it, but there may, of course, be instances in which it would not be cured in this way, and terminating the trial and taking the case up afresh before another jury would be the only adequate means of correction. Those instances are exceptional, but they do arise, [citing cases.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In <em>Lusby v. State, </em>217 Md. 191, 141 A. 2d 893 (1958) there was placed before the jury that lie detector tests had been made and were favorable to the state\u2019s case. Prescott, J. dissented to the majority's affirmance of the judgment because he thought that an instruction to the jury to disregard this information was ineffective. He stated his view vividly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">Theoretically it may be said that the defendant was not denied a fair and impartial trial, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>court instructed the jury to disregard the objectionable evidence; but the Courts should exercise at least a reasonable amount of practicality in the rendition of their judgments. In a situation of the kind we have in the instant case, can it be said that the court\u2019s admonition to the jury to disregard the references to the fact that lie detector tests had been made was effective in erasing the impression made upon the minds of the jury by the state\u2019s attorney that such tests had been made and the results were favorable to the state\u2019s case? Empirically speaking, it was about as effective as informing a three year old child, who has just received a handful of lollypops from a large, jolly, rotund, white-whiskered man dressed in red as he alighted from a sleigh drawn by eight reindeer, that there was no such personage as Santa Claus. <em>[Id </em>at 207, Prescott, J. dissenting.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\"><em>See Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U. S. at 129-130; <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U. S. 368, 388, n. 15, 84 S. Ct. 1774 (1964); <em>Delli Paoli v. United States, </em>352 U. S. 232, 247-248, 77 S.

Ct. 716 (1949) (Jackson, J. concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The case before us furnishes one of the exceptional instances in which a caution to disregard is not sufficient to cure the error in placing improper matters before the jury. It is a classic illustration of an instance in which such error can be adequately cured only by terminating the trial and taking the case up afresh before another jury. The nature of the objectionable matter, the constant repetition of it before the jury, and its direct adverse relation to the defense of the accused, lead inescapably to this conclusion. We observe that none of the matters to which the defense\u2019s continual objections went was actually stricken or withdrawn from the jury other than by the caution to disregard them; the challenged matters remained in the transcripts of the recording given to the jury and on the tapes, both of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>were in the case as exhibits. We hold that in the circumstances the error was not cured by the cautionary instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">We give short shrift to the State\u2019s contentions that the accused \u201cwaived objections to the evidence in question,\u201d and that \u201ceven if the evidence was erroneously admitted, it was harmless error.\u201d As we have indicated, defense counsel was vigorous, persistent and steadfast in his objections. Patently, he did not intend to waive these objections by his attempts on cross-examination, including the offering of the deposition referred to in the recordings, to salvage what he could and mitigate to some extent the adverse rulings of the court. <em>See Peisner r. State, </em>236 Md. 137, 144, 202 A. 2d 585 (1964); <em>Jones v. State, </em>205 Md. 528, 536, 109 A. 2d 732 (1954); <em>MacEwen v.

The autopsy report of the Department of Post Mortem Examiners and the testimony of an assistant medical examiner showed that the body of the victim contained sixty-five incised wounds (cuts and stabs made with a sharp implement). Forty of them were superficial. Three of the superficial wounds were on the left wrist and were characterized as \u201cdefense wounds,\u201d that is, wounds received in attempting to ward off an assailant. Twenty-five other discrete wounds were on the head and neck, the left arm, the right arm and leg and the right side of the back. A wound on the left side of the neck was five and a quarter inches long and laid open to a width of one inch. It cut the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the side of the neck and the carotid artery. It alone would have caused death in a couple of minutes. Another was a deeply penetrating stab wound which struck the right lung and could have been a fatal injury. The multiplicity of the remainder of the wounds, when considered in the aggregate, also could have proved fatal. The tip of a knife was imbedded in a muscle near the backbone.
