INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-32\">A federal grand jury in West Palm Beach, Florida returned a one-count indictment against appellant Hatch charging him with knowingly and intentionally possessing with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Before trial, Hatch moved to suppress the marijuana as evidence against him, challenging on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>federal and state constitutional grounds the warrantless search and seizure of his property. Following a suppression hearing, the district court denied Hatch\u2019s motion. The court determined that \u201cthe curti-lage that defines the property in question here is enclosed in the fencing around the home and taxidermist building, even if the fence may not be complete on the north, and perhaps east sides of the property.\u201d Hatch subsequently pled guilty but preserved for appeal, pursuant to Fed.R. Crim.P. 11(a)(2), his Fourth Amendment challenge to the seizure of the marijuana growing on his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-5\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred as a matter of law in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress based on its factual determination that appellant was growing marijuana in an \u201copen field\u201d beyond the curtilage of his house. The denial of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>835 F.2d 1406, 1408 (11th Cir.1988). Findings of fact are upheld unless clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 1408; <em>United States v. Edmondson, </em>791 F.2d 1512, 1514 (11th Cir.1986). Significantly, for our purposes here, what is curtilage, and, therefore, within the realm of legitimate privacy expectations, is a question of fact. <em>United States v. Berrong, </em>712 F.2d 1370, 1374 (11th Cir.1983). Application of law to fact is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Alexander, </em>835 F.2d at 1408. In reviewing denial of a motion to suppress, we construe the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>Id.; United States v. Sarda-Villa, </em>760 F.2d 1232, 1235 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-6\">\u201c[T]he special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to the people in their \u2018person, houses, papers and effects,\u2019 is not extended to the open fields.\u201d <em>Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 176, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 1740, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984) (quoting <em>Hester v. United States, </em>265 U.S. 57, 59, 44 S.Ct. 445, 446, 68 L.Ed. 898 (1924)). Thus, a person \u201cmay not legitimately demand privacy for activities conducted out of doors in fields, except in the area immediately surrounding the home.\u201d <em>Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 178, 104 S.Ct. at 1741. \u201c[T]he term \u2018open fields\u2019 may include any unoccupied or undeveloped area outside of the curtilage. An open field need be neither \u2018open\u2019 nor a \u2018field\u2019 as those terms are used in common speech.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180, 104 S.Ct. at 1742.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-8\"><em>United States v. Dunn, </em>480 U.S. 294, 107 S.Ct. 1134, 94 L.Ed.2d 326 (1987), on which appellant relies, recognizes that, consistent with <em>Oliver, </em>Fourth Amendment protection extends to the curtilage of the house. <em>Id. </em>at 300, 107 S.Ct. at 1139; <em>see also Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 180, 104 S.Ct. at 1742. How far the curtilage and Fourth Amendment protection extends turns on \u201cwhether an individual reasonably may expect that the area in question should be treated as the home itself.\u201d <em>Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 300, 107 S.Ct. at 1139; <em>Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 180, 104 S.Ct. at 1742. In resolving this issue, the Court in <em>Dunn </em>reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1576-9\">Drawing upon the Court\u2019s own cases and the cumulative experience of the lower courts that have grappled with the task of defining the extent of a home\u2019s curtilage, we believe that curtilage questions should be resolved with particular reference to four factors: the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1576-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 301, 107 S.Ct. at 1139. In that case, the Court held that a barn used to store chemicals and equipment was not within the curtilage of the house for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. Applying the four factors, <em>id. </em>at 302-03, 107 S.Ct. at 1140, the court held that the barn was fifty yards \u2014 a \u201csubstantial\u201d distance \u2014 from the fence surrounding the house and sixty yards from the house itself. Second, the barn was outside the fence surrounding the house, and that fence clearly established the area around the house as a distinct area within the parcel. Third, the Court found it \u201cespecially significant\u201d that the physical evidence clearly established that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>the barn was not being used \u201cfor intimate activities of the home.\u201d Aerial photos showed the defendant\u2019s truck at the barn, apparently unloading chemical containers; the officers heard a motor running in the barn and smelled strong chemical odors in the barn and surrounding area. Finally, the Court noted that the defendant did little to shield the barn area from view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-4\">The district court in the instant case relied heavily on the fact that appellant\u2019s home and the area immediately surrounding it were separated from the rest of the parcel by partially completed fences. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1577-5\">I find from the evidence that the curti-lage that defines the property that was in question here is enclosed in the fencing around the home and taxidermist building, even if the fence may not be complete on the north, and perhaps east sides of the property. It is true in a narrow definition of the term perimeter that means all the way around. But it seems to me it isn\u2019t necessary that the fence be without any kind of breech [sic] in order for the curtilage to be defined for the purpose that we are talking about here. I think we have to be practical about the thing, and the areas where the fence may not be complete around his property is really not an area that is in question in connection with the investigation that was made by these officers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abmn\">R3:204-05. The court concluded that the totality of the evidence did not establish that Hatch\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy was violated. <em>Id. </em>at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-6\">Applying the factors in <em>Dunn, </em>and based on the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, we hold the district court correctly concluded that appellant had no Fourth Amendment protection against a warrantless search and seizure of the marijuana plants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The marijuana was growing thirty yards and farther from Hatch\u2019s home. Aerial photographs submitted as exhibits clearly indicate that the area in which the plants were growing was separated from Hatch\u2019s home by a taxidermy building, several fences, stock pens, a tac room, and a drying barn. <em>See Berrong, </em>712 F.2d at 1374 (\u201cSince the marijuana field was located beyond all of the buildings on the Berrongs\u2019 property, it was beyond the curtilage of the home.\u201d). These photographs also show that Hatch planted the marijuana outside the fences (posts, barbed wire and hog wire) setting apart his house and taxidermy building as a separate compound, so to speak, within the parcel of land.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hatch testified that \u201cthe basic fences just around the house, the only reason they are there is to keep the livestock out of the main part of the yard, and out of my [taxidermy] shop.\u201d Moreover, we have held that \u201cthere is no legitimate expectation of privacy in outbuildings and open fields, <em>even if fenced, </em>unless they are part of the curtilage, or the immediate appurtenances, of a home.\u201d <em>United States v. Long, </em>674 F.2d 848, 853 (11th Cir.1982) (emphasis added). We also note that, as in <em>Dunn, </em>the fact that Hatch had erected a perimeter fence surrounding his 300 acre tract does not create a constitutionally protected privacy interest in the open fields on his property. <em>See Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 304, 107 S.Ct. at 1141 (citing <em>Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 182-83, 104 S.Ct. at 1743-44) (building fences on open fields does not create a protected privacy interest in them).</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-9\">Consideration of the use to which the area surrounding the marijuana plants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>was put, the third factor, also supports a finding of no protectible property interest. The stock pens, the tac room, the drying bar, the growing marijuana, and the remainder of Hatch\u2019s 300 acres, lay outside the fenced compound containing the home and taxidermy building. Appellant cannot reasonably argue that these activities (including his daily use of a nearby garbage dump for disposing of trash from his home and animal remains from his taxidermy shop), separated as they were from the home by the fencing, were connected with the intimate activities of the home. As in <em>Oliver, </em>any expectation of privacy appellant may have had in activities carried on in an \u201copen field\u201d was not reasonable. <em>See Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 182-83, 104 S.Ct. at 1743.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-4\">Finally, as to whether the marijuana was shielded from observation, we find that the marijuana plants were not visible to passers-by. The trees and surrounding brush appear to obscure the marijuana from view. Only by entering well into appellant\u2019s property and proceeding down a footpath could one view the marijuana. Visitors to Hatch\u2019s \u201ccompound\u201d and customers of the taxidermy shop would not pass within viewing distance of the plant. Notwithstanding this, however, the other factors taken together easily put this marijuana outside the curtilage of Hatch\u2019s residence. And, as the Supreme Court acknowledged in <em>Dunn, </em>the four factors set forth there cannot be applied mechanically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvHC\">Rather, these factors are useful analytical tools only to the degree that, in any given case, they bear upon the centrally relevant consideration \u2014 whether the area in question is so intimately tied to the house itself that it should be placed under the home\u2019s \u201cumbrella\u201d of Fourth Amendment protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1578-5\">480 U.S. at 301, 107 S.Ct. at 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-7\">From the evidence presented, we conclude that the district court did not err in rejecting appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment challenge. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Hatch\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1577-7\">. We also hold, under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Florida v. Riley, </em>488 U.S. 445, 109 S.Ct. 693, 102 L.Ed.2d 835 (1989), that the helicopter overflight raises no Fourth Amendment concerns here. Testimony of the deputies flying over indicated that they observed with the naked eye the marijuana growing in an unenclosed field from an altitude of 500 feet as they circled Hatch\u2019s property. Therefore, whether the search and seizure passes constitutional muster here depends, not on the manner by which the eradication team learned of the presence of the marijuana on Hatch\u2019s property, but on the extent of the curtilage of Hatch's house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1577-11\">. Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the extent of the curtilage, according to <em>Dunn, </em>does not turn on whether or not the area surrounding the house is completely fenced. The test for determining curtilage is not a bright-line determination; nor does the boundary it defines need to be as \"bright line\u201d as a fence or other obvious barrier. The question is one of \"reasonable expectations,\u201d and for that reason, we do not define curtilage so mechanically.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
