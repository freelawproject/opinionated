Doyle and other federal civilian firefighters and law enforcement personnel. These federal personnel sought liquidated damages as compensation for the Government\u2019s delays in paying overtime. The United States Claims Court refused to toll the two-year statute of limitations and dismissed these suits. <em>Doyle v. United States, </em>20 Cl.Ct. 495 (1990). This court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b864-21\">The Claims Court set forth in detail the facts and relevance of related cases. <em>Doyle, </em>20 Cl.Ct. at 497-98. This opinion therefore provides a summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1548\">*1548</page-number>The 1974 Fair Labor Standards Act amendments (1974 amendments) granted federal firefighters and law enforcement officers overtime pay. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-19, as amended in 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-259 \u00a7 6(c)(1)(A), 88 Stat. 55. The overtime pay applied to hours worked after January 1, 1978 which exceeded either 216 hours in a 28-day period or \u201cthe average number of hours\u201d worked in similar periods in 1975. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(k)(l) (1988). The 1974 amendments required the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) to conduct a study to determine the average hours in 1975. The Secretary\u2019s study, however, disregarded hours worked by state and local personnel, compiling the average solely on the basis of hours worked by federal employees. This study set the 1975 average at 216 hours for firefighters and 186 hours for law enforcement personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">Federal employees challenged the study. <em>Jones v. Donovan, </em>25 Wage &amp; Hour Cas. (BNA) 380, 1981 WL 2300 (D.D.C.1981), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>675 F.2d 1340 (D.C.Cir.1982) <em>{Jones I). </em>The district court ordered the Secretary to recompute the overtime standards including state and local data. The Secretary\u2019s revised study reduced the average hours to 212 and 171 respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Based on the new study, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) ordered federal agencies to award their personnel overtime back pay. Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Letter 551-20, September 22, 1983. In late 1983, the Government began to make lump sum payments for overtime, retroactive to January 1978. These payments did not include interest. At this point, many federal employees filed suits seeking liquidated damages for the Government\u2019s delay in making the required payments. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. Donovan, </em>26 Wage &amp; Hour Cas. (BNA) 1602, 1984 WL 3193 (D.D.C.1984) <em>(Jones II); Lanehart v. Marshall, </em>26 Wage &amp; Hour Cas. (BNA) 1654 (D.Md.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Seven firefighters filed such a suit in the Eastern District of New York. <em>Cook v. United States, </em>No. CV85-1467 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 1985). The district court awarded liquidated damages, tolled the two-year statute of limitations, and ordered the Government to produce the names of employees to whom it had paid overtime. On appeal, this court affirmed the district court\u2019s order compelling the production of names, but remanded the case for consideration of the tolling question. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>795 F.2d 987 (Fed.Cir.1986) <em>(Cook I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">On remand, the district court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs. The court decided that plaintiffs\u2019 claims accrued when OPM published the results of the Secretary\u2019s new study in September 1983. The trial court further determined that the Government willfully refused to pay overtime, thus invoking the three-year statute of limitations of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a) (1988).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Cook, </em>unreported (E.D.N. Y.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">When the case returned on appeal, this court upheld the district court\u2019s accrual date, but reversed its determination that the Government\u2019s actions were willful. <em>Cook v. United States, </em>855 F.2d 848 (Fed.Cir.1988) (Co<em>ok II). </em>Thus, section 255(a)\u2019s two-year statute of limitations applied to the <em>Cook II </em>plaintiffs. This court remanded for computation of damages and for consideration of the tolling of the statute. The district court transferred the remaining claims to the Claims Court. <em>Cook v. United States, </em>No. CV85-1467 (E.D.N.Y. June 12, 1987). The Claims Court consolidated plaintiffs\u2019 claims with the claims of Doyle and other workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1549\">*1549</page-number>The Claims Court found that plaintiffs in the^consolidated cases filed their complaint on November 14, 1985, more than two years but less than three years after the accrual date. This finding required dismissal of the suit as untimely under the two-year statute. The Claims Court granted the Government\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment and dismissed all the complaints. The Claims Court found no basis for tolling the statute of limitations or for awarding liquidated damages. Plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Section 1295(a)(3) of Title 28 United States Code gives this court jurisdiction over the Claims Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. This court is not bound by the Claims Court\u2019s ruling that no material facts were in dispute. <em>Mingus Constructors, Inc. v. United States, </em>812 F.2d 1387, 1390 (Fed.Cir.1987). Rather, this court reviews the Claims Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the facts in this case in a light most favorable to the federal employees. <em>Id. </em>at 1391.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Tolling the Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">The FLSA protects claimants by providing for an automatic one-year extension of the statute of limitations in the case of a willful violation. Furthermore, a trial court must grant the victims of a willful violation liquidated damages. In <em>Cook II, </em>this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-9\">As regards the case of a federal agency that has in good faith accepted and followed the advice of the Secretary of Labor, we think a new <em>per se </em>rule is now appropriate; given these facts, that any mistake in responding to the demands of the FLSA is <em>not willful.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-10\"><em>Cook II, </em>855 F.2d at 850 (emphasis added). The Claims Court determined that the Government relied in good faith on the Secretary\u2019s overtime rules and did not willfully violate the FLSA. <em>Doyle, 20 </em>Cl.Ct. at 499. In the absence of willfulness, the statute of limitations for FLSA violations is two years. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">Even after issuance of the OPM directive in September 1983, the Government apparently did not immediately begin making overtime payments. This court in <em>Cook II </em>considered post-September 1983 claims. This court\u2019s ruling on the Government\u2019s good faith applied to those claims as well. The Claims Court correctly rejected the notion that claims arising after the OPM directive are <em>per se </em>willful. Instead the Claims Court followed this court\u2019s direction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-13\">With respect to the length of the limitations period, we reverse and remand with directions to ascertain who is now a party, and the damages, if any, to be recovered by any party on the basis that the limitations period is two years, not three, subject to tolling if the court so holds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4H\"><em>Cook II, </em>855 F.2d at 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-14\">The Claims Court found that OPM\u2019s September 22, 1983 letter notified plaintiffs that the FLSA granted them back overtime pay. From that time, according to the Claims Court, the federal workers \u201chad adequate opportunity to know of their claims against defendants and the opportunity, within a reasonable time, to file such claims.\u201d 20 Cl.Ct. at 501. On this basis, among others, the Claims Court denied equitable tolling of the statute of limitations. This court discerns no material issues of fact or errors of law in the Claims Court\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-15\">In <em>Cook I, </em>this court upheld an order compelling production of the names of potential plaintiffs in overtime back pay cases. The Claims Court found, however, that the OPM directive gave plaintiffs actual notice of entitlement to back pay. <em>Doyle, </em>20 Cl.Ct. at 501. In light of this actual notice, the discovery order sustained in <em>Cook I </em>did not change the accrual date for plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The Claims Court correctly saw no need to toll the statute of limitations pending production of names.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-16\">The trial court\u2019s correct decision to apply the two-year statute of limitations renders most of the claims in this case untimely. However, because this court in <em>Cook II </em>acknowledged the possible existence of claims continuing beyond the statutory lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1550\">*1550</page-number>it, this court also examines the FLSA\u2019s statutory remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">Liquidated Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">In <em>Cook II, </em>this court recognized that FLSA claims might continue to arise after September 1983. <em>Cook II, </em>855 F.2d at 851. This court remanded the case to the district court to determine which \u201cclaims, if any, for pay periods after September 22, 1983, did not accrue until the end of those pay periods.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The causes of action arising out of this application of the continuing claims doctrine would \u201cnot accrue until the end of those pay periods.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Upon accrual, these claimants might seek liquidated damages under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) (1988).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">For these continuing claims, this court must examine eligibility for liquidated damages. Section 216(b) states that an employer in violation of FLSA obligations \u201cshall be liable\u201d to its employee for liquidated damages in the amount of the unpaid overtime or wages. When an employer violates an FLSA obligation in good faith, however, section 260 grants a court discretion to award or withhold liquidated damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">This discretion to award liquidated damages, however, does not extend to a liquidated damages award for interest or delay damages against the United States. <em>Library of Congress v. Shaw, </em>478 U.S. 310, 106 S.Ct. 2957, 92 L.Ed.2d 250 (1986). In <em>Shaw, </em>the Supreme Court held that Congress must expressly waive the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity from suits for interest payments before claimants can recover interest or delay damages. 478 U.S. at 319, 106 S.Ct. at 2964. Neither \u00a7 216 nor \u00a7 260 expressly waives the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity against interest. Sections 216 and 260 do not refer to interest. These sections authorize payment of liquidated damages, not interest. Moreover, Congress specifically codified this principle as part of the Claims Court\u2019s procedural mandate. Section 2516(a) of Title 28 U.S.C. states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-12\">(a) Interest on a claim against the United States shall be allowed in a judgment of the United States Claims Court only under a contract or Act of Congress expressly providing for payment thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4W\">In this case, no contract or Act of Congress expressly provides for recovery of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">To the extent plaintiffs seek damages for delay, <em>Shaw </em>bars recovery. In <em>Shaw, </em>the Supreme Court drew no distinction between interest and delay damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-14\">But the force of the no-interest rule cannot be avoided simply by devising a new name for an old institution:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-15\">[T]he character or nature of \u2018interest\u2019 cannot be changed by calling it \u2018damages,\u2019 \u2018loss,\u2019 \u2018earned increment,\u2019 \u2018just compensation,\u2019 \u2018discount,\u2019 \u2018offset,\u2019 or \u2018penalty,\u2019 or any other term because it is still interest and the no-interest rule applies to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-16\">Interest and a delay factor share an identical function. They are designed to compensate for the belated receipt of money. The no-interest rule has been applied to prevent parties from holding the United States liable on claims grounded on the belated receipt of funds, even when characterized as compensation for delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-17\"><em>Shaw, </em>478 U.S. at 321-22, 106 S.Ct. at 2965-66 (quoting <em>United States v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, </em>518 F.2d 1309, 1322, 207 Ct.Cl. 369 (1975), <em>cert. denied, 425 </em>U.S. 911, 96 S.Ct. 1506, 47 L.Ed.2d 761 (1976)). Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1551\">*1551</page-number>though the plaintiffs\u2019 claims sought \u201cliquidated damages\u201d in order to fit within the FLSA\u2019s terms, the Claims Court found that they actually seek interest or delay damages. The FLSA does not waive immunity for suits against the Government for interest. Whether labelled liquidated damages for delay, delay damages, or interest, plaintiffs have no statutory basis for recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Having correctly detected no material factual disputes, the Claims Court granted summary judgment according to law. The Claims Court\u2019s decision is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-6\">.
