Appellant\u2019s offense was committed and he was arrested on August 7, 1987, after the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (ADAA) was signed into law on October 27, 1986, but before November 1, 1987, the effective date of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. Appellant now challenges his corrected sentence as improperly imposing a term of special parole in lieu of the term of supervised release which the district court, in reliance on <em>United States v. Smith, </em>840 F.2d 886 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 859, 109 S.Ct. 154, 102 L.Ed.2d 125 (1988), had previously determined to be unauthorized under the Sentencing Guidelines. We remand for resentencing in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 840, 112 L.Ed.2d 919 (1991), which held that the ADAA provisions mandating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>a term of supervised release apply to all drug offenses specified in section 1002 of the ADAA, including 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), occurring after October 27, 1986 but before November 1, 1987.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
