During sentencing, the district court applied a three-level enhancement to Stroman\u2019s base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) for her aggravating role in the offense. On appeal, Stroman argues that the district court committed clear error in applying the three-level \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) enhancement. Stroman further claims that the district court committed clear error in declining to grant a reduction in Stroman\u2019s base offense level based on her minor role in the offense pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Upon careful review of the record and the briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-18\">The Federal Sentencing Guidelines provides that a sentencing judge may increase the offense level based on the defendant\u2019s aggravating role in the offense as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUt\">Based on the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, increase the offense level as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-19\">(a) If the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 4 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-20\">(b) If the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 3 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-21\">(c) If the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity other than described in (a) or (b), increase by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-22\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. As indicated by the text of the Sentencing Guidelines, to qualify for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>a three-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), the court must find that (1) the defendant was \u201ca manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader); and (2) the criminal activity involved five or more participants \u201cor was otherwise extensive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Application Note 2 clarifies the type of leadership role a defendant must play in a conspiracy to warrant an enhancement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. An upward departure may b'e warranted, however, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u2018 manage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Id. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), cmt. n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Application Note 4 lists a number of factors for the district court to consider in determining the extent of the defendant\u2019s aggravating role, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXV\">[T]he exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Id. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), cmt. n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">The Federal Sentencing Guidelines provides that a sentencing judge may decrease the base offense level based on the defendant\u2019s mitigating role in the offense as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\">Based on the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, decrease the offense level as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-12\">(a) If the defendant was a minimal participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 4 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-13\">(b) If the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">In cases falling between (a) and (b), decrease by 3 levels. \u00a7 3B1.2. In determining whether a defendant\u2019s role was \u201cminor,\u201d a district court considers two principles. \u201cFirst and foremost, the district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which she has been held accountable.\u201d United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, 175 F.3d 930, 940 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc). \u201cIn other words, the district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating her base offense level.\u201d Id. at 941. .\u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that she played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which she has already been held accountable\u2014not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy\u2014should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d Id. at 944. Second, \u201cthe district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to .that of other participants in the relevant conduct.\u201d Id. However, \u201c[Relative culpability does not end the inquiry.\u201d Id. \u201cThe fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d Id. \u201cRather, the district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in'her relevant conduct.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">In the instant case, Stroman pled guilty to four counts related to her admitted involvement in a conspiracy involving the use of stolen personal identity information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>to obtain and deposit fraudulent tax receipts in the bank accounts of herself and her various co-conspirators. At sentencing, the district court found by a preponderance of evidence that Stroman was \u201ca manager or supervisor\u201d because she \u201cspecifically directed other codefendants to withdraw funds and to meet with her thereafter.\u201d DE 223:41. The district court also found by a preponderance of evidence that Stroman\u2019s criminal activity \u201cwas otherwise extensive\u201d because Stroman filed at least 27 fraudulent tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service, which resulted in 14 fraudulent refunds being deposited into the accounts of Stroman or her code-fendants. DE 223:40-41. The district court then determined that Stroman was not entitled to a mitigating role downward departure because \u201cStroman was a major participant in th[e] scheme.\u201d DE 223:41. The district court further stated that \u201c[t]he very fact that she might have been less culpable than [codefendant] Mr. Bryant is not an indication that she was not otherwise a major participant in this scheme.\u201d DE 223:41.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. United States v. Lee, 427 F.3d 881, 892 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">On appeal, Stroman argues that the district court clearly erred in applying a three-level increase to the base offense level pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) for her aggravating role. Specifically, she argues that she was not a \u201cmanager or supervisor\u201d and that the \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d prong of \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) was not met. Stroman further argues that the district court clearly erred in declining to apply a two-level decrease in her base offense level based on her \u201cminor\u201d role in the offense pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">First, Stroman claims that that the district court clearly erred in finding that she was a \u201cmanager or supervisor\u201d for the purposes of the \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) enhancement because, according to Stroman, she \u201csimply followed the instructions\u201d of codefen-dant Michael Bryant, whom she refers to as the \u201cmastermind\u201d of the criminal con-, spiracy. We disagree. Stroman\u2019s own factual proffer supports the district court\u2019s finding that Stroman specifically directed other codefendants in the tax fraud conspiracy. See, e.g., DE 116:2 (\u201c[T]he defendant obtained the bank account information of co-defendants_ The defendant then provided the account information to the target, and the target filed the false returns, generating fraudulent refunds, and using the bank account information of the co-defendants to receive the refunds. After the money was deposited into the accounts, the defendant then contacted the co-defendants, and directed them to withdraw the funds.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Second, Stroman claims that the \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d prong of \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) was not met because, unlike Bryant, she was not responsible for \u201cdirectly procuring the [personal identity information] in the conspiracy.\u201d Indeed, Stroman has consistently argued that the \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d prong of \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) is not met because Stroman\u2019s participation was less severe than Bryant\u2019s participation. For instance, at the sentencing hearing, Stroman\u2019s counsel and the court engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">THE COURT: So tell me why this criminal activity that involved Ms. Stroman was not otherwise extensive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-11\">MR SAMMS: Well, because, Judge, I think her involvement was not otherwise extensive. I think the \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d would apply to Michael Bryant, in other words, or the people that actually got the personal identifiers. She never got any personal identifiers from any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>one. She was provided that by Michael Bryant. Michael Bryant is the one that contacted the female that worked at the healthy agency, and they worked out a way to actually go into the computers and get all those personal identifiers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq5\">That is otherwise extensive, those kinds of activities where you\u2019re going beyond just the normal cashing of checks. You\u2019re going beyond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\">You\u2019re otherwise extensive when you have a way of getting the personal information. You are otherwise extensive when you have a way of manipulating the computer system to get those identifiers. You are extensive when you can get someone who was involved in the healthcare industry to give you the code to break into the\u2014through the computers and get those personal identifiers. That is otherwise extensive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">Ms. Stroman took a check and put it in her account. That\u2019s not otherwise extensive. And so that is why I don\u2019t think that position also applies to her as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWe\">DE 223:10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Stroman\u2019s argument both below and on appeal appears to assume that the term \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d in \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) refers to the relative degree or amount of a defendant\u2019s participation in a criminal conspiracy vis-a-vis other codefendants. It does not. The plain text of \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) indicates that the subject modified by the adjectival phrase \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d is not the relative degree or amount of involvement vis-\u00e1-vis other codefendants but rather the quality of the \u201ccriminal activity\u201d itself. Thus, the prong is satisfied if \u201cthe criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). The phrase \u201cother extensive,\u201d accordingly, refers to \u201cother\u201d ways\u2014besides the number of participants\u2014that \u201ccriminal activity\u201d may be considered \u201cextensive.\u201d Although Stroman argues that her involvement was less extensive than Bryant\u2019s involvement, she fails to advance any argument that the criminal activity at issue in the instant case was not \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in applying a three-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Finally, Stroman argues that she was entitled to a two-level decrease in her base offense level based on her \u201cminor\u201d role in the offense pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Specifically, she argues that she is entitled to the reduction because her role in the tax return fraud scheme relatively minor as compared to codefendant Michael Bryant, whom she characterizes as an \u201celite crime lord.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14. We disagree. First, Stroman fails to satisfy the first prong of the De Var\u00f3n test because she nowhere argues that her participation in the scheme was minor \u201cin relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating her base offense level.\u201d See Rodriguez De Varon, 175 F.3d at 940-44. Second, Stroman fails to satisfy the second prong of the De Var\u00f3n test because she has not satisfied her burden of showing that she was \u201cless culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in her relevant conduct.\u201d Id. at 944. Although Stroman\u2019s participation in the scheme may have been less severe than codefendant Bryant\u2019s participation, about which we express no opinion, such a fact would be insufficient to entitle Stroman to a minor role reduction. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in denying Stro-man\u2019s request for a minor role reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">\u2022 AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
