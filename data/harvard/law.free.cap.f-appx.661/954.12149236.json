On appeal, Castaneda first argues that the district court erred in failing to award him a minor-role reduction\u2014pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b)\u2014and thereby imposed a procedurally unreasonable total sentence. Second, Castaneda argues that the court erred in denying his request for a downward departure, ori his criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-16\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir. 1999). Further explaining this standard, we made this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-17\">... a trial court\u2019s choice between two permissible views of the evidence is the very essence of the clear error standard of review. So long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, we believe that it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 945. (citation and quotation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">A district court may decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if it finds the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A \u201cminor participant\u201d is a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5). \u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">In determining whether a minor-role adjustment applies, the district court must consider two principles: \u201cfirst, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940. For the first element of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, we have explained that, \u201c[o]nly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable\u2014not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy\u2014should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. -</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">For the second element of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, we have determined that a district court should look to other participants only to the extent that they (1) \u201care identifiable or discernable from the evidence,\u201d and (2) \u201cwere involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have recognized, however, that the \u2022 first element set forth in <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>may, in many cases, be dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">We review the procedural reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse-of-dis-eretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). However, \u201cthe degree of deference that is due varies with the type of procedural error alleged.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1273 n.25 (11th Cir. 2008). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard, follows improper procedures in making the determination, or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence can be procedurally unreasonable if the district court makes errors \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing, to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">Here,- the record supports the district court\u2019s finding that Castaneda was not entitled to a minor role reduction. Under <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>Castaneda played a substantial role in the relevant conduct on which he was sentenced. In particular, he frequently distributed large quantities of methamphetamine; and during the year before his. arrest, he delivered 10 to 15 pounds of methamphetamine to his co-conspirator approximately 20 times. Castaneda admitted to participating in the conspiracy. The district court could have inferred from the totality of the circumstances that Castaneda played a substantial role in the conspiracy. The record supports the district court\u2019s finding that Castaneda was no minor participant relevant to the conduct for which he was held accountable. The district court\u2019s decision was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">In addition, the district court\u2019s decision not to apply the minor-role reduction is otherwise supported under <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>even if Castaneda\u2019s culpability is compared to the other participants. While Castaneda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>argues that he was the least culpable person in the conspiracy, that assertion is belied by his uncle\u2019s statement that Castaneda recruited and paid him to participate in the offense. Furthermore, even if another co-conspirator (Hendricks) was \u201cthe leader and mastermind,\u201d the record shows that Castaneda knowingly distributed a substantial amount of methamphetamine over the course of a year. Castaneda appears to be more of an average participant than a minor player. Even if he was less culpable than another conspirator, given the evidence of Castaneda\u2019s involvement, the district court did not clearly err in denying Castaneda a minor-role reduction. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944 (\u201cThe fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be disposi-tive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor participants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Second, the court did not abuse its discretion and impose a procedurally unreasonable sentence. The court did not err in calculating Castaneda\u2019s guideline range, properly determining that he did not qualify for a minor role reduction. Nothing indicates that the court treated the Guidelines as mandatory, failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Castaneda\u2019s sentence was not procedurally unreasonable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">If reliable information indicates that a defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, a downward departure may be warranted. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l). In general, however, a defendant may not appeal a district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward. <em>United States v. Fossett, </em>881 F.2d 976, 979 (11th Cir. 1989). A defendant may appeal the court\u2019s failure to depart downward on the ground that the court erroneously believed it lacked the authority to depart, but this Court will assume that the district court understood it had authority to depart downward where nothing indicates that it misapprehended its authority. <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). Further, issues not briefed on appeal are generally deemed abandoned. <em>Carmichael v. Kellogg, Brown, &amp; Root Serv., Inc., </em>572 F.3d 1271, 1293 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">There is no indication in the record that the district court misapprehended its authority to depart downward. So as we see it, the court was authorized to depart downwardly; and the sentencing court concluded that such a departure was unwarranted because Castaneda\u2019s criminal history did not merit such treatment under \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l). This decision is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
