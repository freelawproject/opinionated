(\u201cHome Depot\u201d), following a bench trial on Thomas\u2019s failure-to-hire racial discrimination claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d). Briefly stated, Thomas contends that Home Depot\u2014 based on Thomas\u2019s race\u2014rescinded an offer of employment. On appeal, in pertinent part, Thomas challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a jury trial.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Reversible error has been shown; we vacate the judgment and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-20\">Thomas filed this civil action against Home Depot, alleging a violation of Title VII. In his initial complaint\u2014which was filed properly with the district court and served timely on Home .Depot\u2014Thomas included a jury demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-21\">Home Depot filed a motion to dismiss Thomas\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim and for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Thereafter, the magistrate judge granted Thomas leave to file an amended complaint. In the amended complaint, Thomas reasserted his failure-to-hire claim against Home Depot, alleging more facts in support of his claim. Thomas\u2019s amended complaint did not repeat the jury demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Home Depot moved for summary judgment. The district court denied Home Depot\u2019s motion. In doing so, the court concluded that Home Depot had failed to show that Thomas could establish no pri-ma facie case of race discrimination. The district court also concluded that sufficient circumstantial evidence existed to allow a reasonable \u201cjury\u201d to find that Home Depot\u2019s proffered legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for rescinding Thomas\u2019s job offer were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Then, at a pretrial conference, the district court denied Thomas\u2019s request for a jury trial. The district court concluded that, although Thomas had requested a jury trial in his original complaint, his amended complaint\u2014which contained no jury demand\u2014superseded completely his original complaint. The district court also explained that it was too late in the proceedings to grant an untimely request for a jury trial and expressed concern about the difficulties a pro se plaintiff would have representing himself adequately in front of a jury. Thomas moved for reconsideration of the request for a jury trial; the district court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The district court conducted a bench trial on Thomas\u2019s claims and entered judgment in favor of Home Depot. The district court found and concluded that Thomas failed to show that Home Depot\u2019s proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for rescinding Thomas\u2019s job offer was a pretext for race discrimination. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">We review de novo the interpretation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We review with \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d the denial of a jury trial. Mega Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Pieniozek, 585 F.3d 1399, 1403 (11th Cir. 2009). The right to a jury trial is fundamental, and\u2014although the right may be waived\u2014we must \u201cindulge every reasonable presumption against waiver.\u201d Id. (alterations omitted). We must vacate a judgment based upon an unconstitutional denial of a jury trial, unless the denial constituted harmless error. LaMarca v. Turner, 995 F.2d 1526, 1544 (11th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">\u201cThe right to trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution ... is preserved to the parties inviolate.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(a). A party wishing to assert his right to a jury trial must \u201cdemand a jury trial by (1) serving the other parties with a written demand\u2014 which may be included in a pleading\u2014no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served; and (2) filing the demand in accordance with Rule 5(d).\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(b). A party\u2019s failure to serve and file a jury demand in compliance with Rule 38(b) constitutes a waiver of the right to a jury trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(d). Once a demand for a jury trial has been properly served and filed, however, it \u201cmay be withdrawn only if the parties consent.\u201d Id. For purposes of Rule 38, the parties may consent by filing a stipulation to a nonjury trial or by making an oral stipulation on the record. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 39(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Here, Thomas included a demand for a jury trial in his original complaint. Thomas\u2019s jury demand was both served' and filed properly, in accordance with Rule 38(b). Thus, because Thomas\u2019s demand for a jury trial was properly completed, it could be withdrawn only with the consent of the parties. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">That Thomas later filed an amended complaint containing no jury demand did not render invalid Thomas\u2019s initial jury demand or withdraw it. Generally speaking, an amended complaint supersedes the original complaint: averments against one\u2019s adversaries dropped from the original complaint no longer count. Pintando v. Miami-Dade Hous. Agency, 501 F.3d 1241, 1243 (11th Cir. 2007). A jury demand, however\u2014although it may be included in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>pleading\u2014is no element of a complaint itself. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), 38. Most important, the ways by which a proper jury demand, once made, may be withdrawn are governed in a case like this one by the letter of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Nothing in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a proper and complete jury demand can be withdrawn by a later amended complaint totally silent on the issue of a juiy trial. Because Thomas\u2019s amended complaint did not\u2014as a matter of law, could not\u2014\u201csupersede\u201d Thomas\u2019s earlier jury demand, and because the amended complaint included no consent of the parties to withdraw the earlier-made jury demand, the district court erred in denying Thomas a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Although unconstitutional denials of jury trials may be subject to harmless error review, an error may be deemed harmless \u201conly where the issues could have been disposed of on summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Burns v. Lawther, 53 F.3d 1237, 1243 (11th Cir. 1995). Here, the district court denied Home Depot\u2019s motions for summary judgment and for judgment as a matter of law. Later, when finally deciding the case\u2019s merits, the district court weighed the evidence introduced at trial; and the court based its decision at least in part on a determination about the credibility of testimony. On this record, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s denial of a jury trial was harmless: \u201cquestions of witness credibility are the exclusive province of the jury.\u201d See United States v. Hernandez, 743 F.3d 812, 815 (11th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">We vacate the judgment and remand for retrial before a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b594-13\"> Because we conclude that Thomas is entitled to a jury trial, we do not reach Thomas\u2019s arguments on appeal about the merits of his underlying Title VII claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
