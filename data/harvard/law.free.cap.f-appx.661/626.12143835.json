Smith, Appling, and Tillison argue that the district court erred by enhancing their sentences when it incorrectly counted, as victims, persons who voluntarily provided access to their debit card information, which Smith, Appling, and Tillison then used to cash fraudulent checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-26\">We review a district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881, 892 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-27\">Pursuant to \u00a7 2B 1.1(b)(2) of the Sentencing Guidelines, a two-level enhancement is applied if the offense involved 10 or more victims; a four-level enhancement is applied if the offense involved more than 50 but fewer than 250 victims. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A), (B). Thus, the appropriate enhancement calculation depends on the number of \u201cvictims\u201d involved. A \u201cvie-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>tim\u201d means a person who sustained an actual loss or a bodily injury as a result of the offense. <em>Id. </em>comment. (n.l). In cases involving \u201cmeans of identification,\u201d Application Note 4(E) provides that a \u201cvictim\u201d also includes \u201cany individual whose means of identification was used unlawfully or without authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>comment, (n. 4(E)); U.S.S.G. App. C. vol. Ill, Amend. 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">\u201cMeans of identification\u201d has the meaning given by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7), \u201cexcept that such means of identification shall be of an actual (i.e., not fictitious) individual, other than the defendant or a person for whose conduct the defendant is accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n. 1). The \u201cmeans of identification\u201d include \u201cany name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual, including any ... unique electronic identification number, address, or routing code.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">We apply traditional statutory construction rules to interpret the language of Sentencing Guideline enhancements. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>704 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir. 2013). We will first give the language in the guideline its plain and ordinary meaning. We will consider, not only the bare meaning of the word, but also its placement and purpose in the guidelines; \u201cfw]e will not rewrite the guidelines by reading definitions more broadly than their plain language indicates.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">We have addressed similar language in the aggravated identity theft statute, which provides that anyone who \u201cknowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person shall ... be sentenced.\u201d See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). We determined that to establish the \u201cwithout lawful authority\u201d element of aggravated identity theft, the government was not required to show that the defendant obtained another person\u2019s identification documents by stealing. <em>United States v. Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d 603, 607 (11th Cir. 2007), <em>abrogated by on other grounds by Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 646, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009). We noted that the plain language of this phrase indicated \u201cCongress\u2019s intent to prohibit more than just the defendant\u2019s transfer, possession, or use of identification that was obtained by theft by that defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We explained that \u201cour reading of the plain language to prohibit the possession or use of another person\u2019s identification that was obtained by methods other than stealing does not lead to absurd results\u201d because \u201c[i]t is not absurd to conclude that Congress also intended to deter the purchase of identification documents by money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The district court did not err by enhancing Smith\u2019s, Appling\u2019s, and Tillison\u2019s sentences because it correctly counted the number of victims. The district court correctly counted, as victims, persons who voluntarily provided access to their debit card information, which Smith, Appling, and Tillison then used to cash fraudulent checks: Smith, Appling, and Tillison used the debit card information in an unlawful way, regardless of whether Smith, Ap-pling, and Tillison had authority to have the debit card information.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
