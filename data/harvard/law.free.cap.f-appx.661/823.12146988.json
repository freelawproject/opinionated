He contends that the district court erred by entering a judgment reflecting that he was convicted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), and he maintains that this court should remand the case to the district court to reform the judgment to reflect a conviction pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(1). Perdomo contends that he did not have a qualifying conviction for an aggravated felony and that the district court erroneously relied upon his prior conviction in Arkansas for residential burglary. Because Perdomo raises his arguments for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error only. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Section 1326(b)(2) subjects an alien to a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years if his prior removal was after a conviction for an aggravated felony. The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) as, inter alia, an enumerated offense, like burglary, for which the prison term is at least one year, or a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, for which the prison term is at least one year. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), (G).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Perdomo maintains that his prior conviction in Arkansas for residential burglary, pursuant to Arkansas Code \u00a7 5-39-201(a)(1), does not constitute the enumerated offense of burglary and, therefore, the crime is not an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). He asserts that the Arkansas statute is broader than the generic definition of \u201cburglary\u201d because it includes the unlawful entry of vehicles. Perdomo also argues that his conviction is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). He alleges that the offense does not have the element of force needed to qualify it as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 16(a), and cannot be a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 16(b) because the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in that subsection must be struck as unconstitutionally vague in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision invalidating a similar clause in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014;\u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">We need not resolve whether Perdomo\u2019s offense is the equivalent of the enumerated offense of \u201cburglary\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) because he has not established that the conviction is not an aggravated felony pursuant to \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). His argument that \u00a7 16(b) is unconstitutionally vague on its face in light of <em>Johnson </em>is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Longoria, </em>831 F.3d 670, 674-680 (5th Cir. 2016) (en banc), and \u00a7 16(b) is not vague as applied to him. <em>See Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 10, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004); <em>United States v. Echeverria-Gomez, </em>627 F.3d 971, 977 (5th Cir. 2010). He does not otherwise contest whether his conviction, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used during the course of the offense and, thus, has waived any claim that his conviction does not, in fact, satisfy the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 16(b). <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 446-47 (5th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">In light of the foregoing, Perdomo has not shown that the district court plainly erred in finding that his Arkansas conviction for residential burglary is an aggravated felony. Thus, the district court eor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>rectly entered judgment pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(2), and no reformation of the judgment is warranted. His conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
