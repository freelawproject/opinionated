Cho argues first that substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s decision denying her withholding of removal claim, which was based on her testimony regarding the domestic violence she suffered at the hands of her ex-husband. The BIA affirmed the denial of the claim, determining that even assuming she suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground, the evidence of South Korea\u2019s advancements in addressing domestic violence rebutted the presumption that she would be likely to suffer persecution in the future. Cho next argues that she established her eligibility for CAT relief and the BIA failed to give reasoned consideration to her CAT claim. Finally, Cho contends that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of her motion for continuance because the IJ\u2019s denial of the motion was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment, unless the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir. 2007). When the BIA explicitly agrees with the findings of the IJ, we will review the decision of both the BIA and the IJ as to those issues. <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, which requires \u201cview[ing] the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and drawing] all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir. 2004) <em>{en banc). </em>We must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir. 2004) (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the ... fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must establish that if returned to her country, her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The burden of proof is on the applicant. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(C). An alien may satisfy her burden of proof for withholding of removal in two ways. First, an alien may establish past persecution based on a protected ground. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir. 2006). If the applicant establishes past persecution based, at least in part, on an enumerated ground, it is presumed that her life or freedom would be threatened upon return to that country, unless the government shows by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom no longer would be threatened; or (2) it would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate to another part of the country to avoid persecution. <em>Id. </em>Second, an alien may establish that it is more likely than not that she will be persecuted upon removal based on a protected ground. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Because the BIA issued its own opinion in this ease, we review the BIA\u2019s opinion. <em>Ruiz, </em>479 F.3d at 765. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that, even assuming Cho suffered past persecution, any presumption of future persecution was rebutted by South Korea\u2019s advancements in addressing domestic violence. In 2004, when Cho last resided in South Korea, reports showed that 44.6% of married South Korean households experienced some form of domestic violence, with 15.7% experiencing physical domestic violence, but only 11.8% of women reported their domestic violence incident to police. Domestic violence victims also reported that South Korean authorities were often negligent in confronting domestic violence incidents, would simply release domestic violence suspects once they arrived at the police station, and sometimes humiliated and bullied victims instead of offering help. Police negligence, according to one report, stemmed from the sexist view of police in the .early stages of two statutes addressing domestic violence, which were enacted in 1997. Further, in 2004, the recognition of South Korea\u2019s \u201c1366\u201d emergency centers,, which provided counseling and other emergency services to women who were victims of all types of violence, was low, with only 32.8% of females and 31% of males affirming knowledge of those services.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">However, in 2013, South Korea instituted its \u201cthree strikes\u201d policy regarding domestic violence offenders, which authorized authorities to immediately detain a domestic violence suspect, regardless of the victim\u2019s wishes, if the suspect had two priors for domestic violence offenses within the previous three years. In 2007, the South Korean government instituted mandatory domestic violence curriculum in schools and revised and reinforced punishments for domestic violence offenders. South Korea has also continued to fund and publicize its \u201c1366\u201d support centers, which provided domestic violence resources to approximately 160,000 victims every year. Moreover,' although police negligence was cited as a serious impediment to domestic violence investigations in 2004, the 2013 Human Rights Report for South Korea from the U.S. State Department observed that South Korean police were, for the most part, generally responsive to domestic violence incidents. Since 2009, the South Korean government has provided over 50 group homes for domestic violence victims, as part of its Housing Provision Project, which also offered follow-up counseling and continued access to domestic violence resources to group home residents. Moreover, new domestic violence regulations were introduced in 2013, mandating that domestic violence suspects seek counseling, even if the suspects were not actually convicted of a domestic violence offense. These new 2013 regulations also allowed authorities to arrest suspects on suspicion of domestic violence if the suspect had a previous domestic violence conviction and a lethal weapon or dangerous instrument was found on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Based on the foregoing, there is substantial evidence supporting the BIA\u2019s conclusion that South Korea has undergone a fundamental change concerning its treatment of domestic violence sufficient to rebut any presumption that Cho would more likely than not be persecuted on account of her membership in her particular social group if she returned to South Korea.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">We \u201cmay review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as a matter of right.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. .\u00a7 1252(d)(1). This exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional and precludes review of a claim not presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>before the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1249-50 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">To satisfy the exhaustion requirement, a petitioner \u201cmust have previously argued\u201d to the BIA \u201cthe \u2018core issue now on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Indrawati v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>779 F.3d 1284, 1297 (11th Cir. 2015). Although \u201cprecise legal terminology\u201d and \u201cwell-developed argument[s]\u201d are not required, \u201c[ujnadorned, conclusory statements\u201d do not suffice. <em>Id. </em>The petitioner must provide the BIA with the relevant factual underpinnings of her argument for relief, unless she is raising a pure question of law. <em>Id. </em>at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">A petitioner\u2019s argument that the BIA has failed to give reasoned consideration to her claims, arguments, or evidence does not need to be exhausted, for such a claim does not arise until the BIA issues its decision in the petitioner\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 1299. Consequently, it would be \u201cnonsensical\u201d to require the petitioner to raise an argument about a decision that is not yet in existence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a contention that the BIA failed to give reasoned consideration to an issue. <em>Jeune v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>810 F.3d 792, 799 (11th Cir. 2016). To determine whether the BIA gave reasoned consideration to a petition, we ask only whether the BIA \u201cconsidered] the issues raised and announced] [its] decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that [it] ha[s] heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>Perez-Guerrero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>717 F.3d 1224, 1232 (11th Cir. 2013) (quoting <em>Cole v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>712 F.3d 517, 534 (11th Cir. 2013)). Although the BIA must consider all the relevant evidence, the BIA \u201cneed not address specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Cho\u2019s arguments that she is eligible for CAT relief because she did not exhaust that claim. Before thp IJ, Cho expressly stated that she was raising only a withholding of removal claim, and her notice of appeal and brief to the BIA contained no substantive arguments regarding a CAT claim. Therefore, the petition for review is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction as to Cho\u2019s claims that she is eligible for CAT relief. <em>Amaya-Artunduagua, </em>463 F.3d at 1249-50; In<em>drawati, </em>779 F.3d at 1297.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">We retain jurisdiction over Cho\u2019s argument that the BIA failed to give reasoned consideration to her CAT claim. <em>Indrawati, </em>779 F.3d at 1299. It fails on the merits though. The BIA did not fail to give reasoned consideration to Cho\u2019s CAT claim because Cho did not present a CAT claim before the BIA. <em>Perez-Guerrero, </em>717 F.3d at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">We review an Id\u2019s denial of a motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Zafar v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1362 (11th Cir. 2006). \u201cJudicial review of discretionary relief incident to deportation proceedings ... is limited to determining \u2018whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u2019\u201d Garc<em>ia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir. 1985) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">\u201cThe Immigration Judge may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. According to BIA precedent, \u201can immigration judge\u2019s decision denying [a] motion for continuance will not be reversed unless the alien establishes that [the] denial caused him actual prejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of his case.\u201d <em>Matter of Sibrun, </em>18 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 354, 356-57 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>(BIA 1988); <em>see Cole, </em>712 F.3d at 534-35 (requiring petitioner, who argued the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance deprived him of due process, to show that the denial resulted in \u201csubstantial prejudice,\u201d meaning that the outcome would have been different if the motion had been granted, and denying the claim because the documents petitioner sought time to obtain would not have called the IJ\u2019s factual findings into question).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Cho\u2019s motion for continuance, and thus the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial, because Cho failed to show good cause. First, although Cho\u2019s continuance motion stated she needed more time to obtain supplementary documents, Cho did not state in her continuance motion, in her brief to the BIA, or in her arguments to us, what documents she sought or how they would have bolstered her withholding of removal claim. Nor did she proffer what documents she sought after the IJ expressly invited her to do so. Further, Cho had been in the United States for almost ten years and had two months after being placed into immigration proceedings to prepare any applications for relief. Finally, Cho has failed to show how the IJ\u2019s decision prejudiced her claims or establish how the outcome of her case would have been different had her motion for continuance been granted. <em>Matter of Sibrun, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 356-57; <em>see also Cole, </em>712 F.3d at 534-35. Therefore, Cho has not demonstrated that the IJ abused his discretion in denying her motion for continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
