Michael Mu\u00f1iz, an attorney proceeding <em>pro </em>se<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, appeals the Tax Court\u2019s deter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>ruinations regarding his tax deficiency for the 2011 tax year. Mu\u00f1iz raises numerous issues on appeal, but the central dispute is relatively straightforward. On his 2011 tax return, Mu\u00f1iz deducted $45,000 from his gross income as alimony paid. According to Mu\u00f1iz, this amount was \u201clump sum\u201d alimony, as defined by Florida state law, ordered in connection with his dissolution proceedings. The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) audited Mu\u00f1iz\u2019s tax return and subsequently disallowed the deduction, finding that the payment did not qualify as deductible alimony under federal tax law, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 71(b)(1), because the obligation to make the payment would not terminate upon the death of the recipient spouse under state law. The Commissioner then sent Mu\u00f1iz a notice of deficiency stating that he was liable for a $10,952 deficiency in income tax and a $2,190.40 accuracy-related penalty. Mu\u00f1iz challenged the deficiency and the penalty in Tax Court, which ruled in favor of the Commissioner. Mu\u00f1iz now petitions for review of the Tax Court\u2019s decision. After careful review, we deny the petition and affirm the judgment of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">We review a decision from the Tax Court in the same manner and to the same extent as a decision from a district court in a non-jury civil action. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). We review the Tax Court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Long v. Comm\u2019r, </em>772 F.3d 670, 675 (11th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">The Commissioner\u2019s deficiency determination is presumed to be correct, and the taxpayer bears the burden of demonstrating that it is incorrect. <em>Webb v. Comm\u2019r, </em>872 F.2d 380, 381 (11th Cir. 1989); <em>see </em>Tax Ct. R. 142 (\u201cThe burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner [challenging the Commissioner\u2019s determination].\u201d). Income-tax deductions are matters of legislative grace, and taxpayers must comply with the specific requirements for any deductions claimed. <em>INDOPCO, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>503 U.S. 79, 84, 112 S.Ct. 1039, 1043, 117 L.Ed.2d 226 (1992). In other words, \u201cthe taxpayer must clearly establish his entitlement to a particular deduction.\u201d <em>Long, </em>772 F.3d at 678 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">Federal tax law provides that a taxpayer may deduct \u201can amount equal to the alimony or separate maintenance payments paid during such individual\u2019s taxable year.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a). Section 71(b)(1) defines the term \u201calimony or separate maintenance payment\u201d as \u201cany payment in cash\u201d that meets the following four requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtR\">(A) such payment is received by (or on behalf of) a spouse under a divorce or separation instrument,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-12\">(B) the divorce or separation instrument does not designate such payment as a payment which is not includible in gross income under this section and not allowable as a deduction under section 215,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-13\">(C) in the .case of an individual legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance, the payee spouse and the payor spouse are not members of the same household at the time such payment is made, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-14\">(D) there is no liability to make any such payment for any period after the death of the payee spouse and' there is no liability to make any payment (in cash or property) as a substitute for such payments after the death of the payee spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>Thus, subsection (D), the only part of \u00a7 71(b)\u2019s definition at issue in this appeal, requires that liability to make the alimony payment terminates upon the death of the payee spouse. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 71(b)(1)(D). This requirement mainly serves to distinguish support payments from disguised property settlements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Hoover v. Comm\u2019r, </em>102 F.3d 842, 845-46 (6th Cir. 1996) (\u201cThe requirement, that the obligation to make payments terminate immediately upon the death of the recipient is central to Congress\u2019s intended distinction between support and property settlements.\u201d); <em>see also Johanson v. Comm\u2019r, </em>541 F.3d 973, 977 (9th Cir. 2008). Only support payments are deductible as alimony under federal tax law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Formerly, \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D) required that the instrument \u201cspecifically provide for termination upon the death of the payee spouse,\u201d but Congress deleted that requirement through the Tax Reform Act of 1986. <em>Hoover, </em>102 F.3d at 846. So, now, state law can \u201csave\u201d alimony arrangements that do not include an explicit statement of termination upon death. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, when conducting the \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D) inquiry, we first look for termination language in the instrument creating the obligation, but if \u201cthe order does not expressly state that the payments cease upon the death of the payee, we must examine the state law to determine whether the death of the recipient terminates the payment order.\u201d <em>Kean v. Comm\u2019r, </em>407 F.3d 186, 191 (3d Cir. 2005); see <em>also Johanson, </em>541 F.3d at 977; <em>Hoover, </em>102 F.3d at 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">In this case, the parties agree that the final judgment creating Mu\u00f1iz\u2019s obligation to pay does not state whether the obligation terminates upon the death of his ex-wife. Therefore, we examine Florida state law to determine whether the death of the recipient spouse terminates the payment order. <em>Kean, </em>407 F.3d at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">Under Florida state law, courts may award various forms of alimony and may order \u201cperiodic payments or payments in lump sum or both.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 61.08(1). Periodic alimony is \u201cmost commonly used to provide support,\u201d is subject to modification based on a substantial change in circumstances, and, \u201c[a]s a general rule,\u201d is \u201cterminated upon the death of either spouse or the remarriage of the receiving spouse.\u201d <em>Canakaris v. Canakaris, </em>382 So.2d 1197, 1202 (Fla. 1980). Lump-sum alimony, by contrast, may be awarded \u201cto ensure an equitable distribution of property acquired during the marriage,\u201d and, critically, the entry of a final judgment of a lump sum award creates \u201ca vested right which is neither terminable upon a spouse\u2019s remarriage or death nor subject to modification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1201; see <em>Newsome v. Newsome, </em>456 So.2d 520, 522 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1984) (\u201cLump-sum alimony is essentially payment of a definite sum and is in the nature of a final property settlement; hence, an award of lump-sum alimony creates a vested right which survives death and is not terminable on the recipient party\u2019s remarriage.\u201d) (quoting another source with approval).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">Here, assuming, as Mu\u00f1iz contends, that the final judgment granted an award of lump-sum alimony, the Tax Court properly found that Mu\u00f1iz was not entitled to the alimony deduction for his lump-sum alimony payment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Florida state law is clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>liability to pay an award of lump-sum alimony does not terminate upon the death of the payee spouse. <em>Canakaris, </em>382 So.2d at 1201 (but noting that \u201c[jurisdiction may be expressly retained, however, to terminate lump sum alimony installment payments upon a spouse\u2019s remarriage or death when the parties agree to such a provision in a property settlement agreement\u201d). As a result, lump-sum alimony under Florida law does not satisfy \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D), and therefore payment of such an award does not qualify as deductible alimony for federal tax law purposes. <em>See, e.g., Hoover, </em>102 F.3d at 844 (\u201cThe mere use of the word \u2018alimony does not affect the tax consequences of payments.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">Mu\u00f1iz argues that \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D) does not apply to a one-time lump-sum alimony payment that has been fully satisfied. In Mu\u00f1iz\u2019s view, the plain language of \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D) applies in the case of multiple alimony payments only, and whether he would have remained liable after the death of his ex-wife is irrelevant because he quickly discharged his liability under the instrument by paying the full amount. Mu\u00f1iz misunderstands \u00a7 71(b) and the inquiry it requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">Nothing in the language of \u00a7 71(b) makes any of its requirements contingent on whether the \u201cpayment in cash\u201d is a onetime payment or one of many installment payments. Deductible alimony is defined as \u201cany payment in cash\u201d that meets the four requirements set forth above, so \u201cany payment in cash\u201d that does not meet those four requirements, including the requirement that \u201cthere is no liability to make any such payment for any period after the death of the payee spouse,\u201d is not deductible alimony. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D). The lump-sum alimony payment in this case was a \u201cpayment in cash,\u201d but, under state law, liability to make \u201csuch payment\u201d was not contingent on the death of the payee spouse. Therefore, it is not deductible alimony as defined in \u00a7 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">Moreover, Mu\u00f1iz\u2019s proposed distinction between single and multiple payments, solely with respect to lump-sum alimony, would do nothing to advance \u201cCongress\u2019s intended distinction between support and property settlements.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Hoover, </em>102 F.3d at 846-46. Lump-sum alimony may be made payable in installments, but it is still an award of a definite sum that creates \u201ca vested right which is neither terminable upon a spouse\u2019s remarriage or death nor subject to modification.\u201d <em>Canakaris, </em>382 So.2d at 1201. Whether payable in installments or all at once, an award of lump-sum alimony \u201cis in the nature of a final property settlement.\u201d <em>Newsome, </em>466 So.2d at 522. In short, how lump-sum alimony is ordered payable has no bearing on the nature of liability under Florida state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">Likewise, the fact that Mu\u00f1iz quickly and fully paid the lump-sum award, and thereby discharged his liability, is irrelevant to whether \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D) was satisfied and whether the payment was the kind of payment that Congress intended to be deductible. The \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D) inquiry focuses first on the instrument itself and then, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>the instrument is silent, on state law. <em>See, e.g., Hoover, </em>102 F.3d at 846. As we have explained, the instrument is silent and Florida state law is clear that, unless the instrument says otherwise, liability to pay an award of lump-sum alimony does not terminate upon the death of the payee spouse. <em>Canakaris, </em>382 So.2d at 1201. Muniz\u2019s actions subsequent to the alimony award are not relevant to the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">In sum, because liability to pay an award of lump-sum alimony under Florida state law does not terminate upon the death of the recipient spouse, Mu\u00f1iz\u2019s payment pursuant to such an award did not meet the definition of \u201calimony\u201d under federal tax law, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D), and the Tax Court did not err in sustaining the Commissioner\u2019s decision to disallow the claimed alimony deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">Mu\u00f1iz next challenges the accuracy-related penalty imposed by the Commissioner and sustained by the Tax Court. We review for clear error whether a taxpayer acted with reasonable cause and in good faith when making a tax underpayment. Gus<em>tashaw v. Comm\u2019r, </em>696 F.3d 1124, 1134 (11th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">The Internal Revenue Code imposes a 20-percent penalty for any underpayment that is a \u201csubstantial understatement of income tax.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6662(a), (b)(2). However, the penalty does not apply \u201cif it is shown that there was a reasonable cause for such portion [of the underpayment] and that the taxpayer acted in good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6664(c)(1). The taxpayer bears the burden of proof to establish that he acted with reasonable cause and in good faith. <em>Gustashaw, </em>696 F.3d at 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">The most important factor for determining whether the taxpayer acted in good faith is the extent to which the taxpayer attempted to determine his proper liability. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.6664-4(b). We have concluded that a taxpayer did not establish the reasonable cause and good-faith defense for his tax underpayment where (1) he was a sophisticated taxpayer with an accounting degree and financial-analysis experience; and (2) he did not consult a tax professional before filing his return. <em>Campbell v. Comm\u2019r, </em>658 F.3d 1255, 1257, 1260 (11th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">Here, the Tax Court did not clearly err in finding that Mu\u00f1iz did not act in good faith and with reasonable cause when he underpaid his taxes. Similar to the taxpayer in <em>Campbell, </em>Mu\u00f1iz was a sophisticated taxpayer who had a Certified Public Accountant license, had practiced as a public accountant, and was a licensed attorney. In addition, Mu\u00f1iz admitted that he did not consult a tax attorney or another accountant before filing his 2011 tax return. Finally, Mu\u00f1iz could not recall if he had conducted any legal research before filing his return, indicating that he did not take extensive measures to determine his proper tax liability. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.6664-4(b). Mu\u00f1iz\u2019s claimed reliance on the judgment awarding alimony is unavailing because the instrument said nothing about whether liability would terminate on the death of the recipient' spouse. For these reasons, the Tax Court did not clearly err by denying Mu\u00f1iz\u2019s defense to the accuracy-related penalty in the deficiency notice. Therefore, we affirm the underpayment penalty imposed under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6662(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-13\">Mu\u00f1iz raises various other issues that he claims were erroneously handled by the Tax Court. He asserts that the Tax Court abused its discretion in the following ways: (1) by denying his motion <em>in limine, </em>which sought to prevent the introduction of documents the Commissioner had obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>from his ex-wife pursuant to a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>issued without notice to Mu\u00f1-iz; (2) by declining to admit documents from the audit of his 2011 tax return; (3) by sustaining an objection to his cross-examination of his ex-wife during trial before the Tax Court. Mu\u00f1iz also challenges the constitutionality of Tax Court Rule of Practice and Procedure 147, which authorized the issuance of the subpoena to his ex-wife, complaining that Rule 147 violated his due-process rights by allowing the issuance of a subpoena to a third-party or non-party without notice to the opposing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find it unnecessary to address these remaining contentions because any errors were harmless under the circumstances. As for the evidentiary issues, Mu\u00f1iz has not shown that any of the evidence allegedly excluded or admitted wrongfully would affect our determination on the question of whether \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D) was satisfied in this case, which amounted to a legal question under Florida state law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Also, Mu\u00f1iz makes no claim that this evidence was relevant to his ability to establish that he acted reasonably and in good faith. Accordingly, any evidentiary error was harmless. <em>See Pollard v. Comm\u2019r, </em>786 F.2d 1063, 1067 (11th Cir. 1986) (evidentiary error by the Tax Court will not result in a reversal if the error was harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">Likewise, we conclude that any due-process violation in these circumstances was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Tenn. Secondary Sch. Athletic Ass\u2019n v. Brentwood Acad., </em>551 U.S. 291, 303-04, 127 S.Ct. 2489, 2497, 168 L.Ed.2d 166 (2007) (concluding that the consideration of <em>ex parte </em>evidence, even assuming that it constituted a due-process violation, was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). While the contents of the documents allegedly obtained improperly may have been referenced by the Tax Court, the documents are not relevant to the question of whether \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D) was satisfied in this case, which, as explained above, rested solely on an examination of Florida state law, over which we exercise <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See Long, </em>772 F.3d at 675. Accordingly, Mu\u00f1iz was not prejudiced by the admission of the documents obtained through Rule 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the Tax Court and DENY Mu\u00f1iz\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1045-17\">. As a licensed attorney, Mu\u00f1iz is not accorded the liberal construction we normally give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number><em>pro se </em>litigants. <em>See Olivares v. Martin, </em>555 F.2d 1192, 1194 n.1 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">. A transfer of property between former spouses is not considered a gain or a loss for either spouse if the transfer is made incident to the divorce. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1041(a),</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">. We reject Muniz\u2019s contention that the Commissioner somehow waived its challenge to the lump-sum alimony payment. The notice of deficiency clearly stated that the payment made pursuant to the alimony award did not qualify as alimony for federal tax purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>because \"[flederal tax law requires that payments must end with the death of the recipient spouse.\u201d Exh. 27-J. The Commissioner did not need to plead his basis for disallowing the deduction as an affirmative defense because it was not a matter extraneous to Mu\u00f1-iz's burden of showing that the Commissioner erred in disallowing the deduction. <em>See Flav-O-Rich, Inc. v. Rawson Food Serv., Inc. (In re Rawsan Food Serv., Inc.), </em>846 F.2d 1343, 1349 (11th Cir. 1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"ARx\">. While there is, of course, a key distinction between periodic alimony, which necessarily contemplates multiple payments, and lump-sum alimony, which may be made payable all at once or in installments, this case plainly does not involve periodic alimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">. Some of the evidence may have been relevant to Mu\u00f1iz's waiver argument, but we find that argument to be meritless, and, in any case, Mu\u00f1iz has not established that any of this pre-deficiency correspondence was inconsistent with the position of the Commissioner in the notice of deficiency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
