Simmons\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, filed in- the Southern District of Georgia, challenges the validity of his conviction in the Eastern District of Missouri for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, which the Eighth Circuit affirmed on direct appeal. In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Simmons asserts that numerous trial errors led to his conviction, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, and that the \u00a7 2256 court later misconstrued his motion to vacate and failed to properly address his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. He also contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dretke v. Haley, </em>541 U.S. 386, 124 S.Ct. 1847, 158 L.Ed.2d 659 (2004), authorizes review of his \u00a7 2241 petition because he alleged actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">Whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir. 2013). We liberally construe the filings of <em>pro se </em>parties. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, 148 F.3d </em>1262, 1263 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-14\">Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Hold</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number><em>er, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir. 2003). Section 2255 grants federal prisoners a cause of action to challenge their sentences as unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful and delineates the procedure for adjudicating these actions. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In addition, the so-called \u201csavings clause\u201d contained in \u00a7 2255(e) permits a federal court to entertain a federal prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 habeas petition in the limited circumstances where the prisoner demonstrates that the remedy in \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Because the savings clause is a jurisdictional provision, a petitioner must show that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d before the district court has jurisdiction to review the \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1339-40 (11th Cir. 2013). In other words, whether a federal prisoner pursing a \u00a7 2241 petition meets the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause, and thereby opens a portal to review of the merits of the \u00a7 2241 petition, is a threshold consideration that must be resolved before reaching the merits of the \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">We have stated that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d if the petitioner had no \u201cgenuine opportunity\u201d to raise the claim in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1272. So, if there was a genuine opportunity to raise the claim in a \u00a7 2255 motion, the claim cannot be brought under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Harris v. Warden, </em>801 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir. 2015) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that claims cognizable under \u00a7 2255 cannot be brought under \u00a7 2241.\u201d). Moreover, procedural bars to a \u00a7 2255 motion, such as a limitations period or procedural default, generally do not make the remedy of \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. <em>Zelaya v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Com., </em>798 F.3d 1360, 1370 (11th Cir. 2015). Similarly, although federal prisoners are subject to a bar on filing second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions unless they meet specific statutory requirements, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b), 2255(h), that bar does not render \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of the petitioner\u2019s detention, within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir. 2011) <em>(en banc). </em>In other words, a prisoner cannot evade the successive-applications bar by filing a \u00a7 2241 motion instead. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">We have recognized one particular instance in which \u201cno genuine opportunity\u201d exists to raise a claim in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1343. Specifically, no genuine opportunity exists if precedent in the circuit of conviction squarely foreclosed the claim now being raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition throughout the prisoner\u2019s sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id.-, see also Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1272. In those circumstances, according to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir. 1999), the savings clause is available to challenge a conviction where the petitioner makes two additional showings: (1) the claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; and (2) \u201cthe holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense.\u201d <em>Id.-, see also Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">While we have since noted that the <em>Wof-ford </em>test is \u201c\u2018only dicta\u2019 as it applies to challenges to convictions,\u201d <em>Zelaya, </em>798 F.3d at 1370-71 (quoting <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1319), we also \u201chave never doubted that the savings clause, at the very least, applies to actual-innocence claims due to a conviction for a non-existent offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1281). Put differently, the savings clause gives a prisoner \u201can avenue to seek relief\u2019 \u201cwhen a Supreme Court decision subsequent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>conviction means that a petitioner\u2019s offense conduct is no longer criminal.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1343 (citing <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244). However, although the <em>Wofford </em>test is directed to claims of actual innocence, actual innocence alone does not \u201copen the gateway to relief under the savings clause.\u201d <em>Zelaya, </em>798 F.3d at 1371-72. \u201cThat is, the prisoner must show some sort of procedural defect in \u00a7 2255, and not merely assert that he has a particularly weighty substantive claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Simmons argued that he was convicted on the basis of evidence that should not have been admitted at trial (such as co-conspirator statements made after the conspiracy ended), that the trial court erred in ruling on various other matters, that his appellate counsel was ineffective for filing an <em>Anders </em>brief on direct appeal, and that the \u00a7 2255 court misconstrued his claims and improperly applied a procedural bar to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He claims that the government at trial introduced no legally competent evidence on which to base his conviction and overcome the presumption of innocence, and that, as a result of the various errors asserted, he was denied his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourt\u00e9enth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Here, Simmons has not met the requirements of the savings clause. Simmons has not identified any Eighth Circuit precedent that, throughout Simmons\u2019s sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 motion, squarely foreclosed any of the claims he brought in his \u00a7 2241 petition. Accordingly, he has not shown that he was deprived of a \u201cgenuine opportunity\u201d to raise his current claims in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1343. Indeed, it appears that Simmons\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition largely reiterates claims he previously raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Even assuming that the \u00a7 2255 court, or the trial and appellate courts before it, reached an incorrect outcome on Simmons\u2019s claims, that is not enough to show that \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective as a remedy. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1272; <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1348. Likewise, the \u00a7 2255 court\u2019s application of a procedural bar to some of Simmons\u2019s claims does not render \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Zelaya, </em>798 F.3d at 1370. Rather, \u201c[Simmons] has to show that the test was not procedurally adequate because erroneous circuit precedent foreclosed his argument\u201d <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1348. He has not done so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">Moreover, Simmons does not rely on any retroactive Supreme Court decision that was not previously available to him and that establishes that his conduct is no longer criminal. <em>Id. </em>at 1343-44; <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. As far as we can tell from Simmons\u2019s filings, the law applicable to his claims has not changed from the time of his conviction in 2009 through the date of our decision in this appeal. And even if such a decision were applicable to Simmons\u2019s claims, Simmons still likely could not obtain relief via the savings clause without a showing that the claims were foreclosed by circuit precedent throughout the underlying proceedings. See <em>Samak v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>766 F.3d 1271, 1275 (11th Cir. 2014) (affirming the dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition solely because the petitioner could not show that \u201ccircuit precedent squarely foreclosed his claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">Finally, Simmons\u2019s reliance on <em>Dretke </em>is misplaced. In <em>Dretke, </em>the Supreme Court addressed, but declined to resolve, the question of whether an actual-innocence exception permitted consideration of a procedurally defaulted challenge to a non-capital sentence raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for habeas corpus. 541 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>393-94, 124 S.Ct. at 1852. But even if <em>Dretke </em>did resolve that question, it would not help Simmons. In Zelaya, we rejected a prisoner\u2019s reliance on similar cases from this Court which had established that \u201can actual innocence claim may excuse a non-jurisdictional procedural bar,\u201d such as a statute of limitations or a procedural default. 798 F.3d at 1372 (citing <em>Rozzelle v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>672 F.3d 1000, 1011-12 &amp; n.14 (11th Cir. 2012), and <em>McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190, 1198 (11th Cir. 2011)). We explained that an actual innocence claim could not excuse the requirements of the savings clause because \u201c[sjection 2255(e) is not a procedural bar; instead, it imposes a jurisdictional <em>condition </em>on the availability of the \u00a7 2241 petition.\u201d <em>Zelaya, </em>798 F.3d at 1372 (emphasis in original). Therefore, even a credible claim of actual innocence \u201ccannot by itself open the gateway to \u00a7 2241 relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1373. Instead, Simmons must comply with the statutory framework Congress established, which means, because he has already filed one \u00a7 2255 motion, that he must comply with the requirements under \u00a7 2255(h) relating to second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Because Simmons has not shown that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention, the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) is not available to open a portal to \u00a7 2241 relief, and the district court properly dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
