Francis contends that the court erred by finding AM-2201 to be most closely related to Tetrahydrocannabinol, Synthetic (THC), and by applying a 1:167 ratio of AM-2201 to marijuana to calculate the relevant drug quantity. He also argues that the district court improperly limited the degrees of his U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 sentence reduction by considering a factor unrelated to his assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In a related case arising from the same criminal scheme, we recently affirmed the THC is the most closely related drug to AM-2201 and that the court did not err by applying the 1:167 ratio. Francis\u2019s drug-quantity claims lack merit. <em>See United States v. Malone, </em>828 F.3d 331, 337-40 (5th Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">As to Francis\u2019s claim that the district court erred by considering his minor role as a factor affecting his \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction, we review only for plain error because Francis did not alert the court to the possible error in order to give the court a chance to amend the reduction or to clarify its reasons. <em>See United States v. Neal, </em>578 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir. 2009). To show plain error, Francis must show a forfeited error that was \u201cclear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute\u201d and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does, this court has the discretion to correct the error if it seriously affected the integrity, fairness, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>To show that an error affected his substantial rights pertaining to his sentence, Francis must show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for the district court\u2019s error, [he] would have received a lower sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 647 (5th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">\u201cDistrict courts have almost complete discretion to determine the extent of a departure under \u00a7 5K1.1.\u201d <em>United States v. Hashimoto, </em>193 F.3d 840, 843 (5th Cir. 1999). Nonetheless, \u201cthe extent of a \u00a7 5K1.1 or [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(e) departure must be based solely on assistance-related concerns.\u201d <em>United States v. Desselle, </em>450 F.3d 179, 182 (5th Cir. 2006). The court told Francis that the 30% reduction under \u00a7 5K1.1 was \u201cbased not only on [his] cooperation, but on [his] relative culpability with the other defendants and the other factors.\u201d If we assume without deciding that the court committed a clear and obvious error by possibly conflating the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with assistance factors, we nonetheless conclude that Francis has not shown that any error affected his substantial rights. The district court\u2019s mention of Francis\u2019s \u201crelative culpability\u201d in the context of the reduction is ambiguous and does not mandate an inference that the court intended Francis\u2019s role reduction to <em>limit </em>further reduction. Thus, the record does not establish that, but for the alleged consideration of an improper factor, Francis would have received a lesser sentence. <em>See Davis, </em>602 F.3d at 647; <em>cf. Malone, </em>828 F.3d at 341 (finding no plain error where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the district court merely \u201cmuddled the steps\u201d in formulating the sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
