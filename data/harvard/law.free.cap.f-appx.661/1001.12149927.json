He challenges the reasonableness of his sentence on appeal. He argues that the district court abused its discretion in two main ways: (1) by basing his sentence on an unsupported factual finding; and (2) by relying on an improper factor in arriving at a sentence greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing. After careful review, we affirm Bloom\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">Bloom came to the attention of law enforcement after officers, using a peer-to-peer file-sharing network, downloaded several videos depicting child pornography from an IP address associated with Bloom\u2019s residence. In a subsequent search of Bloom\u2019s home pursuant to a warrant, law enforcement seized electronic devices containing over 850 videos and 2,000 images of child pornography downloaded over a three-year period. Law enforcement also discovered that Bloom had produced child pornography several months earlier using a nine-year-old girl he had been babysitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">Under a written plea agreement, Bloom pled guilty to one count of knowingly and intentionally producing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a), (e). (\u201cCount One\u201d), and one count of knowingly receiving child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2), (b)(1) (\u201cCount Two\u201d). Counts One and Two each had applicable statutory minimum and maximum sentences: the range for Count One was 15 to 30 years of imprisonment; and the range for Count Two was 5 to 20 years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">Before sentencing, a probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d), which determined a combined guideline range of 262 to 327 months of imprisonment based on a total offense level of 39 and a criminal history category of I. No objections were filed. The district court adopted the PSR and its guideline range at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-12\">The majority of the sentencing hearing concerned the parties\u2019 arguments for an appropriate sentence. The government argued for a guideline-range sentence, while Bloom contended that a sentence at or near the statutory minimum on Count One (180 months) was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">In support of its request for a guideline sentence, the government presented two pieces of evidence. First, the government introduced a disc containing files retrieved from Bloom\u2019s electronic devices, which included a video Bloom produced using the nine-year-old victim. The government played a portion of this video at sentencing. According to the PSR and the parties\u2019 comments at sentencing, the video depicts Bloom pulling down the underwear of the victim, exposing her vagina and anus, and then sexually manipulating her vagina and \u25a0anus with his hand. Second, the government introduced a sex doll of child-like proportions that was seized from Bloom\u2019s home. The doll had a used condom attached to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-14\">Bloom requested -a sentence well below the guideline range, arguing that the child-pornography guideline was too harsh and that there were various mitigating factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>about his conduct. He asserted that his touching of the victim was an isolated incident, that he never communicated with others about child pornography, and that he did not distribute the child pornography he' produced and even attempted to make his files inaccessible to others on the peer-to-peer network. Bloom also asked the court to take into account that, in his view, the victim was asleep during the sexual assault, so the psychological impact on the victim was likely to be minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">As Bloom\u2019s counsel stressed the isolated nature of the sexual assault, the district court interjected that the same sexual act, had it occurred on federal property or had Bloom crossed state lines, would have subjected Bloom to a mandatory sentence of no less than 30 years in prison under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c). Moreover, after watching a portion of the video, the district court found it implausible that the victim had \u201cslept through that.\u201d In any case, the court explained, \u201cthe conduct occurred\u201d whether the victim was asleep or pot. Bloom responded that the court should take into account the potential impact on the victim in comparing the severity of Bloom\u2019s conduct to other child-pornography crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">The district court also noted that it was particularly troubled by Bloom\u2019s cartoons depicting child pornography. For example, one cartoon included text representing that a child engaged in sexual acts with her father because \u201cshe didn\u2019t want to disobey [him], she didn\u2019t want to get spanked.\u201d These cartoons, according to the court, suggested more than an interest in possessing child pornography for his own use, because they \u201cnormalize[ ] child abuse in almost in a teaching fashion, describe[ ] to children that this type of behavior is okay. That suggests to me that this probably wasn\u2019t a first-time incident.\u201d Bloom responded that there was no evidence he had ever used the cartoons to \u201cgroom\u201d a minor. The court replied, \u201cBut what other use? What other use? I mean, what other use?\u201d The judge further elaborated, \u201che\u2019s got plenty of the real thing. He\u2019s got, like I said, more\u2014he\u2019s got a lifetime, in my opinion, of child pornography, real images. He doesn\u2019t need cartoons for his own sexual gratification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">After hearing personally from Bloom, who expressed remorse and shame for his conduct, the district court pronounced sentence. The court first discussed the nature and circumstances of the offenses, including the \u201cunspeakable\u201d acts depicted in the files Bloom downloaded, which the court stated were \u201csome of the worst\u201d and \u201cmost disturbing\u201d it had seen described in a PSR, the \u201cextreme number of images\u201d Bloom possessed, the three-year period of time Bloom had been downloading child pornography, and the fact that Bloom had produced child pornography in which he sexually assaulted a child in his care. The court expressly rejected Bloom\u2019s assertion that the victim was asleep during the molestation, finding that she' would likely have to live with the fear and degradation caused by Bloom\u2019s abuse. All of these factors combined, the court stated, \u201crequired a very severe sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">Next, the district court briefly discussed the need for the sentence to deter others from engaging in similar conduct and then turned to the need for the sentence to protect the public from the \u201cextreme risk\u201d Bloom posed to society. The court found that the cartoons Bloom possessed indicated that he viewed child sexual abuse as something normal and not harmful to children, a perception reinforced by his comments at sentencing. Specifically, in expressing remorse during allocution, Bloom stated that he was thankful no minor had been injured by his actions, which told the court that he was minimizing his own conduct and had \u201cvery poor insight\u201d into what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>he had done. This, in turn, the court concluded, suggested \u201cthe need for a very-serious and severe sentence.\u201d Finally, the court cited the child-sized sex doll, which Bloom used to satisfy himself sexually despite being in an apparent sexual relationship with his adult girlfriend, who was pregnant. Taken together, the court stated, nothing in the record mitigated the court\u2019s concern that Bloom\u2019s sexual attraction to children \u201cwill ever be something that [he] can get control over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">For these reasons and the need to protect the public \u201cin particular,\u201d the district court imposed a total sentence of 360 months of imprisonment, representing a 33-month variance above the high end of the guideline range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sentence, the court explained, took into account \u201cin a very measurable way the sexual act that was committed on the child.\u201d The court again noted that Bloom would have faced a mandatory term of no less than 30 years, had he engaged in the same conduct on federal property or crossed state lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Bloom objected to the above-guideline sentence and again addressed the matter of whether the victim was awake during the sexual assault. The district court responded that its finding that the victim was awake was based upon its \u201cobservation of the video and just common sense.\u201d Without that specific finding, however, the court stated that it would have imposed a sentence of 327 months, within the guideline range. Bloom now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence, including a sentence above the advisory guideline range, under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1186, 1188-89 (11th Cir. 2010) <em>(en banc). </em>In reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, we first ensure that the sentencing court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate the guideline range, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from tjie guideline range. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Next, we examine the substantive reasonableness of the sentence in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">Although Bloom expressly challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence only, his contention that the district court based its sentencing decision on an unsupported factual finding appears to fall within the rubric of procedural reasonable<em>ness\u2014i.e., </em>a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts. Accordingly, we first review whether substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s factual finding that the child victim did not sleep through the sexual touching. Second, we address the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-13\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Creel, </em>783 F.3d 1357, 1359 (11th Cir. 2015). For a factual finding to be clearly erroneous, we must be-left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made based on the record as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We defer to the district court\u2019s factual findings because \u201cthe district court is in the best position to hear the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in making specific factual findings.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number><em>States v. Wilson, </em>993 F.2d 214, 218 (11th Cir. 1993). \u201cWhere a fact pattern gives rise to two reasonable and different constructions, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Almedina, </em>686 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">At a minimum, factual findings must be supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in the record. <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1273 n.25 (11th Cir. 2008). That requires some external source supporting the district court\u2019s finding, such as factual admissions during a guilty plea, undisputed statements in the PSR, or evidence presented at trial or during the sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir. 2009); <em>United States v. Polar, </em>369 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir. 2004). Factual findings \u201ccannot be based on speculation,\u201d <em>United States v. Newman, </em>614 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir. 2010), or on conclusory leaps in logic unsupported by the evidence, but the district court may draw reasonable inferences from the facts in the record, <em>Creel, </em>783 F.3d at 1359. To draw such inferences, the court may rely on \u201ccommon sense and ordinary human experience,\u201d <em>United States v. Philidor, </em>717 F.3d 883, 885 (11th Cir. 2013), as well as the court\u2019s \u201cday-today experience in criminal sentencing,\u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>187 F.3d 1316, 1322 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Bloom asserts that the video fails to establish that the victim was awake, and that the district court\u2019s reference to \u201ccommon sense\u201d was simply unsupported speculation. However, the video upon which the court based its finding has not been included as part of the record on appeal. As the appellant, the burden was on Bloom to ensure the record on appeal is complete, which means bringing before this court all parts of the proceedings below necessary for a determination of the validity of any claimed error. <em>Pensacola Motor Sales Inc. v. E. Shore Toyota, LLC, </em>684 F.3d 1211, 1224 (11th Cir. 2012); <em>see </em>Fed. R. App. P. 10(b)(2) (\u201cIf the appellant intends to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant must include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to that finding or conclusion.\u201d); <em>Borden, Inc. v. Fla. E. Coast Ry. Co., </em>772 F.2d 750, 758 (11th Cir. 1985) (applying Rule 10(b)(2) to exhibits and depositions). \u201c[WJhere a failure to discharge that burden prevents us from reviewing the district court\u2019s decision we ordinarily will affirm the judgment.\u201d <em>Pensacola Motor Sales Inc., </em>684 F.3d at 1224 (quoting <em>Selman v. Cobb Cty. Sch. </em>Dist., 449 F.3d 1320, 1333 (11th Cir. 2006)). We find that to be the case here. Without knowing exactly what the district court observed in the video, we cannot say whether the district court\u2019s inference was reasonable or not, and hence, whether the district court\u2019s factual finding was clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must affirm the district court\u2019s factual finding and reject Bloom\u2019s construed challenge to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">In sentencing a defendant, district courts must consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). These purposes are retribution (\u201cto reflect the seriousness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d), deterrence (\u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d), incapacitation (\u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d), and rehabilitation (\u201cto provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner\u201d). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court also must consider, among other factors, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history, and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, and the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Generally, the weight given to any specific \u00a7 3553(a) factor is left to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir. 2007). However, a district court can abuse its discretion by giving an improper or irrelevant factor substantial weight or by committing a clear error of judgment in balancing the proper factors. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">Where a district court imposes an upward variance based upon the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it should explain why the variance is appropriate, and \u201cthe justification for the variance must be sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 1187 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although we consider the extent of the deviation, we must give appropriate deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the variance. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable in light of the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">Here, Bloom has not established that his total sentence is substantively unreasonable. First, we are not persuaded that the district court\u2019s reference to the thirty-year statutory minimum sentence for aggravated sexual abuse, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c), amounted to consideration of an improper or irrelevant factor. As an initial matter, the district court was entitled to consider as relevant conduct at sentencing the undisputed fact that Bloom engaged in a sexual act with a nine-year-old child in his care, even though that conduct was not an element of either offense of conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. Furthermore, the record reflects that the district court raised the statutory minimum under \u00a7 2241(c) primarily in response to Bloom\u2019s argument that mitigation was warranted in light of the isolated nature of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">' As the district court correctly pointed out, Congress mandated a thirty-year sentence for a similar, single incident occurring within federal jurisdiction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(c), 2246(2)(D). The only thing that separated Bloom from a defendant convicted of violating \u00a7 2241(c), the court explained, was a \u201cjurisdictional hook,\u201d not the seriousness of the underlying factual conduct. So even if Bloom abused a single child, that was hardly a basis for mitigation. Whether these considerations fall under the nature and circumstances of the offense, \u00a7 3553(a)(1), or the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities between defendants who engaged in similar conduct, \u00a7 3553(a)(6), we see no error in the district court\u2019s reasoning, and we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by giving an improper or irrelevant factor substantial weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">Moreover, the district court\u2019s sentencing decision was based on a number of other factors, many of which appear much more significant to the court\u2019s calculus. The rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>ord reflects that the court thoroughly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and found that many supported the need for a very severe sentence. With regard to the nature and characteristics of the offense, the court cited the \u201cunspeakable acts\u201d depicted in the videos, the \u201cextreme\u201d number of videos and images Bloom possessed (850 videos and 2,000 images), the length of time he had been downloading child pornography (over three years), and the fact that he abused a child who was in his care in order to produce child pornography. Also of particular importance to the court was the need to protect the public, based on Bloom\u2019s cartoons that depicted child 'sexual abuse as normal and were of the type often used in child-sexual-abuse cases to \u201cgroom\u201d children for sexual abuse, Bloom\u2019s comments at sentencings, and the child-sized sex doll. Bloom has put forth no argument challenging the district court\u2019s balancing of these factors as unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">We have said before, and we say again, that \u201c[c]hild sex crimes are among the most egregious and despicable of societal and criminal offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1220 (11th Cir. 2009). We \u201chave upheld lengthy sentences in these cases as substantively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(affirming as reasonable a 100-year sentence for a first-time offender who sexually abused a single thirteen-year-old girl and took photos of it); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1244 (11th Cir. 2006) (affirming as reasonable a 140-year sentence for an offender with few prior offenses who produced, possessed, and distributed child pornography); <em>see also Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1206-08 (describing the \u201cdevastating and long-lasting effects\u201d childhood sexual abuse has on its victims). Bloom\u2019s victims included not just the child he sexually assaulted but also the victims depicted in the child pornography he possessed and distributed. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1208 (\u201cEvery instance of viewing images of child pornography represents a renewed violation of the privacy of the victims and a repetition of their abuse.\u201d (quoting Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-248, \u00a7 501(2)(D), 120 Stat. 587, 624 (2006) (codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251 note))).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">In sum, Bloom has not shown that his total sentence of 360 months of imprisonment, representing a 33-month variance above the high end of his guideline range of 262 to 327 months, was substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. Accordingly, we affirm Bloom\u2019s total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">. Bloom received a sentence of 240 months on Count Two, the statutory maximum for that offense, to run concurrently with the 360-month sentence on Count One.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">. Nevertheless, we note that the district court and the parties described substantial manipulation of the child\u2019s vagina and anus, suggesting that the district court\u2019s conclusion that no child could sleep through the actions was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
