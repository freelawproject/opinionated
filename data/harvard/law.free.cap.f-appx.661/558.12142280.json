On appeal, Joassin contends the district court abused its discretion by failing to strike several declarations submitted by the Defendants and erroneously granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>summary judgment where the evidence presented competing witness testimony. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the denial of the motion to strike but reverse summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to strike the declarations and incident report. Each declarant expressly limited his or her declaration to events that he or she personally observed. The fact that some declarants did not personally observe every relevant portion of the incident does not render speculative their declarations regarding events the de-clarants did observe. The declarations were based on personal knowledge and are therefore admissible summary judgment evidence. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The district court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of the Defendants. While some details of Joas-sin\u2019s account of the incident have varied, the bulk of Joassin\u2019s claims have remained consistent. In both his verified complaint and his deposition, Joassin stated that the officers slammed him to the ground three times without provocation while he was restrained, grabbed and squeezed his genitals, and spit in his face, causing various injuries. Drawing all reasonable inferences in Joassin\u2019s favor, Joassin\u2019s sworn testimony creates a genuine issue of material fact as to \u201cwhether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u201d <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 320-21, 106 S.Ct, 1078, 1085, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In concluding that summary judgment was appropriate, the district court relied on the declarations of the Defendants and three non-parties: a prison officer, a prison nurse, and a Florida Department of Corrections investigator. Although competing affidavits generally create a genuine issue of fact, the district court held that this case was similar to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion <em>Scott v, Harris, </em>under which we should disregard a party\u2019s sworn account of the events if it is \u201cblatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it.\u201d <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 1776, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007). In <em>Scott, </em>a video of the high-speed chase at issue in the case \u201cso utterly discredited\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s description of the events that the Court held no reasonable jury could believe the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 380, 127 S.Ct. at 1776. We have interpreted <em>Scott </em>as reaffirming our understanding of the summary judgment standard. <em>See Morton v. Kirkwood, </em>707 F.3d 1276, 1284 (11th Cir. 2013) (\u201cThus, where an accurate video recording completely and clearly contradicts a party\u2019s testimony, that testimony becomes incredible.\u201d). In <em>Morton, </em>we affirmed a district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment because the defendant offered not a video recording but \u201cforensic evidence that does not so utterly discredit [the plaintiffs] testimony that no reasonable jury could believe it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">Here, Joassin\u2019s self-serving testimony is contradicted by the self-serving testimony of the prison officials who are either Defendants in this action or colleagues of the Defendants in this action. In concluding that Joassin\u2019s testimony was blatantly contradicted by the record, the district court relied upon a Department of Corrections investigator\u2019s declaration relaying what he saw on a now-destroyed videotape and a prison nurse\u2019s declaration introducing Joassin\u2019s medical records from the date at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>issue. But neither declaration is so inherently credible as to \u201cblatantly contradict]\u201d and \u201cutterly discredit]\u201d Joassin\u2019s testimony. <em>See Scott, </em>550 U.S. at 380, 127 S.Ct. at 1776. Additionally, even if we treated the two declarations as sacrosanct, neither declaration contradicts enough of Joassin\u2019s testimony to warrant judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Though based on the investigator\u2019s observation of a videotape, the investigator\u2019s declaration is not videotape evidence. Because the videotape was destroyed, neither the district court nor this Court has the benefit of an irrefutable videotape that \u201ccompletely and clearly contradicts\u201d Joassin. <em>See Morton, </em>707 F.3d at 1284. Rather, the investigator\u2019s declaration presents just another interested witness\u2019s recitation of what he claims to have observed. Furthermore, the investigator\u2019s declaration, if credited, refutes Joassin\u2019s allegations with respect to only the portion of the incident that took place in or near the shower. The investigator concedes that he observed no videotape evidence of the portion of the incident that took place in the vestibule while prison officers led Joassin to the infirmary. Therefore, even if we discredited Joassin\u2019s testimony to the extent the investigator testifies otherwise, there would remain a genuine issue of fact as to whether the' prison officers squeezed Joas-sin\u2019s genitals and twice unnecessarily slammed Joassin to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Likewise, the prison nurse\u2019s declaration and records of Joassin\u2019s medical treatment do not \u201ccompletely and clearly contradict ]\u201d Joassin\u2019s testimony. <em>See id. </em>As a former employee and current contractor of the Department of Corrections, the nurse is an interested witness. Even if the nurse was disinterested, her declaration cannot be credited to the extent Joassin\u2019s testimony contradicts it. <em>See Jackson v. West, </em>787 F.3d 1345, 1357 n.6 (11th Cir. 2015). The declaration and medical records, which the nurse completed, remain contradicted to the extent that Joassin stated in his deposition that the nurse did not examine him <em>on </em>the date at issue. This action is therefore no more than a swearing contest between interested witnesses. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cOne cannot \u2018refute\u2019 a witness\u2019s statements using another witness\u2019s statements at summary judgment; such a swearing contest is one for the jury to resolve.\u201d). Furthermore, the nurse\u2019s declaration and medical records, if credited, refute Joassin\u2019s allegations only as to the severity or existence of Joassin\u2019s injuries. The nurse does not claim to have witnessed any portion of the allegedly excessive use of force. \u201c[T]he core judicial inquiry is ... whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 999, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). We may not superimpose onto this inquiry an arbitrary injury threshold: <em>See Wilkins v. Gaddy, </em>559 U.S. 34, 39, 130 S.Ct. 1175, 1179, 175 L.Ed.2d 995 (2010) (\u201cTo conclude ... that the absence of some arbitrary quantity of injury requires automatic dismissal of an excessive force claim improperly bypasses this core inquiry.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)); <em>Saunders v. Duke, </em>766 F.3d 1262, 1270 (11th Cir. 2014) (acknowledging <em>Wilkins </em>and extending it to a Fourth Amendment excessive-force case). Therefore, even if Joassin overstates his alleged injuries, the Defendants are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The summary judgment evidence reveals a genuine dispute regarding whether the Defendants \u201cmaliciously and sadistically\u201d inflicted and permitted one another to \u201cmaliciously and sadistically\u201d inflict force upon Joassin \u201cfor the very purpose of causing harm.\u201d <em>Whitley, </em>475 U.S. at 320, 106 S.Ct. at 1085. Therefore, summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">.
