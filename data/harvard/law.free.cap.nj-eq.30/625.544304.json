There being no proof that the assessment was actually made before the mortgage was <em>given,\u2014Held, </em>that such inference could not be drawn from the answer'.</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b651-11\"><em>Mr. E.

The answer of the city sets up, that the assessment for that year was made between the first Mon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>day in May and the last Monday in June, 1876, but it is not claimed in the answer, nor is there any proof, that the assessment was made before the execution of the mortgage of the complainants. The averment of the answer as to the date of the assessment is perfectly consistent with the fact that it was made after the execution of the mortgage, and, by a well-settled rule of equity pleading, the averment is to be construed most strongly against the pleader. The answer must, therefore, be taken to admit that the mortgage was executed to the complainants before the assessment was levied. <em>Story\u2019s Eq. Pl. </em>\u00a7 452a.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">This case is therefore essentially alike to that in which the opinion has been filed, and for the reasons therein stated the chancellor is respectfully advised that the exceptions to the master\u2019s report be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
