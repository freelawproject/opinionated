All the interests of the Duke of York in East New Jersey, including the royalties and powers of government, were conveyed to the proprietors of East New Jersey, as fully and amply, and in the same condition as they were granted to him, and they had the same dominion and property in the navigable waters and soil under them, and in the rights of fishery, that had belonged to him under the original charter, and were held by them as a <em>prerogative </em>right, and incident to the <em>regal </em>authority; and were, by the said proprietors, in 1702, surrendered to Anne, queen of England, and her heirs and successors. The surrender, according to its evident object and meaning, restored to the crown, in the same plight and condition, whatever the Duke of York held as a royal prerogative right, with the political power to which it was incident. When the people of New Jersey took possession of the reins of government, and took into their own hands the powers of sovereignty, the <em>prerogatives </em>and <em>gura regalia </em>\u2022which before belonged to either the crown or the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>liament, became immediately and rightfully vested in the state.\u201d</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>North Carolina.\u2014After a fraudulent conveyance of lands and a sale under execution against the vendor, the fraudulent vendee, before the delivery of the sheriff\u2019s deed, entered into recognizance to the state.\u2014 <em>Held, </em>that as the fraudulent vendee had no valid title to the lands at the time of giving the recognizance, the state could thereby derive no preference over the execution purchaser, the sheriff\u2019s deed relating back to the time of his sale. <em>Hoke </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>3 <em>Dev. </em>12.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The preference of the state is confined to its own claims, and does not embrace those of corporations of which the state is owner in vrhole or in part <em>{Bank of South Carolina </em>v.

For, although the colonial legislatures are understood to have been inhibited from passing any law derogatory from the sovereignty of the crown or repugnant to the laws and statutes of England, which seems to have been the only common rule imposed upon them, yet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>application of this rule in the several colonies will be found to have been as various as their respective soils, climates and productions.\u201d</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AJd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>An insolvent discharge \u2019does not bar the United States <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>8 <em>Wheat. </em>253; <em>Glenn </em>v. <em>Humphreys, 4 Wash.

It was therefore essential to the force and obligations of any rule of the common law that it had been before that time actually adopted, used or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>approved <em>in </em>the colony; and further, that it should not be repugnant to the rights and liberties contained in the constitution. Although it might be found in every law treatise, from Bracton and Glanville to Coke, Hale, Hawkins and Blackstone, or in every reporter from the year-books to the days of Lord Mansfield, it would have no more force in Massachusetts than an edict of the emperor of China.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b350-4\">The vice-chancellor further says that Mr. Griffith declared it to be his opinion <em>\u201c </em>that our laws give no preference to debts of any kind due to the state; they stand only on the same footing as other debts, according to their degree.\u201d 4 <em>Grif. Law Reg. </em>1281, <em>note </em>(2).</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b350-5\">By reference to the citation it appears that Mr. Griffith does not sustain the position which he is cited to support. Under the title, \u201c <em>Payment of debts by executors and administrators\u2019\u2019 </em>he asks the question, \u201c Is the law of England in regard to the order of paying debts by executors aud administrators, in force ?\u201d and answers it, viz.: \u201c Where executors and administrators do not proceed as upon an <em>insolvent </em>estate, we have no law, so far as respects the <em>order and priority of payment of debts </em>and administration of the personal assets, other than the <em>common law ; </em>except that an <em>executor, </em>being a debtor, is not released from his debt by such appointment, unless so expressed in the will; but it is to be assets, and so accounted for.\u201d (R. <em>L. </em>p. 573.) By a note he says: \u201c Our laws give no preference to debts of any kind due to the state; they stand only on the footing of other debts, according to their degree.\u201d It appears, therefore, that in the text he says that we have \u201c no law but the <em>common </em>lawin the note he informs us of the fact that the statute referring to the payment of debts by executors and administrators contains no reference to the priority of the state. <em>The statutes referred to, and of which he is speaking, refer only to the estate of decedents.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b350-6\">Yet, by reference to a portion of the vice-chancellor\u2019s opinion, already quoted, it will be seen that the king cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>be divested by a general law of his rights, unless the statute is <em>made to extend to Mm by express words.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-5\">The authority of Mr. Ewing is simply to the same effect. The deduction made from the passage by the vice-chancellor is <em>non sequitur; </em>he assumes that because a statute directory to executors and administrators, directing the order in which the debts of intestates shall be paid, does not include the priority of the sovereign, therefore the common law prerogative in cases of insolvent debtors is thereby abolished. See 2 <em>Kent Com. </em>*416; <em>Mitchell\u2019s Estate, </em>2 <em>Watts </em>87.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-6\">The vice-chancellor further says: \u201c The federal government <em>unquestionably possessed </em>as high a prerogative right as a creditor as any sovereignty could under a government republican in form, yet it never attempted to exercise the crown\u2019s common law prerogative in this respect, but as early as 1797 established a right of preference by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-7\">Now the simple truth is, that the federal government never possessed any common law power whatever, it being a fact, that has never been disputed, that it is a government of limited power, possessing no other rights than those conceded by the states. The powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-8\">Mr. Tucker says: \u201c It is distressing to reflect that it ever should have been made a question whether the constitution of the United States, on the -whole face of which is seen so much labor to enumerate and define the several objects of federal power, could intend to introduce in the lump, in an indirect manner, and by a forced construction of a few phrases, the vast and multifarious jurisdiction involved in the common law; a law filling so many ample volumes; a law overspreading the entire field of legislation; a law that would sap the foundation of the constitution, as a system of limited and specified powers.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-9\">It was necessary for the sovereign to have the right, and therefore, under the exercise of its duty to pay the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>debts, it was held, in <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Blight, </em>that congress possessed the power to pass such a statute. See 2 <em>Kent </em>244. The fact that the federal government did not possess the power, so far from being an argument in favor of the states not inheriting it, is, on the contrary, additional evidence that the common law prerogative of the sovereign remained unimpaired in the states.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b352-5\">in. <em>If the prerogative existed, it could not be lost by non-user.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b352-6\">The vice-chancellor says: \u201c So far as my knowledge extends, no law officer of the state has ever attempted to enforce it. For over one hundred years, as an actual practical prerogative of government, it has neither been exerted nor recognized, and this * * would seem to negative the existence of the right with great emphasis.\u201d No argument can be deduced from non-user or the failure to assert it on the part of the law officers of the state\u2014(1) Because, having been adopted by the constitution of the state, and declared to be a part of the law of this state by the supreme courts of this state and of the United States, its existence does not depend upon its exercise. (2) <em>Nullum tcmpus occurritregi </em>has been the standing maxim upon all occasions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b352-8\">In <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>Baker &amp; Vorste, </em>4 <em>Mass. </em>422, Chief Justice Parsons says : \u201c No laches can be imputed against the government, and <em>against it no time runs so as to bar rights.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b352-9\">The right of proclaiming war or peace, making treaties and sending ambassadors, the <em>jus regium </em>in the shore, can not be lost by non-user. This latter was never asserted in New Jersey until 1821, and Judge Baldwin, in 1830, expresses an opinion that this right ought to be considered as established by the decision of <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Mundy. </em>It is well known that the decision of the courts of this state since that time have advanced in the claim of the extent of this prerogative, until now, in derogation of common right, the riparian proprietor can be cut off from access to the water adjacent to his upland. As late as 1842 the question was again before Chief Justice Taney.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The whole of the riparian laws, and the decisions of our courts thereupon, are gross assumptions of power if the suggestion of the vice-chancellor is tenable, for the right exercised by New Jersey to-day over the shore is at least as great as ever was claimed by the British crown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-6\">Where can we turn to any claim made by any law officer to immunity on the part of the state from being sued, or protection for the property of the people from the process of the courts? It exists only by virtue of the sovereign prerogative, and because the state can do no wrong. The occasions for its assertion never occur.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-7\">In Maryland the sovereign claim of priority for its debts was not asserted until 1834, nearly sixty years after the declaration of independence; and yet the suggestion that this common law prerogative of the sovereign adopted by their bill of rights had been lost by non-user, was not even suggested in the Maryland case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-8\">IV. <em>The title to the property of an insolvent corporation is not divested by force of law upon the appointment of a receiver.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-9\">The vice-chancellor says, title to this property is divested by force of law, and such divestiture is perfect and absolute, and that no claim was made by the state until after a receiver had been appointed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-10\">It appears in the case that, without making the state a party, or without any notice to the state treasurer or law officers of the state, the bank in New Brunswick which had on deposit $34,000 of the taxes of the people of Middlesex county, deposited there by the collector of the county to the credit of the treasurer of the state, was declared insolvent and a receiver appointed. Immediately thereupon, by the direction of the then attorney-general, Hon. Jacob Vanatta, the state treasurer demanded the amount in full as a preferred claim, to which demand the reply was \u201c that they were not in a condition to pay at that time.\u201d On July 7th, 1877, the state treasurer filed a petition on behalf of the state, asking an injunction to prevent any payment being made until the right of the state could be determined, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>order was granted, and now the vice-chancellor holds that although the right of the state might have been perfect on the day the receiver was appointed, that that appointment divested the title to the property by force of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b354-4\">The vice-chancellor has here fallen into an error in reference to a fundamental principle, and as it is made a part of the syllabus of the case as reported, it is of paramount importance that it should be corrected by this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b354-5\">In <em>Kline </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>11 <em>C. E. Gr. </em>474, the vice-chancellor himself held that the receiver of the Erie Railroad Company stood in respect to duty and liability just where the corporation would were it operating the road. \u201c That whether the receiver is regarded as the officer of the law or the representative of the proprietors of the corporation or its creditors, or as combining all their characters, he is trusted with the powers of the corporation and must, therefore, necessarily be burdened with its duties and subject to its liabilities.\u201d .</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b354-6\">The decree in the case is manifestly founded upon the undisputed doctrine that the receiver is an officer of the courts holding possession for those who may be decreed to have the right. <em>His possession was their possession.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b354-7\">Mr. Kerr, in his book on Receivers, says: \u201c The effect of the appointment of a receiver is to remove the possession of the property from the parties to the suit. If, at the time a receiver is appointed, a party claiming a right in the same subject-matter under a title paramount to that under which the receiver is appointed, is in possession of the right which he claims, the appointment of a receiver leaves him in possession, but parties to the suit, who are not in possession under a paramount title, are removed from possession by the appointment of a receiver. If a party to the suit be appointed receiver, the same rule obtains.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b354-8\">\u201c The appointment of a receiver, however, does not in any way affect the right to the property. The court of chancery, in a suit for a receiver, deals with the possession only, until the right can be determined, if the right be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>subject-matter in dispute between tbe parties, or until the encumbrances have been cleared off, if the appointment has been made at the suit of an encumbrancer. <em>Where the right is the subject-matter in dispute, the receiver merely holds the ^property for whosoever may'ultimately appear to be entitled to it.\u201d Kerr on Receivers </em>158, 159.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b355-5\">He refers to the case of <em>Evelyn </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>3 <em>Hare </em>472, where the argument of Messrs. Cooper and Rolt, followed by the opinion of Vice-Chancellor AVigram, would seem to leave no room for doubt or dispute on this proposition. A note in the American edition says : \u201c That a receiver represents the interests of all the parties in the property, and that it is his duty to protect it to the best of his ability for all those interested, although those interests may be various and conflicting or involved in doubt.\u201d See <em>Iddings </em>v. <em>Bruen, </em>4 <em>Sandf. Ch. </em>417; <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Lord Massareene, </em>2 <em>Ball &amp; B. </em>55; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Duke of Marlborough, </em>2 <em>Swans. </em>125; <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Mansfield, </em>1 <em>Hog. </em>234.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b355-6\">In the Maryland case, Chief Justice Buchanan says : \u201c AVe have endeavored to show that this is a fair and <em>bona fide </em>assignment for a valuable consideration and passes the property from the bank and beyond its power or control. If so, and a similar assignment in England has the effect to protect the property against the king\u2019s <em>extent </em>and to defeat his priority (as we have seen it does), it has equally the effect here to pi\u2019otect the property in the hands of the trustees against common law priority of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b355-7\">The vice-chancellor has, evidently, been led into error, by failing to observe the distinction drawn between a <em>valid assignment, </em>under a deed which has divested the insolvent of his property, by his own act, <em>and the possession of a receiver.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b355-8\">In conclusion, it is insisted that the view taken by the vice-chancellor, that the assertion of this right of priority, on the part of the state, should be regarded as in antagonism to the cardinal objects of a government established by the people, for their common protection and security, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>founded on a misconception of the theory of the government. The prerogative in reference to his revenue was given to the king, at least in theory, not for his own good, but for the common good of his subjects. The <em>jus regium </em>in the shore and beds of navigable rivers he held for the benefit of his people. This section of the prerogative, Sir \"William Blackstone tells us, was one of the incidental prerogatives of the crown, having a relation to something else, <em>distinct from Ms </em>person\u2014indeed, only an exception, in favor of the crown, to those general rules that are established for the rest of the community. <em>\u201cSuch as that no costs should be recovered against the Mng;. that his debts should be preferred to any of his subjects.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b356-4\">The federal government of the United States, not having the power as a prerogative at common law, claimed it as an incident to the constitutional duty of collecting the public revenue and paying the public debt\u2014the supreme court of the United States holding the act of congress constitutional on this ground alone. And the exercise of this right so acquired and denounced by the vice-chancellor as rigorous, has recently saved the federal government from heavy loss at the expense of all private creditors in the case of Jay Cooke, McCullough &amp; Co.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b356-5\">South Carolina, upon the <em>dicta </em>of whose courts, repudiating the common law of England, the vice-chancellor based his opinion on this point, took care to provide, by special statute, for the priority of the sovereign\u2019s claim for taxes. The railroad tax law of our own state makes this lien for taxes paramount to mortgaged debts incurred prior to the assessment of the tax. Nearly every state in the Union which repudiated our common inheritance, was obliged, by necessity, to re-enact this sovereign prerogative by statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b356-6\">It is the duty of the attorney-general to insist that the taxes of the people of Middlesex county, deposited in the State Bank at New Brunswick, by the county collector, subject to the order of the state treasurer, were a sacred trust. It was the product of their labor, drawn from them by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>sovereign power, and it was under the protection of the common law which is their common heritage. If the tax be lost or stolen in its transmission to the treasury, the necessities of government require that it shall be replaced, and thus, for the benefit of a commercial institution or its creditors, established for purposes of private profit or engaged in speculation, the people will be obliged to submit to retaxation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-6\"><em>Mr. A. V. Schenck, </em>for the receiver.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-7\">The State Bank at New Brunswick became insolvent March 31st, 1877, and a petition was filed by the board of chosen freeholders of the county of Middlesex, in the court of chancery, as creditors of the bank, for an injunction and the appointment of a receiver, under the act entitled \u201cAn act concerning corporations.\u201d <em>{Rev. </em>p. 175.) The chancellor granted the injunction, and appointed a receiver April 7th, 1877. George M. Wright, state treasurer, had at that time deposited in the bank, in his name, as treasurer, the sum of $33,990. He subsequently (July 7th, 1877) filed his petition in chancery, claiming the right to be paid in full in preference to all other creditors of the State Bank, under an alleged state prerogative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-8\">The principle is thus stated by Coke <em>(Co. Lit. </em>131 (b)): \u201c The king, by his prerogative, regularly is to be preferred in payment of his duty or debt, by bis debtor, before aiiy subject, although the king\u2019s debt or duty be the latter, and the reason hereof is, for that <em>thesaurus regis est fundamentum belli, et firm amentum pads. </em>And thereupon the law gave the king remedy, by writ of protection, to protect his debtor, that he should not he sued or attached until he paid the king\u2019s debt. But hereof grew some inconvenience, for, to delay other men of their suits, the king\u2019s debts were more slowly paid. And, for remedy thereof, it is enacted by the statute of 25 <em>Eliz. </em>3, c. 19, that the other creditors may have their actions against the king\u2019s debtor, and proceed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>judgment, but not to execution, unless he will take upon him to pay the king\u2019s debt, and then he shall have execution against the king\u2019s debtor for both the two debts. This kind of protection hath (as it appeareth) no certain time limited in it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-5\">But in some cases the subject shall be satisfied before the king; for, regularly, whenever the king is entitled to any fine or duty by the suit of the party, the party shall be first satisfied, as in a <em>cledes tantum. </em>And so, if, in an action of debt, the defendant denie his deed, and it is found against him, he shall pay a fine to the king, the plaintiff shall be first satisfied ; and so in all other like cases. And so it is in bills preferred by subjects in the star-chamber; their costs and damages (if any be) shall be answered before the king\u2019s fine, as it is daily in experience.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-6\">And the prerogative seems to be based in part upon the maxim, <em>uQuando jus domini reg\u00eds et subditi insimul concurrunt, jus reg\u00eds prozferri debet.\u201d Co. Lit. </em>30 (b); 9 <em>Rep. </em>129 (b); <em>Broom\u2019s Leg. Max. </em>69, <em>marg. note; Whart. Leg. Max. 155, maxim </em>70; 1 <em>Bla. Com. </em>238, 239, 240; 2 <em>Bla.

And it is contended, on the part of the appellant, that this prerogative of the king forms a part of the common law, and, as such, has been introduced into this country and into this state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-7\">First\u2014It is denied, on the part of the receiver, that this prerogative of the king has been introduced as a part of the common law, either into this country or into this state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-8\">1. The prerogative flows from feudal principles, is based upon the theory of a monarchical and despotic government, and is utterly inconsistent with a republican form of government established for the good of the people. It is not a <em>direct, </em>but only an <em>incidental, </em>prerogative (2 <em>Bla. Com. </em>240), and as such is only an exception, \u201c in favor of the crown, to those general rules that are established for the rest of the community.\u201d And where it comes in conflict with the well-established right of the citizen, it must yield. \u201cThe king\u2019s prerogative stretcheth not to the doing of any wrong.\u201d 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>Bla. Com. </em>238; <em>Fin. L </em>84, 85. It applies particularly to the king\u2019s <em>income </em>or <em>revenue, </em>and provision is otherwise fully made for the revenue of this state. And it was evidently the intention of the legislature to abolish all revenue based upon <em>prerogative, </em>such as <em>forfeitures </em>for crimes, <em>deodands </em>and the like, which are governed by the same principle as the prerogative in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-6\">2. The <em>adjudicated legal effects </em>of this prerogative show it to be inconsistent with a government formed for the welfare of the people. Beside the instances given by the vice-chancellor in his opinion (2 <em>Stew. </em>268), the attention of the court is called to the following:</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-7\"><em>(a) . </em>The king\u2019s judgment affects all land which the king\u2019s debtor had <em>at or after the time of contracting his debt, </em>whereas between subject and subject the general rule is that a judgment has relation only to the day when signed. 2 <em>Tidd P. </em>1058.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-8\">(b) . If the king\u2019s debtor is unable to satisfy the king\u2019s debt out of his own chattels, the king can betake himself <em>to any third person ibho is indebted to the king\u2019s debtor, </em>and can recover of such third person -what he owes to the king\u2019s debtor, in order to get payment of the debt due from the latter to the crown. 2 <em>Tidd P. </em>1056. And so the king can betake himself to the debtor of the debtor of the king\u2019s debtor, and so on <em>ad infinitum. </em>2 <em>Tidd. P. </em>1058.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-9\"><em>(c) . </em>The king\u2019s debtor <em>is prevented from making any will </em>of his personal effects without the sanction of the crown. <em>Broom </em>and <em>Whart., ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-10\">(&lt;d). Upo.n a debt of record, or a specialty, the writ of extent issues at the instance of .the king, <em>without any previous suit </em>or proceeding, except an affidavit that the debtor is insolvent and the debt is in danger of being lost. And a simple contract debt may be raised to a debt of record by simply issuing a commission to ascertain the amount due, <em>without notice to the debtor. </em>By virtue of the writ of extent the sheriff may break into the debtor\u2019s house, if admission be refused, either to <em>arrest him </em>or to seize his goods. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>lands may be also taken and sold. A debtor taken under this writ cannot be bailed, <em>nor will his discharge under bankrupt or insolvent laws release him. </em>2 <em>Tidd P. </em>1044, 1046, 1049; 3 <em>Bla. Com. </em>420, 421. IIow can the last-named legal effect of this prerogative be reconciled with the provisions of the constitution. of this state (Art. I, \u00a7 17), which declares that <em>\u201c </em>no person shall be imprisoned for debt in any action, or on any judgment founded upon contract, <em>unlessin cases of fraud?\u201d </em>Or with the bankrupt laws of the United States ? Or with the insolvent law's of this state ? <em>(Rev. </em>p. 497, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-5\">Second\u2014This prerogative has not been adopted as a part of the common law <em>by the United States.

If this prerogative has any existence in this state, it exists in its strict common law form, not modified by statute, for all English statutes are declared no longer of force in this state. <em>Pat. </em>p. 436, \u00a7 4. And therefore any citizen-indebted to the state is entitled to the state\u2019s writ of protection, as above.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-6\">2. There is no record, or other evidence, that this prerogative has been claimed by or allowed to the state of New Jersey since the establishment of the government thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-7\">3. <em>\u201c </em>Upon the revolution, all royal rights vested in the people of New Jersey, as the sovereign of the country, and are now in their hands; and they, having themselves both the legal estate and the usufruct, may make such disposition of them, and such regulation concerning them, as they may think fit; and this power of disposition and regulation can be exercised only by the legislative body, who -are the representatives of the people for this purpose.\u201d <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Mundy, </em>1 <em>Hal. </em>13, 78.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-8\">4. The whole course of legislation in this state is a renunciation of this prerogative, repudiates the doctrine, and is entirely inconsistent with its existence. This manifestly appears by reference to the following statutes :</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-9\"><em>(a). </em>\u201c An act respecting suits for the recovery of moneys due to the state,\u201d passed February 28th, 1820 <em>(Nix.

It directs proceedings <em>hy suit </em>to be instituted in all cases where money is due to the state, and judgment and execution as in ordinary cases. The provisions of the constitution of this state (Art. I, \u00a7 17) apply in full force to all proceedings under this statute. Hence, <em>the arrest </em>of the state\u2019s debtor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>in all cases, </em>and without regard to \u201c cases of fraud,\u201d is clearly repugnant to the constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-5\">(h). \u201cAn act providing for the collection of fines and costs,\u201d approved March 18th, 1851.

The state is bound by these statutes by <em>necessary implication, </em>and no other conclusion can be deduced from them than that the legislative and executive departments of the state (11 <em>Rep. </em>70) intended to abrogate the alleged prerogative. 1 <em>Kent Com., </em>(10th ed.) 460; <em>Van Kleck </em>v. <em>O\u2019Hanlon, </em>1 <em>Zab. </em>588; 1 <em>Bla.

Now, the only <em>concurrence </em>of right as to the state and a citizen, under the eightieth section of the act <em>(Rev. </em>p. 191) is in case where the state has a judgment (or mortgage) and a citizen has a judgment (or mortgage).</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-6\">Im all other cases, by the express direction of the act, the fund is to be <em>proportionally </em>distributed. It is in contemplation of the legislature that the state shall <em>sue </em>and recover a <em>judgment </em>for any debt due it, the same as a citizen. Hence it follows that the state, not having recovered any judgment, is not entitled to be placed even among the preferred creditors recognized by the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-7\">Seventh.\u2014In view of the statutes: <em>Nix.
