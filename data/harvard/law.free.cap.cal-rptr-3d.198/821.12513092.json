The issues to be briefed and argued are limited to the following: Did the juvenile court violate minor's due process rights by detaining him well past the 120-day limit established in the Los Angeles County Superior Court Juvenile Division's \"Amended Competency to Stand Trial Protocol\" (Protocol), without evidence of progress toward attaining competency? Does a violation of the Protocol establish a presumption of a due process violation?</p></opinion>\n</casebody></body></html>"}}
