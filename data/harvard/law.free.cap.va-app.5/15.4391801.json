We conclude that the commission misapplied the applicable law; therefore, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">At the time of the accident, the injured employee was a fifty year old water filter operator. During his work shift, he descended steps to the basement of the water filter plant to turn off raw water pumps. Later, as he began to ascend the steps, he remembered that he had to check a water meter chart, and, as he turned around on the first step, he fell to the floor. He felt a sharp pain in his knee but cannot remember if the pain occurred before or after the fall. While at work he was required to wear steel-toed safety shoes that rubbed his toes and affected his walk. He said that he had never injured his knee before. He suffered a \u201cprobable torn meniscus\u201d and was recommended for arthroscopic surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The commission found that the employee\u2019s knee \u201cgave way as he turned on the step which caused his fall.\u201d It concluded that there were no risks \u201cin traversing the steps\u201d that were \u201cinherent in the employment environment\u201d and that there was no injury to the knee caused by the fall. For these reasons it decided that the injury did not arise out of the employment and was, therefore, not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">To be compensable an injury must \u201carise out of . . . the employment\u201d and occur \u201cin the course of the employment.\u201d <em>Reserve Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hosey, </em>208 Va. 568, 571, 159 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1968). Both concepts are prerequisite to compensability. <em>Baggett Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>219 Va. 633, 637, 248 S.E.2d 819, 822 (1978). \u201c[A]rising out of\u2019 employment refers to the origin or cause of the injury, while \u201cin the course of\u2019 the employment refers to the time, place and circumstances under which the accident occurred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">The employer does not deny that the accident occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 the employee\u2019s employment since it occurred during his work shift and while he was \u201creasonably fulfilling the duties of his employment . . . .\u201d <em>Norfolk &amp; Washington Steamboat Co. </em>v. <em>Holladay, </em>174 Va. 152, 157, 5 S.E.2d 486, 488 (1939). The con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>troverted issue is whether the injury arose out of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">For an injury to arise out of the employment there must be \u201ca causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.\u201d <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Aronovitcsh, </em>170 Va. 329, 335, 196 S.E. 684, 686 (1938). This test excludes \u201can injury which cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which comes from a hazard to which the workman would have been equally exposed apart from the employment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">This exclusion is more completely defined by a comparison of several cases which discuss it. In <em>Reserve Life Ins. Co. </em>v. Hosey, 208 Va. 568, 159 S.E.2d 633 (1968), the Supreme Court affirmed a finding that a knee injury, including a possible tear of a medial meniscus, was caused by an accident arising out of the employment. The employee, while doing a door to door survey for her employer, was going up the steps of a home when she felt a sharp severe pain in her knee as she made the final step. She did not know what caused the knee \u201cto twist or turn \u2018because it had never happened before.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 159 S.E.2d at 634. In affirming that this injury did \u201carise out of the employment,\u201d the Court observed that a risk is \u201cincidental to the employment when it belongs to or is connected with what the employee has to do in fulfilling his contract of service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572, 159 S.E.2d at 636. It also said that the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 should be given a \u201cliberal construction in order to effectuate the humane and beneficent purposes of the [a]ct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">More recently, the Supreme Court held that an injury to a leg muscle did not arise from employment when it occurred while the employee walked along a level, clean, unobstructed and well lighted corridor. <em>Richmond Memorial Hospital </em>v. Crane, 222 Va. 283, 285-86, 278 S.E.2d 877, 879 (1981). The Court observed that the employee did not \u201cslip, trip, stumble or fall\u201d and that \u201c[njothing within her work environment contributed to her injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court distinguished <em>Hosey </em>and pointed out that the employee in <em>Hosey </em>was \u201cclimbing steps, not walking along a level corridor and, more importantly, the steps \u2018were just a little bit higher than usual.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crane, </em>222 Va. at 286, 278 S.E.2d at 879 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Since then, this Court has concluded that the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that the steps in <em>Hosey </em>\u201cwere just a little bit higher than usual\u201d was not vital to the outcome in <em>Hosey. Hercules, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stump, </em>2 Va. App. 77, 81-82, 341 S.E.2d 394, 396-97 (1986). The reference to the height of the steps was simply an additional factor peculiar to the work environment that further distinguished the facts in <em>Hosey </em>from those in <em>Crane. Id. </em>In <em>Stump, </em>where an employee injured his knee when he slipped and fell from a stairway at his place of work, this Court also observed that to be compensable an injury does not have to result from an unusual or defective condition. <em>Id. </em>at 79, 341 S.E.2d at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Another important difference between <em>Crane </em>and <em>Hosey </em>is that in <em>Crane </em>the cause of the injury was unknown whereas in <em>Hosey </em>the cause was known. In <em>Crane </em>the employee\u2019s muscle tear occurred when she was walking along a \u201clevel, clean, unobstructed and well lighted corridor\u201d and without her slipping, tripping, stumbling or falling. <em>Crane, </em>222 Va. at 285-86, 278 S.E.2d at 879. On the other hand, in <em>Hosey </em>the initial treating physician reported on a written form that the employee\u2019s torn meniscus was caused by the accident and that the employee was not suffering from some other condition. In <em>Hosey </em>there was a causal connection between the employee\u2019s work and the injury; in <em>Crane </em>there was not. Thus, the requirement that an injury must \u201carise out of the employment\u201d excludes idiopathic disease, one whose cause is unknown or uncertain. <em>Winegar </em>v. <em>International Telephone &amp; Telegraph, </em>1 Va. App. 260, 263, 337 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Another group of cases also defines when an injury \u201carises out of the employment.\u201d These cases discuss the requirement as it applies to injuries occurring on streets and highways. Virginia, following the majority rule, employs the \u201cactual risk test\u201d under which \u201cit is immaterial . . . whether the degree of exposure is increased, if in fact the employment subjected the employee to the hazards of the street, whether continuously or frequently.\u201d <em>Immer &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Brosnahan, </em>207 Va. 720, 725, 152 S.E.2d 254, 257 (1967) (quoting 1 A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 9.10 (1964)). This test is \u201cnot that other persons are exposed to similar risks, but rather that the employment exposes the workman to the particular danger in the street.\u201d <em>Dreyfus &amp; Co. v. Meade, </em>142 Va. 567, 574, 129 S.E. 336, 338 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Applying the \u201cactual risk\u201d test in these \u201cstreet cases\u201d has resulted in compensating an employee injured on a street or highway while on a mission of his employment. <em>See Brosnahan, </em>207 Va. at 727-28, 152 S.E.2d at 259; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Cohen\u2019s Department Store, Inc., </em>171 Va. 106, 108-09, 198 S.E. 476, 477 (1938). Conversely, it has also resulted in denying compensation to an employee injured on the street or highway while on a mission of his own unconnected with his employment. <em>Meade, </em>142 Va. at 576, 129 S.E. at 338. Thus, where in the furtherance of his employment the employee is exposed to a hazard which causes him injury, his injury is a cost of doing that business and is, therefore, compensable. Conversely, where the injury results from a hazard to which the employee is exposed as a result of his own personal errand, his injury is not a cost of doing his employer\u2019s business and is not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The \u201cactual risk\u201d test is not limited in application to injuries occurring on a street or highway. The test also applies to those injuries which occur at the place of employment. <em>Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Parson, </em>1 Va. App. 281, 287, 338 S.E.2d 162, 165 (1985); <em>Park Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Parham, </em>1 Va. App. 166, 169-70, 336 S.E.2d 531, 533 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The \u201cactual risk\u201d test is useful in understanding the exclusion of hazards to which an employee is exposed apart from the employment. An injury arises out of the employment even if the employment does not enhance or increase the degree of the specific risk to which the employee is exposed. An injury is compensable so long as the risk causing the injury is produced by the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">In the present case the commission misapplied the law in determining whether the employee\u2019s injury arose out of the employment. In saying that there were no \u201crisks in traversing the steps . . . inherent in the employment environment,\u201d the commission\u2019s opinion suggests a need to prove that the employment created a greater degree of risk in \u201ctraversing the steps.\u201d This was incorrect. The employee was only required to show that his employment required him to use the steps as he did and that this, not some unknown cause, caused the injury to his knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">There is no question that the employee was on the mission of his employer when he found it necessary to turn around on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>stairway which he was ascending. The attending physician reported that the employee\u2019s knee injury resulted from a twist type injury to his right knee at work. This was unrebutted evidence of a causal connection between the employee\u2019s work and the injury. But for its misapplication of the law, the commission would have had to find that the employee\u2019s injury arose out of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">In conclusion, the commission misapplied the law by imposing a requirement of an enhanced employment-related risk as a prerequisite to compensability in determining if an accident arose out of the employment. Therefore, we reverse the commission\u2019s award and remand this case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Cole, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
