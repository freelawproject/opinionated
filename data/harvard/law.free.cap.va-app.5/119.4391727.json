Surbey (husband) pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-91(9)(a). Husband argues that the trial court erred in requiring him to pay spousal support to Debra M. Surbey (wife) because he proved that she committed adultery subsequent to their separation and prior to the entry of any decree of divorce in this cause. In support of his contention, he relies on Code \u00a7 20-107.1;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>225 Va. 616, 303 S.E.2d 923 (1983); and <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Rosenberg, </em>210 Va. 44, 168 S.E.2d 251 (1969). In support of the trial court\u2019s decision, wife relies, in part, on <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>1 Va. App. 183, 336 S.E.2d 27 (1985)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The parties married on May 11, 1981 and separated on April 21, 1984. Husband filed a bill of complaint on April 30, 1984, charging that wife\u2019s cruel conduct was tantamount to constructive desertion, thereby forcing him to leave the residence at which they last cohabited. Wife responded, charging that husband deserted her without cause and, in addition, was guilty of adultery both before and after their separation. Husband\u2019s answer denied wife\u2019s allegations and further pled condonation as a defense to the adultery charge. On May 30, 1985, the trial court referred the cause to a commissioner in chancery for \u201creport and recommendations with respect to all issues and questions raised in these proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The record amply establishes misconduct on the part of both parties prior to their separation on April 21, 1984. The record also discloses that subsequent to their separation each party employed a private detective for the purpose of gathering evidence to be used against the other at trial. The detectives\u2019 investigations revealed continued misconduct by both husband and wife after their April 21, 1984 separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In a motion filed on October 18, 1985, husband requested and received permission to file an amended bill of complaint adding a charge that wife had committed adultery on February 7 and March 7, 1985. Wife filed an answer denying the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">After hearing testimony and receiving arguments of counsel on January 29, 1986, the commissioner filed his report with the trial court. His pertinent findings and recommendations were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">1. In addition to the grounds alleged by the parties each party requested a divorce on the grounds provided in Code \u00a7 20-91(9)(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">2. That husband committed adultery prior to the separation, however, this was made known to wife and she condoned that misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">3. That both parties were at fault in causing the separation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">4. That both parties were guilty of adultery subsequent to their separation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>5. That neither party can meet the requirements of the \u201cclean hands\u201d doctrine, and recrimination bars each from using adultery as a fault ground on which to be granted a divorce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\">6. That a divorce be granted because the evidence discloses a ground contained in Code \u00a7 20-91 (9)(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">7. No recommendation was made as to spousal support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Neither party excepted to the report of the commissioner. An examination of the record in this cause amply supports the findings and recommendations contained in the commissioner\u2019s report which was \u201csustained in its entirety\u201d by the trial court. Husband objected to the decree only as to the award of spousal support. Wife excepted to the decree \u201cin part\u201d without designating the basis therefor; however, in her brief on appeal she abandoned her objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">By sustaining the commissioner\u2019s report the trial court made a finding that both parties were guilty of post-separation adultery. The judgment of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal unless the record discloses that it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>2 Va. App. 238, 242, 343 S.E.2d 363, 365 (1986); Code \u00a7 8.01-680. We find that there is sufficient evidence to support the judgment of the trial court sustaining the commissioner\u2019s report that both parties committed adultery subsequent to their separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Under some circumstances, post-separation adultery may give the deserting party ground to obtain a decree of divorce <em>a vinculo matrimonii. Haskins v. Haskins, </em>188 Va. 525, 533-34, 50 S.E.2d 437, 441 (1948). In such cases, a determination of which litigant caused the separation is not controlling of the outcome of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 533, 50 S.E.2d at 441. Wife contends, however, that because both parties committed adultery after their separation the principles of recrimination prevent husband from using her adulterous conduct to bar her claim for spousal support when the ground for granting the divorce was that contained in Code \u00a7 20-91(9) (a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Recrimination in divorce law is the defense that the applicant has himself done what is ground for divorce. It bars the plaintiffs suit founded on whatever cause, whether the defendant is guilty or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\">In Virginia, if it be established that one spouse has been guilty of cruelty, or of desertion for a period insufficient to justify an absolute divorce, those offenses, for which merely a divorce a mensa et thoro may be granted, grave though they may be, are not sufficient to bar the right of the other spouse to a divorce from the bonds of matrimony if the statutory grounds for that relief be sufficiently proved. Further, the statutes of both states [Virginia and West Virginia] provide that a plea of recrimination with respect to any other ground of divorce shall not be a bar to either party obtaining a divorce on the ground of separation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">6A Michie\u2019s Jurisprudence <em>Divorce and Alimony </em>\u00a7 26 (1985). It is apparent that under the facts of the case before us neither husband nor wife could use adultery as a ground for divorce, each being barred by the doctrine of recrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The divorce in this case was granted on the ground of separation without cohabitation for more than one year. Code \u00a7 20-91(9)(a). Code \u00a7.20-91(9)(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">A decree of divorce granted pursuant to this subdivision (9) shall in no way lessen any obligation any party may otherwise have to support the spouse unless such party shall prove that there exists in the favor of such party some other ground of divorce under this section or \u00a7 20-95.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The question we must answer is did there exist in favor of either party some other ground for divorce under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-91 or 20-95. We hold that because neither party is entitled to successfully assert adultery as a ground for divorce, and because there was a finding supported by the evidence that both parties were at fault in causing the separation, there did not exist a ground for divorce under any other section of the Code except \u00a7 20-91(9)(a). The right to spousal support is not affected by an award of a no-fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>divorce since neither party\u2019s duty of support is affected absent a finding of fault on one party or the other. <em>See Blevins </em>v. <em>Blevins, 225 </em>Va. 18, 21, 300 S.E.2d 743, 745 (1983); <em>Dukelow v. Dukelow, 2 </em>Va. App. 21, 25, 341 S.E.2d 208, 210 (1986). We construe the word \u201cfault\u201d as used in these cases to mean grounds which legally may be used by one party as a basis for obtaining a divorce from the other party.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Husband does not argue that there was no showing of need for support or a lack of his ability to pay the sum awarded. Therefore, the trial court did not err in awarding spousal support to wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Koontz, C.J., and Benton, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-13\"> Code \u00a7 20-107.1 authorizes the trial court to award spousal support subject to the provision that \u201cno permanent maintenance or support shall be awarded from a spouse if there exists in such spouse\u2019s favor a ground of divorce under the provisions of \u00a7 20-91(1), (3), or (6) or \u00a7 20-95.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-14\"> That opinion specifically limited its conclusion to \u201cthe peculiar facts of (that) record\u201d which differ from those contained in the record before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\"> <em>Coe </em>and <em>Rosenberg </em>cited by husband in support of his position are distinguishable from the case before us in that neither involved recrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
