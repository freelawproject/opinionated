On appeal, Johnson raises the following issues: (1) whether as a matter of law the complaining witness\u2019 testimony was inherently incredible, and (2) whether the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was sufficient to prove that the act in question was accomplished against the will of the complaining witness by force, threat or intimidation. We conclude that the second issue is dispositive and, accordingly, we do not address the first issue. We hold that the Commonwealth failed to prove force, an essential element of the crime charged, and reverse Johnson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">There are conflicts in the evidence in the record supporting Johnson\u2019s claim that no contact, sexual or otherwise, occurred between him and the complaining witness; however, because of our view of this case, we relate only those facts favorable to the Commonwealth and in so doing assume that sexual contact did occur. We will refer only to the first names of the witnesses who were minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">On July 16, 1985, Scott, the fourteen year old complaining witness, spent the night at the home of his friend, Dale. After watching television until late that night both boys fell asleep \u201ccross<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ways\u201d on the bed in the bedroom of Dale\u2019s mother. Scott had on jeans and shoes, but no shirt. Dale\u2019s mother slept on a sofa in the living room, a short distance away. Johnson, a family friend, came to this home in the early morning hours of the next morning, as was his custom, to help Dale deliver the morning newspaper. He also customarily slept for awhile before delivering the newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">On this particular morning, Johnson arrived at 5:30 a.m. and thereafter, positioned himself in the bed between the two sleeping boys facing Scott\u2019s back. Scott testified that thereafter Johnson touched \u201cmy tail and my penis.\u201d Specifically, Scott testified that \u201c[Johnson] woke me up and was holding me real close to him and then he started taking his fingers and going around my pants and stuff and I kind of acted like I was asleep.\u201d Scott further testified that after Johnson touched his genitalia and buttocks, when he tried to get up, Johnson \u201cpushed me back down. ... I got up again and he tried to grab me, but then I went and used the bathroom and I left.\u201d Dale did not respond when Scott called to him during this incident. Upon leaving, Scott told Dale\u2019s mother that he was going to his grandmother\u2019s house. He made no complaint to Dale\u2019s mother. Shortly thereafter Scott informed his friend, Donnie, of this incident. Donnie testified that at that time Scott appeared scared and was crying. The boys called the police and the responding officer testified that Scott appeared \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d when he related the incident to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The Commonwealth correctly points out that Johnson is raising the issue concerning force, threat and intimidation for the first time in this Court because he did not specifically assert that argument in the trial court. Under familiar principles, we recognize that a reasonably specific objection or motion must be made in the trial court to preserve an issue for appellate review. Rule SA:^.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record reveals that Johnson essentially maintained in the trial court that no contact, sexual or otherwise, occurred and, therefore, we agree that he did not specifically present the issue of force, threat or intimidation in the trial court. Under these circumstances, we must first decide whether Johnson can be heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>on this issue for the first time in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Rule 5A:18 is clear and this Court has repeatedly enforced its provisions. <em>See Head </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 163, 167-68, 348 S.E.2d 423, 426 (1986); <em>Ingram </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>1 Va. App. 335, 341, 338 S.E.2d 657, 660 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">One exception of this rule, \u201cthe ends of justice,\u201d was addressed by this Court in <em>Mounce </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 433, 436, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987). In <em>Mounce, </em>we concluded: \u201c[T]he \u2018ends of justice\u2019 provision may be used when the record affirmatively shows that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not when it merely shows that a miscarriage <em>might </em>have occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Obviously, the applicability of this exception cannot be determined on the mere assertion of the general rule, but necessarily requires our review of the record. Having thus reviewed the record and for the reasons that follow, we invoke the ends of justice exception and consider the merits of Johnson\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">Aggravated sexual battery. A. An accused shall be guilty of aggravated sexual battery if he or she sexually abuses the complaining witness, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">1. The complaining witness is less than thirteen years of age, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">2. The act is accomplished against the will of the complaining witness, by force, threat or intimidation, or through the use of the complaining witness\u2019s mental incapacity or physical helplessness, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-11\">a. The complaining witness is at least thirteen but less than fifteen years of age, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-12\">b. The accused causes serious bodily or mental injury to the complaining witness, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-13\">c. The accused uses or threatens to use a dangerous weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-14\">B. Aggravated sexual battery is a felony punishable by confinement in the penitentiary for a term of not less than one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>nor more than twenty years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u201cSexual abuse\u201d is defined in pertinent part in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201cSexual abuse\u201d means an act committed with the intent to sexually molest, arouse, or gratify any person, where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">(a) The accused intentionally touches the complaining witness\u2019s intimate parts or clothing covering such intimate parts ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-67.4 defines sexual battery, a Class I misdemeanor, as the sexual abuse of the \u201ccomplaining witness against the will of the complaining witness, by force, threat or intimidation or through the use of the complaining witness\u2019s mental incapacity or physical helplessness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">The use of identical language in these statutes defining sexual battery and aggravated sexual battery with reference to force, threat or intimidation makes it clear that the legislature did not intend for these factors to be the distinction between the two statutes. Rather, the factors that elevate the criminal act from the misdemeanor to the felony are the specific age of the victim, serious bodily or mental injury, or the use or threat of use of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">Thus, the age of the complaining witness, \u201cat least thirteen but less than fifteen,\u201d is the \u201caggravating\u201d factor which distinguishes the felonious act from a misdemeanor where force, threat or intimidation are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">In this case the complaining witness was not less than thirteen years of age. If he had been, no force would have been required. In addition, the complaining witness does not allege and the facts in the record do not support a finding of threat, intimidation, mental incapacity, physical helplessness, serious bodily or mental injury, or use or threat of use of a dangerous weapon. Consequently, the sole and crucial issue is whether the act was accomplished against the will of the complaining witness by force.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>In determining this issue, we assume, and the record supports, that Johnson, with the intent to sexually molest, arouse or gratify either himself or the complaining witness, intentionally touched the complaining witness\u2019s genitalia and buttocks. We further assume, and the record supports, that Johnson committed this act against the will of the complaining witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The critical issue then becomes whether Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3 requires some force other than that force which is inherently required to accomplish the unlawful touching. Stated differently, the issue is whether, on the facts of this case, a mere nonconsensual touching of the intimate parts of the complaining witness comes within the statutorily defined criminal act or whether some additional force is required. While the Virginia appellate courts have not previously addressed this specific issue, we conclude from the language of the statutes that the legislature intended some force other than merely that force required to accomplish the unlawful touching to be included within the statutorily defined criminal acts of either sexual battery or aggravated sexual battery. Where the complaining witness is at least thirteen years old, unless some force is used to overcome the will of the complaining witness, the unlawful touching constitutes common law assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In the present case, our review of the record convinces us that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not merely that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred. As despicable as we find the conduct of Johnson to be, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth does not support his conviction of aggravated sexual battery. No force was used by Johnson other than the exertion necessary to accomplish the unlawful touching of Scott. The unlawful touching was accomplished by surprise rather than by threat or intimidation. Scott was awake and merely pretended to be asleep when the touching occurred. Under those facts, the touching was not accomplished through the use of the complaining witness\u2019 mental incapacity or physical helplessness as those terms are defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>pulled Scott back down on the bed when Scott attempted to get up, no touching of Scott\u2019s genitalia occurred thereafter. We have concluded that the statute requires that some force be used to overcome the will of the complaining witness. Here, no force was used, but, rather, the unlawful touching was merely nonconsenual. Johnson\u2019s conviction of aggravated sexual battery, therefore, cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Accordingly, we reverse and vacate the conviction for aggravated sexual battery and remand this case to the trial court for a new trial for assault and battery if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\n<em>Reversed, vacated, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Coleman, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\"> \u201cNo ruling of the trial court or the Industrial Commission will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.
