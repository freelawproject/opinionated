There is no controlling precedent regarding the certified questions, the answers to which will determine the outcome of this appeal, dispose of Flo &amp; Eddie\u2019s underlying claims, and resolve an important area of California state law. The questions certified are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-19\">1. Under section 980(a)(2) of the California Civil Code, do copyright owners of pre-1972 sound recordings that were sold, to the public before 1982 possess an exclusive right of public performance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-20\">2. If not, does California\u2019s common law of property or tort otherwise grant copyright owners of pre-1972 sound recordings an exclusive right of public performance?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-21\">III.Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b977-22\">Appellee Flo <em>&amp; </em>Eddie is a corporation created by two founding members of The Turtles, a 1960s folk rock band best known for the hit song \u201cHappy Together.\u201d Flo &amp; Eddie allegedly acquired the rights to a number of The Turtles\u2019 pre-1972 sound recordings, which it has licensed to music, film, and internet companies for various uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-23\">. Appellant Pandora is an online radio service that allows users to stream music on internet-connected devices, including, until recently, The Turtles\u2019 music. Pandora has not paid Flo &amp; Eddie for the public performance<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of its sound recordings, nor does it generally do so for performers of pre-1972 sound recordings.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>On October 1, 2014, Flo &amp; Eddie filed an action<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for damages against Pandora for publicly performing The Turtles\u2019 pre-1972 sound recordings on its services. without paying royalties. Flo <em>&amp; </em>Eddie alleged that these sound recordings were protected under section 980(a)(2) of the California Civil Code, as well as the state\u2019s common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Originally enacted in 1872, and amended in 1947 and 1982, section 980 has undergone, at times, substantial revision that may bear on the merits of Flo &amp; Eddie\u2019s claims. We therefore briefly summarize the evolution of state and related federal law, as relevant to the parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">At the time The Turtles were recording and releasing music in the 1960s, section 980(a) codified what was known as \u201ccommon law copyright.\u201d It granted the \u201cauthor or proprietor of any composition in letters or art ... an exclusive ownership in the representation or expression thereof as against all persons except\u201d cover artists. Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 980(a) (1949). At the same time, section 988(a) of the California Civil Code divested any common law rights once \u201cthe owner of a composition in letters or arts publishe[d] it.\u201d Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 983(a) (1949). Upon publication, \u201cthe same [could] be used in any manner by any person, without responsibility to the owner, insofar as the law of this State is concerned.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">The California legislature originally adopted this language in 1947, seemingly \u201cto remove ambiguities in the State law and <em>to bring the California statute into accord with federal law </em>and judicial precedent within and without California.\u201d Memorandum from Beach Vasey, Legislative See\u2019y, State of Cal., to Governor Earl Warren (July 3, 1947) (emphasis added). The \u201cfederal law\u201d in force at time of adoption and through the 1960s was the Copyright Act of 1909, which, like the California copyright statutes, did not expressly mention sound recordings.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">Rather, the 1909 Act differentiated between unpublished and published works. Unpublished works were left to the protection of the common law, unless registered for federal protection. <em>See Twin Books Corp. v. Walt Disney Co., </em>83 F.3d 1162, 1165 (9th Cir. 1996) (\u201cUnder the 1909 Act, an unpublished work was protected by state common law copyright from the moment of its creation until it was either published or until it received protection under the federal copyright scheme.\u201d). Upon publication <em>with </em>proper copyright notice, federal protection automatically attached and common law protection terminated. Works that were published <em>without </em>proper copyright notice irrevocably en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>tered into the public domain. <em>See Batjac Prods. Inc. v. GoodTimes Home Video Corp., </em>160 F.3d 1223, 1226 (9th Cir. 1998) (explaining that, under the 1909 Act, \u201c[s]tate \u2018common law' protection attached upon creation of the work and ended with publication of the work. Once published, the only protection available was federal statutory copyright. Publication of a work with proper notice secured the statutory copyright.\u201d). The 1947 amendments to California\u2019s copyright statutes therefore reflected this schema by divesting common law copyright protection at the point of publication. Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 983(a) (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">In 1978, however, this schema changed. Congress overhauled federal copyright law. Rather than limiting federal copyright protection only to works that were published with proper notice, the Federal Copyright Act of 1976<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> expanded federal protection to any works fixed in a tangible medium of expression \u2014 thereby preempting common law protection for fixed, but still unpublished works. <em>See </em>Federal Copyright Act of 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-553, \u00a7 102(a), 90 Stat. 2541, 2592 (1976); <em>Batjac Prods., </em>160 F.3d at 1226 (\u201cUnder the 1976 Act, unpublished works lost their common law protection but gained statutory protection.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">The 1976 Act expressly exempted pre-1972 sound recordings from this new federal protection, however. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(c). Instead, the 1976 Act left the common law in place to protect pre-1972 sound recordings. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cWith respect to sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, any rights or remedies under the common law or statutes of any State shall not be annulled or limited by this title until February 15, 2067.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">In response, the California legislature repealed the divestiture-by-publication rule of section 983 and again amended section 980(a), dividing it into two subsections. . Since then, section 980(a)(2) has granted the \u201cauthor of ... a sound recording initially fixed prior to February 15, 1972 ... an exclusive ownership therein until February 15, 2047, as against all persons except\u201d cover artists.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 980(a)(2). Whether section 980(a)(2) or California common law extend an exclusive right of public performance to owners of pre-1972 sound recordings is the subject of this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-14\">After Flo &amp; Eddie filed the present lawsuit, Pandora filed a motion to strike under California\u2019s statute against \u201cstrategic litigation against public participation,\u201d or SLAPP.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pandora argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>section 980(a)(2) does not even apply to The Turtles\u2019 recordings since, under section 983(a), those recordings entered the public domain at the point of publication back in the 1960s. Relying on the legislative history of section 980, Pandora further argued that the California legislature in 1982 did not intend to create protection for sound recordings that had previously entered the public domain when it adopted section 980(a)(2). Even if it did, Pandora argued, the legislature did not intend that protection to include a public performance right.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Flo &amp; Eddie opposed the motion, arguing that the plain language of section 980 gave it \u201cexclusive ownership\u201d over The Turtles\u2019 pre-1972 sound recordings, including a public performance right. Flo &amp; Eddie further argued that the repeal of section 983 made that provision irrelevant. Even if it had never been repealed, Flo &amp; Eddie argued, section 983 never applied to its sound recordings because (1) The Turtles\u2019 records were not \u201cpublished\u201d for the purposes of California law, and (2) section 983 applied only to compositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">The district court rejected Pandora\u2019s arguments and denied the motion to strike, reasoning that Pandora\u2019s reading of section 980(a)(2) would lead to absurd results. <em>Flo &amp; Eddie, Inc. v. Pandora Media, Inc., </em>No. CV 14-7648 PSG (RZx), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70551, at *22-23. The court ruled that California law had historically protected sound recordings even after publication via the common law. <em>Id. </em>at *24-28. Reading that protection into the text of section 980(a)(2), the court concluded that the statute protected published pre-1972 recordings and granted Flo &amp; Eddie a property right in the public performance of its sound recordings. <em>Id. </em>at *27-29. On the basis of that property right, the district court further held that Flo &amp; Eddie\u2019s claims for misappropriation, conversion, and unfair competition were legally sufficient for the purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute. <em>Id. </em>at *29. Pandora timely appealed. <em>See DC Comics v. Pac. Pictures Corp., </em>706 F.3d 1009, 1016 (9th Cir. 2013) (holding that an order denying a special motion to strike under California\u2019s anti-SLAPP law is immediately appealable in federal court pursuant to the collateral order doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">IY. The Need for Certification</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">Certification is warranted if there is no controlling precedent and the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision could determine the outcome of a matter pending in our court. <em>See </em>Cal. R. Ct. 8.548(a). This appeal not only meets both criteria, but also presents an issue of significant public importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>Indeed, the \u201csignificant and unresolved\u201d nature of the issue prompted the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to certify a similar question to the New York Court of Appeals in Flo &amp; Eddie\u2019s case against Sirius XM. <em>Flo &amp; Eddie, </em>821 F.3d at 267. The Court of Appeals accepted the certified question, <em>Flo &amp; Eddie, Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio, Inc., </em>27 N.Y.3d 1015, 32 N.Y.S.3d 576, 52 N.E.3d 240 (2016), and resolved it in view of the fact that its decision could have \u201cextensive and far-reaching\u201d consequences given the \u201cmany competing interests at stake,\u201d <em>Flo &amp; Eddie, </em>28 N.Y.3d 583, 48 N.Y.S.3d 269, 70 N.E.3d 936.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">Faced with \u201ca complete judicial void\u201d in Florida case law, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit likewise certified similar questions to the Florida Supreme Court in another Flo &amp; Eddie case against Sirius XM. <em>See Flo &amp; Eddie, Inc. v. Sirius XM Radix), Inc., </em>827 F.3d 1016, 1020 (11th Cir. 2016). The Florida Supreme Court has accepted the certified questions and set oral argument for later this year. <em>See </em>Scheduling Order, <em>Flo &amp; Eddie, Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio, Inc., </em>No. SC16-1161 (Fla. Jan. 30, 2017).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">We agree with our sister circuits that certification is the best way to proceed on these issues, especially in California. As an incubator of both musical talent and technological innovation, California has a significant interest in the appropriate resolution of the certified questions. Resolution of these questions will likely affect the state and industries within the state in a variety of ways, and is therefore best left to the California Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"a-m-dedup-0\">No controlling precedent resolves the certified questions. <em>Capitol Records, Inc. v. Erickson, </em>2 Cal.App.3d 526, 82 Cal.Rptr. 798 (1969) and <em>A &amp; M Records, Inc. v. Heilman, </em>75 Cal.App.3d 554, 142 Cal.Rptr. 390 (1977) predate the adoption of section 980(a)(2), and therefore cannot aid us in resolving the first certified question. <em>Erickson </em>and <em>Heilman </em>also address only common law liability for piracy, the unauthorized duplication and distribution of sound recordings for profit. Public performance was not at issue in either case, thereby rendering them unhelpful in resolving the second certified question as well. As such, there is no precedent, much less controlling precedent, from either the California appellate courts or the California Supreme Court to guide our court\u2019s inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">Flo &amp; Eddie\u2019s central argument is that California\u2019s plain meaning rule for interpreting statutes resolves the first certified question. <em>See, e.g., People v. Canty, </em>32 Cal.4th 1266, 14 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 90 P.3d 1168, 1172-73 (2004). Applying the rule, Flo &amp; Eddie contends that the \u201cexclusive ownership\u201d term in section 980(a)(2) allows copyright owners to exclude all unauthorized uses, including public performance. But the statute does not define \u201cexclusive ownership\u201d or \u201cownership.\u201d And while undefined terms are given their ordinary meanings, as appropriate to the context, <em>see Martinez v. Vaziri, </em>246 Cal.App.4th 373, 200 Cal.Rptr.3d 884, 891 (2016) (refusing to construe an undefined phrase in isolation \u201cbecause as a matter of basic statutory interpretation, the words must be construed in context\u201d), it could well be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>said that the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of \u201cexclusive ownership\u201d in the context of copyright is at the very heart of the dispute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">That section 980(a)(2) includes an exception for cover artists does not make the meaning of \u201cexclusive ownership\u201d plain. The exception only establishes that the \u201cownership\u201d rights granted by the statute do not include rights to control cover artists; it does not establish what \u201cownership\u201d rights are included in the first instance. The canons of statutory interpretation are therefore insufficient to aid in the resolution of this case, and do not eliminate the need for clear guidance from California\u2019s highest court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Pandora maintains that Flo &amp; Eddie\u2019s sound recordings lost state copyright protection upon publication in the 1960s, and that the 1982 amendment adopting section 980(a)(2) did not resurrect copyright protection. But this argument depends on an interpretation of the 1947 versions of sections 980(a) and 983(a), which have likewise never been considered by the California Supreme Court. Accordingly, Flo &amp; Eddie cites only off-point lower court eases and out-of-state authority<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for its counterargument that the divestiture-by-publication rule of the 1947 version of section 983(a) did not apply to sound recordings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">In <em>Lone Ranger Television, Inc. v. Program Radio Corp., </em>740 F.2d 718 (9th Cir. 1984),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as Pandora points out, we addressed a similar situation. There, we concluded that broadcast tapes of the Lone Ranger radio show leased to radio stations and sold to the public in the 1950s and 1960s had lost common law or state copyright protection upon general publication under section 983, despite its later repeal. Although binding precedent for our court, <em>Lone Ranger </em>was a case about piracy. It therefore does not help us resolve whether the California legislature intended to grant a right of <em>public performance </em>to owners of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>pre-1972 sound recordings when it explicitly extended copyright protection to sound recordings with the adoption of section 980(a)(2) in 1982. Nor does it resolve whether California\u2019s common law of copyright guarantees a right of <em>public performance, </em>in addition to protecting against piracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Resolving these questions will dispose of this appeal and determine the merits of Flo &amp; Eddie\u2019s underlying claims. The district court concluded that section 980(a)(2) granted owners of pre-1972 sound recordings a property right in the public performance of their recordings. On the basis of that property right, the district court further concluded that Flo &amp; Eddie\u2019s claims of misappropriation, conversion, and unfair competition were legally sufficient. If either section 980(a)(2) or California common law does provide an exclusive right of public performance, the district court\u2019s ruling must be affirmed, and Flo &amp; Eddie\u2019s claims granted. If neither section 980(a)(2) nor California common law provides such a right, the district court\u2019s ruling must be reversed, and the underlying-claims must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">We therefore conclude that this case presents prime questions for the California Supreme Court to address. <em>See </em>Cal. R. Ct. 8.548(a). The answers given by the California Supreme Court will dispose of this appeal currently pending before the Ninth Circuit. We agree to accept the court\u2019s answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">V. Accompanying Materials</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">The clerk of this court is hereby directed to file in the California Supreme Court, under official seal of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, copies of all relevant briefs and excerpts of record, and an original and ten copies of the request with a certification of service on the parties, pursuant to California Rules of Court 8.548(c), (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">The panel will only resume control and jurisdiction of this case upon receiving a decision from the California Supreme Court or upon that court\u2019s decision to decline to answer the certified questions. The parties shall file a joint report informing this court of whether the California Supreme Court has accepted the certified questions, after that determination is made. If the California Supreme Court accepts the certified questions, the parties shall file a joint status report to our court every six months after the date of acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-17\">. California courts have not defined \u201cpublic performance.\u201d Under current federal law, public performance means \"to perform or display [a recording] at a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered,\u201d or \"to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work to ... the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the.same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b978-7\">. Prior to filing this case, Flo &amp; Eddie filed similar actions against online radio service Sirius XM in federal court in California, <em>see Flo &amp; Eddie Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio Inc., </em>No. CV 13-5693 PSG, 2014 WL 4725382 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 22, 2014); in New York, <em>see Flo &amp; Eddie, Inc. v.

Sirius XM appealed adverse rulings in both the New York and Florida cases, after which the Second and Eleventh Circuits certified questions of state law to the New York Court 'of Appeals and Florida Supreme Court, respectively. The New York Court of Appeals recently answered the certified question, holding that New York's common law of copyright does not recognize an exclusive right of public performance for copyright holders. <em>See Flo &amp; Eddie, Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio, Inc., </em>28 N.Y.3d 583, 48 N.Y.S.3d 269, 70 N.E.3d 936 (2016). As a result, the Second Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s order denying summary judgment to Sirius XM and directed the district court to grant summary judgment and dismiss the case with prejudice. <em>Flo &amp; Eddie, Inc. v.

Thus, although the issue before our court is in the context of an appeal from the denial of an anti-SLAPP motion, a ruling on the certified questions would not only dispose of the appeal from the collateral order, but would also resolve the underlying claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b981-6\">. In that case, the court held that copyright holders do not have a right of public performance under New York common law. <em>Flo &amp; Eddie, </em>28 N.Y.3d 583, 48 N.Y.S.3d 269, 70 N.E.3d 936.

The only California case that has touched on the issue is <em>Capitol Records, LLC v. Sirius XM Radio, Inc., </em>No. BC520981, 2014 WL 7150014 (Cal. Super. Ct. Dec. 5, 2014), a Los Angeles County Superior Court case. Seemingly confirming the lack of sufficient guidance from California appellate courts, the <em>Capitol Records </em>court issued a tentative ruling refusing to recognize a public performance right in a jury instruction only to reverse the ruling after the Central District of California reached the opposite conclusion in <em>Sirius. </em>The issue was never resolved, however, as the case later settled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b982-7\">.

At oral argument, the parties focused on the meaning and impact of the out-of-state case <em>RCA Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Whiteman, </em>114 F.2d 86 (2d Cir. 1940), and the duo of cases that were purported to \"overrule\u201d it: <em>Capitol Records, Inc. v.

In a recent decision, the New York Court of Appeals decisively resolved the dispute. The court held that <em>Mercury Records </em>did not overrule the underlying premise of <em>Whiteman, </em>and held that no right of public performance existed under New York common law copyright. <em>See Flo &amp; Eddie, </em>28 N.Y.3d 583, 48 N.Y.S.3d 269, 70 N.E.3d 936.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b982-12\">.
