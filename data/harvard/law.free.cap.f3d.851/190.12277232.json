The Commissioner issued Chai a timely notice of deficiency asserting that he owed self-employment tax on the $2 million payment, plus a 20% accuracy-related penalty. The original notice of deficiency did not assert an income-tax deficiency because the $2 million increase in Chai\u2019s income was initially offset for income-tax purposes (but not self-employment-tax purposes) by his reported share of a partnership loss that could be adjusted only in a separate, partnership-level, proceeding. Chai initiated a deficiency proceeding in the United States Tax Court to challenge the Commissioner\u2019s self-employment-tax determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-20\">While Chai\u2019s deficiency proceeding was pending, losses reported by Mercato Global Opportunities Fund, LP (\u201cMercato\u201d) \u2014 a partnership of which Chai was a member \u2014 were disallowed in a partnership tax proceeding (the <em>\u201cMercato </em>proceeding\u201d). Chai had reported his share of Mercato\u2019s losses on his 2003 personal return. With that loss disallowed, Chai would also owe income tax on the $2 million payment if the Tax Court decided that the payment was income. To collect that tax (and another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>20% accuracy penalty), the Commissioner filed an amended answer in Chai\u2019s personal deficiency proceeding to assert an income-tax deficiency in addition to the original self-employment-tax deficiency. In separate orders, the Tax Court held (1) it lacked jurisdiction over the added income-tax deficiency because I.R.C. \u00a7 6230 required the Commissioner to apply the results of the <em>Mercato </em>proceeding to Chai by computational adjustment, rather than in his deficiency proceeding, and (2) Chai owed the self-employment tax and corresponding penalty. In upholding the penalty assessment, the Tax Court rejected as untimely Chai\u2019s argument, raised for the first time in post-trial briefing, that the Commissioner failed to carry its burden to show compliance with a statutory written-approval requirement. The Commissioner challenges the first ruling, and Chai challenges the second.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">For the reasons discussed below, we hereby: (1) VACATE the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdictional ruling and, because Chai concedes that the $2 million payment is fully taxable, REMAND the case to the Tax Court to enter a revised decision upholding the income-tax deficiency; (2) AFFIRM the portion of the Tax Court\u2019s order upholding the self-employment-tax deficiency; and (3) REVERSE the portion of the Tax Court\u2019s order upholding the accuracy-related penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A2L\">I. Statutory Framework</p>\n<p id=\"Avx\">This case involves the complicated intersection of partnership and individual taxpayer tax court proceedings. Before turning to the facts and procedural background of this case, both of which are encumbered with terminology and concepts that have confounded the parties and the Tax Court, it is helpful to start with a basic outline of the statutory context underlying this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">When the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) audits an individual taxpayer\u2019s return and determines that he owes more than he reported, it must follow statutorily prescribed deficiency procedures to recover unpaid tax, including unpaid self-employment tax imposed by I.R.C. \u00a7 1401(a), as well as any applicable reporting penalty. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6211-6216, 6665(a)(1). Those procedures require the IRS to assert its claim for additional tax and penalty through a notice of deficiency, which the taxpayer may challenge by petition filed in the Tax Court within 90 days of the notice\u2019s issuance. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212(a), 6213(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The' Tax Court \u201cexercises jurisdiction only to the extent provided by statute.\u201d <em>See GAF Corp. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>114 T.C. 519, 521 (2000). Its jurisdiction to redetermine a deficiency asserted by the IRS \u201cdepends upon a valid notice of deficiency and a timely filed petition.\u201d <em>Id.; see Moret</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>ti v. Comm\u2019r, </em>77 F.3d 637, 642 (2d Cir. 1996) (\u201cA notice of deficiency is ... considered the jurisdictional prerequisite to a taxpayer\u2019s suit in the Tax Court for rede-termination of his tax liability.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Where the notice of deficiency is invalid, the Tax Court must dismiss the case. <em>See GAF Corp., </em>114 T.C. at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The IRS is prohibited from assessing and collecting additional tax deficiencies during the period for filing a Tax Court petition. If the taxpayer timely files, that prohibition remains in place until the decision of the Tax Court becomes final. I.R.C. \u00a7 6213(a). Along the same lines, the statute of limitations on the assessment of any additional deficiencies is tolled during that period and for 60 days thereafter. 1.R.C. \u00a7 6503(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Unlike individuals and corporations, partnerships are not separately taxable entities. A partnership\u2019s income and expenses pass through to the individual partners, who must pay a tax on their proportionate shares of net gain or may claim a deduction for their shares of net loss. Partnership tax is subject to the procedures set forth in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (\u201cTEFRA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 97-248, 96 Stat. 324 (codified as amended at I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6221-6234). Central to those procedures is the distinction between partnership and nonpartnership items. \u201cPartnership item[s]\u201d are items more properly determined at the partnership level than at the partner level \u2014 e.g., income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6221, 6231(a)(3). \u201cNonpartnership item[s]\u201d are all of the partnership\u2019s remaining income and expenses that are not \u201cpartnership item[s].\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6231(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">To initiate adjustments to partnership items, TEFRA requires the IRS to conduct a unitary audit of the partnership and issue a final partnership administrative adjustment (\u201cFPAA\u201d) to the partners, which the partners may challenge in a single judicial proceeding (a \u201cTEFRA proceeding\u201d) in, <em>inter alia, </em>the Tax Court. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6223(a)(2), 6226. Adjustments to nonpartnership items follow the standard procedures for adjustments to personal income. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6221, 6230(a)(2)(A). The goal of the TEFRA procedures \u201cis to ensure that, in general, partnership items are adjusted once at the partnership level. A1 partners, whose tax liability will be affected by its outcome, have the opportunity to participate in the audit allowing each to be bound by its result.\u201d <em>Callaway v. Comm\u2019r, </em>231 F.3d 106, 111 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">As with the deficiency proceedings for nonpartnership (i.e., personal) items, the IRS is prohibited from making FPAA-re-lated deficiency assessments during the period in which a partner may challenge the FPAA and, if a challenge is commenced, until after a final Tax Court decision is issued. I.R.C. \u00a7 6225(a). The statute of limitations is likewise tolled during that period and for one year after a final decision. I.R.C. \u00a7 6229(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">Once a partnership-level tax proceeding becomes final (or the time to. seek judicial review of the FPAA expires), the IRS applies the results to each partner\u2019s personal return and calculates any deficiencies. If the deficiency calculation would be purely computational, the Commissioner issues to the partner a \u201cnotice of computational adjustment,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rather than a no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>tice of deficiency. I.R.C. \u00a7 6225; <em>see </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6230(a)(1) (\u201cExcept [in certain circumstances], subchapter B of this chapter [i.e., deficiency procedures] shall not apply to the assessment or collection of any computational adjustment.\u201d).; <em>N.C.F. Energy Partners v. Comm\u2019r, </em>89 T.C. 741, 744 (1987). The deficiency procedures, however, do apply to \u201caffected items\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that require an individual, partner-level factual determination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I.R.C. \u00a7 6230(a)(2)(A). In such instances, the IRS is required to issue, within one year of the outcome of the TEFRA proceeding, an affected-item notice of deficiency (unless it can be folded into the partner\u2019s existing deficiency proceeding).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6229(d), 6230(a)(2)(A)\u00a9; Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6231(a)(6)-1(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The TEFRA provisions (and cases interpreting them) are clear: Partnership-level proceedings must be kept distinct from deficiency proceedings involving individual partners. A problem arises, however, where, as here, a partnership\u2019s net loss is so large that it offsets proposed adjustments to nonpartnership items in a partner\u2019s personal deficiency proceeding. In that case, the loss offset could eliminate some of the partner\u2019s personal tax deficiencies (but not others, such as a self-employment-tax deficiency), and the non-TEFRA adjustments could wind up being uncollectible because of the expiration of the statute of limitations vis-a-vis nonpart-nership items.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">That was the case in <em>Munro v. Commissioner, </em>92 T.C. 71 (1989). There, the IRS presumptively \u2014 i.e., prior to the conclusion of ongoing partnership-level TEFRA proceedings \u2014 issued a notice of deficiency to each partner that disallowed partnership losses for computation purposes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 72-73. The taxpayers moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, asserting that the deficiency was attributable to partnership-level adjustments subject to ongoing TEFRA proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 73-74. Although the Tax Court agreed that a deficiency existed and that it had jurisdiction, the court rejected the IRS computation. The court held that partnership items included on a taxpayer\u2019s return must be \u201ccompletely ignored [for purposes of] determining] if a deficiency exists that is attributable to nonpartnership items.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 74. This became known as the <em>\u201cMunro </em>computation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>But <em>Munro </em>created its own problems for taxpayers and the IRS. A taxpayer/partner, for example, who is subject to concurrent TEFRA and individual deficiency proceedings could be assessed and required to pay a deficiency that would have to be returned by the IRS as an overpayment if partnership losses were ultimately allowed. The taxpayer would effectively be without a prepayment forum to litigate the partnership item adjustments. The IRS similarly would be unable to adjust various nonpartnership deductions where a taxpayer derives income primarily from a partnership, because the income would have to be ignored under <em>Munro. </em>Thus, in 1997, Congress created a procedure \u2014 codified at I.R.C. \u00a7 6234 \u2014 to deal with <em>Munro-</em>like situations. <em>See </em>Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-34, \u00a7 1231(a), 111 Stat. 788, 1020-23, <em>amended by </em>Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-147, \u00a7 416(d)(1)(D), 116 Stat. 21, 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Section 6234 is a helpful method for coordinating deficiency and TEFRA proceedings to avoid the taxpayer losing out on prepayment rights and the IRS losing its ability to assess deficiencies attributable to partnership items. It provides a declaratory judgment procedure for adjustments to \u00e1n oversheltered tax return\u2014 that is, a return that shows no taxable income and a net loss from a TEFRA partnership proceeding. I.R.C. \u00a7 6234(b). In such an instance, the IRS may issue a \u201cnotice of adjustment\u201d for nonpartnership items if \u201cthe adjustments resulting from such determination do not give rise to a deficiency (as defined in section 6211) but would give rise to a deficiency if there were no net loss from partnership items.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I.R.C. \u00a7 6234(a)(3). The taxpayer may challenge the notice of adjustment within 90 days in the Tax Court, which has jurisdiction to determine the correctness of the adjustment. I.R.C. \u00a7 6234(c). If the Tax Court\u2019s decision is upheld (or not contested) and the taxpayer\u2019s partnership items are ultimately adjusted in a subsequent TEFRA proceeding, the IRS may collect any additional deficiency attributable to nonpartnership items. If the TEFRA proceedings conclude before the Tax Court makes a declaration, the notice of adjustment is treated as a notice of deficiency. I.R.C. \u00a7 6234(g)(3). Finally, if the taxpayer does not contest the notice within the period to do so, the taxpayer may seek a refund upon conclusion of the TEFRA proceeding for any deficiencies attributable to partnership items that were ultimately upheld. I.R.C. \u00a7 6234(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">With that baseline in mind, we turn to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">II. The Tax-Shelter Scheme and Chai\u2019s Role as Accommodating Party <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">Chai is a Harvard-trained architect who got involved in a substantial tax-shelter scheme at the urging of Andrew Beer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>after Beer married Chai\u2019s cousin. Central to the self-employment tax inquiry is Chai\u2019s relationship to Beer and role in the various tax shelters.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Beer is an investment manager who \u201ccreated and marketed several tax shelters directed to wealthy individuals\u201d in 2000 and 2001. App\u2019x 234. The goal was to reduce the substantial tax liabilities of prospective clients by generating losses to offset taxable income for a particular year. Among the entities Beer formed to market and advise the tax shelters were Bricolage Capital, LLC (\u201cBricolage\u201d), Counterpoint Capital, LLC (\u201cCounterpoint\u201d), and Delta Currency Trading, LLC (\u201cDelta\u201d). At all relevant times, Beer owned all or a majority of the interests in Delta, Bricolage, and Counterpoint (collectively, the \u201cBricolage entities\u201d). Chai never owned an interest in Delta or Bricolage. The Bricolage entities shared clients, offices, employees and resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">For their services, the Bricolage entities (and particularly Beer as majority owner) collected sizable advisory and client-facilitation fees. The shelters shared three characteristics: (1) each involved a flow-through entity (\u201cFTE\u201d); (2) to garner the tax benefits, the FTEs entered into \u201cstraddle\u201d transactions by which gains would be triggered before the participant entered the shelter and losses would be triggered thereafter, leaving the participant with an interest in only the losses; and (3) each required an accommodation (accommodating party) \u2014 a transitory partner or shareholder \u2014 to serve as initial owner of the straddled gains. This is where Chai came in.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In 2000, Beer offered Chai the opportunity to act as an accommodating party in exchange for compensation from the Brico-lage entities. Chai agreed to a $100,000 annual salary plus a signing bonus and potential discretionary, bonuses. Beer explained to Chai his integral role in the schemes as a conduit and assured Chai that the tax liabilities he incurred in the transactions would be eliminated by later-acquired offsetting losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Pursuant to this arrangement, during 2000 and 2001, Chai served as the accommodating party for at least 131 tax shelters and reported over $3.2 billion of shelter-derived income. He received and reported equal offsetting losses during that time. In his capacity as accommodating party, Chai executed numerous transactions and traveled to the offices of Delta and its affiliates \u201ca lot\u201d and \u201cregularly.\u201d App\u2019x 238. Due to travel conflicts with his architecture business, however, Chai was often unable to be physically present to sign documents in his capacity as accommodating party. To resolve the problem, Chai formed JJC Trading, LLC (\u201cJJC\u201d) in 2001 at Delta\u2019s suggestion. Chai was sole owner of JJC and Brico-lage was named a nonmember-manager with discretionary and signatory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Chai\u2019s friendship with Beer and the resulting business arrangement proved fruitful for Chai. In 2000, for instance, Chai received $1.2 million as a signing bonus from Counterpoint, and in 2001, he received $1 million from Delta. Both entities reported the payments as 'nonemployee compensation (on IRS Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income), and Chai reported them as income on his tax returns. Chai also received the agreed-upon $100,000 annual salary from Bricolage and Counterpoint in each of 2001 and 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">On his 2001 return, Chai made a series of income-offsetting declarations related to his arrangement with Beer. Chai reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>on Schedule C<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u2014 the form for \u201cProfit or Loss From Business (Sole Proprietorship)\u201d- \u2014 -that he \u201c \u2018materially partieipate[d]\u2019 in the operation of [JJC\u2019s] business during 2001,\u201d thereby entitling him to favorable treatment under passive-loss rules. Supp. App\u2019x 146. Chai described certain capital losses as \u201cdisposition^] of business property,\u201d which, under I.R.C. \u00a7 1231, allowed him to treat JJC\u2019s losses as ordinary losses. Supp. App\u2019x 160-65. Chai also made a \u201cmark-to-market\u201d election for JJC under I.R.C. \u00a7 475(f) \u2014 an election limited to persons \u201cengaged in a trade or business as a trader in securities.\u201d Supp. App\u2019x 156, 166; <em>see also </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 475(f)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">By the end of 2001, all of Chai\u2019s \u25a0 and JJC\u2019s interests in the tax shelters had been liquidated. In April 2002, after Chai received a $1 million payment from Delta, Delta\u2019s financial officer, Helen Del Bove, emailed Chai that she would be \u201cfinalizing some numbers within the next week or so\u201d regarding additional fees he would receive from Delta in the future. Supp. App\u2019x 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In February 2003, Chai and Del Bove discussed the proper tax treatment of a prospective $2 million payment from Delta to Chai. Del Bove told Chai that she was going to wire him the $436,000 remaining in JJC, dissolve that entity, and pay him another $2 million. Chai asked her how the payments should be treated and whether he would be issued an IRS Form 1099 for the whole amount. Del Bove told him multiple times that the $2 million payment was income and that Delta would report it on his Form 1099 for 2003. Beer subsequently authorized on behalf of Delta a payment of $2 million to Chai as a discretionary bonus. Delta, consistent with Del Bove\u2019s guidance, treated the payment as non-employee compensation on Chai\u2019s Form 1099 for 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">III. Chai\u2019s 2003 Return and Related Audits</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Chai did not report the $2 million payment from Delta as taxable income on his 2003 return. Instead, in filing his return, he took the position that it constituted the return of capital from his investments. Chai, however, was not a partner of, and did not invest any capital in, Delta. And neither Chai nor JJC reported any portion of Delta\u2019s income or'loss in 2003. No corresponding tax form was prepared by Delta for Chai. Chai\u2019s return showed an overall loss of $11,466,070 (with $0 tax), the majority of which ($11,149,621) came from his share of partnership losses claimed by Mercato \u2014 a partnership of which Chai was a member and that had no direct connection to the $2 million Delta payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">The IRS conducted separate, but concurrent, audits of Chai\u2019s and Mercato\u2019s 2003 returns. The audit of Chai\u2019s return resulted in a net increase income adjustment of $2,397,139, primarily due to the unreported $2 million payment from Delta. In its May 5, 2009 notice of deficiency to Chai, the IRS characterized the $2 million Delta payment as self-employment income and therefore asserted a corresponding deficiency in Chai\u2019s self-employment tax. At that time, the IRS did not assert a deficiency in Chai\u2019s \u201cregular\u201d income tax related to the $2 million payment because it was prohibited from adjusting Chai\u2019s $11.1 million share of the Mercato loss prior to the conclusion of the <em>Mercato </em>proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">Meanwhile, the audit of Mercato led the IRS to issue, on June 17, 2009, an FPAA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>that completely disallowed Mercato\u2019s $110 million claimed loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In separate proceedings over the following years, Chai challenged the notice of deficiency and Mercato challenged the FPAA in the <em>Mercato </em>proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">IV. The Tax Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Soon after filing an answer in Chai\u2019s deficiency proceeding in the Tax Court, the Commissioner concluded that, under <em>Munro,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>he should have included in the May 2009 notice a deficiency in Chai\u2019s income tax that would result from the approximately $2.4 million upward adjustment to Chai\u2019s income if his share of the Mercato loss were removed. That is, if Chai\u2019s reported $11.1 million share in Mer-cato\u2019s losses were ignored, his overall loss would decrease from approximately $11.5 million to approximately $400,000; the $2.4 million adjustment would therefore result in $2 million of taxable income. On October 30, 2009, the Commissioner filed an Amendment to Answer in Chai\u2019s deficiency proceeding asserting an additional deficiency in income tax ($563,868) and a corresponding additional 20% penalty ($112,-773.80).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">On June 3, 2013, the <em>Mercato </em>proceeding concluded. In an order dated September 13, 2013, the Tax Court disallowed all of Mercato\u2019s losses for 2003. Under I.R.C. \u00a7 6229(d), the IRS had one year from that date to assess any computational deficiency in Chai\u2019s 2003 income tax and penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">In December 2013, at the beginning of trial in Chai\u2019s personal deficiency proceeding, Chai moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction the claims made by the Commissioner in his 2009 Amendment to Answer.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Chai did not dispute the disal-lowance of the Mercato loss. Instead, he argued that, rather than asserting the additional claims for income tax due after disallowance of the Mercato losses in' Chai\u2019s present deficiency proceeding, the Commissioner had to issue a notice of computational adjustment \u2014 the method by which the IRS notifies partners of purely computational deficiency assessments and related penalties resulting from the application of the outcome of a partnership-level proceeding to their returns. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6225, 6230(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">The Commissioner countered that he had \u201cproperly recomputed the [asserted] deficiency and penalty\u201d in the 2009 Amendment to Answer by removing Chai\u2019s share of the partnership loss from the computation, as required by <em>Munro. </em>Supp. App\u2019x 10-11. Alternatively, the Commissioner argued, even if <em>Munro </em>did not apply because the <em>Munro </em>computation here would effect a complete, rather than partial, disallowance of the partnership losses, the Tax Court could \u201cnow take jurisdiction and rule on\u201d the recomputed amounts pursuant to its I.R.C. \u00a7 6212 deficiency juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>diction (as augmented by I.R.C; \u00a7 6214(a)). Supp. App\u2019x 17. In support, the Commissioner relied on <em>Harris v. Commissioner, </em>99 T.C. 121, 123 (1992), for the proposition that \u201conce partnership items are resolved, the Court may take those partnership items 'into account for computational purposes in a [partner\u2019s previously initiated] deficiency proceeding.\u201d Supp. App\u2019x 17 (citing <em>Harris, </em>99 T.C. at 123).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The Commissioner alternatively argued (as he does here) that the $2 million payment (or the deficiency attributable thereto) was an \u201caffected item\u201d under I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6230(a)(2)(A)\u00a9 and 6231(a)(5). He asserted that the claim for the increased deficiency was contingent upon the Tax Court\u2019s resolution of the dispute over the $2 million payment from- Delta, which the IRS termed a substantive \u201cpartner-level [individual taxpayer] determination\u201d with respect to an \u201caffected item.\u201d Supp. App\u2019x 13. As the Commissioner has now acknowledged, it was an odd fit. Nevertheless, recognizing that the affected-item argument might render the Amendment to Answer ineffective to confer jurisdiction over the additional deficiency, the Commissioner also sought leave to amend the answer again to formally reassert the income-tax deficiency claim now that the <em>Mercato </em>proceeding was final.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Tax Court granted leave to file what it restyled as the \u201cFirst Amendment to Answer\u201d on April 24, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Y. The Tax Court\u2019s Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"abs-dedup-0\">A. The Jurisdictional Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">On February 13, 2015,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the Tax Court granted Chai\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the Commissioner\u2019s claim for additional income tax. The court agreed with Chai that the 2009 Amendment to Answer attempted \u201cto increase a taxpayer\u2019s deficiency based on the Commissioner\u2019s proposed, but unadjudieat-ed, adjustments to .. \u25a0. partnership items\u201d in violation of <em>Munro. </em>Supp. App\u2019x 40. The court did not address the Commissioner\u2019s now-primary argument that, even if <em>Munro </em>did not allow the amendment, under <em>Harris </em>the court obtained jurisdiction over the newly added claims once the <em>Mercato </em>decision became final simply by virtue of its I.R.C. \u00a7 6212 deficiency jurisdiction (as augmented by I.R.C. \u00a7 6214(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">The court also rejected the Commissioner\u2019s argument that it obtained jurisdiction by virtue of the First Amendment to Answer based on the affected-item theory. The \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d under an affected-item theory, said the court, was \u201cwhether the increased deficiency ... requires a partner-level determination before it can be assessed.\u201d Supp. App\u2019x 42. The court held that it did not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">There is no factual determination that must occur in the petitioner\u2019s deficiency proceeding before respondent can apply the results of the [Mercato] proceeding. The disallowed losses from the <em>[Merca-</em>to] proceeding can be applied to petitioner\u2019s 2003 income taxes regardless of the outcome of this deficiency proceeding (whether the $2 million at issue in this ease is taxable non-employee compensation or a return of capital).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">Supp. App\u2019x 43. In the court\u2019s view, \u201csection 6230(a)(1) requires that the results of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the [Mercato] proceeding be applied to [Chai] through a Notice of Computational Adjustment.\u201d Supp. App\u2019x 43. Thus, the court found that the First Amendment to Answer did not give the court jurisdiction over the increased deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The Commissioner moved for reconsideration, noting that he had already applied the results of the <em>Mercato </em>proceeding to Chai\u2019s 2003 tax return in an August 2014 notice of computational adjustment \u2014 that is, he automatically applied the disallowed loss to Chai\u2019s then-agreed upon income\u2014 $49,869 \u2014 and determined income tax thereon. However, the Commissioner explained, the IRS could not apply the additional deficiency claimed as a result of the $2 million Delta payment without treating it as taxable income in its computations. And it could not treat the payment as taxable income because the court had not yet ruled in the deficiency proceeding that Chai had received the payment as gross income, rather than as a return of capital or a gift. In other words, the Commissioner argued, the partner-level ruling regarding the proper treatment of the $2 million payment was necessary before it could assess the additional deficiency. The Tax Court denied the motion for reconsideration, without comment, on April 16, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">B. The Self-Employment Tax Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">On May 6, 2015, the Tax Court entered its final decision upholding the deficiency in Chai\u2019s self-employment tax and an accuracy-related penalty. The court noted that \u201c[t]he character of a payment for tax purposes is determined by the intent of the parties, particularly the intent of the pay- or, as disclosed by the surrounding facts and circumstances.\u201d App\u2019x 245-46 (collecting cases). Gross income, the court explained, \u201cgenerally includes all income from whatever source derived, including compensation for services in the form of fees, commissions, or fringe benefits.\u201d App\u2019x 245 (citing I.R.C. \u00a7 61(a)(1)). A return of capital or receipt of a gift, on the other hand, is not taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Here, the court found that the trial testimony and record evidence (including the contemporaneous email exchange with Del Bove and other correspondence between Chai and Delta personnel) supported the conclusion that the $2 million payment was compensation subject to self-employment tax. The court rejected Chai\u2019s attempts to minimize his role in the tax shelters, finding instead that his role \u201cwas' a critical component of the transactions and the tax shelters could not have functioned as planned without [his] participation.\u201d App\u2019x 246. Additionally, the court found that the evidence contradicted Chai\u2019s characterization of the payment as a return of capital. Instead, the evidence showed that Chai was not a partner or investor in- Delta and did not have a capital investment in any tax-shelter entity after 2001. Neither was the payment a gift from Beer, the court held, as \u201c[t]he record is devoid of any evidence suggesting that the payment resulted from detached and disinterested generosity.\u201d App\u2019x 255. Finally, the court held that, as necessary to be subject to self-employment tax, \u201cthe record demonstrate[d] that [Chai] accommodated tax shelters with sufficient continuity, regularity, and a profit motive such that he was engaged in a trade or business as a tax shelter accommodating party.\u201d App\u2019x 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">C. The Penalty Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">In post-trial briefing, Chai argued for the first time that the Commissioner had failed to satisfy his burden of production under I.R.C. \u00a7 7491(c) \u201cby not introducing evidence of his compliance with section 6751(b)(1),\u201d which requires written supervisory approval of certain penalty determinations. App\u2019x 256. The court declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>consider Chai\u2019s argument, finding, it untimely and that the Commissioner would be prejudiced by its consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The court then upheld the 20% accuracy-related penalty asserted in the notice of deficiency. The court held that the Commissioner had satisfied his burden to prove the existence and amount of deficiency, and that Chai failed to satisfy the reasonable-cause exception because he could not establish justified reliance on his accountant.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Chai filed a timely notice of appeal on May 18, 2015, and the Commissioner filed a notice of cross-appeal on July 24, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">VI. Proceedings in this Court</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In January 2016, Chai moved to dismiss as untimely the Commissioner\u2019s cross-appeal, arguing that the Tax Court\u2019s February 2015 jurisdictional order dismissing the IRS\u2019s claims for the additional deficiency and penalty was an immediately appealable \u201cdispositive order\u201d within the meaning of Tax Court Rule 190(b)(1). In March 2016, a panel of this Court denied Chai\u2019s motion, citing <em>Estate of Yaeger v. Commissioner, </em>801 F.2d 96, 98 (2d Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the Tax Court\u2019s legal conclusions and for clear error its factual findings. <em>Callaway, </em>231 F.3d at 115 (citing I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1)). \u201cIn particular, \u2018[w]e owe no deference to the Tax Court\u2019s statutory interpretations, its relationship to us being that of a district court to a court of appeals, not that of an administrative agency to a court of appeals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Exacto Spring Corp. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>196 F.3d 833, 838 (7th Cir. 1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">I. The Jurisdictional Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">A. We Have Jurisdiction Over the Commissioner\u2019s Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">As an initial matter, Chai again asserts that the Commissioner\u2019s cross-appeal is untimely. While we need not revisit our prior decision denying his motion to dismiss, we explain briefly why it stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">With exceptions not relevant here, the United States Courts of Appeals \u201chave exclusive jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Tax Court ... in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). In the context of an appeal from a district court decision, \u201c[fjederal appellate jurisdiction generally depends on the existence of \u2022 a decision by the District Court that \u2018ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 467, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978) (quoting <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945)); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (generally limiting appellate jurisdiction to \u201cappeals from ... final decisions of the district courts\u201d). The Third Circuit has stated that \u201c[j]urisdiction under section 7482(a)(1) ... extends only to a \u2018final decision\u2019 of the tax court.\u201d <em>N.Y. Football Giants, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>349 F.3d 102, 105 (3d Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Ryan v. Comm\u2019r, </em>680 F.2d 324, 326 (3d Cir. 1982)). This Court has held \u201cthat Tax Court decisions are appealable only if they dispose of an entire case.\u201d <em>Estate of Yaeger, </em>801 F.2d at 98. A notice of appeal from the Tax Court must be filed within 90 days of the entry of such \u201cdecision,\u201d or within 120 days of the entry of \u201cdecision\u201d if another party has filed a timely notice of appeal. I.R.C. \u00a7 7483.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Here, the Tax Court entered its final decision on May 6, 2015.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Chai filed a notice of appeal 12 days later. The Commissioner filed a notice of appeal on July 24, 2016, 49 days after entry of the Tax Court\u2019s decision and well before the 120-day limit set by \u00a7 7483. The Commissioner\u2019s notice was therefore timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Chai contends that the Commissioner\u2019s notice was untimely because the Tax Court\u2019s February 13, 2015 dispositive order concerning its jurisdiction over the income-tax deficiency was the operative final decision for the cross-appeal. An order is an appealable final decision only when it was \u201cclearly intended to end a litigation.\u201d <em>SongByrd, Inc. v. Estate of Grossman, </em>206 F.3d 172, 178 (2d Cir. 2000). Because the Tax Court\u2019s February 13, 2015 order was not intended to dispose of the Commissioner\u2019s initial self-employment-tax-deficiency claim and end the proceeding in the Tax Court, that order was not immediately appealable. <em>See Coopers &amp; Lybrand, </em>437 U.S. at 467, 98 S.Ct. 2454.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Chai\u2019s central argument that Tax Court Rule 190(b)(1), which provides that a \u201cdis-positive order ... shall be treated as a decision of the Court for purposes of appeal,\u201d rendered the February 13, 2015 order immediately appealable is meritless. As discussed above, a final decision must clearly be intended to end the litigation; Rule 190(b)(1) does not address finality and must be read in a manner consistent with the statutory finality requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">We also reject Chai\u2019s argument that the February 13, 2015 order was final and appealable under I.R.C. \u00a7; 7481(a)(1), which provides that a \u201cdecision of the Tax Court shall become final ... [u]pon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a notice of appeal.\u201d That subsection addresses finality only when a \u201c[t]imely notice of appeal [has] not [been] filed,\u201d <em>see id. </em>without dictating when the time to file a notice begins. Chai\u2019s argument thus begs the question in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">B. The Tax Court\u2019s Jurisdictional Ruling was Incofrect</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">The odd posture of this case has confounded even the Commissioner; he has offered several theories to support his request for reversal, only to abandon them to focus on others. The problem is that the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s jurisdictional provisions have gaps, and this case lands neatly within one. The irony is that no one \u2014 not even Chai \u2014 disputes that, as a result of the decision in the <em>Mercato </em>proceeding disallowing the partnership losses, Chai has $2 million of net income on which he has not paid income tax. The question is, can the IRS collect it?</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">More precisely, we must decide whether the Tax Court had jurisdiction over the additional income-tax deficiency when the Commissioner filed the First Amendment to Answer at the conclusion of the <em>Mercato </em>proceeding, at some earlier time, or not at all. In plain English: Did the Tax Court have the authority to consider the re-determination of Chai\u2019s partnership losses in deciding his income-tax liability resulting from his receipt of the $2 million Delta payment \u2014 a payment that had nothing to do with his Mercato partnership interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">The Commissioner has abandoned his prior reliance on <em>Munro </em>and instead advances two somewhat contradictory arguments as to how the Tax Court erred in its jurisdictional analysis. His primary argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>ment is that, for much the same reasons set forth in <em>Harris, </em>the Tax Court obtained jurisdiction over the increased deficiency because the Commissioner\u2019s First Amendment to Answer was filed after the conclusion of the <em>Mercato </em>proceeding and prior to the Tax Court\u2019s decision in Chai\u2019s deficiency proceeding. Alternatively, the Commissioner argues that the claim for the increased deficiency is attributable to an \u201caffected item,\u201d requiring a partner-level determination. Chai responds that <em>Harris </em>is inapposite and that this is not an affected-item case. He seems to suggest, as did the Tax Court, that the only way for the Commissioner to have assessed the additional deficiency was by issuing a notice of computational adjustment\u201d under I.R.C. \u00a7 6230(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">This case does not fit neatly into the statutory methods marrying TEFRA and deficiency proceedings. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6234. But procedural oddities do not mean the tax is uncollectible. For the following reasons, we are persuaded that the Tax Court erred in dismissing the Commissioner\u2019s claim for the additional income-tax deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We start with two uneontr-oversial premises. <em>First, </em>the IRS could not have assessed the income-tax deficiency attributable to the $2 million Delta payment until the <em>Mercato </em>proceeding concluded. It is textbook tax law, affirmed in <em>Munro, </em>that any increased deficiency (and penalty) attributable to a proposed, but not-yet-adjudicated, adjustment to a partnership item at issue in a TEFRA proceeding must await the outcome of the partnership-level proceeding. <em>Munro, </em>92 T.C. at 74; <em>see also GAF Corp., </em>114 T.C. at 521-28 (dismissing for lack of jurisdiction a notice of deficiency issued prior to the completion of related partnership-level proceedings). <em>Second, </em>as a general matter, the scope of a deficiency proceeding may be expanded to cover any additional deficiencies for the tax year beyond those asserted.in a statutorily-compliant notice of deficiency that is the subject of the proceeding. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6214(a) (\u201c[T]he Tax Court shall have jurisdiction to redetermine the correct amount of the deficiency even if the amount so redetermined is greater than the amount of the deficiency, notice of which has been mailed to the taxpayer, and to determine whether any additional amount, or any addition to the tax should be assessed, if claim therefor is asserted by the Secretary [through the Commissioner] at or before the hearing or a rehearing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The Tax Court\u2019s decision was, at bottom, based on the blanket assertion that, because the increased deficiency was not an \u201caffected item\u201d under \u00a7 6230(a)(2)(A)(i), \u201csection 6230(a)(1) <em>required] </em>that the results of the [Mercato] proceeding be applied to [Chai] through a Notice of Computational Adjustment.\u201d' Supp. App\u2019x 43 (emphasis added); <em>see </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6230(a)(1) (\u201cExcept [in certain circumstances], subchapter B of this chapter [i.e., deficiency procedures] shall not apply to the assessment or collection of any computational adjustment.\u201d). We agree that neither the increased deficiency attributable to the $2 million payment by virtue of the disallowed Mercato losses nor the $2 million payment itself is an \u201caffected item.\u201d As the Commissioner has effectively conceded in arguing its primary position, the $2 million Delta payment is not an \u201caffected item,\u201d since \u201cthe disallowance of the Mercato loss has no bearing on whether $2 million is includible in [Chai\u2019s] income.\u201d Comm\u2019r Br. 50 n.16. In other words, the proper treatment of the $2 million payment was unaffected by the <em>Mercato </em>proceeding; the disallowance affected only the tax consequences of that treatment. And an increased deficiency in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>itself is not an affected item for purposes of \u00a7 6230(a)(2)(A)(i), since that section refers to deficiencies as attributable to (not themselves constituting) affected items.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">We disagree, however, with the Tax Court\u2019s framing of the inquiry as \u201cwhether the increased deficiency is an affected item that requires a partner-level determination before it can be assessed\u201d and its conclusion that, where \u00a7 6230(a)(2) does not apply, the results of the partnership-level proceeding <em>necessarily </em>must be applied to the taxpayer through a notice of computational adjustment. Supp. App\u2019x 42. We conclude, to the contrary, that a computational adjustment is not the only method that may be employed when \u00a7 6230(a)(2) does not apply. When a computational adjustment is not feasible, \u00a7 6230(a)(l)\u2019s bar on the use of deficiency procedures does not apply. This case illustrates the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The IRS did exactly as the Tax Court prescribed with respect to the income Chai did report \u2014 in the August 2014 computational adjustment, the Commissioner calculated $10,269 of tax on the $49,869 of <em>other </em>income that Chai stated on his 2003 return. The Tax Court and Chai seem to suggest, however, that the IRS should have also included in its computational adjustment the income-tax deficiency attributable to the unreported $2 million Delta payment. But Chai did not report the $2 million payment as income on his 2003 return. Thus, in order to assess the deficiency the Commissioner still needed a determination in Chai\u2019s individual deficiency proceeding as to the nature of the $2 million payment \u2014 i.e., as the Tax Court put it, \u201cwhether the $2 million at issue in this case [was] taxable non-employee compensation or a [non-taxable] return of capital.\u201d Supp. App\u2019x 43. The Tax Court and Chai would have the IRS collect the tax purportedly due on a payment, the treatment of which was the subject of ongoing deficiency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">This is an odd position for Chai to take. He is essentially arguing that the Commissioner should have denied him a prepayment forum to adjudicate the treatment of the $2 million payment simply by virtue of the disallowance of the partnership losses, belying a fundamental axiom of the Federal income tax structure: A taxpayer is typically \u201centitled to an appeal and to a determination of his liability for the tax prior to its payment.\u201d <em>Flora v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 145, 159, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed.2d 623 (1960) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 68-179, at 7 (1924)). We have no doubt that had the Commissioner done as Chai suggests \u2014 assess by computational adjustment a deficiency attributable to a still-disputed $2 million payment \u2014 Chai would have cried foul, taking the position exactly opposite to the one he adopts now. A notice of computational adjustment was not the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">So what was? It cannot be that the additional deficiency is insulated from assessment simply because of the timing of the conclusion of the partnership-level proceeding. By that we mean, had the <em>Merca-to </em>proceeding concluded after the Tax Court determined in Chai\u2019s deficiency proceeding that the $2 million Delta payment constituted income, the IRS could have assessed the additional income-tax deficiency in a notice of computational adjustment. But, under the Tax Court\u2019s approach, the additional tax is unassessable simply because the <em>Mercato </em>proceeding concluded before the Tax Court determined the proper treatment of the unreported $2 million payment \u2014 i.e., before the IRS had the legal predicate to assess Chai\u2019s additional income-tax deficiency. We read neither \u00a7 6230 nor any other statutory. provision to require the anomalous result of depriving the Tax Court of delicien-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>cy jurisdiction in all cases where \u00a7 6230(a)(2) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><em>Harris </em>supports our conclusion. In <em>Harris, </em>the Tax Court rejected the Commissioner\u2019s argument that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the effect of a separate TEFRA partnership proceeding in an ongoing deficiency proceeding. The court acknowledged that, under I.R.C. \u00a7 6230(a)(2)(A)(ii), a TEFRA \u201csettlement is applied to a partner by means of a computational adjustment and not under the ordinary deficiency ... procedures,\u201d but it did not read that provision to deprive the court \u201cof jurisdiction to take account of the settled items pursuant to section 6214(b).\u201d <em>Harris, </em>99 T.C. at 126. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">[Ajfter a settlement has been reached, the substantive partnership level issues have been resolved, and all that remains is the mechanical procedure of applying such settlement to the partner. Once substantive partnership level determinations have been made, the congressional objective in enacting the TEFRA partnership provisions has been accomplished. Consequently, the provisions mandating separation of partner and partnership level proceedings can be relaxed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Munro, </em>92 T.C. at 73-74).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The Commissioner reads <em>Harris </em>as standing for the proposition that the TEFRA-mandated adjustments subsequent to the filing of the notice of deficiency \u201cbecome subsumed within the partner\u2019s then-existing deficiency posture, and the court continues to exercise its standard deficiency jurisdiction (as augmented by \u00a7 6214(a), if the subsequent adjustments result in a claim for an increased deficiency).\u201d Comm\u2019r Br. 48. That is, \u201conce the <em>Mercato </em>decision became final, the resulting $11.1 million adjustment to [Chai\u2019s] income became subsumed within his then-existing deficiency posture.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Chai responds that the Commissioner\u2019s theory \u201cattempts to avoid TEFRA and use ordinary deficiency procedures to apply the results of <em>Mercato </em>to [Chai].\u201d Chai Reply Br. 10. He argues that <em>Harris </em>is inapposite, largely because of details the Commissioner elided. <em>Harris, </em>Chai asserts, relied on the fact that \u201c[w]hen the Commissioner and a partner enter into a settlement with respect to partnership items, however, <em>such items become nonpartnership items. </em>Sec. 6231(b)(1)(C).\u201d Chai Reply Br. 12-13 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Harris, </em>99 T.C. at 126 (emphasis added)). Here, Chai argues, there was no settlement and the disallowed Mercato losses therefore were not converted into nonpart-nership items. <em>See </em>Chai Reply Br. 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Chai misreads <em>Harris </em>and \u00a7 6230(a)(2)(A)(ii). True, settled partnership items become nonpartnership items pursuant to \u00a7 6231(b)(1) and there was no settlement here. Also true, \u00a7 6230 specifically provides that deficiency procedures apply to certain \u201citems which have become nonpartnership items.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6230(a)(2)(A)(ii). But the jurisdictional dispute in <em>Harris </em>arose precisely from the fact that, under \u00a7 6230, deficiencies attributable to settled partnership items \u2014 unlike deficiencies attributable to other \u201citems which have become nonpartnership items\u201d \u2014 are <em>excepted </em>from the deficiency procedures. I.R.C. \u00a7 6230(a)(2)(A)(ii) (stating that deficiency procedures apply to \u201citems which have become nonpartnership items <em>(other than by reason of section 6231(b)(1)(C))\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); <em>see </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6231(b)(1)(C) (providing that partnership items become nonpartnership items upon settlement). Thus, it mattered not that the settled items became nonpart-nership items under \u00a7 6231(b)(1)(C). The point is, the settled items were not subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>to the deficiency procedures under \u00a7 6230(a)(2)(A)(ii), but were nevertheless found to be the proper subject of a deficiency proceeding by the <em>Harris </em>court. Thus, as the Commissioner explains, \u201cfor jurisdictional purposes, the erstwhile partnership items in <em>Hams </em>are indistinguishable from the Mercato partnership items.\u201d Comm\u2019r Reply Br. 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We agree. Section 6230(a)(2)(A)(ii) was meant \u201cto enable the Commissioner to collect amounts due as a result of settlements without the necessity of issuing a statutory notice of deficiency,\u201d not to deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction to decide cases like this. <em>See Hards, </em>99 T.C. at 126. That does not mean purely computational adjustments will not continue to be assessed via notice of computational adjustment, outside of normal deficiency procedures. Indeed, the IRS used that procedure here. The results of the <em>Mercato </em>proceeding\u2014 applied to Chai by computational adjustment \u2014 increased Chai\u2019s taxable income to $49,869,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and \u00a7 6230 did not require the Tax Court to ignore the effect of that increase on the deficiency computation in the ongoing deficiency proceeding. Rather, the Tax Court had jurisdiction to redetermine the deficiency by virtue of I.R.C. \u00a7 6214(a) upon the conclusion of the <em>Mer-cato </em>proceeding. For those reasons, we hold that the Tax Court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over the additional income-tax deficiency attributable to the $2 million Delta payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">This result is not inconsistent with I.R.C. \u00a7 6234 or <em>Munro. </em>At first blush, this would appear the ideal case for the IRS to issue a \u00a7 6234 notice of adjustment, which provides a declaratory judgment procedure for asserting deficiencies relating to oversheltered returns prior to the conclusion of partnership-level proceedings. However, the provision (read literally) does not apply to situations where the adjustments to nonpartnership items would result in a deficiency even if the partnership losses were given effect. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6234(a)(3) (applying where \u201cthe adjustments resulting from such determination do not give rise to a deficiency (as defined in section 6211) but would give rise to a deficiency if there were no net loss from partnership items\u201d). The typical example is where the IRS asserts a deficiency in income that would result in an adjusted net income so much greater than the taxpayer\u2019s partnership losses that the adjustment would result in a deficiency even if the partnership losses are allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">But this case is a bit different. If Chai\u2019s partnership losses were given effect, the adjustment to Chai\u2019s nonpartnership item (the $2 million payment) would still result in a self-employment tax deficiency (since self-employment income is not offset by partnership losses), but not an income-tax deficiency (since his partnership losses would still far exceed his adjusted net income). Because a deficiency \u2014 albeit not an income-tax deficiency \u2014 would exist, we agree with the Commissioner that \u00a7 6234 was not available. <em>See </em>Comm\u2019r Br. 42 (asserting that \u00a7 6234 does not apply \u201cbecause the adjustment gave rise to an asserted deficiency in self-employment tax notwithstanding [Chai\u2019s] reported share of the Mercato loss\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">This makes sense in light of \u00a7 6234. Where there is no deficiency after crediting partnership losses, the IRS cannot issue a timely notice of deficiency (which would suspend the limitations period for deficiencies attributable to nonpart-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>nership item adjustments) prior to the conclusion of the partnership-level proceeding; that is where \u00a7 6234 comes into play. But the existence of the self-employment-tax deficiency here gave the IRS a basis for a valid notice of deficiency, obviating the need for a \u00a7 6234 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Further, in instances like this, where \u00a7 6234 does not apply, <em>Munro </em>typically continues to apply, except, the Commissioner argues, \u201cwhere ... the non-partnership income reported on an oversheltered return is itself zero or negative,\u201d and \u201cthe <em>Munro </em>computation [thereby] has the same effect as a complete disallowance of the partner\u2019s reported share of the partnership loss, contrary to the intent of the TEFRA provisions.\u201d Comm\u2019r Br. 42-43; <em>accord </em>IRM 4.31.6.2.5.1 (Aug. 1, 2006). While we are skeptical about the Commissioner\u2019s argument (for reasons set forth in the margin),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> there is no need to decide whether <em>Munro </em>applied here. <em>Munro </em>provides a method for computing (and suspending the limitation period for) partner-level deficiencies attributable to nonpart-nership items prior to the conclusion of the partnership-level proceedings. Because the <em>Mercato </em>proceeding ended before Chai\u2019s personal deficiency proceeding, <em>Munro </em>is inconsequential. Once the <em>Mercato </em>proceeding concluded, the Tax Court had jurisdiction by virtue of its standard I.R.C. \u00a7 6212 deficiency jurisdiction (as augmented by I.R.C. \u00a7 6214(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">II. The Self-Employment Tax Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">This Court reviews the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings as to whether Chai\u2019s role in Beer\u2019s tax shelters constituted a \u201ctrade or business\u201d within the meaning of I.R.C. \u00a7 1402(a) under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>UFCW Local One Pension Fund v.

Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>41 F.3d 1570, 1575 (2d Cir. 1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">B. The Two-Prong <em>Groetzinger </em>Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">Under I.R.C. \u00a7 1401, self-employment taxes (which amount to the equivalent combined Social Security and Medicare taxes on wages imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act) are imposed on \u201cthe net earnings from self-employment derived by an individual ... during any taxable year.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 1402(b). \u201c[N]et earnings from self-employment\u201d is defined generally as \u201cthe gross income derived by an individual from any <em>trade or business </em>carried on by such individual.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 1402(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">While \u00a7 1402 does not define \u201ctrade or business,\u201d the Supreme Court in <em>Commissioner v. Groetzinger, </em>480 U.S. 23, 32-36, 107 S.Ct. 980, 94 L.Ed.2d 25 (1987), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>considered the meaning of the phrase as it appears in I.R.C. \u00a7 162(a). <em>Groetzinger </em>noted that the terms are \u201cbroad and comprehensive,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 31, 107 S.Ct. 980, and that the determination of whether a taxpayer is carrying on a trade or business \u201crequires an examination of the facts in each case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 36,107 S.Ct. 980 (quoting <em>Higgins v. Comm\u2019r, </em>312 U.S. 212, 217, 61 S.Ct. 475, 85 L.Ed. 783 (1941)). The Court confined its construction of the term to the tax statute at issue in that case and \u201cd[id] not purport to construe the phrase where it appears in other places.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27 n.8, 107 S.Ct. 980. However, the phrase \u201ctrade or business\u201d in \u00a7 1401 (at issue here) is to be given the same meaning as the same phrase in \u00a7 162. I.R.C. \u00a7 1402(c). Thus, as the parties agree, <em>\u201cGroetzinger1 s </em>construction of \u2018trade or business\u2019 is the most helpful authoritative pronouncement available, and worthy of reliance here.\u201d <em>UFCW Local One, </em>791 F.3d at 373. Accordingly, for Chai\u2019s role in the tax shelters to be a \u201ctrade or business\u201d under \u00a7 1401, he must have engaged in the activity: \u201c(1) for the primary purpose of income or profit; and (2) with continuity and regularity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Groetzinger, </em>480 U.S. at 35, 107 S.Ct. 980). \u201cA sporadic activity, a hobby, or an amusement diversion does not qualify.\u201d <em>Groetzinger, </em>480 U.S. at 35, 107 S.Ct. 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Primary Purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The Tax Court dealt with this prong swiftly, and rightly so, finding that Chai \u201cwas paid for his services through large lump-sum payments that were reported by the payors as nonemployee compensation on Forms 1099 and ... reported the payments as self-employment income.\u201d App\u2019x 253. As the Commissioner notes, the sums Chai received from his tax-shelter dealings \u201cdwarfed the amounts he reported as income from his partnership interest in an architectural firm.\u201d Comm\u2019r Br. 63. It is quite clear that Chai\u2019s primary purpose was to earn compensation in exchange for his services as an accommodating party.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Chai asserts that his sole motive was that of an investor \u2014 that he agreed to serve as an accommodatingjparty only in the hope of reaping investment gains. The Tax Court rightly rejected that portrayal of the facts. Beer testified that the large sums paid to Chai were largely derived from the fees that Delta received from its clients, not from any increase in the value of Chai\u2019s holdings. The whole point of the shelter scheme was to neutralize any purported returns on investment by generating offsetting losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Chai emphasizes, however, that Beer\u2019s testimony also explained there was an opportunity to profit on the underlying investments, and that at least some of the $2 million payment was \u201cdirectly attributable to the profitability of the underlying derivative transactions entered into by the tax shelter entities.\u201d Chai Reply Br. 24-25. That may be true, and Chai may have been paid less if the scheme did not do as well, but there is no evidence that he stood to go without compensation at all. That Chai had an interest in the investment performance of the tax shelters does not mean he was solely an investor in them. Moreover, the unsurprising fact that his payment was, in part, derived from the shelters\u2019 investment gains does not negate the fact that it was largely drawn from client fees. Chai was not simply an investor in the tax shelters \u2014 he performed a service by acting as an accommodating party and was compensated as such. The Tax Court did not clearly err in discrediting Chai\u2019s contrary testimony and concluding that he agreed to serve as accommodation party in order to earn compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Much of Chai\u2019s argument focuses on factors set forth in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.183-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>2(b) \u2014 the \u201chobby loss\u201d provision \u2014 to show that he lacked profit motive. The \u201chobby loss\u201d provision is focused on limiting or disallowing deductions for any activity not denominated a \u201ctrade or business\u201d under \u00a7 162 or an activity not engaged in for the production of income under \u00a7 212. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.183-2(a). The factors on which Chai relies are meant to guide the analysis of whether the activities for which a taxpayer has claimed an I.R.C. \u00a7 183 deduction were \u201ccarried on primarily as a sport, hobby, or for recreation,\u201d or instead primarily for profit (in which case expenses are deductible). Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.183-2(a). Chai does not (and could not credibly) argue that his role as accommodating party was purely for pleasure. Nor does he assert that his conduct was a hobby; rather, he says it was to seek a return on investment. The \u00a7 183 factors were not designed to distinguish between investment return and profit motives. Indeed, Chai has cited no case law applying them to a case like this. And even to the extent \u00a7 183 is useful in this context, the Tax Court\u2019s factual conclusion that Chai had a profit motive was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.183-2 factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">(1) The manner in which the taxpayer carries on the activity; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">(2) The expertise of the taxpayer or his advisors; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">(3) The time and effort expended by the taxpayer in carrying on the activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA40\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">(4) Expectation that assets used in the activity may appreciate in value; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">(5) The success of the taxpayer in carrying on other similar or dissimilar activities; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">(6) The taxpayer\u2019s history of income or losses with respect to the activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAhH\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-11\">(7) The amount of occasional profits, if any, which are earned; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-12\">(8) The financial status of the taxpayer; and ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-13\">(9) Elements of personal pleasure or recreation involved in the activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.183-2(b). Chai admits, and the Commissioner does not dispute, that factors (4), (7), and (9) are clearly inapplicable in this case. The others largely weigh against Chai.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">Manner in which Chai carried on the activity. Chai asserts that he did not conduct his accommodating party activities in a businesslike manner, as \u201cevery decision made with respect to the tax shelter transactions was made by Bricolage.\u201d Chai Br. 46. He further claims that, once JJC was formed, \u201c[he] did not even have to sign any documents,\u201d as \u201cBricolage did everything, including acting as the managing member of JJC.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Again, the Tax Court reasonably found that Chai engaged in businesslike activities in his capacity as accommodating party, and he cannot discount his role by citing his delegation of authority to an agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-16\">Chai nevertheless likens his case to <em>Sloan v. Commissioner, </em>55 T.C.M. (CCH) 1238 (1988). There, Sloan, a full-time computer analyst who was also an attorney, planned to establish his own law practice after he retired from the U.S. Government, and began performing legal services for clients on weekends while still in the Government\u2019s employ. The Tax Court, analyzing whether Sloan was engaged in a \u201ctrade or business\u201d under <em>Groetzinger, </em>held, <em>inter alia, </em>that Sloan did not engage in the law practice with the primary purpose of earning a profit, but instead to gain experience that he could use when practicing in earnest post-retirement. <em>Id. </em>at 1241. Importantly, Sloan rarely billed clients, was not concerned with earning a profit, and relied on his computer-analyst job as his primary source of income. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Chai, by contrast, was focused on making a profit (albeit, he says, through investment income), and his income from the tax shelters dwarfed the amounts received from his architecture practice. His role was far more businesslike than Sloan\u2019s, and was definitely no hobby.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Moreover, in attempting to offset income, Chai described certain capital losses as \u201cdisposition[s] of business property.\u201d Supp. App\u2019x 156, 160-65. As the Commissioner notes, the use of the term \u201cbusiness property\u201d suggests reliance on I.R.C. \u00a7 1231, which provides that net losses from sales of \u201cproperty used in the trade or business\u201d are treated as ordinary losses. I.R.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(2), (3). In another offsetting measure, Chai made a \u201cmark-to-market\u201d election for JJC under I.R.C. \u00a7 475(f), Supp. App\u2019x 156, when such elections are limited to persons \u201cengaged in a trade or business as a trader in securities,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 475(f)(1)(A). Thus, Chai now attempts to distance himself from his previous position- \u2014 seeking in this litigation, as the Tax Court found, to use his delegation of authority to Bricolage \u201cas a shield\u201d from liability, App\u2019x 252 \u2014 while in the past having relied on his asserted businesslike involvement in Bricolage to obtain, affirmatively, favorable tax treatment. Chai cannot benefit from claims of business and trade losses while denying income from the same endeavor.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Chai\u2019s and his advisor\u2019s expertise. Chai argues that he had no expertise in and barely understood tax-shelter transactions, and that he \u201crelied solely on Mr. Beer\u2019s representations that the transactions were legal and might be profitable.\u201d Chai Br. 47-48. He seeks to contrast his case with <em>Bagley v. United States, </em>963 F.Supp.2d 982 (C.D. Cal. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In <em>Bagley, </em>the court found that Bag-ley \u2014 who was assessed income tax on the proceeds from various False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d) claims he prosecuted- \u2014 -and his private counsel were essentially operating the business of a private attorney general, given their vital expertise in prosecuting FCA cases. <em>Id. </em>at 996-97. Thus, the court found that Bagley engaged in for-profit activity. <em>Id. </em>at 998. Chai asserts that, in contrast to himself, Bagley \u201chad first-hand knowledge of the fraudulent schemes, and the identity of relevant witnesses and the location of documentary evidence.\u201d Chai Br. 48 (quoting <em>Bagley, </em>963 F.Supp.2d at 995).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Chai misses the point. Although Chai was not the mastermind of the tax-shelter scheme, the expertise relevant to our analysis is that of an accommodating party. While the role of accommodating party may not require extensive expertise, Chai (like Bagley) was amply qualified and proficient in the practice. Indeed, he carried out his role successfully for years. He need not have understood every piece of the bigger picture; he needed only to have understood the part he played, which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Chai additionally asserts that he \u201creceived no advice from anyone regarding being a tax shelter accommodating party.\u201d Chai Br. 47. Even if that is true, it only bolsters the conclusion that he had the requisite minimal expertise to support his participation in the venture, since the scheme functioned with him as an essential cog and no one suggests that he was deficient in his role. Just as Bagley\u2019s \u201cinvolvement ... was part and parcel of the business Bagley was conducting,\u201d <em>Bagley, </em>963 F.Supp.2d at 996, Chai\u2019s role, which he ably fulfilled, was essential to the functioning of Beer\u2019s tax shelter business.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">Time and effort expended by Chai. This factor weighs in Chai\u2019s favor, but does not overcome the rest. It is true that Chai\u2019s activities, although regular and continuous, were not time- or effort-intensive. But that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>is a function of the amount of time and effort required to be in the \u201ctrade or business\u201d of being an accommodating party, and not a reflection, of the nature of the activity. In other words-, although it may not take much to be an accommodating party, Chai expended enough effort to be one.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Chai\u2019s success in similar activities. This factor deserves little weight, but clearly weighs in Chai\u2019s favor: he was not involved in similar activities before or after the activity at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">History of income or loss. Chai\u2019s history of income from the tax shelters was regular and substantial, including lump-sum payments of $1.2 million in 2000, $1 million in 2001, and $2 million in 2003. The <em>Bagley </em>court found sufficient history of income where Bagley received only a single FCA payout. <em>Id. </em>at 997. Chai\u2019s history of multiple, yearly, and substantial payouts is even more indicative of being in the business of being an accommodating party.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Amount of occasional profits. As the Commissioner points out, Chai omitted any analysis of this factor in his main brief. Ijn his Reply, he again skirts the issue. But the regulations are clear that \u201csubstantial profit,\u201d even if \u201conly occasional,\u201d is \u201cgenerally ... indicative that an activity is engaged in for profit.\u201d Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.183-2(b)(7). Chai\u2019s profits were just that \u2014 substantial, but occasional.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Chai\u2019s financial status. Chai misses the point, here, too. He argues that \u201c[i]n cases where the taxpayer has other, full-time employment, the requisite profit motive is generally missing.\u201d Chai Br. 50. He cites, <em>inter alia, Sloan </em>and <em>Levinson. </em>In both cases, however, the activity at issue was a secondary source of income. Here, by contrast, the payments Chai received in his capacity as accommodating party dwarfed his architecture income. <em>See </em>Comm\u2019r Br. 63 (comparing incomes).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the Tax Court did not err in finding that Chai had the requisite profit motive to be engaged in the \u201ctrade or business\u201d of being a tax shelter accommodating party, even assuming the \u201chobby loss\u201d provision applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">C. Continuity and Regularity</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">Applying the second <em>Groetzinger </em>prong, the Tax Court found that \u201c[t]he record demonstrates that [Chai\u2019s] activities were continuous and regular.\u201d App\u2019x 252. Chai testified that he went to Bricolage\u2019s offices \u201ca lot\u201d to execute voluminous documents in his capacity as accommodating party. App\u2019x 252. The Tax Court found that the continuous and regular nature of Chai\u2019s activities was not affected by his \u201cforming JJC, making Bricolage JJC\u2019s nonmember manager, and giving Bricolage power of attorney,\u201d particularly because \u201cBrieolage\u2019s actions with respect to JJC are imputed to [Chai] as his agent.\u201d App\u2019x 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">That finding was bolstered by Chai\u2019s representations on Schedule C of his 2001 return for JJC, in which he stated that he \u201c \u2018materially participate^]\u2019 in the operation of this business during 2001,\u201d thereby entitling him to favorable treatment under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>passive loss rules. Supp. App\u2019x 146. In defining \u201cmaterial participation,\u201d the instructions to Schedule C describe various circumstances constituting \u201cmaterial participation,\u201d including \u201cparticipation] in the' activity on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis during [the tax] year,\u201d provided the participation exceeded 100 hours. 2001 Instructions for Schedule C, Profit or Loss From Business, at C-2; <em>see </em>Treas. Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 1.469-5T(a)(7), (b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Attempting to downplay his role, Chai asserts that what the Tax Court considered \u201cregular\u201d activity \u201cwas nothing more than signing \u2018multiple binders\u2019 of documents to \u2018set up [the] corporations\u2019 that Mr. Beer used to facilitate his tax advantaged transactions.\u201d Chai Reply Br. 18 (quoting Supp. App\u2019x 209) (alteration in original). In support, he emphasizes his own self-serving testimony and characterizes his role as including \u201cgoing to Beer\u2019s offices for a few hours at a time,\u201d \u201chaving no regular schedule and going to the office only when requested by Bricolage,\u201d and \u201cnot having a physical office, assistant, or receiving mail.\u201d Chai Reply Br. 18. According to Chai, he \u201cdid not even draft the documents he signed; he was nothing more than a straw man.... He was nothing more than a pawn in a much bigger game.\u201d Chai Reply Br. 1.9, 22. Chai also disclaims any knowledge of the implications of his 2001 JJC return, stating that he \u201cwas not involved in the preparation of the return, and did not understand the complexity or the positions taken on the return.\u201d Chai Reply Br. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">At bottom, however, the record on which the Tax Court relied shows that the testimony of Chai and others, combined with Chai\u2019s representations on prior year returns, supports the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that Chai undertook his activities with \u201ccontinuity and regularity.\u201d <em>See Groetzinger, </em>480 U.S. at 35, 107 S.Ct. 980. While it is true that Chai maintained his architecture practice and was not as intimately involved with the nuances of the shelters as others like Beer, that does not render Chai\u2019s activities insufficiently regular and continuous for purposes of \u00a7 1401. That Chai has a different view of the evidence does not mean the Tax Court clearly erred. <em>See UFCW Local One, </em>791 F.3d at 372. The Tax Court therefore properly held the $2 million Delta payment to constitute taxable self-employment income.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">III. The Penalty Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">Chai argues that the Commissioner failed to meet his burden on the claim to impose an accuracy-related penalty. Specifically, he argues, as he did in his post-trial briefing, that compliance with I.R.C. \u00a7 6751(b)(l)\u2019s written-approval requirement \u201cis an element of the Commissioner\u2019s claim for penalties,\u201d and it is therefore \u201cpart of the Commissioner\u2019s burden [of production under \u00a7 7491(c)] to demonstrate compliance with\u201d that re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>quirement. Chai Br. 53. Because Chai raised the issue for the first time post-trial, the Tax Court declined to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The Commissioner originally did not dispute that the written-approval requirement is an element of a penalty claim so long as \u00a7 6751(b)(2)(B) (the electronic-means exception) does not apply. He argued that the Tax Court\u2019s decision not to consider the argument was not an abuse of discretion, and that, in any event, the penalty here did not require written approval because it was of the type assessed by electronic means. In a Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j) letter, however, the Commissioner now urges us to adopt the reasoning of the majority of a divided Tax Court in <em>Graev v. Commissioner, </em>147 T.C. 16, No. 30638-08, 2016 WL 6996650 (2016),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which held that it is premature to argue the IRS failed to satisfy the written-approval requirements of \u00a7 6751(b)(1) until the Tax Court\u2019s decision on the penalty became final and the IRS assessed the penalty. Read that way, the Commissioner argues, the issue of compliance with the written-approval requirement is not ripe for review in a deficiency proceeding, and the issue of whether the Tax Court permissibly declined to consider Chai\u2019s argument in such a proceeding is therefore moot. This is a notable shift from the Commissioner\u2019s <em>pre-Graev </em>position that Chai\u2019s post-trial argument was too late. Now, the Commissioner argues that Chai\u2019s argument was not too late, but rather premature. Chai has not addressed <em>Graev, </em>but we must.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Deciding whether the Tax Court abused its discretion in failing to consider Chai\u2019s post-trial challenge requires us to determine first at what point the IRS\u2019s obligation to comply with the written-approval requirement kicks in. In other words, if compliance is required but may be obtained at any time prior to assessment of the penalty then, as the Commissioner now argues, the Tax Court was not required address the unripe issue. But if compliance is required before penalty proceedings begin, the Tax Court arguably abused its discretion in failing to consider Chai\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Thus, this case requires us to decide which side in <em>Graev </em>got it right. On one side, the <em>Graev </em>majority held that the written approval may be obtained at any time before the penalty is assessed, and any challenge thereto must be lodged in a post-assessment proceeding. 2016 WL 6996650 at *10 &amp; n.13. On the other side, the five dissenting members in <em>Graev </em>would hold that written approval must be obtained prior to the initiation of Tax Court proceedings regarding penalties. <em>Id. </em>at *29 (Gustafson, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Before turning to <em>Graev, </em>we note that Chai\u2019s was not an electronic-means case, and therefore \u00a7 6751(b)(l)\u2019s written-approval requirement did apply. The Commissioner argues that the penalty here was excepted from \u00a7 6751(b)(l)\u2019s written-approval requirement because it falls within the categories of penalties \u201cautomatically calculated through electronic means.\u201d Comm\u2019r Br. 77 (quoting I.R.C. \u00a7 6751(b)(2)(B)). He does not argue that Chai\u2019s penalty was in fact calculated through electronic means. Instead, he cites the Internal Revenue Manual, which instructs IRS personnel that \u201cthe assessment of a penalty qualifies as one calculated through electronic means if the penalty is assessed free of any independent determination by an IRS employee as to whether the penalty should be imposed against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>taxpayer.\u201d Comm\u2019r Br. 78 (quoting IRM 20.1.1.2.3(5) (Aug. 5, 2014)).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The Commissioner\u2019s argument that the penalty imposed on Chai was \u201ca matter of a mechanical computation,\u201d Comm\u2019r Br. 77, is at odds with the nature of the specific penalty determination in this case. Here, the accuracy-related penalty, arising under I.R.C. \u00a7 6662(a), can be based on an underpayment of tax attributable to one or a combination of causes set forth under \u00a7 6662(b). The Commissioner, in the notice of deficiency, attributed Chai\u2019s underpayment to a substantial understatement of income tax, under \u00a7 6662(b)(2), <em>and/or </em>negligence or disregard of rules and regulations, under \u00a7 6662(b)(1). We are aware of no record evidence that this determination (particularly if it were a decision based on \u00a7 6662(b)(1)) was, or could have been, made electronically through the IMF Automated Underreporter Program. <em>See </em>IRM 4.19.3 (Aug. 26, 2016) (providing instructions for the Automated Underre-porter, a computerized system that uses information return matching to identify potentially underreported tax returns).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">To the contrary, the Notice of Deficiency the Commissioner issued Chai in May 2009 indicates that the determinations were made by Deborah Bennett, Technical Services Territory Manager for the IRS, or a revenue agent working under her authority. <em>See </em>App\u2019x 30. Form 886-A, which was included with the Notice of Deficiency, details why the IRS determined to assess the penalty, including that the IRS employee determined that Chai lacked reasonable cause for the underpayment. <em>See </em>App\u2019x 40-41. The Commissioner\u2019s citation to the instruction manual is unconvincing, especially in light of the Chief Counsel\u2019s guidance. Because Chai\u2019s penalty was not imposed <em>\u201cfree of any independent determination by a Service employee as to lohether the penalty should be </em>imposed,\u201d <em>see </em>I.R.S. Gen. Couns. Mem. 200211040, at 3 (Jan. 30, 2002) (emphasis added), it was not \u201ccalculated automatically through electronic means.\u201d I.R.S. Gen. Couns. Mem. 2014004, at 2 (May 20, 2014). The IRS was therefore required to obtain written approval of the penalty pre-assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">We turn, then, to the issue of when that obligation attached \u2014 that is, whether compliance with the written-approval requirement of I.R.C. \u00a7 6751(b)(1) is an element of the Commissioner\u2019s penalty claim and therefore part of his burden of production. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 7491(c) (\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Secretary shall have the burden of production in any court proceeding with respect to the liability of any individual for any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount imposed by this title.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">\u201cAs in any case of statutory-construction,\u201d we start our analysis, as did the <em>Graev </em>majority, \u201cwith \u2018the language of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson, </em>525 U.S. 432, 438, 119 S.Ct. 755, 142 L.Ed.2d 881 (1999) (quoting <em>Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., </em>505 U.S. 469, 475, 112 S.Ct. 2589, 120 L.Ed.2d 379 (1992)). \u201c[W]here the statutory language provides a clear answer, [our analysis] ends there.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[i]f the meaning of the statute is ambiguous, [we] may resort to canons of statutory interpretation to help resolve the ambiguity.\u201d <em>Auburn Hous. Auth. v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 138, 143 (2d Cir. 2002) (citation omitted). Section 6751(b)(1) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">No penalty under this title shall be assessed unless the initial determination of such assessment is personally approved (in writing) by the immediate supervisor of the individual making such determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>tion or such higher level official as the Secretary may designate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">I.R.C. \u00a7 6751(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We part ways with the <em>Graev </em>majority in its view that the statutory language is clear. <em>See Graev, </em>2016 WL 6996650, at *10. The provision clearly requires written approval of the \u201cinitial determination of ... assessment\u201d before a penalty can be assessed. Its clarity ends there. The provision contains no express requirement that the written approval be obtained at any particular time prior to assessment. The <em>Graev </em>majority read the absence of specific language as to when the prior approval need be obtained to mean that no specific timing requirement exists and thus the written approval need only be obtained at some, but no particular, time prior to assessment. We find ambiguity, however, where the <em>Graev </em>majority found none.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Understanding \u00a7 6751 and appreciating its ambiguity requires proficiency with the deficiency process. \u201cAssessment\u201d is the formal recording of a taxpayer\u2019s tax liability on the tax rolls.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6203 (stating that an assessment is \u201cmade by recording the liability of the taxpayer in the office of the Secretary in accordance with rules or regulations prescribed by the Secretary\u201d). It is \u201cessentially a bookkeeping notation\u201d of what the taxpayer is required to pay the Government. <em>Laing v. United States, </em>423 U.S. 161, 170 n.13, 96 S.Ct. 473, 46 L.Ed.2d 416 (1976); <em>see Hibbs v. Winn, </em>542 U.S. 88, 115, 124 S.Ct. 2276, 159 L.Ed.2d 172 (2004) (Kennedy, J., dissenting). In essence, it is the last of a number of steps required before the IRS can collect a \u201cdeficiency\u201d \u2014 a tax liability greater than what the taxpayer reported on his return. Before it can \u201cassess\u201d a deficiency, the IRS must first determine a \u201cdeficiency\u201d in a taxpayer\u2019s liability. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6201(a). The IRS then announces to the taxpayer in a notice of deficiency its intention to assess that deficiency. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6212(a). If the taxpayer does not file a Tax Court petition within 90 days, \u201cthe deficiency ... shall be assessed.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6213(c). If he does file a Tax Court petition for a \u201credetermination of the deficiency\u201d within the 90-day period, however, the IRS is restricted from assessing the deficiency \u201cuntil the decision of the Tax Court has become final.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6213(a). It is then the Tax Court\u2019s job to determine whether a deficiency should be assessed and, if so, the amount thereof. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6214(a) (\u201c[T]he Tax Court shall have jurisdiction to redetermine the correct amount of the deficiency....\u201d), 6215(a) (\u201c[T]he entire amount redetermined as the deficiency by the decision of the Tax Court which has become final shall be assessed.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">In light of the historical meaning of \u201cassessment,\u201d we agree with the <em>Graev </em>dissent that the phrase \u201cinitial determination of such assessment\u201d is ambiguous. <em>See Graev, </em>2016 WL 6996650 at *31 (Gustaf-son, J., dissenting). If \u201cassessment\u201d is the formal recording of a taxpayer\u2019s tax liability, then \u00a7 6751(b) is unworkable: one can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>determine a deficiency, <em>see </em>I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212(a), 6213(a), and whether to make an assessment, \u201cbut one cannot \u2018determine\u2019 an \u2018assessment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Graev, </em>2016 WL 6996650 at *31 (Gustafson, J., dissenting). We must therefore \u201cconsult legislative history and other tools of statutory construction to discern Congress\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>United States v. Gayle, </em>342 F.3d 89, 93 (2d Cir. 2003). It is particularly useful to \u201cconsider reliable legislative history\u201d in cases like this where \u201cthe statute is susceptible to divergent understandings . and, equally important, where there exists authoritative legislative history that assists in discerning what Congress actually meant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94. \u201cThe most enlightening source of legislative history is generally a committee report, particularly a conference committee report, which we have identified as among \u2018the most authoritative and reliable materials of legislative history.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Disabled in Action of Metro. N.Y. v. Hammons, </em>202 F.3d 110, 124 (2d Cir. 2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The report from the Senate Finance Committee on \u00a7 6751(b) states clearly the purpose of the provision and thus Congress\u2019s intent: \u201cThe Committee believes that penalties should only be imposed where appropriate and not as a bargaining chip.\u201d S. Rep. No. 105-174, at 65 (1998). The statute was meant to prevent IRS agents from threatening unjustified penalties to encourage taxpayers to settle. <em>IRS Restructuring: Hearings on H.R. 2676 Before the S. Comm. on Finance, </em>105th Cong. 92 (1998) (statement of Stefan F. Tucker, Chair-Elect, Section of Taxation, American Bar Association) (\u201c[T]he IRS will often say, if you don\u2019t settle, we are going to assert the penalties.\u201d). That history strongly rebuts the <em>Graev </em>majority\u2019s view that written approval may be accomplished at any time prior to, even if just before, assessment. Allowing, as would the <em>Graev </em>majority, an unapproved initial determination of the penalty to proceed through administrative proceedings, settlement negotiations, and potential Tax Court proceedings, only to be approved sometime prior to assessment would do nothing to stem the abuses \u00a7 6751(b)(1) was meant to prevent. The <em>Graev </em>dissent put it succinctly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">Th[e majority\u2019s] construction is implausible in the extreme \u2014 especially in an instance in which a penalty assertion becomes the subject of Tax Court litigation. Once Chief Counsel had argued and the Tax Court had held that the taxpayer is liable for an assessment, the supervisor\u2019s Johnny-come-lately approval of the \u201cinitial determination\u201d would add nothing to the process. And where the Tax Court had held the taxpayer <em>not </em>liable for the penalty, the supervisor\u2019s consideration of the matter would then be completely moot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-8\"><em>Graev, </em>2016 WL 6996650 at *32 (Gustaf-son, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">The <em>Graev </em>majority gave short shrift to the legislative history, suggesting that the Tax Court\u2019s confirmation in the deficiency proceeding that the penalty was appropriate in Graev\u2019s case (regardless of compliance with \u00a7 6751(b)) cured any concerns that the penalty was used as a bargaining chip. <em>Graev, </em>2016 WL 6996650, at *14. That the penalty may have been appropriate in <em>Graev, </em>however, does not change Congress\u2019s intent or alleviate its concerns; If deficiency proceeding review of penalty determinations were sufficient to deter or detect the IRS\u2019s improper leveraging of undue penalties, then Congress would not have felt compelled to enact \u00a7 7491(c), which places the burden of production on the IRS in any court proceeding regarding the liability of a taxpayer for any penalty, along with \u00a7 6751. More to the point, Tax Court review does not solve the problem\u2014 penalties could still be used as bargaining chips to prompt settlement negotiations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>and, if successful, the Tax Court would be none the wiser (since the taxpayer would have settled, rather than have filed a Tax Court petition where the propriety of the penalty could be litigated).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Moreover, that the Tax Court found that the penalty was not improperly used as a bargaining chip in <em>Graev </em>could just as easily indicate that \u00a7 6751 (even if the written approval had not yet been obtained) is having its intended effect. Indeed, the IRS\u2019s current administrative practice requires a supervisor\u2019s approval to be noted on the form reflecting the examining agent\u2019s penalty determination or otherwise be documented in the applicable workpapers. IRM 20.1.5.1.4.1 (Dec. 13, 2016); <em>accord, </em>IRM 20.1.5.1.6(4) (July 1, 2008); <em>see also </em>IRM 20.1.1.2.3(6) (Aug. 5, 2014) (\u201cThe managerial review and approval must be documented in writing and retained in the case file.\u201d); IRM 20.1.1.2.3(7) (Aug. 5, 2014) (\u201c[T]he IRS may wish to provide the taxpayer with a courtesy copy of the document showing that a manager approved the penalties.\u201d). Of course, the IRS\u2019s internal guidance is neither legally binding nor entitled to more deference than its persuasive value. <em>See Reno v. Koray, </em>515 U.S. 50, 61, 115 S.Ct. 2021, 132 L.Ed.2d 46 (1995); <em>Buffalo Transp., Inc. v. United States, </em>844 F.3d 381, 385 (2d Cir. 2016) (citing <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944)). But, unlike the <em>Graev </em>majority, we do not find the guidance merely \u201csalutary\u201d and \u201cimmaterial to our conclusion.\u201d <em>Graev, </em>2016 WL 6996650 at *12. Rather, it is a persuasive signal of the IRS\u2019s reading of \u00a7 6751 to require, as Congress intended, supervisory approval prior to the issuance of a notice of deficiency-</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">If supervisory approval is to be required at all, it must be the case that the approval is obtained when the supervisor has the discretion to give or withhold it.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> That discretion is lost once the Tax Court decision becomes final: at that point, \u00a7 6215(a) provides that \u201cthe entire amount redetermined as the deficiency ... <em>shall </em>be assessed\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, supervisory (or designated higher official) approval, in order to be of any consequence, must necessarily be obtained before the Tax Court\u2019s decision becomes final. After that point, the IRS loses discretion whether to assess the penalty. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6215(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">It is not enough that approval be given before the Tax Court proceeding ends, however; for the supervisor\u2019s discretion to be given force, the approval must be issued before the Tax Court proceeding is even initiated. Section 6751 requires supervisory approval of \u201cthe <em>initial </em>determination of such assessment\u201d (emphasis added). As the <em>Graev </em>dissent points out, the word \u201cinitial\u201d is defined 'as \u201chaving to do with, indicating, or occurring at the beginning.\u201d Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary 735 (4th ed. 2010); <em>see also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 460 (7th Ed. 1999) (offering as an example of the term \u201cinitial determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>tion\u201d the \u201cfirst determination made by the Social Security Administration of a person\u2019s eligibility for benefits\u201d). While the IRS might still have discretion to concede a penalty after a Tax Court proceeding has commenced, such determination would be final. The statute would make little sense if it permitted written approval of the \u201cinitial determination\u201d up until and even contemporaneously with the IRS\u2019s final determination. In essence, the last moment the approval of the initial determination actually matters is immediately before the taxpayer files suit (or penalties are asserted in a Tax Court proceeding).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> And for that matter, because a taxpayer can file a tax court petition at any time after receiving a notice of deficiency, the truly consequential moment of approval is the IRS\u2019s issuance of the notice of deficiency (or the filing of an answer or amended answer asserting penalties). Thus, we hold that \u00a7 6751(b)(1) requires written approval of the initial penalty determination no later than the date the IRS issues the notice of deficiency (or files an answer or amended answer) asserting such penalty.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In that vein, we further hold that compliance with \u00a7 6751(b) is part of the Commissioner\u2019s burden of production and proof in a deficiency case in which a penalty is asserted. As mentioned above, the Commissioner has the burden of production in any penalty proceeding. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 7491(c) (\u201c[T]he Secretary shall have the burden of production in any court proceeding with respect to the liability of any individual for any penalty....\u201d). Congress\u2019s intent is clear from the legislative history of \u00a7 7491(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">[I]n any court proceeding, the Secretary must initially come forward with evidence that it is appropriate to apply a particular penalty to the taxpayer before the court can impose the penalty. This provision is not intended to require the Secretary to introduce evidence of elements such as reasonable cause or substantial authority. Rather, the Secretary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>must come forward initially with evidence regarding the appropriateness of applying a particular penalty to the taxpayer; if the taxpayer believes that, because of reasonable cause, substantial authority, or a similar provision, it is inappropriate to impose the penalty, it is the taxpayer\u2019s responsibility (and not the Secretary\u2019s obligation) to raise those issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">H. Rep. No. 105-599, at 241 (1998) (Conf. Rep.). It is incumbent on the Commissioner, in order to meet his burden of production, to \u201ccome forward with sufficient evidence indicating that it is appropriate to impose the relevant penalty.\u201d <em>Higbee v. Comm\u2019r, </em>116 T.C. 438, 446 (2001). Because \u00a7 6751(b)(1) provides that \u201c[n]o penalty ... <em>shall </em>be assessed\u201d (emphasis added) unless the written-approval requirement is satisfied, it would be inappropriate to impose a penalty where \u00a7 6751(b)(1) was not satisfied. Read in conjunction with \u00a7 7491(c), the written-approval requirement of \u00a7 6751(b)(1) is appropriately viewed as an element of a penalty claim, and therefore part of the IRS\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>penalty case.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The only remaining issue is whether, in light of the foregoing, the Tax Court abused its discretion in declining to consider Chai\u2019s post-trial argument that the Commissioner had not met its burden of proof with respect to compliance with the written-approval' requirement of \u00a7 6751(b)(1). Chai argues the Tax Court\u2019s timeliness ruling was wrong in three ways: (1) the issue of the Commissioner\u2019s failure to meet his burden could not have arisen until after he failed to do so; (2) the Commissioner had two separate opportunities after trial to supplement the record with evidenee of compliance, but never did so, instead arguing that he was prejudiced by the timing of Chai\u2019s argument; and (3) because Chai raised the issue in his post-trial reply to the Commissioner\u2019s post-trial First Amendment to Answer, its untimeliness was cured by the Tax Court\u2019s \u201crelation back\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Given that \u00a7 6751(b)(1) written approval is an element of a penalty claim and therefore the Commissioner\u2019s burden to prove, Chai\u2019s post-trial argument was tantamount to a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law. In other words, Chai is essentially arguing that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain the verdict on the penalty claim. Such challenges are properly (if not necessarily) made post-trial or at least after the party with the burden rests; the burdened party \u2014 here, the Commissioner \u2014 could not have failed to meet his burden until he concluded his presentation of evidence. In other words, as Chai explains, the sufficiency of the evidence \u201ccould not, by definition, become an issue until after the Commissioner failed to establish the elements of its penalty claim.\u201d Chai Br. 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">In that sense, there was no timeliness issue and the Tax Court\u2019s decision was not, as the Commissioner argues, discretionary as to whether to consider the issue at all. Rather, the Tax Court should have applied the standard applicable to legal-sufficiency challenges, which is the same here as below: whether there was sufficient evidence to permit a rational juror to find in the Commissioner\u2019s favor. <em>See McCarthy v. N.Y.C. Tech. Coll. of City Univ. of N.Y., </em>202 F.3d 161, 167 (2d Cir. 2000). If the parties disagreed as to whether the written approval was an element of the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>missioner\u2019s penalty case, as they do here, they could have litigated that before the Tax Court at any point at which it was raised, including post-trial. The Tax Court then concluding one way or the other could resolve whether the evidence was sufficient to uphold the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Even more, it was not Chai\u2019s obligation to alert the Commissioner to the elements of his claim, and we fail to see how raising the issue post-trial denied the Commissioner the opportunity to properly rebut the argument. Indeed, as Chai notes, \u201cthe burden of production [i]s \u2018a party\u2019s <em>obligation to come forward </em>with evidence to support its claim.\u2019 \u201d Chai Reply Br. 30 (quoting <em>Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, Dep\u2019t of Labor v. Greenwich Collieries, </em>512 U.S. 267, 272, 114 S.Ct. 2251, 129 L.Ed.2d 221 (1994) (emphasis added)). The Commissioner and the Tax Court\u2019s approach would require a party to move to dismiss each element of a claim before trial in order to preserve a sufficiency argument post-trial. That cannot be the case. Thus, the Tax Court was obligated to consider the issue of whether the Commissioner had met its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In responding to Chai\u2019s argument that the Commissioner had multiple opportunities to supplement the record with evidence of compliance, the Commissioner acknowledges that it \u201cis true but irrelevant.\u201d Comm\u2019r Br. 75 (citing <em>Kaufman v. Comm\u2019r, </em>784 F.3d 56, 71 (1st Cir. 2015)). In <em>Kaufman, </em>the party challenging the Tax Court\u2019s penalty ruling raised the noncompliance issue for the first time on appeal. 784 F.3d at 71. The First Circuit deemed the argument unpreserved and rejected the Kaufmans\u2019 argument \u201cthat it was the IRS\u2019s burden to show that the requirements were met, and that the Commissioner cannot now enlarge the record to demonstrate compliance with section 6751.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The First Circuit stated that \u201cthe question whose burden it was to show compliance with \u00a7 6751 is beside the point,\u201d as \u201c[t]he Kaufmans had the responsibility of <em>arguing </em>in the Tax Court that the Commissioner had not complied with the statute in order to put the Commissioner on notice that the issue was in dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Having failed to make the argument below, the First Circuit held, \u201cthe Kaufmans cannot, now fault the Commissioner for introducing no evidence to rebut it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Hormel v. Helvering, </em>312 U.S. 552, 556, 61 S.Ct. 719, 85 L.Ed. 1037 (1941)).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Here, by contrast, Chai did raise the written-approval issue below and the Tax Court gave the Commissioner an opportunity to rebut it. The Tax Court should have considered the argument on its merits, as should we.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">With respect to whether there was sufficient evidence of compliance with \u00a7 6751, the answer is clear: there was not. In fact, the Commissioner has never said that there was. Thus, the Commissioner has failed to meet his burden of proving compliance with \u00a7 6751, a prerequisite to assessment of the accuracy-related penalty. We therefore reverse the portion of the Tax Court\u2019s order upholding the penalty assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we hereby (1) VACATE the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdictional ruling and, because Chai concedes that the $2 million payment is fully taxable, REMAND the case to the Tax Court to enter a revised decision upholding the additional income-tax deficiency; (2) AFFIRM the portion of the Tax Court\u2019s order upholding the self-employment tax deficiency; and (3) REVERSE the portion of the Tax Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>order upholding the accuracy-related penalty.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-5\">. The numbers involved in this litigation are as follows. On his 2003 tax return, Chai reported an overall loss of $11.47 million and income tax of $0. Most of the loss \u2014 $11.15 million \u2014 was due to Chai's participation in the Mercato partnership. When the IRS audited Chai\u2019s 2003 return, it adjusted his income upwards by $2.4 million, largely due to the $2 million Delta payment. This still left a loss of approximately $9.1 million. The IRS\u2019s first notice of deficiency therefore asserted a $63,751 self-employment tax deficiency and a $12,750.20 accuracy-related penalty. When the <em>Mercato </em>proceeding concluded and the partnership loss was disallowed, Chai's income was no longer sheltered by the partnership losses. Not including the Delta payment, this brought Chai\u2019s 2003 income to $49,869, for which the IRS issued a computational adjustment for $10,269 in income tax and a $2,053.80 penalty. Including the disputed Del,ta payment, this would put his 2003 income just above $2 million, for which the IRS asserted in its First Amendment to Answer (defined <em>infra) </em>an income tax deficiency of $563,868.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">.

Chai cites a single case in which the Tax Court found that a taxpayer who operated a retail store, but patented a few inventions for which he settled two patent-infringement suits.

The <em>Graev </em>court was divided over the import of the clause of \u00a7 6751(b) requiring written approval of the initial determination of assessment either by \"the immediate supervisor of the individual making such determination\" or by \u201csuch higher level official as the Secretary may designate.\u201d The dissent argued that, by using the present participle \"making,\u201d as opposed to a past-tense verb form (e.g., \"supervisor of the individual <em>who made </em>such determination\u201d), the statute requires that the supervisory approval occur when \u201cthe individual [is] making such determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *30 (Gustafson, J., dissenting) (alteration in original) (quoting \u00a7 6751(b)(1)). While we are inclined to disagree with that construction for much the same reasons as did the <em>Graev </em>majority, <em>see id. </em>at *11 &amp; n.15, it matters not to our analysis.

Where the IRS moves for leave to assert penalties in an amended answer, the Tax Court considers the potential prejudice to the taxpayer of allowing the amendment. <em>See Estate of Quick v.

The <em>Graev </em>majority and dissent argued at length about why the effective date of \u00a7 6751(b)(1) supports their respective positions. As originally enacted, the statute provided: \"The amendments made by this section shall apply to notices issued, and penalties assessed, after December 31, 2000.\u201d Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-206, \u00a7 3306(c), 112 Stat. 685, 744. The <em>Graev </em>majority read the effective-date provision to apply differently to subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 6751. That is, that \"notices issued\u201d and \u201cpenalties issued\u201d components correspond, respectively, to \u00a7 6751(a) (relating to the computation of penalty included in a \"notice\u201d) and \u00a7 6751(b) (relating to approval of penalty \"assessment\u201d). Read that way, the effective-date provision, says the <em>Graev </em>majority, \"clearly indicates that [\u00a7 6751(b)] is focused on assessment rather than on some earlier event.\u201d <em>Graev, </em>2016 WL 6996650, at *13. The <em>Graev </em>dissent, by contrast, reads the effective-date provision to apply equally to both subsections of \u00a7 6751. The dissent sees \"notices issued\u201d to refer to penalties for which notices of deficiencies are required, and \u201cpenalties assessed\u201d to refer to \"assessable penalties\u201d that do not require a \"notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *30-31 (Gustafson, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">While both sides present persuasive arguments and reasonable interpretations of the effective-date provision, we do not need to go to such lengths here.
