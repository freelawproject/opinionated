Frohling, </em>614 Fed.Appx. 14 (2d Cir. 2015), defendant-cross-claimant-appellant-cross-appellee Virginia K. Sourlis <em>pro se </em>appeals from a November 25, 2015 Superseding Final Judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Miriam G. Cedarbaum, <em>Judge, </em>in this enforcement action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>(\u201cSEC\u201d) in connection with public offerings of unregistered shares of stock of defendant Greenstone Holdings, Inc. (\u201cGreen-stone\u201d). The district court granted ta motion by the SEC for summary judgment on issues of liability, holding Sourlis \u2014 an attorney who wrote a January 11, 2006 opinion letter (\u201cSourlis Letter\u201d) relating to one of the offerings \u2014 liable for violating \u00a7 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e; violating \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5; and aiding and abetting violations of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, in violation of \u00a7 20(e) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(e). The Superseding Final Judgment orders Sourlis to pay a total of $57,284.83 as a civil penalty, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest, and permanently bars her from participating in so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d offerings, <em>ie., </em>offerings of \u201cany equity security that has a price of less than five dollars, except as provided in Rule 3a51-l under the Exchange Act,\u201d Superseding Final Judgment at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">In Nos. 14-2301 and 15-3978, Sourlis principally contends that she was entitled to summary judgment in her favor, arguing that she \u201cdid not owe a duty to protect the interests of the investing public\u201d <em>(e.g., </em>Sourlis brief on appeal at 1, 26), and that the actual offering, of the stock that was the subject of her opinion letter was intervening fraudulent conduct by other defendants that relieved her of responsibility. She also challenges the court\u2019s imposition of a civil penalty and its injunctive order. For the reasons that follow, we find no error in the district court\u2019s determinations of liability and no abuse of discretion in its remedial order. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">A. <em>Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Section 5 of the Securities Act makes it unlawful, directly or indirectly, to publicly offer or sell unregistered stock, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e, unless the offering is covered by an exemption. The stock certificate for unregistered shares not covered by an exemption \u2014 \u201crestricted\u201d stock \u2014 normally bears a legend stating that the shares have not been registered and cannot lawfully be sold until they are registered. The pertinent exemption in this case, as it existed at the relevant time, allowed stock to be issued without the restricted-stock legend if the recipients were persons unaffiliated with the stock\u2019s issuer, and if at least two years had elapsed since the shares were owned by the issuer or a person affiliated with the issuer, <em>see </em>SEC Rule 144(k), 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.144(k) (2005). The two-year requirement was satisfied if unaffiliated persons acquired the shares in exchange for \u201cconsideration consisting <em>solely </em>of other securities of the same issuer\u201d that had been received at least two years earlier, as the shares were deemed to have been acquired from the issuer at the time the surrendered securities had been acquired. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 230.144(d)(3)(h) (2005) (emphasis added). \u201cTo state a cause of action under Section 5, one must show \u2018(1) lack of a [required] registration statement as to the subject securities; (2) the offer or sale of the securities; and (3) the use of interstate transportation or communication and the mails in connection with the offer or sale.\u2019 \u201d <em>SEC v. Cavanagh, </em>445 F.3d 105, 111 n.13 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting <em>Europe &amp; Overseas Commodity Traders, S.A. v. Banque Paribas London, </em>147 F.3d 118, 124 n.4 (2d Cir. 1998)). A person not directly engaged in transferring title of the security can be held liable under \u00a7 5 if he or she \u201cengaged in steps necessary to the distribution of [unregistered] security issues.\u201d <em>SEC v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Ass\u2019n, </em>120 F.2d 738, 741 (2d Cir. 1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, which prohibit fraud in the purchase or sale of a security, are violated if a person has \u201c \u2018(1) made a material misrepresentation or a material omission as to which he had a duty to speak, or used a fraudulent device; (2) with scienter; (3) in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.\u2019 \u201d <em>SEC v. Pentagon Capital Management PLC, </em>725 F.3d 279, 285 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting <em>SEC v. Monarch Funding Corp., </em>192 F.3d 295, 308 (2d Cir. 1999)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 134 S.Ct. 2896, 189 L.Ed.2d 834 (2014). A false statement was made with the requisite scienter if it was made with the \u201cintent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\u201d <em>SEC v. Obus, </em>693 F.3d 276, 286 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[SJcienter may be established through a showing of reckless disregard for the truth, that is, conduct which is highly unreasonable and which represents an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Summary judgment may be granted \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A genuine dispute exists when the evidence is such that, if the party against whom summary judgment is sought is given the benefit of all permissible inferences and all credibility assessments, a rational factfin-der could resolve all material factual issues in favor of that party. <em>See, e.g., Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cit is quite clear what the truth is,\u201d <em>Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>368 U.S. 464, 467, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962) (internal quotation marks omitted), and no rational factfinder could find in favor of the nonmovant. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards that govern the district court\u2019s consideration of the motion. <em>See, e.g., Aulicino v. New York City Department of Homeless Services, </em>580 F.3d 73, 79 (2d Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The district court concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to Sourlis\u2019s liability under \u00a7 5 of the Securities Act with respect to more than 6 million Greenstone shares to which her January 11, 2006 opinion letter pertained. It is undisputed that the Greenstone shares in question were not registered. Sourlis opined that shares could lawfully be issued as unrestricted shares to recipients who were acquiring them in exchange for certain convertible notes. The Sourlis Letter stated that she was relying on \u201cinformation and representations furnished by ... the Original Note Holders to me,\u201d and that \u201cI have been informed by the Original Note Holders\u201d that none of them were affiliated with the issuer and that the Original Note Holders had owned the notes for at least two years. (Sourlis Letter at 2.) The record established, however, that \u201cthe convertible notes described by Sourlis did not even exist.\u201d <em>SEC v. Greenstone Holdings, Inc., </em>954 F.Supp.2d 211, 213 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). Accordingly, many of the statements in the Sourlis Letter were necessarily false. <em>See id. </em>On the basis stated in the Sourlis Letter, which was approved by defendant John B. Frohling, Greenstone\u2019s securities counsel, 6,150,000 Greenstone shares were issued in February 2007 as unrestricted shares, allowing them to be sold to the public despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>fact that they were unregistered. The court concluded that Sourlis\u2019s role</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASR\">satisfie[d] the requirement that she directly or indirectly offered to sell securities. [Greenstone\u2019s transfer agent] required a legal opinion letter providing the authority to issue the unregistered shares without a restrictive legend. It would not have issued the shares without Sourlis\u2019s letter. This is sufficient to hold an attorney liable under Section 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARv\"><em>Id. </em>at 214. We see no error in this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The district court also found Sour-lis liable under \u00a7 20(e) of the Exchange Act because her letter aided and abetted violations of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by others. <em>See </em>Order dated November 16, 2012, entered November 20, 2012 (\u201cNovember 20 Order\u201d), incorporated in the Superseding Final Judgment. Sourlis challenges this conclusion, arguing, as she did in the district court, that she had no actual knowledge that her January 2006 letter would be used for the issuance of unrestricted stock a year later, and that she had no knowledge of the exhibit that was eventually attached to the letter. The court found that the attachment (which specified the persons who were to receive the shares and the number of shares each was to receive) was not the problem; the problem \u201cwas the contents of the letter\u201d (Hearing Transcript, November 16, 2012 (\u201cTr.\u201d), at 32). Although \u00a7 20(e) as it existed at the time of the Sourlis Letter pertained to \u201cany person that knowingly provide[d] substantial assistance\u201d to a primary violator of the securities laws, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(e) (2000), it did not, unlike certain other sections of the Exchange Act, state that in order to be liable the person must have had actual knowledge, <em>see, e.g., </em>Exchange Act \u00a7 21E, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(c)(1)(B) (for claims of fraud in forward-looking statements, requiring proof that the statements were made with \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of falsity). <em>See generally SEC v. Big Apple Consulting USA Inc., </em>783 F.3d 786, 798-801 (11th Cir. 2015). The district court concluded that the requirements of \u00a7 20(e) wer\u00e9 met because Sour-lis\u2019s election not to insist on seeing the notes discussed in her opinion letter was at the very least reckless <em>(see </em>Tr. 36-37 (\u201ceven if it were not intentionally done, it was so reckless,\u201d in light \u201cof its importance to the transaction\u201d)), and that her misrepresentations that she had spoken to the original note holders were misrepresentations as to her knowledge and hence were knowingly false <em>(see id. </em>at 35-36).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">We see no error in the district court\u2019s rejection of Sourlis\u2019s arguments. Sourlis\u2019s letter began by stating that her \u201copinion has been requested with respect to the issuance of shares (the \u2018Shares\u2019) ... upon the conversion of [certain] ... Convertible Notes\u201d (Sourlis Letter at 1), and it concluded that \u201cthe Shares underlying the Note \u215b\u215b] may be issued ... <em>without a legend </em>pursuant to the Securities Act\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 2 (emphasis in original)). Between stating its purpose and its legal conclusion, the \u201cletter represented as fact matters that were contrary to fact\u201d; Sourlis represented in the letter more than once that she \u201chad spoken to the original note-holders,\u201d a representation as to her own \u201cknowledge,\u201d although \u201cthere is no dispute that in fact she did not speak to those original note-holders\u201d; thus, a \u201ccritical statement of fact underpinning the opinion\u201d was false because \u201cno original note-holders existed and indeed no notes existed\u201d (Tr. 35). The Sourlis Letter itself makes clear that its purpose was to state whether unrestricted stock could be issued in exchange for the supposed notes. Its misrepresentations underlying its conclusion that such shares could, consistent with the Securities Act, be issued without a restrictive legend plainly enabled Frohling to instruct Green-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>stone\u2019s transfer agent to issue, in exchange for nonexistent notes, unrestricted stock that was then sold by the recipients. The district court did not err in ruling as a matter of law that Sourlis, in violation of \u00a7 20(e), aided and abetted violations of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The district court subsequently ruled that Sourlis\u2019s knowingly false statements that she had spoken to the note holders, along with her misrepresentations as to facts she had not verified, also warranted holding her liable as a primary violator of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <em>(See </em>Hearing Transcript July 21, 2015, at 4, 21-22.) That ruling, reflected in the Superseding Final Judgment, is amply justified by the record described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">In No. 14-2937, the SEC cross-appealed to challenge so much of the district court\u2019s November 20 Order as had denied its motion for. partial summary judgment holding Sourlis liable under \u00a7 ' 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 as a primary violator. Since the Superseding Final Judgment holds Sourlis liable under those provisions as a primary violator, the SEC\u2019s cross-appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">B. <em>Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\u201cOnce the district court has found federal securities law violations, it has broad equitable power to fashion appropriate remedies,\u201d <em>SEC v. First Jersey Securities, Inc., </em>101 F.3d 1450, 1474 (2d Cir. 1996) <em>(\u2018\u2018First Jersey\u201d), cert. denied, 522 </em>U.S. 812, 118 S.Ct. 57, 139 L.Ed.2d 21 (1997), and its choice of remedies is reviewable for abuse of discretion, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>at 1474-77; <em>SEC v. Contorinis, </em>743 F.3d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 2014), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 531, 193 L.Ed.2d 419 (2015). Sourlis, in addition to denying any responsibility in connection with the unlawful issuance of the 6,150,000 shares to which her opinion letter pertained, argues that that letter was a onetime occurrence that did not warrant a civil penalty or injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Civil monetary penalties are authorized by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act for both deterrent and punitive purposes. <em>See, e.g., SEC v. Razmilovic, </em>738 F.3d 14, 38-39 (2d Cir. 2013). And injunctive' relief is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-11\">particularly within the court\u2019s discretion where a violation was founded on systematic wrongdoing, rather than an isolated occurrence, ... and where the court views, the defendant\u2019s degree of culpability and <em>continued protestations of innocence </em>as indications that injunc-tive relief is warranted, since <em>\u201cpersistent refusals to admit any wrongdoing ma[k]e it rather dubious that [the offenders] are likely to avoid such violations of the securities laws in the future in the absence of an injunction.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-12\"><em>First Jersey, </em>101 F.3d at 1477 (quoting <em>SEC v. Lorin, </em>76 F.3d 458, 461 (2d Cir. 1996) (other internal quotation marks omitted) (emphases ours)).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">We see no abuse of discretion here, given the record in this case as to Sour-lis\u2019s lack of concern as to whether her representations of fact were true or false and her continued manifestation of a lack of concern for her responsibilities under the federal securities laws. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Hearing Transcript, April 2, 2014, at 8, 13, 15 (district court\u2019s references to Sour-lis\u2019s \u201cuntruths,\u201d her willingness to make statements \u2014 with \u201cabsolutely no reason\u201d to believe them correct \u2014 \u201con which other people\u2019s money depends,\u201d and her \u201cfailure to accept any responsibility\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">We have considered all of Sourlis\u2019s appellate arguments and have found in them no basis for reversal. The district court\u2019s Superseding Final Judgment against Sour-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>lis is affirmed. The SEC\u2019s cross-appeal in No. 14-2937 is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
