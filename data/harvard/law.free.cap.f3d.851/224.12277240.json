NEWMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b252-18\">This appeal and cross-appeal concern a pharmacist who suffers from trypanopho-bia \u2014 fear of needles. The pharmacy where he was employed discharged him because he could not comply with a company policy that required pharmacists to administer immunization injections to customers. That action precipitated a suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.Ci \u00a7\u00a7 12101 <em>et seq. </em>and similar state law. Rite Aid Corporation (\u201cRite Aid\u201d), the employer, appeals from the January 27, 2015, judgment entered by the District Court for the Northern District of New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>York (Thomas J. McAvoy, District Judge) awarding Christopher Stevens, the pharmacist, substantial damages after a jury trial. Rite Aid also appeals and Stevens cross-appeals from the District Court\u2019s September 23, 2015, post-trial order. That order dismissed the plaintiffs failure-to-accommodate claim, granted a new trial unless plaintiff agreed to a remittitur (later accepted), substantially granted plaintiffs claims for interest, and denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs wrongful discharge and retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In 2011, Rite Aid, and other large pharmacy chains, started requiring pharmacists to perform immunizations in order to fill an unmet need for vaccinations in the healthcare market. In April 2011, Rite Aid revised its job description to require pharmacists to hold a valid immunization certificate <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and included a reference to immunizations in the list of \u201cessential duties- and responsibilities\u201d for pharmacists.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Before his termination in August 2011, Stevens worked in upstate New York as a full-time pharmacist for Rite Aid and its predecessor pharmacies for 34 years. He was responsible for handling medications and counseling customers regarding their medications. In March 2011, Stevens received an e-mail from his district manager, William Spink, informing him that Rite Aid was going to require all pharmacists to give immunization injections to customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Stevens obtained a note from his treating physician, Dr. Mark Warfel, stating that Stevens is \u201cneedle phobic and cannot administer immunization by injection. Stevens wrote a letter to Spink explaining that his trypanophobia causes him to experience \u201clightheadedness, paleness, and a feeling that I may faint\u201d and that, as a result he \u201cwould never even consider trying to become an immunizing pharmacist.\u201d Stevens also stated that he believed his condition was a covered disability under the ADA, and requested that Rite Aid provide him with a reasonable accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">In May, William Farley, a Rite Aid Human Resources manager; faxed Stevens a list of questions for his doctor to answer regarding Stevens\u2019 needle phobia, including how the phobia would manifest itself if Stevens were to administer immunizations by injection and whether there were any accommodations that would enable Stevens to perform injections. Dr. Warfel\u2019s response stated that if Stevens were to administer an injection, \u201c[h]e would become diaphoretic, hypotensive and probably faint. Vagal response.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Warfel further advised that Stevens could not safely administer an injection, since the likelihood that he would faint would be \u201cunsafe for the patient and Mr. Stevens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">In August, Rite Aid officials told Stevens that the ADA did not apply to trypa-nophobia, that Rite Aid was not required to accommodate Stevens, and that Stevens would lose his job unless he successfully completed immunization training. Stevens later told Spink that he would not be able to complete the training. On August 23, a Rite Aid official gave Stevens a termination letter, informing him that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>being terminated for refusing to perform customer immunizations, which were an essential function of his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">At trial, Dr. Warfel testified that Stevens suffers from trypanophobia and that, when faced with needles, his heart rate increases and he becomes lightheaded, dizzy, and anxious. Frank Dattilio, a Board Certified Clinical and Forensic Psychologist, testified that Stevens\u2019 condition causes his sympathetic nervous system to react when faced with a needle, resulting in heightened blood pressure, syncope (fainting), heightened feelings of anxiety, and loss of concentration that can linger after exposure to needles.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Richard Mohall, Rite Aid\u2019s Senior Director of Clinical Service, testified that Rite Aid wanted its customers to have \u201cthe ability to come into Rite Aid any time the pharmacy was open, any day[,] any time[,] and receive an immunization.\u201d Traci Burch, Rite Aid\u2019s Vice-President of Labor Relations and Employment Counsel, testified that Rite Aid had decided that \u201cimmunizing was going to be a requirement for all of our pharmacists across the country, so anyone who couldn\u2019t perform that essential job function wouldn\u2019t be able to be a pharmacist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Following trial, the jury awarded Stevens back-pay damages of $485,633.00, front-pay damages of $1,227,188.00 to cover a period of 4.75 years, and non-pecuniary damages of $900,000, later reduced to $125,000 when Stevens agreed to a remitti-tur. Judgment was entered on January 27, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">On September 23, 2015, the District Court entered an order denying Rite Aid\u2019s post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law on Stevens\u2019 wrongful termination and retaliation claims, ordering a remitti-tur, which Stevens accepted, and dismissing Stevens\u2019 failure-to-accommodate claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Rite Aid appeals from the judgment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the post-judgment order, and Stevens cross-appeals from the post-judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant or denial of judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50. <em>See Kinneary v. City of New York, </em>601 F.3d 151, 155 (2d Cir. 2010) (denial); <em>Norville v. Staten Island University Hospital, </em>196 F.3d 89, 94 (2d Cir. 1999) (grant). In doing so, we apply the same well established standard as the district court: \u201cJudgment as a matter of law may not properly be granted under Rule 50 unless the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the opposing party, is insufficient to. permit a reasonable juror to find in h[is] favor.\u201d <em>Galdieri-Ambrosini v. National Realty &amp; Development Corp., </em>136 F.3d 276, 289 (2d Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">The ADA prohibits discrimination in employment against \u201ca qualified individual on the basis of disability.\u201d 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is defined as one who, \u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). In other words, employers may not discriminate against people with disabilities that do not prevent job performance, but when a disability renders a person unable to perform the essential functions of the job, that disability renders him or her unqualified. Accordingly, one of the elements of a claim under the ADA is that an employee was \u201cqualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation.\u201d <em>Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., </em>445 F.3d 161, 169 (2d Cir. 2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><em>Essential function. </em>In evaluating whether a particular job function is \u201cessential,\u201d this Court considers \u201cthe employer\u2019s judgment, written job descriptions, the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, the mention of the function in a collective bargaining agreement, the work experience of past employees in the position, and the work experience of current employees in similar positions.\u201d <em>McMillan v. City of New York, </em>711 F.3d 120, 126 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing <em>Stone v. City of Mount Vernon, </em>118 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 1997)); <em>see also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(n)(3). Courts \u201cmust give considerable deference to an employer\u2019s judgment regarding what functions are essential for service in a particular position,\u201d <em>Shannon v. New York City Transit Authority, </em>332 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 2003) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), but \u201cno one listed factor will be dispositive.\u201d <em>Stone, </em>118 F.3d at 97. Courts must conduct \u201ca fact-specific inquiry into both the employer\u2019s description of a job and how the job is actually performed in practice.\u201d <em>McMillan, </em>711 F.3d at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In this case, the evidence, required to be viewed in the light most favorable to Stevens, compels a finding that immunization injections were an essential job requirement for Rite Aid pharmacists at the time of Stevens\u2019 termination. Rite Aid personnel testified, without contradiction, that the company made a business decision to start requiring pharmacists to perform immunizations in 2011. The evidence established that the company carried out this policy by revising its job description for pharmacists to require immunization certification and licensure, as necessary depending on the state where the pharmacy is located, and including immunizations in the list of \u201cessential duties and responsibilities\u201d for Rite Aid pharmacists. Rite Aid\u2019s in-house counsel testified that Rite Aid terminated another pharmacist with needle phobia because, like Stevens, he failed to undergo Rite Aid\u2019s immunization training program, further demonstrating that the company deemed administering immunizations to be an essential function of its pharmacists.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">None of Stevens\u2019 arguments undermines the conclusion that immunization injections were an essential function of his job. He points out that Rite Aid\u2019s revised job description did not specifically state that pharmacists were required to administer immunizations <em>by injection, </em>but there was no evidence that immunizations were administered by alternative means. Although Rite Aid pharmacists spent relatively little time performing customer immunizations when the new policy was first put in place in 2011, there was no evidence that the policy was not fully implemented thereafter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>It is understandable that the jury had sympathy for Stevens, afflicted as he was with an unusual phobia. Nevertheless, his inability to perform an essential function of his job as a pharmacist is the only reasonable conclusion that could be drawn from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><em>Reasonable accommodation. </em>We next consider whether there was a reasonable accommodation that would have enabled Stevens to perform the essential job function of administering immunization injections. It is important to bear in mind that the issue is whether a reasonable accommodation would have enabled him to perform that essential function, not whether, as some of Stevens\u2019 arguments appear to suggest, he could perform his other duties as a pharmacist. \u201cA reasonable accommodation can never involve the elimination of an essential function of a job.\u201d <em>Shannon, </em>332 F.3d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">A reasonable accommodation may include \u201cjob restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modification of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Granting Rite Aid\u2019s post-trial motion to dismiss Stevens\u2019 failure-to-accommodate claim, the District Court correctly concluded that Stevens \u201cfailed to prove that a reasonable accommodation existed at the time he was terminated, or that he would have accepted an identified accommodation if offered.\u201d At trial, Stevens claimed there were four accommodations that Rite Aid could have offered him. None validly supported his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">First, Stevens suggested that Rite Aid could have offered him desensitization therapy, but he points to no authority in support of the theory that employers are obligated to offer employees medical treatment as a reasonable accommodation under the ADA. Indeed, that theory has been rejected by district courts in this Circuit. <em>See, e.g., Emerllahu v. Pactiv, LLC, </em>No. 11-CV-6197(MAT), 2013 WL 5876998, at *4 n.2 (W.D.N.Y. Oct. 30, 2013); <em>Desmond v. Yale-New Haven Hospital, Inc., </em>738 F.Supp.2d 331, 351 (D. Conn. 2010). Furthermore, Stevens failed to show that he would have undergone desensitization therapy had it been made available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">Stevens also suggested that he could have been transferred to a pharmacy technician position.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, Rite Aid\u2019s Vice-President of Labor Relations and Employment testified without contradiction that Rite Aid offered Stevens another position, such as a pharmacy technician position, that would not require administering immunizations, and Stevens offered no evidence that he requested, considered, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>was open to a position as a pharmacy technician.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Stevens\u2019 suggestions that Rite Aid could have either hired a nurse to give immunization injections for him or assigned him to a dual-pharmacist location do not propose true accommodations. Those steps would be exemptions that would have involved other employees performing Stevens\u2019 essential immunization duties. Rite Aid was not required to grant Stevens these exemptions. <em>See Shannon, </em>332 F.3d at 100 (reasonable accommodation does not require elimination of an essential function). Moreover, as the District Court noted, Stevens failed to show that a vacant position at a dual-pharmacist store existed at the time of his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Where the employee\u2019s disability is known to the employer, \u201c[t]he ADA envisions an \u2018interactive process\u2019 by which employers and employees work together to assess whether an employee\u2019s disability can be reasonably accommodated.\u201d <em>Jackan v. N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>205 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). \u201cNevertheless, an employee may not recover based on his employer\u2019s failure to engage in an interactive process if he cannot show that a reasonable accommodation existed at the time of his dismissal.\u201d <em>McElwee v. County of Orange, </em>700 F.3d 635, 642 (2d Cir. 2012) (citation omitted). Because Stevens failed to present any evidence suggesting the existence of a reasonable accommodation at the time of his termination, he cannot recover based on Rite Aid\u2019s failure to engage in an interactive process, even if such a failure occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Because performing immunization injections was an essential job requirement and Stevens presented no evidence of a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed him to perform immunizations at the time of his dismissal, no juror could reasonably conclude that Stevens was \u201cqualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">On the appeal, we reverse the District Court\u2019s post-trial denial of Rite Aid\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on Stevens\u2019 federal and state law wrongful termination and retaliation claims;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on the cross-appeal, we affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Stevens\u2019 failure-to-accommodate claim. We remand for entry of a revised judgment in favor of Rite Aid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\">. According to testimony at trial, a person must be licensed by New York to practice as a pharmacist. However, a pharmacist need not obtain an immunization certificate to be licensed in New York. Rather, immunization certification is a separate, optional process for New York pharmacists.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-12\">. At trial, Dr. Warfel and Stevens explained that \u201cdiaphoretic\u2019' refers to sweating, \"hypo-tensive\u201d refers to a drop in blood pressure that can cause lightheadedness or fainting, and \"vagal response\u201d refers to fainting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\">. Stevens' motion also concerned calculation of interest, a matter rendered moot by our disposition of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\">. Rite Aid\u2019s initial notice of appeal in No. 15-277 states that it is appealing from the District Court\u2019s December 30, 2014, order denying its motion to dismiss Stevens\u2019 complaint. That appeal is improper because it purports to appeal from an unappealable pretrial order and unnecessary because Rite Aid\u2019s notice of appeal in No. 15-279 states that it is appealing from the District Court\u2019s September 23, 2015, judgment, and that appeal brings up for review all prior orders of the District Court that produced the judgment, <em>see Songbyrd, Inc. v. Estate of Grossman, </em>206 F.3d 172, 178 (2d Cir. 2000). Rite Aid\u2019s amended notice of appeal in 15-277 states that it is appealing from the District Court\u2019s September 23, 2015, post-judgment order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\">. Stevens argues that William Spink, a Rite Aid regional manager, did not testify that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>immunizations were an essential function of the pharmacist's job. Spink, however, was describing the duties of a pharmacist in 2010, \"about a year before the immunization program\u201d began. His testimony cannot be construed as applying to the duties of a pharmacist when Stevens was terminated in 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Furthermore, Mohall, Rite Aid's Senior Director of Clinical Service, testified that the low immunization numbers in 2011- \u2014 when Stevens was terminated \u2014 were a product of the policy\u2019s first year and the fact that the company was \u201cjust starting to make the public aware that [it] w[as] available [for immunizations].\u201d He also testified that the immunization numbers \"have grown tremendously and substantially\u201d since 2011, in the realm of 100 to 200 percent each year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b256-13\">. According to testimony at trial, a pharmacy technician is a type of assistant to a licensed pharmacist. Pharmacy technicians earn substantially less money than licensed pharmacists and cannot administer immunizations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b257-6\">. Stevens' retaliation claim necessarily fails because Stevens\u2019 inability to perform an essential function of his job was a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-20\">Our reversal of the District Court\u2019s denial of Rite Aid\u2019s post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law renders moot Rite Aid's appeal from the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
