(West 2002)) for failure to secure a permit as allegedly required by the Act, and then ceases operations, may bring a declaratory action to test the validity of the alleged violation. Alternate Fuels, Inc. (AFI), filed such an action against the Director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (Agency) and the Agency itself. The circuit court of St. Clair County determined that the declaratory action was justiciable, found that the Act did not require AFI to secure a permit, and rejected AFI\u2019s claim for attorney fees; the appellate court affirmed. 337 Ill. App. 3d 857 (2003). For the following reasons, we affirm the appellate court.</p> <p id=\"b244-3\" pgmap=\"244\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b244-4\" pgmap=\"244\">David Wieties, a former Agency employee, was president of Resourceful Environmental Ideas, Inc. (REI), a company located in East St. Louis, Illinois, with the principal objective to produce and sell \u201calternate fuel.\u201d REI was the predecessor company to AFI. On June 14, 1994, Wieties sent a letter to the Agency to determine if AFI\u2019s product constituted waste under the Act and therefore required an Agency permit. The subject material consisted of various types of plastics generated by the shredding of empty agricultural chemical containers into chips approximately one inch in size. Prior to shredding, a company named Tri-Rinse, Inc., \u201ctriple rinsed\u201d the containers according to United States Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Agriculture guidelines to remove residual agricultural chemicals. AFI would transport the resulting chips to Illinois Power for use as fuel at its Baldwin Power Station. On August 31, 1994, the Agency responded that all materials burned for energy recovery retained their classification as waste under the Act and that a facility receiving this material would require a permit from the Agency.</p> <p id=\"b244-5\" pgmap=\"244\">Following this response, REI filed an appeal with the Illinois Pollution Control Board (Board) on September 29, 1994. The Agency filed a motion to dismiss before the Board arguing that the letter was not a \u201cfinal determination.\u201d On November 9, 1994, REI filed a motion to withdraw the appeal and the Board granted REI\u2019s motion.</p> <p id=\"b244-6\" pgmap=\"244(17) 245(75)\">Illinois Power subsequently requested a revision to its operating permit to burn the alternate fuel at the Baldwin plant. The Agency denied Illinois Power\u2019s application, contending that the alternate fuel was a \u201cwaste\u201d pursuant to section 3.53 of the Act (415 ILCS 5/3.53 (West 1994)). According to the Agency, because the material was a \u201cwaste,\u201d Illinois Power would be functioning as a \u201cpollution control facility\u201d under section 3.32 of the Act (415 ILCS 5/3.32 (West 1994)). As a \u201cpollution control facility,\u201d Illinois Power faced significant hurdles to secure a permit.</p> <p id=\"b245-3\" pgmap=\"245\">As part of the permitting process, a pollution control facility must obtain local siting approval. 415 ILCS 5/39.2(a) (West 1994). To obtain local siting approval, the county board or the governing body of the municipality must approve of the facility according to various criteria listed in section 39.2(a) of the Act (415 ILCS 5/39.2(a) (West 1994)). The governing body must hold at least one public hearing within 120 days of the application (415 ILCS 5/39.2(d) (West 1994)) and must generally take final action on the application within 180 days (415 ILCS 5/39.2(e) (West 1994)). Local siting approval expires at the end of two calendar years from the date upon which it was granted. 415 ILCS 5/39.2(f) (West 1994).</p> <p id=\"b245-4\" pgmap=\"245(118) 246(81)\">Illinois Power appealed the Agency\u2019s rejection of its permit application to the Board. The Board\u2019s decision, published January 23, 1997, noted that the subject materials are \u201cempty pesticide containers [which] present landfill problems due to their non-degradability\u201d and that \u201cthe Illinois EPA has determined that the combustion of the subject material, pursuant to the above-listed conditions specified in the permit applications, will not result in a violation of the Illinois Pollution Control Board rules and regulations.\u201d Illinois Power Co. v. Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, PCB Nos. 97 \u2014 37, 97 \u2014 36 (January 23, 1997). The Board held, \u201cHere, Illinois Power is simply receiving the alternate fuel after it has been processed and transformed by TriRinse and using it in its boilers.\u201d Illinois Power, PCB Nos. 97 \u2014 37, 97 \u2014 36. The Board noted that the material was \u201cno longer\u201d waste within the meaning of the Act. Illinois Power, PCB Nos. 97 \u2014 37, 97 \u2014 36. Therefore, Illinois Power was not a \u201cpollution control facility,\u201d as defined by section 3.32(a) of the Act, and therefore not required to obtain local siting approval. Illinois Power, PCB Nos. 97 \u2014 37, 97 \u2014 36.</p> <p id=\"b246-3\" pgmap=\"246\">Soon after the Board\u2019s decision, Edwin Bakowski, a manager of an Agency permit section, prepared a memorandum concerning solid waste<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> permitting requirements for alternative fuel processing facilities. The memorandum noted that the Board\u2019s decision did not address the regulatory status of the alternate fuel prior to receipt by Illinois Power. The memorandum raised concerns about \u201cthe nuisances and speculative accumulation which may occur at alternative fuel processing facilities. The market for waste plastics is not very well established and in some instances these materials could even have a negative market value. The acceptance of unrinsed plastics could also result in the manufacture of unacceptable alternative fuel, onsite nuisances or contamination.\u201d The memorandum then noted that the \u201calternative fuel processing facilities do not appear to be recycling centers\u201d and that the burning of alternative fuel was not recycling. The \u201cproposed options\u201d were to \u201crequire permits for alternative fuel processing facilities as solid waste treatment and transfer station facilities\u201d or \u201crequire no [Bureau of Land] permits for facilities that only process alternative fuels and address problems with these facilities through enforcement.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b246-4\" pgmap=\"246(20) 247(32)\">The memorandum recommended the first option because \u201cthe permit requirements will provide a proactive approach to eliminate environmental problems before they occur by prescribing operating conditions for the facility. It should also be noted that it is difficult to enforce against permit exempt facilities that have nuisance or speculative accumulation problems.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b247-3\" pgmap=\"247\">Also after the Board\u2019s decision, Illinois Power and AFI, formerly REI, entered into a contract for the sale of alternate fuel, which consisted of the chips from the plastic containers with scrap wood as an additional component. AFI also began contracting with suppliers. Included in the record is an unsigned, undated form contract between AFI and a generic supplier. Under the agreement, the suppliers would make arrangements and bear all costs of transporting nonhazardous fuel-grade material, including wood and plastic, to AFI\u2019s facility. AFI would bill the supplier for receipt of the materials based on varying unit prices for the differing materials. Additionally, AFI warranted that it would comply with all laws and regulations and \u201cin the event that the regulatory conditions under which any of the aforesaid requirements or permits change during the terms of this Agreement, and are beyond the control of AFI, AFI shall be released from its obligation to receive the volumes of Supplier\u2019s material *** [and] that AFI shall rigorously pursue the necessary modifications to its permit status so that it may continue to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b247-4\" pgmap=\"247(89) 248(11)\">Four agency representatives inspected AFI\u2019s facility on May 7, 1998, and May 22, 1998, including Bakowski and Kenneth Mensing, an Agency manager who formerly supervised Wieties at the Agency. According to Bakowski, the facility was \u201cnot a nuisance\u201d and Wieties \u201cappeared to have done his homework. He related a lot of this to hazardous waste and what he thought U.S.E.EA. meant and things like that.\u201d A May 8, 1998, inspection report described the facility as \u201cclean and orderly\u201d and \u201cmainly an area to store plastic materials before and after granulation.\u201d An additional inspection on May 22, 1998, yielded similar results.</p> <p id=\"b248-3\" pgmap=\"248\">In his deposition, Mensing described AFI\u2019s facility as a \u201cbig metal warehouse building\u201d with a \u201crelatively small piece of equipment that was a granulator or a shredder which was the only piece of equipment there to process the incoming material.\u201d The facility was a \u201cclean looking area\u201d with various piles or boxes of materials segregated by supplier or plastic type. Mensing prepared a memorandum of the visit, but his observations \u201cdidn\u2019t quite fit into, you know, a prepared type of checklist that we had.\u201d Mensing explained, \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a non-hazardous waste storage checklist.\u201d He did not mention any permitting violation in his memo. According to Mensing\u2019s memorandum, Wieties was \u201cnot opposed to a \u2018recycling permit\u2019 and would like to work with the Agency to develop and implement a new recycling permit system.\u201d Mensing stated, \u201cIf the health and safety *** were a non-issue, that a permit would still be required simply by the verbiage of the statute, that if this is a facility that\u2019s storing \u2014 you know, treating, storing, or disposing of it, then, you know, a permit should be obtained\u201d regardless of whether the facility poses any sort of environmental threat. Mensing stated that he did not see \u201canything operationally that caused me any problem.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b248-4\" pgmap=\"248(95) 249(102)\">On July 8, 1998, the Agency issued a violation notice to AFI pursuant to section 31(a)(1) of the Act (415 ILCS 5/31(a)(1) (West 1998)). Under section 31 of the Act, an alleged violator may work with the Agency to correct violations without the involvement of a prosecuting authority such as the Attorney General or a State\u2019s Attorney. 415 ILCS 5/31 et seq. (West 1998). Within 180 days of discovery of an alleged violation, the Agency shall serve a violation notice upon the alleged violator and a written response shall be required. 415 ILCS 5/31(a) (West 1998). This notice of violation initiates a series of opportunities for the alleged violator to meet with the Agency and resolve the issue. 415 ILCS 5/31(a) (West 1998). If the parties do not resolve the issue, section 31(b) requires that the Agency provide the alleged violator with notice of its intention to pursue legal action and an opportunity to meet prior to referral to the Attorney General or a State\u2019s Attorney. 415 ILCS 5/31(b) (West 1998). If disagreements remain, the Attorney General or a State\u2019s Attorney shall serve a formal complaint upon the alleged violator. 415 ILCS 5/31(c) (West 1998).</p> <p id=\"b249-3\" pgmap=\"249\">The instant section 31(a) notice alleged a violation of section 21(d)(1) of the Act (415 ILCS 5/21(d)(1) (West 1998)) because \u201c[wjaste was stored and treated without a permit granted by the Illinois EPA.\u201d It also alleged a violation of section 21(e) of the Act (415 ILCS 5/21(e) (West 1998)) because \u201c[wjaste was stored and treated at [AFI\u2019sJ facility which does not meet the requirements of the Act and regulations thereunder.\u201d The notice stated, \u201cDue to the nature and seriousness of the violations cited, please be advised that resolution of the violations may require the involvement of a prosecutorial authority for purposes that may include, among others, the imposition of statutory penalties.\u201d The suggested resolution was the submission of a permit application for a waste storage and waste treatment operation to the Agency\u2019s Bureau of Land Permit Section by September 30, 1998. To obtain a permit, AFI was required to obtain local siting approval pursuant to the Act. 415 ILCS 5/39.2 (West 1998).</p> <p id=\"b249-4\" pgmap=\"249\">According to Wieties\u2019 affidavit, due to the issuance of the violation notice, AFI\u2019s primary investors withdrew their support, and its primary supplier withdrew from the agreement in July 1998. AFI thereafter halted its manufacturing operations.</p> <p id=\"b249-5\" pgmap=\"249(8) 250(131)\">The parties subsequently met on September 15, 1998. The Agency advised Wieties it deemed the alternate fuel materials as \u201cwaste\u201d under section 3.53 of the Act (415 ILCS 5/3.53 (West 1998)). The Act defines \u201cwaste,\u201d in pertinent part, as follows: \u201c \u2018Waste\u2019 means any garbage, sludge from a waste treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility or other discarded material ***.\u201d 415 ILCS 5/3.53 (West 1998). The Agency interpreted \u201cdiscarded material\u201d to refer to any material \u201cwhich is not being utilized for its original purpose.\u201d As AFI was not utilizing the alternate fuel material in a manner which was consistent with its original use by the supplier, it was the Agency\u2019s position that such material had been \u201cdiscarded\u201d and was, therefore, a \u201cwaste.\u201d Wieties and the Agency were not able to resolve the matter.</p> <p id=\"b250-3\" pgmap=\"250(154) 251(41)\">AFI filed a two-count complaint on November 2, 1998, naming as defendants Mary A. Gade, Director of the Agency, and the Agency.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In count I, plaintiff requested a declaration that the materials used by AFI in its manufacturing process were not \u201cwastes\u201d because the materials were not discarded. Count II alleged that AFI was statutorily entitled to recoup all reasonable costs, including attorney fees, because the Agency\u2019s interpretation of \u201cdiscarded material\u201d constituted unauthorized rulemaking under the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act (5 ILCS 100/1 \u2014 1 et seq. (West 1998)). The complaint also alleged that an actual controversy existed and that the declaratory judgment statute vested the court with the power to hear the dispute. 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 701 (West 1998). The Agency moved to dismiss, arguing that there was no actual controversy ripe for determination because AFI failed to exhaust all administrative remedies. The circuit court denied the motion to dismiss. The Agency then filed an answer, along with affirmative defenses in which it denied that the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the claim and that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p> <p id=\"b251-3\" pgmap=\"251\">AFI filed a motion for summary judgment against the Director and the Agency on count I. The trial court ruled that there were no genuine issues of material fact and granted AFI\u2019s motion, finding that the materials were not \u201cwastes\u201d because they were not discarded. Thereafter, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on count II. The trial court granted the Agency\u2019s motion as to count II and denied plaintiffs motion. Both parties appealed, and the appellate court affirmed the rulings of the trial court. 337 Ill. App. 3d 857 (2003). We granted the Agency\u2019s petition for leave to appeal on count I. 177 Ill. 2d R. 315. In its brief, AFI requested cross-relief, requesting that we reverse the appellate court and the trial court on count II. 155 Ill. 2d Rs. 315(g), 318(a). Because this appeal from a summary judgment ruling solely presents issues of law, our review is de novo. First Bank of America, Rockford, N.A. v. Netsch, 166 Ill. 2d 165, 176 (1995).</p> <p id=\"b251-4\" pgmap=\"251\">ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"b251-5\" pgmap=\"251\">The Agency raises two issues on appeal: (1) this case was not justiciable because the declaratory judgment action was not ripe for review until the Agency had concluded its investigatory process, and (2) the Agency properly defined the materials processed by AFI as \u201cdiscarded materials\u201d which constituted \u201cwaste,\u201d thus requiring AFI to secure a permit before producing the alternate fuel. In its cross-appeal, AFI contends that the Agency\u2019s interpretation of \u201cwaste\u201d and its subsequent application of the Act constituted impermissible rule-making, thus making the state liable for AFI\u2019s reasonable costs in the instant action, including attorney fees.</p> <p id=\"Ax\" pgmap=\"252\">Justiciability</p> <p id=\"b252-2\" pgmap=\"252\">The Agency argues that AFI\u2019s claim for declaratory judgment is not justiciable. The Agency specifically contends that because the Agency had not yet finished its investigative process under section 31 of the Act (415 ILCS 5/31 (West 2002)) the matter was not ripe for review. AFI responds that the matter is ripe for review because the Agency had completed its investigation, while AFI was forced to halt its operations and was left with no other avenue to resolve the dispute. We agree with AFI.</p> <p id=\"b252-3\" pgmap=\"252\">\u201c \u2018Concepts of justiciability have been developed to identify appropriate occasions for judicial action. *** The central concepts often are elaborated into more specific categories of justiciability \u2014 advisory opinions, feigned and collusive cases, standing, ripeness, mootness, political questions, and administrative questions.\u2019 \u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 882 (8th ed. 2004), quoting 13 C. Wright, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 3529, at 278-79 (2d ed. 1984). Section 2 \u2014 701 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 701 (West 2002)) sets forth the general requirements of a justiciable declaratory action under Illinois law. This section provides that a court</p> <blockquote id=\"b252-4\" pgmap=\"252\">\u201cmay, in cases of actual controversy, making binding declarations of rights, having the force of final judgments, whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed, including the determination, at the instance of anyone interested in the controversy, of the construction of any statute *** or other governmental regulation *** and a declaration of the rights of the parties interested. *** The court shall refuse to enter a declaratory judgment or order, if it appears that the judgment or order, would not terminate the controversy or some part thereof, giving rise to the proceeding.\u201d 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 701(a) (West 2002).</blockquote> <p id=\"b252-5\" pgmap=\"252(36) 253(74)\">The declaratory judgment statute must be liberally construed and should not be restricted by unduly technical interpretations. Netsch, 166 Ill. 2d at 174. This remedy is used to afford security and relief to the parties so as to avoid potential litigation. See, e.g., Netsch, 166 Ill. 2d at 174. \u201cOur courts have recognized that \u2018[t]he mere existence of a claim, assertion or challenge to plaintiffs legal interests, *** which cast[s] doubt, insecurity, and uncertainty upon plaintiffs rights or status, damages plaintiffs pecuniary or material interests and establishes a condition of justiciability.\u2019 \u201d Netsch, 166 Ill. 2d at 175, quoting Roberts v. Roberts, 90 Ill. App. 2d 184, 187 (1967).</p> <p id=\"b253-3\" pgmap=\"253\">Here, in the context of a challenge to an administrative action, we specifically consider ripeness, a component of justiciability. The ripeness doctrine is designed \u201c \u2018 \u201cto prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in arbitrary disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.\u201d \u2019 \u201d National Marine, Inc. v. Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, 159 Ill. 2d 381, 388 (1994), quoting Bio-Medical Laboratories, Inc. v. Trainor, 68 Ill. 2d 540, 546 (1977), quoting Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681, 691, 87 S. Ct. 1507, 1515 (1967); see also National Park Hospitality Ass\u2019n v. Department of the Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 808, 155 L. Ed. 2d 1017, 1024, 123 S. Ct. 2026, 2030 (2003). It is well settled that \u201c \u2018[t]he problem is best seen in a twofold aspect, requiring us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u2019 \u201d National Marine, 159 Ill. 2d at 389, quoting Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 149, 18 L. Ed. 2d at 691, 87 S. Ct. at 1515; see also National Park Hospitality Ass\u2019n, 538 U.S. at 808, 155 L. Ed. 2d at 1024, 123 S. Ct. at 2030.</p> <p id=\"b253-4\" pgmap=\"253(22) 254(186)\">As to the first factor, the issue presented is fit for a judicial decision at this time. In contention is the correct interpretation of \u201cdiscarded material\u201d in section 3.535 of the Act (415 ILCS 5/3.535 (West 2002)). Both sides have approached this matter in terms of statutory construction, and there is no dispute over the facts. Wieties\u2019 discussions with the Agency began in 1994 and involved a number of Agency employees over time. The record clearly demonstrates that the Agency had finished its investigation and had decided AFI stored and treated waste, requiring local siting approval and a waste permit, a stance that has not changed. The Agency performed two inspections of the facility in May 1998. Agency personnel continued their internal discussions regarding AFI and the waste issue, which then culminated in a violation notice. After the Agency issued the violation notice, Wieties responded to and met with the Agency in an unsuccessful attempt at resolving the stalemate concerning the definition of waste. As applied specifically to AFI, the Agency has little incentive to change its definition of \u201cwaste\u201d as AFI has closed shop, obviating the need for a permit and potential prosecution. Thus, there is no prospect for further factual development to aid judicial resolution.</p> <p id=\"b254-3\" pgmap=\"254(125) 255(96)\">As to the second factor, the hardship upon AFI is more than sufficient to render judicial review appropriate at this stage. On June 14, 1994, Wieties, on behalf of REI, sent a letter to the Agency for a waste determination. The Agency responded that REI was treating \u201cwaste.\u201d After Wieties\u2019 company filed an appeal before the Board, the Agency filed a motion to dismiss contending that the response letter was not a \u201cfinal\u201d decision. Thereafter, Wieties\u2019 company filed a motion to withdraw. The legal question with regard to Wieties\u2019 company, now named AFI, remained unanswered through 1998, when Wieties\u2019 meetings with the Agency continued unsuccessfully. The Agency\u2019s interpretation put AFI into a dilemma: secure an allegedly unnecessary permit with the requisite local siting approval, take a potentially more costly alternative of risking serious penalties by continuing and waiting for the ax of Agency prosecution to fall, or discontinue operations. When AFI chose the third option, the Agency had no incentive to refer the matter for prosecution because there was no longer a continuing violation. Indeed, the Agency has given no indication that it wished to issue a section 31(b) notice, much less prosecute the matter. We also note that AFI has not sought relief in this action to prevent the Agency from doing so.</p> <p id=\"b255-3\" pgmap=\"255\">The practical effect upon AFI of failing to allow judicial review at this time would be to foreclose all access to the courts for a determination of the legal question of whether AFI was processing \u201cwaste\u201d under the Act \u2014 a question which Wieties has been pursuing for over 10 years. The parties do not dispute that AFI is a viable business entity which was directly affected by Agency action. The Agency\u2019s decision affected AFI in a concrete way; the notice of violation caused AFI to lose financing, lose its suppliers, and halt operations, thereby ending AFI\u2019s agreement with Illinois Power. Thus, AFI has already felt a direct and palpable injury and has an immediate financial stake in the resolution of the instant action.</p> <p id=\"b255-4\" pgmap=\"255(102) 256(89)\">We find the primary authority proffered by the Agency, National Marine, Inc. v. Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, 159 Ill. 2d 381 (1994), distinguishable. In National Marine, the Agency issued a notice informing the plaintiff that it could be potentially liable for a \u201crelease or a substantial threat of a release of a hazardous substance on the property\u201d pursuant to section 4(q) of the Act. National Marine, 159 Ill. 2d at 383; Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 111\u00bd, par. 1004(q). This notice was based on the Agency finding \u201cburied drums filled with unknown materials, buried tires and wood which had apparently been used as fill material, black-stained soil near an underground storage tank riser *** and an abandoned well house.\u201d National Marine, 159 Ill. 2d at 384. Plaintiff sought a declaration that section 4(q) of the Act was unconstitutional, an injunction enjoining the Agency from enforcement arising from the section 4(q) notice or relying on the factual findings found in the notice, and the issuance of a writ of certiorari to review the Agency\u2019s record and reverse and quash the section 4(q) notice. National Marine, 159 Ill. 2d at 384.</p> <p id=\"b256-3\" pgmap=\"256\">This court noted that \u201cthe complaint, in essence, sought to obtain judicial review of the Agency\u2019s issuance of the 4(q) notice prior to the Agency\u2019s initiation of cost-recovery/enforcement proceedings before the Pollution Control Board (Board) or the circuit court.\u201d National Marine, 159 Ill. 2d at 385. We found, \u201cat this preliminary stage in the administrative process, it is not clear whether the Agency will even initiate a cost-recovery/ enforcement proceeding against plaintiff before one of these bodies. Clearly, under the circumstances, plaintiffs complaint is premature.\u201d National Marine, 159 Ill. 2d at 390-91. We reasoned:</p> <blockquote id=\"b256-4\" pgmap=\"256\">\u201cTo allow preenforcement judicial review of the Agency\u2019s mere issuance of the 4(q) notice would undermine the statutory scheme of the Act. Affording plaintiff judicial review at this preliminary stage in the administrative process could potentially open the door and enable parties \u2018to litigate separately every alleged error committed by an agency in the course of the administrative proceedings.\u2019 [Citations.]</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b256-5\" pgmap=\"256(72) 257(23)\">In addition, preenforcement judicial review of the issuance of a 4(q) notice would substantially thwart the legislative purpose of providing expedient containment of environmental pollution. Allowing this type of judicial review prior to the final stage of the administrative process would substantially delay the quick, effective response action called for by the Act. The clean-up process could be delayed by months or even years at great cost to the environment and public health and safety. Such a result will not be countenanced by this court.\u201d National Marine, 159 Ill. 2d at 392-93.</blockquote> <p id=\"b257-5\" pgmap=\"257\">The concerns of National Marine are not evident in the record. The instant case does not \u201csubstantially delay the quick, effective response called for by the Act.\u201d The record contains no allegations of any environmental contamination. The salient hazard to the environment caused by the plastics exists only in the actual burning of the plastics, for which Illinois Power has received a permit, and the nonbiodegradable character of the agricultural containers, which AFI is potentially alleviating by processing the containers into alternate fuel. Furthermore, the accumulation of materials was only \u201cspeculative.\u201d After the Agency issued the notice of violations, AFI discontinued its operations and all further manufacturing of the alternate fuel ceased. This is a case where, as Mensing stated, the environmental hazard is a nonissue. Instead it involves only the \u201cverbiage\u201d of the statute. Indeed, by issuing a violation notice which led to the subsequent halting of operations, the Agency has been successful in abating any potential nuisance. It is difficult to conceive of a benefit to the environment of a continued investigation of a facility where inspections revealed no danger to the environment and where all operations had ceased. Thus, there was no thwarting of the Act\u2019s purpose to provide expedient containment of environmental risks.</p> <p id=\"b257-6\" pgmap=\"257(77) 258(83)\">Additionally, the present relief sought is not similar to that sought in National Marine. AFI did not seek the issuance of a writ of certiorari to review the Agency\u2019s record or to quash the section 31(a) notice. AFI sought nothing precluding the Agency from continuing its investigation, issuing a notice under section 31(b), or referring the matter to a prosecutorial authority under section 31(c). Nevertheless, nothing in the record demonstrates that the Agency sought to further pursue its investigation of AFI. Additionally, nothing prevented the Agency from continuing its investigation under the Act which could have culminated in a counterclaim in the present action. AFI alleges that the only error the Agency committed was in its interpretation of the Act. Thus, the present action is not \u201cpreenforcement,\u201d as there is no allegation that AFI sought to evade Agency action, nor is there any indication that the Agency wished to refer a matter concerning a discontinued operation to a prosecutorial authority.</p> <p id=\"b258-3\" pgmap=\"258\">Further, unlike in National Marine, the Agency\u2019s action here constituted more than a merely preliminary step prior to an eventual final Agency action. As stated, once AFI discontinued its operations, there was no further incentive for the Agency to refer the matter for enforcement over a dispute concerning only statutory interpretation. Unlike in National Marine, there was not any alleged environmental contamination. Conceivably, there being no continuing production, AFI would have to wait until the Agency filed a complaint based upon a facility that was no longer in operation. As Mensing stated, it was \u201cspeculation\u201d that the Agency would have filed a complaint. As stated by the Agency in its brief, AFI\u2019s declaratory judgment action was filed \u201cat a time when it was unclear whether the Agency, through a State\u2019s Attorney or the Attorney General, would ever initiate an enforcement proceeding.\u201d Furthermore, Mensing stated in his deposition that \u201cif he had just stopped doing it, I don\u2019t know if we would have pursued any further enforcement.\u201d It is not necessary for AFI to expose itself to further liability by continuing the disputed operations for the Agency to pursue administrative remedies entirely in its control until the Agency had deemed it \u201cfinal.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b258-4\" pgmap=\"258(18) 259(121)\">Under the circumstances of this case, where Wieties has been attempting to get a formal determination of the definition of \u201cwaste\u201d under the Act for now over 10 years, where there are no allegations of environmental hazard presented in the record, where the Agency had essentially obtained compliance with the Act, where the declaratory action did not additionally seek to enjoin the Agency from pursuing further action, where AFI had no further administrative recourse but to wait for prosecution on its halted operations, and where the resolution of the case depends entirely on a statutory interpretation, the concerns addressed in National Marine are not present. We therefore find that the record reveals an actual controversy resting on the parties\u2019 conflicting interpretations of the Act which affected plaintiff\u2019s pecuniary interest. This matter is ripe for review and thus justiciable.</p> <p id=\"b259-3\" pgmap=\"259\">Definition of \u201cDiscarded Material\u201d</p> <p id=\"b259-4\" pgmap=\"259\">The Agency contends on appeal that AFI was receiving and processing \u201cdiscarded material\u201d within the plain meaning of the definition of \u201cwaste\u201d within section 3.535 of the Act (415 ILCS 5/3.535 (West 2002)), thus requiring AFI to secure a permit. The Agency further argues that the term \u201cdiscarded\u201d should be construed from the perspective of the supplier, such that a material is considered discarded if it is used for a purpose other than that originally intended by the generator of the material. AFI responds that when the phrase \u201cdiscarded material\u201d is read in conjunction with section 3.380 of the Act (415 ILCS 5/3.380 (West 2002)), it is apparent that the materials it receives are not \u201cdiscarded\u201d and, therefore, are not \u201cwaste\u201d requiring a permit. The parties agree the Act does not define the term \u201cdiscarded.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b259-5\" pgmap=\"259(6) 260(164)\">The fundamental principle of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature\u2019s intent. Michigan Avenue National Bank v. County of Cook, 191 Ill. 2d 493, 503-04 (2000). The language of the statute is the most rehable indicator of the legislature\u2019s objectives in enacting a particular law. Hawes v. Luhr Brothers, Inc., 212 Ill. 2d 93, 105 (2004). We give statutory-language its plain and ordinary meaning, and, where the language is clear and unambiguous, we must apply the statute without resort to further aids of statutory construction. Michigan Avenue National Bank, 191 Ill. 2d at 504. We must not depart from the plain language of the Act by reading into it exceptions, limitations, or conditions that conflict with the express legislative intent. Hawes v. Luhr Brothers, Inc., 212 Ill. 2d at 105. Moreover, words and phrases should not be construed in isolation, but must be interpreted in light of other relevant provisions of the statute. Michigan Avenue National Bank, 191 Ill. 2d at 504.</p> <p id=\"b260-3\" pgmap=\"260(63) 261(19)\">Section 21 of the Act lists prohibited acts, stating, in relevant part, \u201c[n]o person shall: *** (d) Conduct any waste-storage, waste-treatment, or waste-disposal operation: (1) without a permit granted by the Agency ***. *** (e) Dispose, treat, store or abandon any waste, or transport any waste into this State for disposal, treatment, storage or abandonment, except at a site or facility which meets the requirements of this Act and of regulations and standards thereunder.\u201d 415 ILCS 5/21 (West 2002).</p> <p id=\"b261-5\" pgmap=\"261\">The Agency issued a violation notice alleging a violation of section 21(d)(1) because \u201c[wjaste was stored and treated without a permit granted by the Illinois EPA.\u201d It also alleged a violation of section 21(e) of the Act because \u201c[wjaste was stored and treated at [AFI\u2019s] facility which does not meet the requirements of the Act and regulations thereunder.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b261-6\" pgmap=\"261\">The Act defines \u201cwaste\u201d as:</p> <blockquote id=\"b261-7\" pgmap=\"261\">\u201cany garbage, sludge from a waste treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility or other discarded material, including solid, liquid, semi-solid, or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial, commercial, mining and agricultural operations, and from community activities ***.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 415 ILCS 5/3.535 (West 2002).</blockquote> <p id=\"b261-8\" pgmap=\"261\">In this section, the Act uses the term \u201cdiscarded\u201d only as a modifier to the term \u201cmaterial.\u201d The Act does not elaborate as to who or what subject exactly performed the discard action. Rather, the focus remains on the object: \u201cmaterial.\u201d Given that the Act does not specify the subject, the Agency\u2019s proposition \u2014 that the modifier \u201cdiscarded\u201d should be construed from the perspective of the supplier \u2014 is not unequivocally erroneous. However, a look at another pertinent portion of the Act demonstrates that the Act retains its focus on the \u201cmaterial\u201d itself as it passes between entities.</p> <p id=\"b261-9\" pgmap=\"261\">The Act uses the term \u201cdiscarded\u201d in section 3.380 of the Act (415 ILCS 5/3.380 (West 2002)), which reads as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b261-10\" pgmap=\"261(52) 262(13)\">\u201c \u2018Recycling, reclamation or reuse\u2019 means a method, technique, or process designed to remove any contaminant from waste so as to render such waste reusable, or any process by which materials that would otherwise be disposed of or discarded are collected, separated or processed and returned to the economic mainstream in the form of raw materials or products.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 415 ILCS 5/3.380 (West 2002).</blockquote> <p id=\"b262-4\" pgmap=\"262\">Under this phrasing the legislature has categorized items that may be recycled, reclaimed, or reused into two main categories: (1) \u201cwaste\u201d from which contaminants may be removed and (2) \u201cmaterials.\u201d 415 ILCS 5/3.380 (West 2002). \u201cMaterials\u201d are further subdivided into those that are \u201cdiscarded\u201d and those \u201cmaterials that would otherwise be disposed of or discarded [which] are collected, separated or processed and returned to the economic mainstream in the form of raw materials or products.\u201d 415 ILCS 5/3.380 (West 2002). While the legislature has not defined \u201cdiscarded materials,\u201d the legislature has mentioned what it is not: \u201cmaterials that would otherwise be disposed of or discarded [which] are *** returned to the economic mainstream in the form of raw materials and products.\u201d Thus, materials are \u201cdiscarded\u201d unless they are returned to the economic mainstream.</p> <p id=\"b262-5\" pgmap=\"262\">Here, AFI was not removing contaminants from the triple-rinsed containers or from wood. The contaminants had been removed by the triple-rinsing process before they arrived at AFFs facility and there is no indication in the record of proposed removal of contaminants from wood. Therefore, the solid at issue is a \u201cmaterial.\u201d We next consider whether this material was otherwise discarded or if it was \u201ccollected, separated or processed and returned to the economic mainstream in the form of raw materials or products.\u201d AFI processes the plastic containers and returns the materials as a \u201cproduct\u201d into the economic mainstream, as demonstrated by the contract with Illinois Power. Under the Act, the materials are, therefore, not discarded.</p> <p id=\"b262-6\" pgmap=\"262(32) 263(28)\">The comparison of AFFs facility to the statutory definitions for \u201crecycling center\u201d and \u201cpollution control facility\u201d reinforces this interpretation. Under the Act, \u201c \u2018recycling center\u2019 means a site or facility that accepts only segregated, nonhazardous, nonspecial, homogenous, nonputrescible materials, such as dry paper, glass, cans or plastics, for subsequent use in the secondary materials market.\u201d 415 ILCS 5/3.375 (West 2002).</p> <p id=\"b263-3\" pgmap=\"263\">By contrast, a \u201cpollution control facility\u201d is \u201cany waste storage site, sanitary landfill, waste disposal site, waste transfer station, waste treatment facility, or waste incinerator. This includes sewers, sewage treatment plants, and any other facilities owned or operated by sanitary districts organized under the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Act.\u201d 415 ILCS 5/3.330 (West 2002). The aim of AFI was not to store, landfill, dispose, transfer, treat, or incinerate waste. Rather, AFI shreds the plastic materials that have already been \u201ctriple rinsed\u201d by Tri-Rinse, Inc., and sells the chips to Illinois Power. While AFI\u2019s facility does not neatly fit into the category of \u201crecycling center\u201d because it does more than simply \u201caccept\u201d materials, AFI\u2019s facility retained more characteristics of a \u201crecycling center\u201d than a \u201cpollution control facility,\u201d chiefly because it handles \u201cmaterials\u201d rather than \u201cwaste.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b263-4\" pgmap=\"263\">In its petition for rehearing, the Agency argues that our interpretation here conflicts with the definition of \u201crecycling\u201d in the Illinois Solid Waste Management Act (415 ILCS 20/1 et seq. (West 2002)). The Agency specifically refers to the definition of \u201crecycling\u201d in section 2.1, which provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b263-5\" pgmap=\"263\">\u201c[T]he process by which solid waste is collected, separated and processed for reuse as either a raw material or a product which itself is subject to recycling, but does not include the combustion of waste for energy recovery or volume reduction.\u201d 415 ILCS 20/2.1 (West 2002).</blockquote> <p id=\"b263-6\" pgmap=\"263(46) 264(69)\">This provision is inapplicable. As is obvious from its title, the Illinois Solid Waste Management Act governs the disposal of \u201csolid waste.\u201d 415 ILCS 20/1 (West 2002). Though the plastic chips are eventually sold to Illinois Power for \u201cenergy recovery,\u201d we have held that AFI is not processing \u201cwaste\u201d under the Act. Thus, the process creating the chips does not constitute \u201crecycling\u201d under this definition. Furthermore, our holding that AFI\u2019s facility is not a \u201cpollution control center\u201d is not to be read as a determination that the facility is a \u201crecycling center\u201d under the Act. Therefore, our interpretation of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act is consistent with the Illinois Solid Waste Management Act.</p> <p id=\"b264-3\" pgmap=\"264\">We therefore reject the Agency\u2019s contention that \u201cdiscarded\u201d is defined solely from the viewpoint of the supplier in that a material is putatively \u201cdiscarded\u201d as \u201cany material which is not being utilized for its intended purpose\u201d of the generator. There is nothing in the statute which would dictate this definition. Rather, the Act contemplates that materials that may otherwise be discarded by the supplier may be diverted from becoming waste and returned to the economic mainstream.</p> <p id=\"b264-4\" pgmap=\"264\">On rehearing, the Agency contends that this court\u2019s interpretation of the Act is out of step with a series of federal court decisions construing the term \u201cdiscarded material\u201d contained in a similar definition of \u201csolid waste\u201d in the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6901 et seq. (2000); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6903(27) (2000) (defining \u201csolid waste\u201d). We disagree and find our application of the Act to AFI\u2019s facility is in harmony with the RCRA.</p> <p id=\"b264-5\" pgmap=\"264(92) 265(12)\">We initially note that under basic rules of statutory construction, we give statutory language its plain and ordinary meaning, and, where the language is clear and unambiguous, we must apply the statute without resort to further aids of statutory construction. Michigan Avenue National Bank, 191 Ill. 2d at 504. Because we find that the plain language of the Act does not require AFI to secure a permit, a review of decisions construing a similar statute is not necessary. Nevertheless, a review of the RCRA definition cited by the Agency and of cases construing it does not persuade us that a different result is warranted.</p> <p id=\"b265-3\" pgmap=\"265\">The RCRA establishes a regulatory structure overseeing the safe treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. American Petroleum Institute v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 906 F.2d 729, 732 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Congress\u2019 \u201coverriding concern\u201d in enacting the RCRA was to establish the framework for a national system to insure the safe management of hazardous wastes. United States v. ILCO, Inc., 996 F.2d 1126 (11th Cir. 1993). Before the material can be a \u201chazardous waste\u201d subject to the RCRA, it must first meet the RCRA\u2019s definition of \u201csolid waste,\u201d as well as additional requirements pertaining to the hazardous nature of the waste. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6903(5) (2000) (defining \u201chazardous waste\u201d). Under the RCRA, the term \u201csolid waste\u201d</p> <blockquote id=\"b265-4\" pgmap=\"265\">\u201cmeans any garbage, refuse, sludge *** and other discarded material, including solid, liquid, semisolid, or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial, commercial, mining, and agricultural operations, and from community activities ***.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6903(27) (2000).</blockquote> <p id=\"AWX\" pgmap=\"265\">While this provision is virtually identical to the Act\u2019s definition in section 3.535 (415 ILCS 5/3.535 (West 2002)), the Agency\u2019s argument ignores our reliance on section 3.380 of the Act to determine whether the material at issue was \u201cdiscarded material.\u201d 415 ILCS 5/3.380 (West 2002). Accordingly, the Agency\u2019s present argument on rehearing suffers from the failure to cite a parallel provision of the RCRA which would similarly guide our interpretation of the term \u201cdiscarded material.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b265-5\" pgmap=\"265(52) 266(80)\">Furthermore, the RCRA grants the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) enforcement powers and authority to promulgate regulations establishing a comprehensive management system for hazardous wastes. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6921 through 6939b (2000). For instance, the USEPA has promulgated regulations under the RCRA, which further define the phrase \u201csolid waste\u201d as any \u201cdiscarded material\u201d and it further defines \u201cdiscarded material.\u201d 40 C.F.R. Pt. 261.2 (2003). Notably, this definition of \u201cdiscarded material\u201d includes certain materials which are \u201c[bjurned to recover energy\u201d or are \u201c[u]sed to produce a fuel or are otherwise contained in fuels (in which case the. fuel itself remains a solid waste).\u201d 40 C.F.R. Pt. 261.2(c)(2) (2003). Moreover, the USEPA has also expressly explained that this regulatory definition applies only to wastes that are hazardous. Section 261.1(b)(1) states:</p> <blockquote id=\"b266-3\" pgmap=\"266\">\u201cThe definition of solid waste contained in this part applies only to wastes that also are hazardous for purposes of the regulations implementing subtitle C of the RCRA. For example, it does not apply to materials (such as nonhazardous scrap, paper, textiles, or rubber) that are not otherwise hazardous and that are recycled.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.1(b)(1) (2003).</blockquote> <p id=\"b266-4\" pgmap=\"266\">Thus, the RCRA definition of \u201csolid waste\u201d is distinguishable from the case at bar because of its a priori reflection of Congress\u2019 \u201coverriding concern\u201d with hazardous materials. There is no dispute that the materials that AFI processes are not \u201chazardous.\u201d When the plastic containers arrive at AFI\u2019s facility they have already been \u201ctriple-rinsed\u201d by Tri-Rinse, Inc. Thereafter, the plastic containers are shredded into chips and then sold to Illinois Power. The remaining potential danger posed by the plastic derives from the burning of the plastic. However, that concern has been addressed by the Agency\u2019s permit issuance to Illinois Power.</p> <p id=\"b266-5\" pgmap=\"266(66) 267(305) 268(23)\">The Agency\u2019s proffered cases are also inapposite because of their procedural posture. In each case, the courts reviewed USEPA regulations or orders that were made pursuant to the statute regarding facilities that handled hazardous wastes. Owen Electric Steel Co. of South Carolina, Inc. v. Browner, 37 F.3d 146 (4th Cir. 1994) (reviewing USEPA order concerning whether a slag processing area within a facility that treated, stored, or disposed of hazardous waste was a solid waste management unit); United States v. ILCO, Inc., 996 F.2d 1126 (11th Cir. 1993) (reviewing a USEPA regulation as applied to smelting of spent batteries to produce lead ingots which produced several specific hazardous wastes); American Mining Congress v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 907 F.2d 1179 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (reviewing USEPA rule relisting as hazardous six wastes generated from metal smelting operation); American Petroleum Institute v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 906 F.2d 729 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (reviewing USEPA rule exempting the slag residues that result from the treatment of \u201cK061\u201d in zinc smelters from the RCRA\u2019s restrictions on land disposal of hazardous wastes); American Mining Congress v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 824 F.2d 1177 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (reviewing USEPA regulation that amended the definition of \u201csolid waste\u201d to establish and define the Agency\u2019s authority to regulate secondary petroleum and mining materials reused within an industry\u2019s ongoing production process). In each case, the USEPA argued that its specific interpretation was entitled to deference under a Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778 (1984) analysis. In short, the courts determined if the USEPA regulations or orders were a \u201cpermissible\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d construction of the definition of \u201cdiscarded\u201d under the RCRA which were entitled to deference under Chevron. Owen Electric Steel Co., 37 F.3d at 150; ILCO, 996 F.2d at 1130; American Mining Congress, 907 F.2d at 1186; American Petroleum Institute, 906 F.2d at 740; American Mining Congress, 824 F.2d at 1182. In contrast to the federal cases, the Agency does not argue that its interpretation of \u201cdiscarded material\u201d in this litigation is entitled to the same deference under the Chevron analysis. Furthermore, the Agency points to no regulation, federal or otherwise, that further defines \u201cdiscarded materials\u201d which would apply to the present nonhazardous material. Therefore, these cases are distinguishable.</p> <p id=\"b268-3\" pgmap=\"268\">We note that this may not be the final word on whether this type of industry may remain outside of the Agency\u2019s purview. As AFI\u2019s counsel stated at oral argument before this court, the Agency may deem this industry worthy of regulation through a properly promulgated regulation which further defines \u201cdiscarded materials.\u201d Until such a clarifying regulation is in place, the plain meaning of the Act does not dictate that the present materials are \u201cdiscarded\u201d and therefore \u201cwaste.\u201d Hence, we find that AFI is not a \u201cpollution control facility\u201d requiring a permit which would further require local siting approval.</p> <p id=\"b268-4\" pgmap=\"268\">Attorney Fees</p> <p id=\"b268-5\" pgmap=\"268\">In its cross-appeal, AFI contends that the Agency\u2019s interpretation of \u201cwaste\u201d constituted impermissible rule-making, thus making the state hable for AFI\u2019s attorney fees in the instant action. The Agency responds that it was merely interpreting the statute as it applied to this particular case, rather than engaging in any formal rule-making. We agree with the Agency.</p> <p id=\"b268-6\" pgmap=\"268\">Section 10 \u2014 55(c) of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act (5 ILCS 100/10 \u2014 55(c) (West 2002)) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b268-7\" pgmap=\"268\">\u201cIn any case in which a party has any administrative rule invalidated by a court for any reason, including but not limited to the agency\u2019s exceeding its statutory authority or the agency\u2019s failure to follow statutory procedures in the adoption of the rule, the court shall award the party bringing the action the reasonable expenses of the litigation, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d 5 ILCS 100/ 10 \u2014 55(c) (West 2002).</blockquote> <p id=\"b268-8\" pgmap=\"268\">The Administrative Procedure Act further includes the following definition of a \u201crule\u201d:</p> <blockquote id=\"b269-2\" pgmap=\"269\">\u201c \u2018Rule\u2019 means each agency statement of general applicability that implements, applies, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, but does not include (i) statements concerning only the internal management of an agency and not affecting private rights or procedures available to persons or entities outside the agency, (ii) informal advisory rulings issued under Section 5 \u2014 150, (iii) intra-agency memoranda, (iv) the prescription of standardized forms, or (v) documents prepared or filed or actions taken by the Legislative Reference Bureau under Section 5.04 of the Legislative Reference Bureau Act.\u201d 5 ILCS 100/1 \u2014 70 (West 2002).</blockquote> <p id=\"b269-3\" pgmap=\"269\">AFI has failed to demonstrate that the Agency\u2019s interpretation of \u201cdiscarded material\u201d as \u201cany material which is not being utilized for its intended purpose\u201d is \u201ca statement of general applicability.\u201d AFI cites intraagency memoranda, and remarks taken from the depositions of Ed Bakowski and Kenneth Mensing that this interpretatipn was to provide \u201cguidance\u201d to the regulated community. Such statements do not affect private rights or procedures available to specific entities outside the Agency. 5 ILCS 100/1 \u2014 70(i) (West 2002). AFI points only to the deposition testimony of Kenneth Mensing which states that a violation notice was issued to one business other than AFI, using the same interpretation of \u201cdiscarded material.\u201d Mensing stated that this business elected to secure a permit rather than challenge the violation notice. However, further details of the Agency\u2019s application of this interpretation to this business are not available in the record. Given the paucity of information pertaining to the second business, as well as the lack of any information in the record concerning Agency action pertaining to the business community at large, we find the record is devoid of any indication that the Agency\u2019s interpretation of \u201cdiscarded material\u201d was a statement of general applicability.</p> <p id=\"b269-4\" pgmap=\"269(16) 270(115)\">Additionally, nowhere in the record has AFI demonstrated that the Agency exceeded its statutory authority in merely interpreting the Act and issuing a notice of violations premised upon that interpretation, nor could it. The Agency here was interpreting a statutory term, \u201cdiscarded material,\u201d based on a particular set of facts, and it was entitled to do so. We further note that this interpretation was not manifestly erroneous, as the Board in the Illinois Power decision (Illinois Power Co. v. Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, PCB Nos. 97\u201437, 97\u201436 (January 23, 1997)) noted that the material was \u201cno longer\u201d waste by the time it arrived at the Baldwin Power Plant. While the Agency\u2019s interpretation of the Act was ultimately incorrect, no statutory provision prevents the Agency from making a mere interpretation.</p> <p id=\"b270-3\" pgmap=\"270\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b270-4\" pgmap=\"270\">We find that plaintiffs claim was justiciable, that AFI was not processing \u201cwaste\u201d in the form of \u201cdiscarded material,\u201d and that AFI is not entitled to attorney fees because the Agency\u2019s interpretation was not one of \u201cgeneral application.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the appellate court\u2019s judgment affirming the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment for plaintiff on count I and for defendant on count II.</p> <p id=\"b270-5\" pgmap=\"270\">Appellate court judgment affirmed.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b246-5\" pgmap=\"246\">Under the Act \u201csolid waste\u201d means waste. 415 ILCS 5/3.82 (West 1994).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"2\"> <p id=\"b250-4\" pgmap=\"250\">Plaintiff also named St. Clair County as a defendant.

Although the majority\u2019s reasoning to the contrary is not without some sympathetic appeal, I do not believe that the instant action is ripe.</p> <p id=\"b270-8\" pgmap=\"270(44) 271(73)\">The facts which I consider to be pertinent to the analysis may be stated succinctly. (1) AFI started up its operation. (2) The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (Agency) issued AFI a \u201cviolation notice,\u201d under section 31(a) of the Act (415 ILCS 5/31(a) (West 1994)), in which the Agency alleged that AFI was treating and storing \u201cwaste\u201d without a permit. (3) AFI voluntarily ceased its operations. (4) AFI filed the instant declaratory judgment action in the circuit court, arguing that the materials in question were not waste and requesting that the circuit court enter an order stating that \u201cthe allegation stated in the above-described violation notice issued to [AFI] are [sic] contrary to the law.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b271-3\" pgmap=\"271\">As the majority acknowledges, a section 31(a) violation notice carries no legal repercussions. For the Agency to have attempted to hold AFI liable for its alleged violation of law, the Agency would have had to issue AFI a notice of its intent to pursue legal action under section 31(b) (415 ILCS 5/31(b) (West 1994)) and thereafter referred the case to the Attorney General or State\u2019s Attorney under section 31(c) (415 ILCS 5/31(c) (West 1994)). The Attorney General or State\u2019s Attorney would have had to file a formal complaint against AFI. 415 ILCS 5/31(c) (West 1994). There would have followed a proceeding before the Pollution Control Board. Only if the Board ruled against AFI would any legal consequences have attached.</p> <p id=\"b271-4\" pgmap=\"271(135) 272(24)\">The section 31(a) notice is merely the first step in this process. It is designed to put the recipient on notice that there may be a problem, nothing more. It is not a final determination of culpability \u2014 indeed, it is not even a formal complaint. And as this court has previously stated, \u201c[a]n agency\u2019s preliminary, investigative action is not a final agency decision ripe for judicial review. [Citation.] Notifying a party that it is subject to an investigation which may potentially lead to the institution of an action against that party does not create a claim capable of judicial resolution.\u201d National Marine, Inc. v. Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, 159 Ill. 2d 381, 389 (1994). Thus it would seem that AFI\u2019s complaint in this case ought to have been dismissed. But the majority distinguishes National Marine, thus affirming the ripeness doctrine in theory, but determining that it should not forestall AFI\u2019s suit in the instant case.</p> <p id=\"b272-3\" pgmap=\"272\">I find National Marine indistinguishable with regard to the relevant facts. In both National Marine and the instant case, the Agency issued a preliminary notice of potential liability for an environmental violation. In each case, the party to whom the notice was issued brought suit in the circuit court. Both alleged violators claimed that they were harmed by the mere issuance of the preliminary notices. But in National Marine, as here, the notice was not a final adjudication, and moreover it was \u201cnot clear whether the Agency will even initiate a cost-recovery/enforcement proceeding against plaintiff.\u201d National Marine, 159 Ill. 2d at 390. Therefore, this court concluded that the dispute was not yet ripe because, I repeat, \u201c[a]n agency\u2019s preliminary, investigative action is not a final agency decision ripe for judicial review. [Citation.] Notifying a party that it is subject to an investigation which may potentially lead to the institution of an action against that party does not create a claim capable of judicial resolution.\u201d National Marine, 159 Ill. 2d at 389.</p> <p id=\"b272-4\" pgmap=\"272(117) 273(129)\">The majority raises several points in support of its conclusion that National Marine does not guide our result in the instant case. First, the majority contends that the \u201cconcerns\u201d mentioned in National Marine are not implicated in the present case, because \u201c[t]he instant case does not \u2018substantially delay the quick, effective response called for by the Act.\u2019 \u201d 215 Ill. 2d at 235. This is because, according to the majority, there are \u201cno allegations of any environmental contamination\u201d in the record. Here the majority comes perilously close to assuming what AFI is trying to prove, i.e., that AFI committed no environmental contamination. It is clear, however, that the section 31(a) notice charged AFI with, inter alia, storing \u201cwaste\u201d without a permit. The fact that AFI voluntarily ceased its shredding operations does not permit us to conclude as a matter of law that the storage of waste has wholly ceased.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, this allegation of environmental contamination might indeed be ongoing notwithstanding AFI\u2019s voluntary cessation of operations. The majority\u2019s speculation that the \u201csalient hazard to the environment\u201d consisted \u201conly\u201d of \u201cthe actual burning of the plastics\u201d (215 Ill. 2d at 235) ignores the fact that the Agency charged AFI with conduct unrelated to the burning of the plastics. Indeed, the majority appears to be telling the Agency, as a matter of law, what is and is not a \u201csalient hazard to the environment.\u201d In my view, this is both extraordinary and unwarranted.</p> <p id=\"b273-5\" pgmap=\"273\">The majority also argues that this case is distinguishable from National Marine because</p> <blockquote id=\"b273-6\" pgmap=\"273\">\u201cAFI sought nothing precluding the Agency from continuing its investigation, issuing a notice under section 31(b), or referring the matter to a prosecutorial authority under section 31(c). *** Thus, the present action is not \u2018preenforcement,\u2019 as there is no allegation that AFI sought to evade Agency action, nor is there any indication that the Agency wished to refer a matter concerning a discontinued operation to a prosecutorial authority.\u201d 215 Ill. 2d at 235-36.</blockquote> <p id=\"b273-7\" pgmap=\"273(40) 274(153)\">See also 215 Ill. 2d at 233 (\u201cWe also note that AFI has not sought relief in this action to prevent the Agency from\u201d issuing a section 31(b) notice or prosecuting AFI). This argument is also unconvincing. Contrary to the majority\u2019s characterization, the instant action is clearly an attempt by AFI to evade Agency action. If not, what would be the point of their filing the declaratory judgment action? This point is underscored by the very relief AFI sought in its complaint: that the circuit court enter an order stating that \u201cthe allegation stated in the above-described violation notice issued to [AFI] are [sic] contrary to the law.\u201d Clearly, such an order \u2014 that the allegations in the section 31(a) notice are contrary to law\u2014 would indeed preclude the Agency from attempting to prosecute AFI for the conduct alleged therein, now or ever. Indeed, as the Agency warns in its brief to this court, declaring the very allegations \u201ccontrary to law\u201d could effectively insulate from prosecution not just AFI, but the entire industry of which AFI is a part \u2014 a possibility that this court ought not to ignore.</p> <p id=\"b274-3\" pgmap=\"274\">Finally, the majority contends that \u201cunlike in National Marine, the Agency\u2019s action here constituted more than a merely preliminary step prior to an eventual final Agency action.\u201d 215 Ill. 2d at 236. I must disagree. From the Agency\u2019s point of view, that is indeed all that it had done. The fact that AFI voluntarily ceased its operations does not somehow convert the Agency\u2019s action from a preliminary step to a final adjudication. As the majority itself noted in the paragraph immediately preceding, the Agency had yet to \u201ccontinu[e] its investigation, issu[e] a notice under section 31(b), or refer[ ] the matter to a prosecutorial authority under section 31(c).\u201d 215 Ill. 2d at 235. The section 31(a) notice is clearly a mere preliminary step in the statutory scheme. The fact that the Agency might not ever have taken these subsequent steps does not distinguish this case from National Marine. See National Marine, 159 Ill. 2d at 390 (\u201cit is not clear whether the Agency will even initiate a cost-recovery/enforcement proceeding against plaintiff\u2019).</p> <p id=\"b274-4\" pgmap=\"274(7) 275(15)\">Thus, I conclude that the majority\u2019s attempted distinctions of National Marine are without a difference as far as the legal principles involved.</p> <p id=\"b275-3\" pgmap=\"275\">Moreover, even if I agreed with the majority that National Marine was distinguishable, and analyzed the case from first principles, I still would not join its conclusion. The majority\u2019s underlying concern is that a party who is the target of an administrative action must be allowed to have its day in court. I agree with the majority that a party must at some point be able to seek redress in the courts for any administrative action against it. However, the ripeness doctrine does not deprive a litigant of access to the courts. Rather, it controls the timing of that access so as to avoid premature litigation and to avoid unnecessary abstract disagreements and entanglement by the courts in agency proceedings. See National Marine, 159 Ill. 2d at 388, quoting Bio-Medical Laboratories, Inc. v. Trainor, 68 Ill. 2d 540, 546, 370 N.E.2d 223 (1977), quoting Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681, 691, 87 S. Ct. 1507, 1515 (1967) (\u201c \u2018The basic rationale of the ripeness doctrine *** \u201cis to prevent the courts, through avoidance of adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties\u201d \u2019 \u201d).</p> <p id=\"b275-4\" pgmap=\"275(82) 276(42)\">The majority is concerned that if the ripeness doctrine were invoked to preclude the instant suit it might truly operate to bar AFI from court, however, because the Agency might never take the subsequent steps necessary to institute enforcement proceedings based on the violation notice. See 215 Ill. 2d at 233. This argument is not without some intuitive force. But in the end it proves too much, as the same argument could be made by any litigant to challenge an initial notification that an agency might institute proceedings against that litigant. It is never a foregone conclusion that an agency will seek to hold an offender accountable. Thus to accept this concern as a general exception to the ripeness doctrine would swallow that rule.</p> <p id=\"b276-3\" pgmap=\"276\">The majority suggests that this case is different from most, however, because \u201cthe Agency had no incentive to refer the matter for prosecution because there was no longer a continuing violation.\u201d 215 Ill. 2d at 233. First, as I previously noted, I do not believe that it is possible to conclude as a matter of law that there was no continuing violation, in that among the allegations in the section 31(a) notice was storage of waste without a permit. But even assuming, arguendo, that we could conclude as a matter of law there was no continuing violation, I would question the significance which the majority attaches to this fact. According to the majority\u2019s reasoning, a party who will never have a final agency decision entered against it may utilize Illinois courts to challenge the basis of the abortive investigation against it \u2014 even though a party which is actually facing the possibility of legal action cannot. Such a result is incongruous. In addition to the question of ripeness, it is far from clear to me that a party would have standing to attack the content of a preliminary notice \u2014 which is, again, not even a formal complaint (see 415 ILCS 5/31(c) (West 2002)) \u2014 in an investigation which has gone nowhere and never will go anywhere. I believe it is unwise to allow a party to use the courts of this state to challenge allegations in the investigative process of a proceeding which will never move forward to impose liability.</p> <p id=\"b276-4\" pgmap=\"276(40) 277(35)\">Notwithstanding the above, AFI is in a somewhat sympathetic position because even though the section 31(a) notice carried no legal consequences, there were real-world implications associated with its issuance. At least some of AFI\u2019s investors \u201cpulled out,\u201d as did its primary supplier. AFI subsequently made the voluntary decision to terminate operations. However, the United States Supreme Court has specifically stated that such by-products of the institution of proceedings do not obviate the ripeness doctrine.</p> <blockquote id=\"b277-3\" pgmap=\"277\">\u201cThe impact of the initiation of judicial proceedings is often serious. Take the case of the grand jury. It returns an indictment against a man without a hearing. It does not determine his guilt; it only determines whether there is probable cause to believe he is guilty. But that determination is conclusive on the issue of probable cause. As a result the defendant can be arrested and held for trial. [Citations.] The impact of an indictment is on the reputation or liberty of a man. The same is true where a prosecutor files an information charging violations of the law. The harm to property and business can also be incalculable by the mere institution of proceedings. Yet it has never been held that the hand of government must be stayed until the courts have an opportunity to determine whether the government is justified in instituting suit in the courts. Discretion of any official may be abused. Yet it is not a requirement of due process that there be judicial inquiry before discretion can be exercised. It is sufficient, where only property rights are concerned, that there is at some stage an opportunity for a hearing and a judicial determination. * * \u2756</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b277-6\" pgmap=\"277\">The determination of probable cause in and of itself had no binding legal consequence ***. It took the exercise of discretion on the part of the Attorney General, as we have pointed out above, to bring it into play against appellee\u2019s business. Judicial review of such a preliminary step in a judicial proceeding is so unique that we are not willing easily to infer that it exists.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Ewing v. Mytinger &amp; Casselberry, Inc., 339 U.S. 594, 598-602, 94 L. Ed. 1088, 1093-95, 70 S. Ct. 870, 872-74 (1950).</blockquote> <p id=\"b277-7\" pgmap=\"277(30) 278(167)\">The majority notes that upon receipt of the section 31(a) notice, AFI was forced to choose between (a) getting a permit, (b) operating without a permit, or (c) shutting down.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 215 Ill. 2d at 232-33. I believe that there is no question that if AFI had chosen option (b), and were still operating its business \u2014 even if investors and its main supplier had pulled out \u2014 this court would find National Marine indistinguishable and we would rule that the instant suit was unripe. The only difference between that case and the case at bar is the majority\u2019s guess that in this case the Agency will probably not advance the proceedings. It is certainly not impossible that the proceedings could continue in this case, however, just as there was no guarantee that they would continue in National Marine. In both cases, whether the suit would proceed would depend on the exercise of the officials\u2019 discretion. But in the instant case, because of the majority\u2019s prognostication about the likelihood that the officials will exercise their discretion in favor of prosecution, the doctrine of ripeness is overridden. I do not agree, and accordingly I respectfully dissent.</p> <p id=\"b278-3\" pgmap=\"278\">CHIEF JUSTICE McMORROW and JUSTICE KIL-BRIDE join in this dissent.</p> <p id=\"b278-4\" pgmap=\"278\">DISSENT ON DENIAL OF REHEARING</p> <footnote label=\"4\"> <p id=\"b273-8\" pgmap=\"273\">The majority cannot justify such a conclusion by citing to its determination on the merits that the matter in question was not \u201cwaste.\u201d This would be equivalent to saying that the case is ripe simply because we decided the underlying issue against the agency. This would eviscerate the ripeness doctrine, as any litigant seeking to challenge any administrative agency\u2019s initial notice could argue that they should win as a matter of law. This court would be placed in the absurd position of having to decide the merits of a case in order to determine whether the case was ripe for adjudication.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"5\"> <p id=\"b278-7\" pgmap=\"278\">The implication that it was unfair to require AFI either to incur the expense of obtaining a permit or to \u201crisk[ ] serious penalties by continuing and waiting for the ax of Agency prosecution to fall\u201d (215 Ill. 2d at 233) is ameliorated by noting that even if the \u201cax\u201d had indeed fallen, and the Agency had succeeded in proving that AFI had violated the permit requirement, AFI still would have had the opportunity to \u201cshow that compliance with the Board\u2019s regulations would impose an arbitrary or unreasonable hardship.\u201d 415 ILCS 5/31(e) (West 2002).</p> </footnote> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b278-5\" pgmap=\"278\">JUSTICE FREEMAN,</author> <p id=\"Azu\" pgmap=\"278\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b278-6\" pgmap=\"278(28) 279(138)\">I believe that rehearing ought to have been granted in this case, for two reasons. First, the membership of this court changed between the issuance of the original opinion and the disposition of the petition for rehearing. Justice Rarick, a member of the majority, retired and was replaced by Justice Karmeier. Because the six remaining participants in the original decision split 3-3 on what action to take on the petition, it was necessary for Justice Karmeier to vote on the petition for rehearing to break the deadlock. Given that a justice was required to begin participating in the case at the petition for rehearing stage, I believe we ought to have granted the petition, in order to have the benefit of full briefing and discussion of the issues in the case, and specifically those concerns raised in the petition for rehearing. I see no harm in at least requesting a response from AFI before taking action, but the majority declines to take even this minor step.</p> <p id=\"b279-3\" pgmap=\"279\">Second, this is not a case in which the petition for rehearing was of no weight, or raised concerns already adequately addressed by the original majority opinion. A comparison of the original disposition and the opinion as modified on denial of rehearing reveals that the majority extensively modified its opinion in response to the EPA\u2019s arguments upon rehearing. I do not intend to fault the majority for taking the petition for rehearing seriously; quite the contrary. But the fact that the majority found such extensive revisions and additions to be necessary serves to underscore my position that the better approach would have been to grant the petition for rehearing, in order to have the benefit of full briefing and discussion of the issues.</p> <p id=\"b279-4\" pgmap=\"279\">Finally, I note that the petition was filed more than six months ago \u2014 and thus, the majority\u2019s choice to foreclose additional briefing and argument cannot even claim the relatively minor virtue of speedy disposition of the petition.</p> <p id=\"b279-5\" pgmap=\"279(18) 280(46)\">The above observations would be true even if I agreed with the majority that the modifications adequately dealt with the petition. I do not. I feel compelled to note the flaws in the majority\u2019s modifications not only to the justiciability issue, upon which I originally dissented in this case, but also on the modifications to the majority\u2019s discussion of the merits of the case.</p> <p id=\"b280-3\" pgmap=\"280\">On the justiciability issue, the majority has inserted on denial of rehearing the suggestion that AFI and its predecessor have been \u201cattempting to get a formal determination of the definition of \u2018waste\u2019 under the Act for now over 10 years\u201d (215 Ill. 2d at 236-37). This overstates the case a bit, in my opinion. AFI has known the Agency\u2019s position, that the materials it was processing are \u201cwaste,\u201d since 1994. AFI simply does not like the Agency\u2019s position, and has been berating the Agency to change its position, for 10 years. The majority\u2019s statement also fails to take into account that AFI\u2019s predecessor withdrew its 1994 appeal, rather than attempting to obtain a ruling from the Board, calling the 10-year mark further into question.</p> <p id=\"b280-4\" pgmap=\"280\">Regarding the merits of the case, the majority now simply assumes what it purports to have proven. The central question is whether the empty plastic fertilizer containers which AFI was processing are \u201cwaste\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The majority concludes, and I agree, that the containers are \u201cwaste\u201d only if they are \u201cdiscarded materials.\u201d 215 Ill. 2d at 239-40. The majority looks at the definition of \u201crecycling, reclamation, or reuse,\u201d and determines that materials are not \u201cdiscarded\u201d if they are instead \u201c \u2018collected, separated or processed and returned to the economic mainstream in the form of raw materials or products.\u2019 \u201d 215 Ill. 2d at 240, quoting 415 ILCS 5/3.380 (West 2002). I also agree with this further step. Further, there is no question that AFI \u201ccollected\u201d and \u201cprocessed\u201d the plastic containers. So the only issue, on the merits, is whether the materials in question are \u201creturned to the economic mainstream in the form of raw materials or products.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b281-2\" pgmap=\"281\">But having finally reached the bedrock question, the majority replaces analysis with assumption. The majority simply states as fact, with no analysis whatsoever, that by shredding the plastic containers and selling the shreds to Illinois Power to be burned for energy recovery, AFI is returning the materials to the economic mainstream as a \u201cproduct.\u201d 215 Ill. 2d at 240. The majority does not spare a moment\u2019s reflection on whether plastic chips sold solely for combustive fuel ought to be characterized as \u201cproducts\u201d in the \u201ceconomic mainstream.\u201d The conclusion is far from obvious to me. On rehearing the EPA strongly disputed this conclusion, noting that combustion of waste for energy recovery is not recycling. See 215 Ill. 2d at 241, quoting 415 ILCS 20/2.1 (West 2002). The EPA argues that if Illinois Power is not recycling when it performs the combustion of waste, neither can AFI be recycling when it processes what would otherwise be waste in order to make it more suitable for combustion and sells it to Illinois Power for combustion. (If the containers AFI is processing are \u201creturned to the economic mainstream in the form of raw materials or products,\u201d then AFI is recycling, by the definition upon which the majority relies. See 415 ILCS 5/3.380 (West 2002).) This is a forceful and logical point, but the majority sidesteps it via the circuitous logic of stating that it is irrelevant, because the majority has already concluded (one page before) that the materials in question are not \u201cwaste.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b281-3\" pgmap=\"281\">In the original opinion, the majority did not analyze whether AFI was returning the materials to the economic mainstream as products because it mistakenly believed that the EPA did not dispute this fact. But now that the EPA has made it clear, on rehearing, that the majority was mistaken, and the EPA does indeed dispute this characterization of AFI\u2019s operations, some analysis must be undertaken. It is, after all, the only issue in the case.</p> <p id=\"b281-4\" pgmap=\"281(11) 282(168)\">It is worth recalling that this case comes before us on appeal from a summary judgment in a declaratory judgment action. Because the factual characterization of the materials is at issue, it might be appropriate to take additional \u2014 that is, any \u2014 evidence, which would require reversal and remand. This highlights, in my mind, the impropriety of allowing AFI to bring this action in the first instance. Because the EPA has never even brought an enforcement action against AFI, the case is still in the investigatory stages. The EPA might not at this time have any evidence bearing on the question of whether the shredded plastic chips AFI sells to Illinois Power are \u201cproducts,\u201d but since the EPA has never even brought formal charges against AFI, it can hardly be faulted for this state of affairs. It is like allowing a suspect to challenge the basis for his prosecution, when he has merely been brought in for questioning and asked not to leave town, and not even an indictment has yet been issued against him.</p> <p id=\"b282-3\" pgmap=\"282\">I still believe that this case \u2014 a challenge to a \u201cviolation notice,\u201d a mere precursor to a formal charging document \u2014 ought never to have been considered by an Illinois court, for the reasons set out in my original dissent and in this court\u2019s unanimous opinion in National Marine. I also believe, however, that if the case is to be taken, we must address the issues raised, rather than assuming them away. Finally, at the very least, we ought to have the issues fully briefed when a petition for rehearing raises serious points and a new member of the court is forced to participate in the case for the first time at the rehearing stage. Accordingly, I would vote to grant rehearing, and I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion to deny rehearing as modified.</p> <p id=\"b282-4\" pgmap=\"282\">JUSTICE KILBRIDE joins in this dissent on denial of rehearing.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
