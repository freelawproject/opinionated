ANTHONY J. BOTTI, JUDGE OF THE FIRST CRIMINAL COURT OF THE CITY OF JERSEY CITY, WILLIAM J. TIMNEY, CLERK OF THE SAID COURT, AND THE CITY OF JERSEY CITY, DEFENDANTS.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b76-5\">Submitted May 7, 1940</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A6d\">Decided June 17, 1940.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b76-10\">Before Justices Case, Donges and Heher.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-11\">For the prosecutor, <em>Henry Pass (William Boor stein, </em>of counsel).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-12\">For the defendants, <em>James A. Hamill (Samuel Pesin, </em>of counsel).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b76-13\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"Ah5\">Heher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALG\">Upon a complaint charging that on May 25th, 1939, \u201cat Jersey City,\u201d he \u201cdid erect on premises owned by\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>him \u201cat 68 Van Reipen Avenue a sign indicating a business, contrary to and in violation of section 3, paragraph 1, subsections 1 and <em>2\u201d </em>of the local zoning ordinance, prosecutor was convicted of a violation of \u201cthe provisions\u201d of the ordinance \u201cin this, that\u201d he, on the day named, \u201cdid erect on premises owned by him at No. 68 Van Reipen Avenue, a sign indicating a business, and did conduct a business and commercial enterprise at the said premises at No. 68 Van Reipen Avenue, a second residential zone and district as set forth by\u201d the zoning ordinance, \u201ccontrary to and in violation of the provisions of section 3, paragraph 1, subsections 1 and 2\u201d thereof; and the judgment is assailed (a) as based upon a complaint that does not charge a violation of the zoning ordinance, and (b) as adjudging prosecutor guilty of an offense not charged in the complaint. Since these points are dispositive, there is no occasion to consider other questions raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Section III of the ordinance regulates the use of the \u201cSecond Residential Zone or District\u201d therein delimited. Paragraph 1 thereof provides that, in such zone, \u201cno lot of land shall hereafter be used and no building or structure shall hereafter be erected, altered or used for any of the following purposes,\u201d among others not here pertinent: \u201c1. Business of any kind. 2. Commercial enterprises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">But the complaint does not allege that the <em>locus </em>was situate within such \u201cSecond Residential Zone or District,\u201d and that in itself would seem to be a fatal deficiency. <em>Apler </em>v. <em>City of Newark, </em>6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>554. Moreover, neither that section, nor any other provision of the ordinance to which our attention has been directed, reprobates as a penal offense the erection on premises within such zone of \u201ca sign indicating a business.\u201d Nor could the accused be lawfully convicted of conducting \u201ca business and commercial enterprise\u201d upon his premises, since this offense was not charged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Seeming to concede these propositions, defendants maintain (a) that the parties \u201cstipulated that the complaint be amended to charge that the defendant conducts a business and commercial enterprise at the premises in question, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>said premises are in a residential zone,\u201d and (b) that there was no motion \u201cto dismiss the complaint for any defect therein or for any failure to charge an offense against the defendant,\u201d and the question cannot be raised in this court for the first time \u2014 citing <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Recorder\u2019s Court of West Orange, </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>385.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">There was no such stipulation. The amendment of the complaint related merely to the date of the alleged violation and the particular subsections of section III alleged to have been violated by the specified act. As pointed out in <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Recorder\u2019s Court of West Orange, </em>supra, an error of law exhibited on the face of the record may be availed of, even though not raised in the inferior tribunal nor made the subject of a ruling therein. See <em>Loper </em>v. <em>Somers, </em>71 <em>N. J. L. </em>657; <em>Defiance Fruit Co. </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>76 <em>Id. </em>482, 488; <em>Goekel </em>v. <em>Erie Railroad Co., </em>100 <em>Id. </em>279. Here, the accused was convicted of an offense not charged in the complaint; and this is plainly a common error which may be assigned on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The judgment is accordingly reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
