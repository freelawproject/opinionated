The plaintiff sued upon a promissory note and upon the condition contained in a chattel mortgage securing the same. The note was admittedly barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">Had there been a covenant in the mortgage to pay the note, the circumstance that the suit on the note was barred by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>statute of limitations would be no defense to an action on the covenant. <em>Lembech &amp; Betz Eagle Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Krause, </em>94 <em>N. J. L. </em>219. But there was no covenant in the chattel mortgage in suit. There was but a condition avoiding the conveyance upon the payment of the debt. This is not a covenant under seal to pay the debt. Hence, there could have been no other ruling than that of the learned trial judge. <em>Gottfried Krueger Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Remek, </em>110 <em>Id. </em>489.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
