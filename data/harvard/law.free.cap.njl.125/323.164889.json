The defendants had employed a plumber to install on their premises a hot water heater attached to an oil burner. The hot water attachment, during the time the plumber was still checking the operation thereof, exploded because of lack of water damaging plaintiff\u2019s premises for which the District Court awarded damages. This was error. There was no proof that the explosion was due to defendants\u2019 negligence. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Welwood, </em>38 <em>N. J.
