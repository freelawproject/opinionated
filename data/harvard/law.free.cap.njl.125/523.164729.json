It did order that prosecutor\u2019s salary should be not less than $1,000. If prosecutor is restored to his position, the employer is not directed to fix the salary at less than he theretofore received. If the Board of Freeholders fixes the former salary, prosecutor is not harmed. If it fixes a lower sum, it will be the board\u2019s action that produces the injury prosecutor fears. Until the salary is changed, prosecutor suffers no harm. At present, the question is academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The application is denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
