He was compensated for temporary disability which is not here in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">An examination of the testimonjr clearly satisfies us that the burden of proof of any permanent injuries resulting from the fall has not been established by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The judgment of the Pleas in reversing the bureau is in accordance with the facts and is affirmed. The writ will be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
