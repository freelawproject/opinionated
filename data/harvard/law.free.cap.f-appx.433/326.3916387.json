Bazemore\u2019s motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Bazemore argues that his claims in the instant case are not duplicative of those in prior case no. 3:10-CV-720. However, Bazemore has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his case as malicious because both the instant case and Bazemore\u2019s prior case involve \u201cthe same series of events\u201d and contain allegations of \u201cmany of the same facts.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Johnson, </em>846 F.2d 1019, 1021 (5th Cir.1988); <em>see Pittman v. Moore, </em>980 F.2d 994, 994-95 (5th Cir.1993). Although the specific claims in each case differ, Bazemore contends in both cases that the Government failed to follow the requirements of \u00a7 983 when it seized certain property. Furthermore, both cases challenge the execution of seizure warrants supported by the same affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Bazemore\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Bazemore\u2019s request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. After Bazemore filed this IFP motion, we barred him from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Bazemore v. Abbott, </em>423 Fed.App. 398, 2011 WL 1519119 (5th Cir.2011) (unpublished). Bazemore remains subject to the \u00a7 1915(g) bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
