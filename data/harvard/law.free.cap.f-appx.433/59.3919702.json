For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">In 2003, state police troopers pulled over the car in which Robinson was a passenger. The driver consented to a search of the vehicle, and the officers uncovered drugs, weapons, and other incriminating evidence. A further investigation led to the discovery of additional drugs and paraphernalia in two hotel rooms Robinson was occupying. Robinson was thereafter indicted for distribution of a controlled substance and conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Robinson moved to suppress the evidence found as a result of the vehicle search, but the trial court denied the motion for lack of standing. He ultimately pleaded guilty and received a sentence of 292 months\u2019 imprisonment. This Court affirmed his sentence. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>186 Fed.Appx. 240 (3d Cir. 2006). In 2007, Robinson filed an unsuccessful motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, in which he challenged the voluntariness of his guilty plea, the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and the effectiveness of his counsel. We denied his request for a certificate of appealability. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>C.A. No. 09-2452 (order entered Feb. 2, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">In March 2010, Robinson filed in the District Court a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, claiming that the state police troopers violated his equal protection rights because the vehicle search was allegedly based on his race. The District Court dismissed the petition and we summarily affirmed. <em>See Robinson v. Sniezek, </em>401 Fed.Appx. 645 (3d Cir.2010). Robinson then filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). The District Court denied the motion, and Robinson timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we may summarily affirm if Robinson does not raise a substantial question on appeal. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6. In his Rule 60(b) motion, Robinson argued that the Government took inconsistent positions concerning his standing to challenge the vehicle search. In Robinson\u2019s view, the Government ultimately admitted that he had standing to challenge the search, and its failure to admit that fact earlier rendered his post-conviction proceedings unfair. The District Court denied the motion, reasoning that Robinson\u2019s argument lacked merit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that, even if the Government had taken inconsistent positions, the Government\u2019s arguments concerning his standing to challenge the search did not bear on the disposition of Robinson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion or his \u00a7 2241 petition. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-8\">. The District Court correctly noted that the Government did not take inconsistent positions with regard to Robinson\u2019s standing to challenge the search. Rather, the Government consistently argued that Robinson lacked standing to challenge the vehicle search because the driver consented to the search, but noted that Robinson <em>did </em>have standing to challenge the validity of the traffic stop. <em>See </em>D. Ct. Doc. No. 7, 6-8.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
