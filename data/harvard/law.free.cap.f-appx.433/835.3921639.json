No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">In December 2009, Traylor filed a <em>pro se </em>civil complaint alleging that many Wells Fargo employees and Georgia officials deprived him of his rights under many federal statutes and constitutional provisions. The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motions for a more definite statement and ordered Traylor to replead his complaint within 14 days. Traylor filed a new <em>pro se </em>civil complaint, which included a civil cover sheet, an application to proceed <em>informa pauperis, </em>and a complaint. The district court gave this complaint a new case number.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">But the magistrate, construing the new complaint as an attempt to comply with the district court\u2019s order to replead, concluded that Traylor had not intended to file a new case. The magistrate ordered the clerk to close administratively the new case and transfer the pleadings to the 2009 case. Traylor appealed the magistrate\u2019s order; and the district court affirmed, concluding that Traylor had not met his burden of showing that the magistrate\u2019s order was clearly erroneous or contrary to law. On appeal, Traylor argues that the order was contrary to law and that he did intend to file a new case.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-15\">We review a district court\u2019s treatment of a magistrate\u2019s order for an abuse of discretion. <em>Williams v. McNeil, </em>557 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2009). When a party objects to a magistrate\u2019s non-dispositive order, the district court must consider those \u201cobjections and modify or set aside any part of the order that is clearly erroneous or is contrary to law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A). We review a district court\u2019s consolidation of cases for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Young v. City of Augusta, Ga., </em>59 F.3d 1160, 1169 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">The district court abused no discretion in affirming the magistrate\u2019s order to consolidate Traylor\u2019s cases because consolidation was proper. Traylor\u2019s second complaint also alleged that Wells Fargo employees and Georgia officials deprived him of rights under federal statutes and constitutional provisions. Both complaints referred to housing discrimination. Thus, these cases \u201csimultaneously pending in the same court\u201d involved many of the same parties and issues; and consolidation was proper. <em>See Hargett v. Valley Fed. Sav. Bank, </em>60 F.3d 754, 765-66 (explaining that consolidation is the \u201cproper solution to problems created by the existence of two or more cases involving the same parties and issues, simultaneously pending in the same coui\u2019t\u201d); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>Fed.R.Civ.P. 42(a)(2) (a court may consolidate cases on its docket if the cases \u201cinvolve a common question of law or fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Traylor\u2019s contention that he intended to file a new complaint is unavailing. In the second complaint, Traylor stated several times that the complaint was \u201cin direct response to\u201d the order to replead his complaint in his 2009 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
