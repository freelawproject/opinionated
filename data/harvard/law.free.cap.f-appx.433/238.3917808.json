Wilson seeks to appeal the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2) and 1915A(b)(l) and (2). He alleged that Officer Randall Buster used excessive force when he pulled Wilson\u2019s arm, which was in a sling from a shoulder injury, through his cell bars. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>alleged that the Lubbock County Jail failed to protect him from Buster\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">We construe Wilson\u2019s motion to proceed IFP and his appellate brief as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.Sd 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3). We ask only whether the appeal involves meritorious legal issues. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Where the merits are intertwined with the IFP decision, we may reach the merits when deciding the IFP motion. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Because the magistrate judge dismissed the complaint both as frivolous and for failure to state a claim, our review is <em>de novo. See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Wilson\u2019s initial claim that the magistrate judge erred in dismissing his complaint before allowing Wilson to amend is without merit, because the judge held a hearing pursuant to <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179, 181-82 (5th Cir.1985), in which Wilson fully elaborated on his claims. <em>Cf. Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 10 (5th Cir.1994) (vacating and remanding because the district court did not provide plaintiff with opportunity to offer more detailed set of factual claims). Regarding Wilson\u2019s claim against Buster, the primary focus of an excessive-use-of-force claim is the reason behind the use of force, namely, \u201cwhether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6-7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). Both the force used and the injury must be more than <em>de minimis </em>and must be evaluated in the context in which the force was deployed. <em>Id. </em>at 910; <em>Lockett v. New Orleans City, </em>607 F.3d 992, 999 (5th Cir. 2010). As the district court concluded, in light of Wilson\u2019s allegations and the medical evidence, any force used by Buster and any injury received by Wilson do not give rise to a claim of a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Additionally, Wilson also cannot show that jail officials are liable for failing to protect him. Nothing in the record establishes that officials could have prevented the incident or even knew of Buster\u2019s alleged intentions. Accordingly, Wilson cannot establish that jail officials knew of a \u201csubstantial risk of serious harm\u201d to Wilson or that they disregarded the risk by \u201cfailing to tak\u00e9 reasonable measures to abate it.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Wilson likewise cannot succeed on any claim of vicarious liability or <em>respondent superior, </em>because under \u00a7 1983, there is no liability under these theories. <em>Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 303 (5th Cir.1987). Finally, because Wilson has not established \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d his motion for appointment of counsel is denied. <em>See Santana v. Chandler, </em>961 F.2d 514, 515 (5th Cir.1992); <em>see also Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 213 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Wilson\u2019s appeal does not involve legal points that are arguable on the merits, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), and his IFP motion is DENIED, <em>see Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197 (5th Cir.1997). Because the resolution of Wilson\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s certification order requires resolution of the merits of his appeal, the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See id.; </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Our dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Wilson\u2019s complaint as frivolous count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Wilson that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
