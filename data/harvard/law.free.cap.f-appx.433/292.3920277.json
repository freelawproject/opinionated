In calculating his guidelines sentencing range, the district court assigned Torres a firearm enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). Torres was sentenced to 78 months of imprisonment. Forgoing an appeal, Torres instead moved for a reduction of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), asserting that a reduction was proper pursuant to Amendment 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4. The district court denied the motion for lack of jurisdiction, determining that no provision of \u00a7 3582(c) applied to Torres\u2019s case. Additionally, the district court denied Torres permission to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, determining that Torres\u2019s appeal was not in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-21\">Torres now appeals the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and moves to proceed IFP on appeal to question the denial of IFP status and the certification that his appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3). In gist, Torres asserts that his appeal presents the issue whether his sentence should be reduced to negate the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>which he claims to have been unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">To proceed IFP on appeal, a movant must first show that he is a pauper and that he appeals in good faith, i.e., that the appeal presents a nonfrivolous issue. <em>Carson v. Policy, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir. 1982). An appeal is frivolous if it \u201clacks an arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001). Torres has not shown that his appeal presents a nonfrivolous issue. Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Carson, </em>689 F.2d at 586; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
