Braxton complained that the Georgia Department of Community Affairs and its employees, La-Ruth Holloway, Karen Loveless, Jeffrey Abney, and Geoffrey Parker, violated the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(d), the Georgia Fair Housing Act, Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 8-3-202(a), and Braxton\u2019s rights to due process and equal protection by discriminating against her based on her race. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-24\">We review the dismissal of a complaint as frivolous for abuse of discretion. <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir. 2008). We construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally, but we will affirm the dismissal of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>complaint as frivolous if it \u201c \u2018lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 1831-32, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Braxton\u2019s frivolous and internally inconsistent complaint. Braxton failed to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\u201d that is, from which the district court could \u201cdraw the reasonable inference that the defendants] [were] liable\u201d for violating Braxton\u2019s civil rights. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662,129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Braxton complained that she was denied due process by Holloway, Loveless, and Parker when they \u201cstripped away\u201d her housing voucher and later denied her an \u201cinformal hearing\u201d to reinstate her voucher, but Braxton admitted that Holloway later reinstated the voucher. Braxton also complained that she was discriminated against in violation of the Georgia Fair Housing Act when Holloway failed to inspect adequately some rental property, but Braxton admitted that \u201call item[s] were fixed.\u201d Braxton accused another employee of the Department, Jacqueline Nunis, of racial steering by \u201cwarning] [Braxton] not to\u201d move into six counties inspected by Abney that were predominantly white counties and encouraging Braxton to move to Rome, Georgia, where more minorities resided, but Braxton admitted that Nunis said that housing was available in the six counties and that \u201cJeff Abney [would] take [Braxton\u2019s] voucher if [she] move[d] there.\u201d Braxton also accused Abney of racial steering by \u201cprobably assuming]\u201d that Braxton \u201cwas a black person\u201d based on her voice message and telling Braxton she would have a \u201chard time finding a rental\u201d in two particular counties, but Braxton failed to allege that Abney had made a different representation to or made housing available to a similarly-situated white voucher holder. Although Braxton alleged that rental properties were available \u201cwithin [her] section 8 voucher range\u201d and \u201chome owners and apt. managers in that area ... accept Section 8,\u201d Braxton failed to allege that any of the properties available participated in the section 8 voucher program. Braxton expressed indignation that \u201c[s]ection 8 [would] unlawfully tamper[ ] with government records\u201d and identify her and her children as black instead of as American Indians, but Braxton failed to state how the alleged tampering violated her civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Braxton also argues that she is entitled to relief for claims involving retaliation, disability discrimination, and \u201cstate created danger,\u201d but she did not present those claims to the district court. We will not consider Braxton\u2019s claims for the first time on appeal. <em>See Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ala. v. Weitz, </em>913 F.2d 1544, 1549-51 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Braxton\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
