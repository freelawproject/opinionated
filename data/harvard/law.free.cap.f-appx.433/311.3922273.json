Buendia-Gallegos challenges his sentence, which was the result of an upward departure. According to Buendia-Gallegos, the district court committed procedural error by not specifically explaining its choice of the criminal history category and the offense level, as required by \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4)(A). He also complains that the district court erred by failing to comply with \u00a7 4A1.3(c), which requires the sentencing judge to given written reasons to explain why the defendant\u2019s criminal history category is inadequate. Because he did not object on these bases, we review these claims for plain error only. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Price, </em>516 F.3d 285, 286-87 (5th Cir.2008). Buendia-Gallegos has failed to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">The first claim fails because the district court is not required to engage in a mechanical recitation of rejected criminal history categories and offense levels before arriving at those it believes to be appropriate. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 348 n. 2 (5th Cir.2006). The second claim fails because, contrary to Buendia-Gallegos\u2019s assertions, the court gave ample reasons to justify its conclusion that his criminal history category did not adequately represent his past misdeeds. <em>See United States v. Ashburn, </em>38 F.3d 803, 809 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). BuendiaGallegos has shown no plain error in connection with his contentions that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">Buendia-Gallegos\u2019s challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence likewise lacks merit. The district court\u2019s choice to depart was based on proper factors. Although the departure was not insubstantial, this fact alone is not dispositive. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 709 n. 5 (5th Cir.2006). BuendiaGallegos\u2019s disagreement with the appropriateness of his sentence does not suffice to show that the district court abused its discretion. <em>See United States v. Rajwani, </em>476 F.3d 243, 250 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
