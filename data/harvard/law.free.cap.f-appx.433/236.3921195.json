The district court dismissed the complaint both as frivolous and for failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). Accordingly, our review is <em>de novo. See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-27\">The invasion of privacy that Menard alleged was no greater than this court has previously held to be constitutional. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Letcher v. Turner, </em>968 F.2d 508, 510 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Elliott v. Lynn, </em>38 F.3d 188, 190-92 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 747 (5th Cir.2002). Menard\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, and we dismiss it as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The dismissal of the complaint by the district court as frivolous and for failure to state a claim and the dismissal of the appeal as frivolous count as strikes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Menard garnered a strike in <em>Menard v. Wagner, </em>No. 3:09-CV-8 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 2, 2011). Accordingly, he has three strikes and is now barred under \u00a7 1915(g) from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Menard has also filed a motion for appointment of counsel. Because this matter is not particularly complex, and Menard has shown an ability to prepare a cogent brief and cite relevant facts and law, the motion is DENIED. <em>See Schwander v. Blackburn, </em>750 F.2d 494, 502 (5th Cir. 1985).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-28\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
