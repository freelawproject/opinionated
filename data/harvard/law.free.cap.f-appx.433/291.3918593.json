Aubert\u2019s supervised release was revoked after he failed to complete a drug treatment program. The district court upwardly varied from the advisory range guideline range of four to ten months and imposed a statutory maximum sentence of 36 months of imprisonment. Aubert contends that his expulsion from the drug treatment program was due in part to the probation officer\u2019s refusal to approve a request for additional treatment sessions. He argues that a statutory maximum sentence was unreasonable given that he was only partially to blame for his failure to succeed in the program. Aubert also contends that his sentence is unconstitutional, and hence substantively unreasonable, because he was punished on account of his addiction to drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-23\">In imposing sentence, the district court took note of Aubert\u2019s criminal offenses during his term of supervision, the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>and frequency of supervised release violations, and Aubert\u2019s continued need for drug treatment and education or vocational training. The district court indicated that in light of Aubert\u2019s failure to complete a drug rehabilitation program during his supervised release he would benefit from a longer and more intensive drug treatment program in a prison setting. Aubert has not shown that the district court\u2019s sentence was plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v.
