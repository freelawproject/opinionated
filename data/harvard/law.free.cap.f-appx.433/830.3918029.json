Chandler challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the revocation and the reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-20\">Ample evidence supported the decision of the district court to revoke Chandler\u2019s supervised release. Officers of the Sheriffs Office of Calhoun County searched Chandler\u2019s property after aerial surveillance observed trails for an all-terrain vehicle between Chandler\u2019s house and plots of marijuana. The officers discovered 58 marijuana plants in the fields surrounding Chandler\u2019s house, including two plots of marijuana that were 60 and 150 yards from the house. Investigator Franklin Allen spoke to Chandler\u2019s wife, who said she had suspected Chandler of growing marijuana because he and his brother often were gone for long periods of time after riding into the woods on their all-terrain vehicles. Allen later stopped Chandler and his brother, who was towing behind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>his Expedition vehicle a trailer containing two all-terrain vehicles, and officers discovered in the vehicles several cans of Miracle Gro and water bottles, a saw, multiple spools of trot-line cord, and two face masks. The brothers had reason to conceal their identity: in 2004, officers arrested Chandler and his brother after they were seen on video surveillance riding their all-terrain vehicles to marijuana plots grown in a national park. Although Chandler testified at his revocation hearing that the supplies were used for growing tomato plants and going fishing, the district court was entitled to discredit Chandler\u2019s testimony. <em>See United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994). The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Chandler\u2019s sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. Chandler cultivated 44.3 pounds of marijuana while on supervised release for his conviction for conspiring to manufacture more than 100 marijuana plants, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(b)(1)(B), and he had, in 1990, been convicted of possessing with intent to distribute ten pounds of marijuana, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 841(a)(1). The district court explained that Chandler\u2019s guideline range of 24 to 30 months of imprisonment \u201cunderrepresented] the seriousness of [Chandler\u2019s] history\u201d and an upward variance to the maximum statutory penalty was \u201cneeded\u201d to address \u201chis demonstrated lack of total respect for the law and for [members of] the public\u201d who were \u201cpreyfed] on\u201d because of their \u201cweakness with addictions and interest in drugs\u201d and the apparent inadequacy of \u201cthe twenty-seven month[ ] [sentence] previously imposed\u201d for conspiracy. The district court \u201cconsider[ed][the] Section 3553(a) factors and ... the circumstances of [Chandler\u2019s] offense\u201d and reasonably determined that a \u201clong sentence\u201d of 60 months of imprisonment was necessary to punish Chandler, \u201cto promote respect and to deter [him] from\u201d similar future \u201c[mis]eonduct, and to protect the public.\u201d Those reasons also supported the order that Chandler serve his sentence consecutive to any state sentence imposed for his crimes. <em>See United States v. Andrews, </em>330 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.2003). The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The revocation of Chandler\u2019s supervised release and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
