Lancaster contends he is actually innocent of being a career offender and asserts he is entitled to relief under \u00a7 2241 based on <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>609 F.3d 1159 (11th Cir.2010), <em>opinion vacated on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (2011) <em>(en banc). </em>Primarily, he contends his conviction for \u201cassault or battery in a county or municipal jail or detention facility\u201d is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for the purposes of career offender sentencing under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, based on the Supreme Court decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). Lancaster also contends his other two convictions classified at sentencing as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d are related within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 is a question of law we review <em>de novo. Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003). The petitioner has the burden of establishing his right to federal habeas relief. <em>Coloma v. Holder, </em>445 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2006). Generally, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. In a typical case, a prisoner who previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate must apply for and receive permission from the court of appeals before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b), 2255(h). Only under very limited circumstances may a federal prisoner file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241 based on the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255(e) which requires a showing that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the petitioner\u2019s] detention.\u201d <em>Savyyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">We recently vacated our panel opinion in <em>Gilbert, </em>and held \u201cthe savings clause does not authorize a federal prisoner to bring in a \u00a7 2241 petition a claim, which would otherwise be barred by \u00a7 2255(h), that the sentencing guidelines were misapplied in a way that resulted in a longer sentence not exceeding the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc). </em>Specifically, we rejected a claim by a federal prisoner that he was incorrectly sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision holding one of his predicate offenses did not satisfy the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 4B1.2(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1314-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">Lancaster cannot follow the path to relief now foreclosed by our <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Gilbert. </em>The longest statutory maximum for Lancaster\u2019s offenses is life imprisonment, so his 292-month total sentence falls within the statutory range of imprisonment for his offense. <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Thus, his claim falls squarely within the category of claims foreclosed by <em>Gilbert. </em>Additionally, Lancaster\u2019s other argument that his predicate offenses are \u201crelated\u201d within the meaning of the Guidelines is not cognizable on collateral review. He previously raised the same argument on direct appeal so it too cannot meet the rigorous standard of the savings clause. <em>See United States v. Nyhuis, </em>211 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>dismissal of Lancaster\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-17\">. Lancaster also asserts that his prior conviction for robbery does not constitute a \"crime of violence.\u201d Because Lancaster raises this issue for the first time on appeal, we will not address this claim. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b807-6\">BARKETT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Az80\">specially concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Although I agree that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc), controls this case, I adhere to the reasons expressed in my dissent in <em>Gilbert </em>for disagreeing with the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gilbert.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
