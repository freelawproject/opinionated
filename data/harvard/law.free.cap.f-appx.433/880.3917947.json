After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-27\">When Carmona arrived at Miami Airport on a flight from Colombia, U.S. Customs inspectors found heroin hidden in the lining of Carmona\u2019s carry-on backpack. Carmona has never disputed that the actu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>al amount of heroin he transported was 727.4 grams. In fact, at his plea hearing, Carmona admitted he transported that amount. Furthermore, Carmona did not object to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), which stated that the heroin in Carmona\u2019s backpack weighed 727.4 grams and recommended a base offense level of 30, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(5), based on that drug quantity. Finally, at sentencing, Carmona did not object when the district court used that undisputed drug quantity to calculate Carmona\u2019s advisory guidelines range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment and then imposed a 46-month sentence, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Carmona did ask for a downward variance from the advisory guidelines range because he thought he was carrying 600 grams, rather than 700 grams, of heroin. The district court denied the request.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">For the first time on appeal, Carmona argues that the district court\u2019s use of the 727.4 grams of heroin to calculate his advisory guidelines range violated the Sixth Amendment. Citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Carmona contends that the district court could not hold him accountable for that drug quantity because Carmona did not admit, and the government did not prove, that Carmona knew that amount of heroin was in his backpack.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Because Carmona raises his <em>Booker </em>objection for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Munoz, </em>430 F.3d 1357, 1374-75 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, we find no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">For sentencing purposes, the district court may rely on evidence heard during trial, the defendant\u2019s admissions during his guilty plea, undisputed statements in the PSI or evidence presented at the sentencing hearing. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>884 F.2d 1355, 1356 (11th Cir.1989). The failure to object to factual findings in the PSI, including drug quantity findings, is deemed an admission of those facts. <em>United States v. Williams </em>438 F.3d 1272, 1274 (11th Cir.2006). Moreover, after <em>Booker, </em>under an advisory guidelines system, the district courts remain free to impose sentencing enhancements based on judge-made findings by a preponderance of the evidence so long as the sentence imposed does not exceed the statutory maximum sentence. <em>See United States v. Dean, </em>487 F.3d 840, 854 (11th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1227-28 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">Carmona does not contend that his 46-month sentence exceeds the 40-year statutory maximum sentence authorized by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(a)(1), (b)(2)(A). Thus, the district court did not violate the Sixth Amendment when it calculated Carmona\u2019s advisory guidelines range based on the undisputed statements in the PSI and Carmona\u2019s admissions during his plea colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-15\">The fact that Carmona claims he did not know he was carrying 727.4 grams of heroin in his backpack does not change the result. It is well-settled in this Circuit, both before and after <em>Booker, </em>that the fact that a drug courier did not know the exact amount or type of drugs he was transporting does not prevent a district court from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>attributing the drugs to him for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Alvarez-Coria, </em>447 F.3d 1340, 1344 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Gomez, </em>905 F.2d 1513, 1514-15 (11th Cir.1990); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. n. 2(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-10\">. Carmona does not challenge that ruling on appeal or argue that his 46-month sentence was procedurally or substantively unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b903-16\">. To establish plain error, the appellant must show (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects his substantial rights, and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Munoz, </em>430 F.3d at 1375.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
