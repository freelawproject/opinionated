The district court sentenced Cruz-Martinez to 6 months as to Count 1, and 24 months as to Count 3, to be served consecutively. On appeal, Cruz-Martinez argues that his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable because (1) the district court did not specifically mention 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), its purposes, or how it applied the statute; and (2) his sentence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>greater than necessary to implement the goals of \u00a7 3553(a), specifically those relating to the seriousness of the offense, because both offenses arose from the same conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">We review a final sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court must impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). The district court does not have to discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor so long as the record indicates that it considered the factors in some form. <em>See United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">A sentence is substantively reasonable if it achieves the purposes of sentencing as enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). This Court may reverse if it is left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). Indicia of substantive reasonableness include being within the applicable guidelines range, <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788, and the sentence\u2019s relation to the applicable statutory maximum, <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (considering that defendant\u2019s sentence was well below the statutory maximum in finding the sentence substantively reasonable). The appellant carries the burden of demonstrating a sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Cruz-Martinez\u2019s sentence is reasonable. Although it did not specifically cite them, the record shows that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Dorman, </em>488 F.3d at 944-45 (finding sentence reasonable although district court did not articulate that it had considered \u00a7 3553(a) because it considered defendant\u2019s objections and motion for downward departure that implicated the factors). The Court ensured that it was applying the correct guidelines range, and the parties presented arguments as to the appropriate sentence that implicated \u00a7 3553(a). Further, the sentence was within the applicable guidelines range, and such sentences are ordinarily expected to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Cruz-Martinez received a statutorily mandated sentence of 2 years as to Count 3, and his 6-month sentence as to Count 1 was well below the 10-year maximum sentence permitted. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542; <em>see also Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. While Cruz-Martinez argues that both of his sentences arise from the same conduct, this does not mean that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>sentence is unreasonable. The penalty statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A, required the district court to impose consecutive sentences, and Cruz-Martinez has not conclusively shown that commission of both offenses results in the same harm. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
