Torres argues that the district court clearly intended for his sentence to be an upward departure under the Sentencing Guidelines and that under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h), he was entitled to notice of the court\u2019s intent to depart prior to the imposition of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-25\">Rule 32(h) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[bjefore the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party\u2019s prehearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure.\u201d Fed. R.CrimP. 32(h). Thus, under Rule 32(h), a district court cannot impose a departure unless it first notifies the parties that it is contemplating doing so. <em>United States v. Jacobs, </em>635 F.3d 778, 782 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>A \u201cdeparture\u201d is a \u201cterm of art under the Guidelines and refers only to non-Guidelines sentences imposed under the framework set out in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe district court\u2019s authority to impose a departure emanates from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) and, in turn, Chapter 5, Part K of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In contrast, a \u201cvariance\u201d is a sentence imposed outside of the Guidelines framework. <em>Id. </em>The court\u2019s authority to impose a variance is discretionary and stems from \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>\u201cRule 32(h)\u2019s notice requirement does not apply to variances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 721-22 (5th Cir.2007) (analyzing the notice requirement under the <em>\u201cpost-Booker </em>advisory Guidelines regime\u201d and holding that Rule 32(h) applies to departures only and not to variances).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Neither party argues that the district court\u2019s orally pronounced sentence conflicts with the court\u2019s written statement of reasons. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>604 F.3d 186, 191 (5th Cm.) (noting that \u201c[wjhere the orally-imposed sentence conflicts with the written judgment, the oral pronouncement controls\u201d), <em>cert. denied., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 291, 178 L.Ed.2d 191 (2010). However, the Government appears to acknowledge that there existed some ambiguity in the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement as a result of the court\u2019s use of the term departure. In cases where there is an ambiguity between the oral and written sentences, this court reviews the entire record to determine the court\u2019s intent. <em>Garcia, </em>604 F.3d at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Read as a whole, the record clearly shows that the district court\u2019s intent was to impose a variance. Although the court made a single, brief reference to a \u201cdeparture upward from the recommended guideline range\u201d at the sentencing hearing, the court did not cite \u00a7 3553(b) or Chapter 5 of the Guidelines, and instead made reference to a \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factor. In the statement of reasons, the court made a definite statement that it was imposing \u201ca sentence outside the advisory sentencing guideline system\u201d and again cited the same \u00a7 3553(a) factor as its justification for a sentence outside the recommended guideline range. Because the sentence imposed was a variance, rather than a departure, Rule 32(h)\u2019s notice requirement does not apply. <em>See Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
