Moody argues that: (1) his sentences were procedurally unreasonable, because the court relied on his prior unscored criminal convictions to impose variances, without giving him prior notice of its intent to do so, which violated his process rights; and (2) his sentences were substantively unreasonable, because the court improperly relied on his vacated murder conviction, for which he was sentenced to death, to impose a harsh sentence, and erred by failing to appropriately consider his age \u2014 48 at the time of sentencing \u2014 or the time he wrongly spent in prison for his later-vacated conviction. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">When a party fails to adequately object to an alleged sentencing error below, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir. 2006). However, where a party properly preserves an objection, we review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When determining the effect of the \u00a7 3553(a)(1) factors \u2014 specifically the history and characteristics of the defendant \u2014 a court may consider a wide latitude of evidence. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1231-35 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009). The district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). It is generally sufficient that the record, viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>as a whole, reflects that the sentencing judge considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has taken the \u00a7 3553(a) factors properly into account. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1194-95 (11th Cir. 2010) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Due process does not require that a court provide parties with notice of its intent to vary from the guideline range. <em>Irizarry v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 708, 714-16, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008). Parties may not claim unfair surprise or an inability to present mitigating evidence when a defendant\u2019s imposed sentence lies outside the Guidelines because, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), parties are inherently on notice that the sentencing guidelines range is advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 712-13, 128 S.Ct. 2198.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c\u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation and brackets omitted). The district court is \u201cpermitted to attach great weight to one factor over others.\u201d <em>Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1237 (quotation omitted). We will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 674, 178 L.Ed.2d 502 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">The reasonableness of a sentence may be indicated when the sentence imposed was well below the statutory maximum sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009). Sentences outside the guidelines are not presumed to be unreasonable. <em>Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1237 (holding that a district court\u2019s decision to vary upward, from the 30-37 month guideline range to the 120-month statutory maximum, was reasonable). A court may consider all pertinent prior conduct within a defendant\u2019s criminal history, which is proven by a preponderance of the evidence, in determining a substantively reasonable sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661; <em>see also United States v. Culver, </em>598 F.3d 740, 752-53 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 336, 178 L.Ed.2d 147 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-18\">In this case, the district court did not violate Moody\u2019s due process rights, and his sentences were procedurally reasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>consider Moody\u2019s unscored criminal convictions when determining his sentences. See <em>Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1231-35. Furthermore, due process did not require that the court provide Moody with notice of its intent to impose an upward variance based on these convictions. <em>See IHzarry, </em>553 U.S. at 714-16, 128 S.Ct. 2198. Indeed, Moody was especially on notice that he might not receive a sentence within the initially calculated guideline range, because the PSI explicitly noted U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 as grounds for a possible departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Moody\u2019s sentences were also substantively reasonable. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors support the district court\u2019s action in that his sentences reflect the seriousness of the offenses, will deter further criminal conduct, protect the public from Moody, and will promote respect for the law. In addition, though the sentences imposed were outside the Guidelines, they were well below the statutory m\u00e1ximums. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a); <em>see also United States v. Pounds, </em>230 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that the statutory maximum for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) is life in prison). Furthermore, the district court acted within its discretion by not imposing a lesser sentence based on Moody\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Moreover, Moody mischaracterizes the proper effect of the time he served in prison on later-vacated convictions. He asserts he should be given credit for the \u201cnearly a decade\u201d he wrongly spent in prison. But the majority of this imprisonment was warranted, because it was required by the 60-month concurrent sentences that Moody received for his guilty pleas to three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Accordingly, Moody has failed to show that the district court committed plain error or abused its discretion, and his sentences were both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b809-9\">. As an initial matter, Moody did not adequately preserve his argument of procedural unreasonableness based on a lack of due process. <em>See Massey, </em>443 F.3d at 819 (\"[T]o preserve an objection to [his] sentence for appeal, [a defendant] must 'raise that point in such clear and simple language that the trial court may not misunderstand it.\u2019 \u201d).
