Cunningham argues that Nature\u2019s Earth Pellets discriminated against her and regarded her as disabled based on her addiction to prescription drugs. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The Americans with Disabilities Act provides that no covered employer \u201cshall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual\u201d in any of the \u201cterms, conditions, [or] privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). To establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination under the Act, a plaintiff must prove that she has a \u201cphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more [of her] major life activities\u201d or is \u201cregarded as having such an impairment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(1)(A), (C). \u201c[A] person is \u2018regarded as\u2019 disabled within the meaning of the [Americans with Disabilities Act] if a covered entity mistakenly believes that the person\u2019s actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.\u201d <em>Murphy v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>527 U.S. 516, 521-22, 119 S.Ct. 2138, 2137, 144 L.Ed.2d 484 (1999). \u201c[T]o prevail on a perception theory of disability discrimination, [the employee] must be able to show that, as with a real impairment, the perceived impairment is \u2018substantially limiting\u2019 and significant.\u201d <em>Sutton v. Lader, </em>185 F.3d 1203, 1208 (11th Cir.1999). A major life activity is a basic action performed by an average person in the general population and includes actions like performing manual tasks, physical movements and communication, breathing, thinking, communicating, and working. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12102(2)(A); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Cunningham failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on either an actual or perceived disability. Cunningham argues that her addiction to anti-depressant medications prevented her from resolving other mental disorders, caused her to suffer about ten panic attacks a month, and interfered with her ability to breathe, concentrate, interact with others, and care for herself, but Cunningham failed to establish that any of these impairments were or were regarded as substantially limiting. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(1); <em>Sutton, </em>185 F.3d at 1208. Cunningham testified that she was able to breathe and get ready for work; she performed regularly the tasks of a shipping clerk, which required her to monitor the supply of company products and coordinate deliveries of those products; and she exercised sufficient independence of thought and concentration to withdraw from a rehabilitation facility against the advice of her physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Even if Cunningham had established a prima facie case of discrimination, she failed to prove that the legitimate reason proffered for her termination was pretextual. Nature\u2019s Earth Pellets introduced evidence that Cunningham had been terminated because of her extensive absenteeism and the number of final warnings that she had been given under the company\u2019s progressive discipline system. To establish pretext, Cunningham was required to prove that the \u201c \u2018the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision ... either by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation [was] unworthy of credence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson v. Ala. State Tenure Comm\u2019n, </em>405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1095, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)). Cunningham argues that Nature\u2019s Earth Pellets had not considered terminating her for past infractions of its leave policy, but that argument does not establish that the decision to fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Cunningham lacked credence. Based on Cunningham\u2019s history of absenteeism, Nature\u2019s Earth Pellets could legitimately refuse to grant Cunningham sick leave of an indefinite duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The summary judgment in favor of Nature\u2019s Earth Pellets is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
