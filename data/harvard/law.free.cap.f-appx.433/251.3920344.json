We have jurisdiction to entertain the BIA\u2019s determination that Hernandez\u2019s asylum application was untimely because the timeliness issue is based on the BIA\u2019s construction of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4)\u00ae. <em>See Nakimbugwe v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 281, 284 (5th Cir. 2007). We review questions of law de novo, <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594-95 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Here, the BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s ruling in an unpublished, single-judge decision. This Court has not resolved the issue of whether such a decision should be entitled to greater deference pursuant to <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), or the lesser amount of deference pursuant to <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). \u201cWe need not resolve this question, because [Hernandez\u2019s] claim fails under either standard. Thus, we review it under the less-deferential <em>Skidmore </em>standard.\u201d <em>Mushtaq v. Holder, </em>583 F.3d 875, 877 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">An application for asylum must be filed within one year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Notwithstanding an untimely filing, an asylum application may be considered \u201cif the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\u201d \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4)\u00ae. The term \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d may include \u201cchanges in applicable U.S. law.\u201d \u00a7 208.4(a)(4)(i)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Hernandez argues that <em>Valdiviezo-Galdamez v. Attorney General of the United States, </em>502 F.3d 285 (3d Cir.2007), changed applicable United States law in a way that materially affected his eligibility for asylum. The BIA held that a nonbinding change in law in the Third Circuit did not constitute a changed circumstance justifying Hernandez\u2019s delay in filing his asylum application. That holding is based on valid reasoning and not contrary to \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). We therefore afford the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration law its proper deference and will not disturb its determination that Hernandez\u2019s asylum application was untimely. <em>Skidmore, </em>323 U.S. at 140, 65 S.Ct. 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Hernandez further argues that he is entitled to withholding of removal because the evidence demonstrates that his life or freedom would likely be threatened if he were removed to El Salvador on account of his membership in the particular social group of young Salvadoran men who refuse to join gangs. We review the BIA\u2019s determination that Hernandez is not eligible for withholding of removal under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Kane v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 231, 239 (5th Cir.2009). Hernandez is entitled to withholding of removal if he shows that his \u201clife and freedom would be threatened in [El Salvador] because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The BIA\u2019s determination that Hernandez did not suffer past persecution is supported by evidence that neither he nor his family was ever physically harmed and, at most, merely suffered threats and harassment. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 188 (5th Cir.2004). Moreover, Hernandez cannot show that he was or would be persecuted on account of his membership in a particular social group; his status as a young Salvadoran male who does not belong to a gang is too generalized to identify him as a member of a particular social group. <em>See Matter of SE-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 579, 582-84 (BIA 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
