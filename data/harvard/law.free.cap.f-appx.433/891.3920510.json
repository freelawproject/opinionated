Smith, a federal prisoner, appeals through counsel the denial of a motion he filed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4), but that the district court construed as a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We granted Smith a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following two issues: \u201c(1) Whether the district court erred in denying Petitioner\u2019s Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) motion,\u201d and \u201c(2) Whether Petitioner has any other post-conviction remedy available to him which the district court should have considered with respect to the merits of his claim.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>I. Rule 60(b)(4) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Ordinarily, we review a district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001). However, we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 60(b)(4) motion to set aside a judgment as void. <em>Id. </em>We also review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2255 motion as second or successive. <em>Gooden v. United States, </em>627 F.3d 846, 847 n. 2 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits a court to relieve a party from a \u201cfinal judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d for various reasons, including when \u201cthe judgment is void.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4). A motion filed pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4) must be made \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cgovern the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts, except as stated in Rule 81.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. Accordingly, we have held that Rule 60(b) cannot be used to obtain relief in criminal proceedings. <em>See United States v. Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d 1365, 1366 (11th Cir.1998). In <em>Mosavi, </em>we held that the defendant could not challenge a criminal forfeiture order using a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion because Fed.R.Civ.P. 1 unambiguously provides that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern the procedure in all suits of a civil nature. <em>Id. </em>We stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-7\">The judgment and order that the defendant contests were entered, not in a civil case, but in a criminal case, and a proper appeal of the forfeitures should have been raised in the defendant\u2019s criminal appeal of his conviction and sentence. Rule 60(b) simply does not provide for relief from judgment in a criminal case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-9\"><em>Id.-, see also United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that Rule 60(b)(4) could not be used to attack any alleged deficiencies in the district court\u2019s order denying Fair\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because \u00a7 3582 is \u201ccriminal in nature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act provides that, to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a movant must first receive an order from the U.S. Court of Appeals authorizing the district court to consider it. <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). \u201cWithout authorization, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive petition.\u201d <em>Farris, </em>333 F.3d at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">In <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>the Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-12\">a Rule 60(b)(6) motion in a \u00a7 2254 case is not to be treated as a successive habeas petition if it does not assert, or reassert, claims of eiTor in the movant\u2019s state conviction. A motion that, like petitioner\u2019s, challenges only the District Court\u2019s failure to reach the merits does not warrant such treatment, and can therefore be ruled upon by the District Court without precertification by the Court of Appeals pursuant to \u00a7 2244(b)(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">545 U.S. 524, 538, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2651, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). Although the Supreme Court expressly noted that it was limiting its consideration to \u00a7 2254 cases, <em>id. </em>at 529 n. 3, 125 S.Ct. at 2646 n. 3, we recently held that \u201cthe standard announced in <em>Gonzalez </em>applies to federal prisoner cases as well,\u201d <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1323 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc). </em>In <em>Gilbert, </em>we rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that a motion he filed asserting an error of law in the calculation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>of his sentence should have been treated as one filed under Rule 60(b)(5) and (6), holding that \u201c[bjecause Gilbert\u2019s motion sought to assert or reassert a claim for relief, instead of pointing out a defect in the integrity of the earlier \u00a7 2255 motion proceeding in his case, under <em>Gonzalez </em>his motion is the equivalent of a second or successive motion and is barred by \u00a7 2255(h).\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1301-02, 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The district court did not err in denying Smith relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4) because that rule of civil procedure could not be used to attack Smith\u2019s criminal judgment, and the district court did not eiT in denying his motion, construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion, because it was an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">II. Other Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Rule 60(b) also enables a court to relieve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding if: \u201c(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or (6)[for] any other reason that justifies relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5) and (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">On appeal, Smith identifies only Rule 60(b)(5) and (6) as the other post-conviction remedies that the district court should have considered. However, as discussed above, Rule 60(b) is a rule of civil procedure that cannot be used to attack a judgment in a criminal case. Therefore, Smith has not shown that the district court erred in failing to consider whether his claim was cognizable under Rule 60(b)(5) or (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Based on our review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Smith\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-17\">. The government submits that we should vacate the COA as improvidently granted. \"Once the parties have briefed and argued the issue set out in a COA and we have reached the point of considering an appeal on the merits, the time for scrutinizing the COA has long since passed.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Crosby, </em>371 F.3d 782, 784 (11th Cir.2004). We decline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>entertain the government\u2019s challenge to the COA at this stage in the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-27\">.
