Evans. Evans brought the action in Appeal No. 10-10487 against Lisa Echeverri, DOR\u2019s Executive Director,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming that subordinates of Echeverri violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection rights in initiating and prosecuting such proceedings because Lynisha Campbell, the custodial parent of his child, had never received temporary cash assistance or foster care payments or requested DOR to proceed with the collection of child support on her behalf. Evans also sought relief under Florida law.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-16\">The district court referred the case to a magistrate judge. After Evans filed an amended complaint, the magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation (R&amp;R) recommending that Evans\u2019s claims for monetary relief against Echeverri in her official capacity be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(iii) and that Evans\u2019s claims for monetary relief against her in her individual capacity be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii); that Evans\u2019s claim for equitable relief be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6); and that Evans\u2019s state law claims be dismissed without prejudice. On January 8, 2010, the district court, on review, adopted the R&amp;R and dismissed Evans\u2019s federal claims under Rule 12(b)(6) or as frivolous under \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and (iii).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-17\">Evans appeals the judgment the district court entered pursuant to the court\u2019s January 8 order. We find no merit in Evans\u2019 claims for the reasons stated in the R&amp;R and the district court\u2019s January 8 order. That is, his claims are either patently frivolous or failed to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-18\">The action that is the subject of Appeal No. 10-10489 began in the Circuit Court for Okaloosa County, Florida, Circuit, <em>State of Florida Department of Revenue Child Support Enforcement on behalf of: Lynisha Twanta Campbell v. Michael A. Evans, </em>Case No.2009 DR 5489. Evans removed the case to the district court. The district court remanded the case to the circuit court for the reasons stated in the Report and Recommended (R&amp;R) issued by the court\u2019s magistrate judge. Evans appeals the judgment remanding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>case. We conclude that remand was required for the reasons stated in the R&amp;R.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">The judgments in Nos. 10-10487 and 10-10489 are</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-14\">. Evans sued Echeverri in both her official and individual capacities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-15\">. The R&amp;R recommended the dismissal of Evans's claim for equitable relief against Echeverri on <em>Younger </em>abstention grounds. The district court rejected that recommendation and dismissed the claim under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
