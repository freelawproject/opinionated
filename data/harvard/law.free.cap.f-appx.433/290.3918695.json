He argues that the district court erred in denying him a reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. He contends that he admitted purchasing four firearms for a codefendant; that he knew the codefendant was a convicted felon who could not own firearms; and that he did not deny additional relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-21\">The district court\u2019s denial of a reduction in Otero\u2019s offense level for acceptance of responsibility was not \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008). Because Otero did not present any evidence to rebut the information in the Presentence Report (PSR), the district court was entitled to rely on that information. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 396 (5th Cir.2010). The PSR supports a finding that Otero falsely denied knowing that his girlfriend, Lauren Reynolds, assisted Gabino Tovias in purchasing firearms and recruiting people to purchase firearms; therefore, the district court did not err in concluding that he acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.l(a)) (2009 version); <em>see also United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742, 753 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d 163, 175-77 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-22\">Otero further contends that the sentence imposed by the district court was substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>tively unreasonable, given that he was not a leader or an organizer; no one was harmed during the conspiracy; he had never been convicted of a violent offense or felony prior to the instant conviction; he was married and supported his family; and he was an honest, hardworking, and very dependable employee. The district court considered Otero\u2019s arguments and determined that a 37-month within-guidelines sentence was appropriate in view of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Otero\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s balancing of the sentencing factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attached to his 37-month within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 766-67 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
