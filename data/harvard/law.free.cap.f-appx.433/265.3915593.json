After Tyler\u2019s claims were dismissed at summary judgment, Defendants sought attorney\u2019s fees on the basis that Tyler\u2019s lawsuit was \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <em>See Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>(1978) (allowing a prevailing defendant to recover attorney\u2019s fees in a Title VII lawsuit if the suit is frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation). As proof of their fees, Defendants submitted an attorney\u2019s affidavit requesting the lump sum of $25,388.00 in fees and stating that the amount of time expended on all matters in defending Tyler\u2019s suit was \u201creasonable and necessary in every instance.\u201d The magistrate judge agreed that Tyler\u2019s claims were frivolous, but denied Defendants\u2019 request for attorneys\u2019 fees because there was no evidence submitted from which the magistrate judge could \u201cbegin to assess the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">On appeal, Defendants challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees on the basis that Tyler did not contest the amount of attorney\u2019s fees they requested. This is not a basis for reversal. It is black-letter law that \u201cthe fee applicant bears the burden of establishing entitlement to an award and documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). The documentation submitted by the fee applicant \u201cmust be sufficient for the court to verify that the applicant has met its burden.\u201d <em>La. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Kellstrom, </em>50 F.3d 319, 324 (5th Cir.1995) (per curiam); <em>see also Leroy v. City of Houston, </em>831 F.2d 576, 586 (5th Cir.1987) (\u201c[T]he burden of proof of reasonableness of the number of hours is on the fee applicant ... and not on the opposing party to prove their unreasonableness.\u201d (citation omitted)). \u201cFailing to provide contemporaneous billing statements does not preclude an award of fees per se, <em>as long as </em>the evidence produced is adequate to determine reasonable hours.\u201d <em>Kellstrom, </em>50 F.3d at 325 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The magistrate judge correctly concluded that the documentation supporting Defendants\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees was inadequate to determine whether Defendants\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees was reasonable: Defendants provided no description of the hours expended on the matter, the rates charged for work, the work performed, or who performed the work. \u201cWithout such basic information, no ... determinations regarding \u2018the reasonable number of hours spend on the litigation and a reasonable hourly rate\u2019 can be made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 9 (quoting <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933). Although this court has, in the past, concluded that \u201csparse\u201d documentation (such as that describing the hours expended and the rates charged) will suffice to allow the court to review a request for attorney\u2019s fees, it has nonetheless required <em>some </em>documentation to support that review. <em>See Wegner v. Standard Ins. Co., </em>129 F.3d 814, 822-23 (5th Cir.1997); <em>cf. Hexamer v. Foreness, </em>997 F.2d 93, 94 (5th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (denying a prevailing, <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs request for attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act because plaintiff \u201cdid not adequately document the time she spent [on her claim]\u201d). The documentation provided by Defendants in this case falls well short of \u201csparse,\u201d and, thus, the magistrate judge correctly denied Defendants\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Defendants also argue that, instead of denying their motion for attorney\u2019s fees, the magistrate judge should have given Defendants the opportunity to submit additional evidence of their fees. This court has repeatedly warned applicants that they \u201c \u2018take their chances\u2019 that the ... court will reject or reduce fee awards if they submit vague or incomplete applications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822 (quoting <em>Kellstrom, </em>50 F.3d at 326-27). The decision to allow Defendants to amend their request for attorney\u2019s fees to provide more specific information rested within the sound discretion of the magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>trate judge. <em>See Walker v. City of Mesquite, TEX., </em>313 F.3d 246, 252 (5th Cir. 2002). The magistrate judge chose not to exercise that discretion to permit the submission of additional evidence, and we see no reason to disturb that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Therefore, the judgment of the district court denying Defendants\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
