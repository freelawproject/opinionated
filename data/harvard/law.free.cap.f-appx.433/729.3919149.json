Although conceding that their motion to reopen was untimely, the petitioners argue that they received ineffective assistance of counsel during their removal hearing, that the 90-day filing deadline should have been equitably tolled, and that the case should be reopened to allow Restrepo to testify in support of her own asylum application and to establish her own credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-17\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006). This review \u201cis limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-18\">An alien may file one motion to reopen in removal proceedings before the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), (c). A motion to reopen \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B). Further, \u201c[a] motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). This 90-day requirement is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional, and, therefore, it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-21\">The petitioners moved to reopen their removal proceedings on June 4, 2010, more than 90 days after the BIA\u2019s January 22, 2009 order affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of all relief. Because the petitioners concede that the motion was untimely, and because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>the 90-day deadline is not subject to equitable tolling, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen. Because the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-17\">. We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA's discretionary refusal to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen the proceedings under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Lewis v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1292-94 (11th Cir.2008). Accordingly, to the extent that the petitioners challenge the BIA's purely discretionary refusal to reopen the proceedings, we dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
