On appeal, Gonzalez-Salinas asserts that the district court erred by applying a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(i)(A)(ii) on the ground that his prior Florida conviction for aggravated assault was a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d It is undisputed, however, that Gonzalez-Salinas did not raise his arguments supporting that assertion below. We therefore review them for plain error. <em>United States v. Pantle, </em>637 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir. 2011). And, applying that standard of review, we conclude that Gonzalez-Salinas is not entitled to relief. This is so because, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court erred by applying the enhancement, any such error was not plain, for there is no precedent from either this Court or the Supreme Court directly resolving the issue or Gonzalez-Salinas\u2019 arguments. <em>See United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
