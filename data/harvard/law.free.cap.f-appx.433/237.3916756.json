Jose Luis BOSQUES-GUTIERREZ, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b259-13\">No. 10-30224</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AhC\">Summary Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b259-14\">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b259-16\">July 15, 2011.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-17\">Camille Ann Domingue, Brett L.

California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Bosques-Gutierrez has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-24\">Counsel\u2019s briefs fail to comply with <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229, 232-33 (5th Cir.2011), in which we admonished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>that an <em>Anders </em>brief should address every applicable item on this court\u2019s <em>Anders </em>checklist, with reference to the facts of the proceedings and citation to the record and relevant legal authority. The briefs fail to address all relevant issues and contain only a cursory examination of the district court\u2019s compliance with Fed.R. Crim.P. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Although <em>Flores </em>teaches that such facially inadequate briefs should not be accepted, we grant the <em>Anders </em>motion in the interest of judicial economy, because it is apparent from the record that this appeal does not involve a nonfrivolous issue. Counsel is directed that future <em>Anders </em>filings should comply with <em>Flores.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
