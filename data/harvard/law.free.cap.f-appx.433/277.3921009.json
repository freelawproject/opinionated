He contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a psychiatric examination brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a) and (b). In support, LozanoRivas contends that his insistence that he was a United States citizen and that he was not convicted for illegal reentry in an earlier criminal proceeding \u2014 in view of documentary evidence indicating that he was so convicted, as well as his guilty plea convictions in other proceedings for illegal reentry and having made a false claim to United States citizenship \u2014 constituted irrational behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-23\">Lozano-Rivas has not shown that \u201creasonable cause\u201d existed to put the district court on notice that he might be mentally incompetent to the extent he was unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4241(a); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>61 F.3d 291, 304 (5th Cir.1995). Lozano-Rivas offers no evidence of a history of irrational behavior on his part or of medical opinions given to the district court that should have led the court to question his competence. <em>See United States v. Messervey, </em>317 F.3d 457, 463 (5th Cir.2002). His statements before and during trial that he was a United States citizen and that he was not previously convicted for illegal reentry are insufficient to make the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a psychiatric examination an abuse of discretion. <em>See id.; Davis, </em>61 F.3d at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
