Gable, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Orlando, FL, Robert E. O\u2019Neill, David Paul Rhodes, Patricia A. Willing-Flu, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Tampa, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b828-15\">Michael William Nielsen, Dowdy &amp; Nielsen, P.A., Winter Spring, FL, for Defendan1&gt;-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b828-17\">Before TJOFLAT, MARTIN and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b828-18\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b828-19\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Yaw Marfo pled guilty to two counts of a six-count indictment: Count One, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and to utter a forged security, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and Count Six, conspiracy to commit tax fraud, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 286. The district court sentenced him at the low-end of the applicable Sentencing Guideline to concurrent prison terms of 41 months. He appeals his sentences, contending that the district court erred by including the total amount of $510,523.32 of intended loss in calculating the offense level, rather than including only the $90,000 of actual loss for which he was responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-21\">We review the district court\u2019s loss determination for clear error. <em>United States v. Woodard, </em>459 F.3d 1078, 1087 (11th Cir. 2006). A defendant\u2019s failure to object to allegations of fact in a presentence report admits those facts for sentencing purposes. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006). Further, \u201ca party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d <em>United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). \u201cThe doctrine of invited error is implicated when a party induces or invites the district court into making an error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThe doctrine stems from the common sense view that where a party invites the trial court to commit error, he cannot later cry foul on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-22\">\u201c[A] party seeking to raise a claim or issue on appeal must plainly and prominently so indicate. Otherwise, the issue\u2014 even if properly preserved at trial \u2014 will be considered abandoned.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number><em>Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Because Marfo admitted at sentencing that the presentence report\u2019s loss and offense level calculations were correct, he has invited his alleged error. In addition, he also has not sufficiently raised a reasonableness issue on appeal, so he has abandoned that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
