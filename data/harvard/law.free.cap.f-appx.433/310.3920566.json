He contends that the stop was unconstitutional under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), because there was little credible evidence of the violation other than the testimony at the suppression hearing of the officer initiating the traffic stop, and he further asserts without providing any evidence or argument in support of his assertion that \u201ceven if he momentarily swerved across the line, which he denies, he by no means \u2018drove\u2019 on the shoulder.\u201d Jacobo also argues that the officer\u2019s additional testimony concerning marijuana seizures and the presence of illegal aliens in the area did not justify the traffic stop and that the officer intended to pull him over even before the alleged traffic violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">The district court determined that the officer\u2019s testimony that Jacobo had driven on the shoulder of the road in violation of the Texas Transportation Code was credible, and Jacobo\u2019s mere assertion without any supporting evidence that he did not in fact swerve across the line on the shoulder does not demonstrate that the district court\u2019s finding that a traffic violation occurred was not plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Gomez, </em>623 F.3d 265, 268 (5th Cir.2010); Tex. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 545.058(a) (Vernon 1999). The existence of a traffic violation justified the stop of Jacobo\u2019s vehicle, regardless of whether the officer had another motive for the stop. <em>See Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). Accordingly, Jacobo has not shown that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Navarro, </em>169 F.3d 228, 231 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
