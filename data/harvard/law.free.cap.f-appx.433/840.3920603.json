In November 2007, Vasquez-Frometa arrived in the United States on a flight from the Dominican Republic and was arrested after he was found to be carrying pellets containing heroin inside his body. He argues that his sentence is proeedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and improperly considered (1) the number of heroin pellets that he was carrying inside his body and (2) the fact that he had traveled to the United States 18 times between 2004 and November 2007. Vasquez-Frometa also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because his brother, who was convicted of a similar offense, was sentenced to only 30 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">We review a sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If a defendant fails to object to a sentencing error before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1233, 1238 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2361, 176 L.Ed.2d 575 (2010). To establish plain error, a defendant must show that there was an (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>We may exercise our discretion to correct such an error if \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1239 (quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">A sentence is proeedurally unreasonable if the sentencing court fails to consider the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) or \u201cselects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2166, 179 L.Ed.2d 946 (2011). The district court need not discuss or explicitly state on the record each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). An acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-16\">In considering the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we consider the totality of the circumstances and apply an abuse-of-discretion standard, under which we reverse only if we find that the district court \u201ccommitted a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Saac, </em>632 F.3d 1203, 1215 (11th Cir.2011). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors that a sentencing court must consider include \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). The party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>We review Vasquez-Frometa\u2019s procedural reasonableness arguments under the plain-error standard because, at sentencing, Vasquez-Frometa stated that he had no objections to the district court\u2019s factual findings or pronouncement of sentence. Vasquez-Frometa has failed to show that the district court plainly erred by imposing a procedurally unreasonable sentence. The record shows that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(2) and 3661, the court was permitted to consider the number of pellets that were found in Vasquez-Frometa\u2019s body, as well as Vasquez-Frometa\u2019s prior trips from the Dominican Republic to the United States. The district court did not rely on clearly erroneous facts because the undisputed facts in the presentence investigation report supported the court\u2019s finding that Vasquez-Frometa made 18 trips to the United States between 2004 and November 2007 despite having limited financial resources. Finally, Vasquez-Frometa has failed to show that his sentence resulted in an unwarranted sentencing disparity because he has not established that he was similarly situated to his brother. Accordingly, we affirm Vasquez-Frometa\u2019s 60-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-6\">.
