We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-20\">Price proceeds pro se on appeal. In light of her pro se status, we must interpret her \u201cbrief liberally to afford all reasonable inferences which can be drawn from\u201d it. <em>Tex. Comptroller of Pub. Accounts v. Liuzza (In re Tex. Pig Stands, Inc.), </em>610 F.3d 937, 941 n. 4 (5th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). That said, we have nonetheless held that under Federal Rule of Appellant Procedure 28, such pro se appellants must include \u201c \u2018citation to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on\u2019 \u201d in their briefs. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>Weaver v. Puckett, </em>896 F.2d 126, 128 (5th Cir.1990)). In short, \u201c \u2018[although we liberally construe the briefs of pro se appellants, we also require that arguments must be briefed to be preserved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Price v. Digital Equip. Corp., </em>846 F.2d 1026, 1028 (5th Cir.1988)); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (requiring an appellant\u2019s argument section to contain her \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>In her brief, Price appears to assert error in the grant of summary judgment on two grounds. First, she argues that issues of material fact remain and that summary judgment was improperly granted as a result. Her briefing on this point, however, fails to identify any putative material fact and suffers from the complete absence of citations indicating the pertinent parts of the record. As a result of these defects, Price has waived her contention on appeal that an issue of material fact precludes the grant of summary judgment. In addition, we have conducted our own examination of the record, and we agree that summary judgment is proper for essentially the same reasons as those given in the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Second, Price argues that the magistrate judge who was assigned to this case interfered with her \u201cright to Co-Counsel, Plaintiff in Consortium], and Whatever assistance she chooses\u201d by \u201cha[ving] her husband banned from the Court\u201d and \u201clater prohibiting] [him] from speaking to her during [a] status conference.\u201d She asserts that her husband is her \u201cassistant\u201d; that <em>Adams v. United States, </em>317 U.S. 269, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942), contains \u201clegal dicta that suggest[s]\u201d that \u201ca litigant [has] the right to have an unlicensed assistant\u201d; and that the lower court\u2019s actions thus violated her constitutional right to due process and equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">This argument is unavailing because it is based on facts \u2014 that the lower court banned Price\u2019s husband from the courtroom and prohibited him from speaking to her at a status conference \u2014 that are not contained in the record. Moreover, <em>Adams </em>does not apply in this case because it concerns only the possible right of a <em>criminal </em>defendant to be represented by an unlicensed lay assistant in certain <em>criminal </em>proceedings. By contrast, our case law is clear that there is no constitutional right to effective counsel in the civil context. <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>785 F.2d 1236, 1237 (5th Cir.1986) (per curiam) (citations omitted). Price has not presented any case in which either the Supreme Court or this Circuit has held that a civil plaintiff has a constitutional right to the assistance of a nonattorney, and, in fact, our case law appears to have long implied exactly the opposite. <em>See Guajardo v. Luna, </em>432 F.2d 1324, 1324 (5th Cir.1970) (holding, in a civil suit, that \u201c[t]here is no constitutional guarantee that non-attorneys may represent other people in litigation\u201d). Accordingly, we reject Price\u2019s arguments and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
