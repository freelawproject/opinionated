In his petition, Means asserted several claims for relief, including that (1) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, and (2) his counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge on direct appeal the trial court\u2019s finding that the victim was competent to testify. The district court granted a certificate of appealability only as to the ineffective assistance claim, and we expanded the certificate of appeal-ability to include the insufficient evidence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">On appeal, Means first argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his conviction for sexual battery upon a child less than 12 years of age. Specifically, he asserts that the evidence consisted solely of the inconsistent testimony and out-of-court statements of his alleged victim, and that the state failed to prove essential elements of the crime charged. Accordingly, he contends that the state court unreasonably applied the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) \u2014 as interpreted by state and federal courts \u2014 thus entitling him to relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Alternatively, he argues that \u00a7 2254(d) does not apply where the state court failed to cite to controlling Supreme Court precedent or to make explicit factual findings, and thus that he is entitled to relief even if the state court reasonably misapplied the <em>Jackson </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">When considering a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal determinations <em>de novo. Owen v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>568 F.3d 894, 907 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1141, 175 L.Ed.2d 978 (2010). At the same time, however, we are essentially reviewing a state court\u2019s decision on the issue. <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1240 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d), we will not grant habeas relief on a state prisoner\u2019s claim that was denied on the merits in state court unless the state court decision: \u201c \u2018(1) ... was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, <em>as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; </em>or (2) ... was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1240-41 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court recently reiterated that \u00a7 2254(d) applies even to summary state court opinions, as well as to opinions that do not cite Supreme Court precedent. <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. -, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>-, 131 S.Ct. 770, 784, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The Supreme Court has further explained that the \u201ccontrary to\u201d and \u201cunreasonable application\u201d clauses of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) have \u201cindependent meaning.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 404-05, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1519, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Specifically, a state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law if it \u201ccontradicts [the Supreme] Court on a settled question of law or holds differently than did that Court on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Green v. Nelson, </em>595 F.3d 1245, 1248 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 827, 178 L.Ed.2d 564 (2010). On the other hand, a decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it \u201cidentifies the correct governing legal principle as articulated by the United States Supreme Court, but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the petitioner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn. other words, it is one that \u2018unreasonably extends [the] principle ... to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend [it] to a new context where it should apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 407, 120 S.Ct. at 1520). Importantly, clearly established federal law is <em>not </em>the case law of the lower federal courts, including our decisions, but rather \u201crefers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions as of the time of the relevant state court decision.\u201d <em>Putman, </em>268 F.3d at 1241 (quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>provides the federal due process benchmark for evidentiary sufficiency in criminal cases. <em>See Green, </em>595 F.3d at 1252. Under that benchmark, \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789. \u201cThis familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Substantively, the Florida offense of sexual battery on a child under 12 years of age involves \u201coral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ\u201d of such child by a person over 18 years of age. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.011(l)(h), (2)(a). The \u201cunion with\u201d language in the statute permits a conviction based on contact with the relevant portion of anatomy, whereas \u201cpenetration\u201d requires some entry into the relevant part, however slight. <em>Seagrave v. State, </em>802 So.2d 281, 287 n. 7 (Fla.2001). Thus, \u201c[i]t is illegal for a man to touch the mouth, anus or vagina of the victim with his penis.\u201d <em>Richards v. State, </em>738 So.2d 415, 418 (Fla.2d Dist.Ct.App. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">In the instant case, Means\u2019s contention that the district court erred by choosing to apply the \u00a7 2254(d) analysis is without merit, since that analysis applies even to summary opinions. In applying the analysis, the district court correctly found that the state court reasonably applied the <em>Jackson </em>standard, because there was a sufficient basis in the record for concluding that the inconsistencies in the victim\u2019s statements were attributable to her age. The state appellate court explicitly found that EC was \u201cremarkably consistent\u201d in describing Means\u2019s conduct and our review of the evidence supports that finding. Although she was sometimes inconsistent in describing the details of the incident, her overall account was not. Accordingly, a rational trier of fact could have found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>essential elements of sexual battery beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Second, Means argues that the district court erred in denying his ineffective assistance claim because the Florida habeas court unreasonably applied <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Specifically, he asserts that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to appeal the trial court\u2019s determination that his alleged victim was competent to testify. He further contends that the district court was required to conduct an independent evidentiary hearing on his ineffective assistance claim because he was not permitted to adequately develop the record in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">An ineffective assistance claim presents a mixed question of law and fact, which we review <em>de novo. Williams v. Allen, </em>598 F.3d 778, 788 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 906, 178 L.Ed.2d 760 (2011). In the context of an ineffective assistance claim raised in a \u00a7 2254 petition, the inquiry turns upon whether the state decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland. See Woodford v. Visciotti, </em>537 U.S. 19, 22, 24-25, 123 S.Ct. 357, 358-60, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002). Thus, \u201c[i]n addition to the deference to counsel\u2019s performance mandated by <em>Strickland, </em>the AEDPA adds another layer of deference \u2014 this one to a state court\u2019s decision \u2014 when we are considering whether to grant federal habeas relief from a state court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Rutherford v. Crosby, </em>385 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir.2004). Notably, where \u201cthe record refutes [a petitioner\u2019s] factual allegations or otherwise precludes habeas relief, a district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Schriro v. Landrigan, </em>550 U.S. 465, 474, 127 S.Ct. 1933, 1940, 167 L.Ed.2d 836 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">To prevail on an ineffective assistance claim, a defendant must demonstrate both: (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Notably, a court need not address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one. <em>Id. </em>at 697,104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">The performance prong of the ineffective assistance standard entails a deferential review of counsel\u2019s conduct. <em>Reed v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>593 F.3d 1217, 1240 (11th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 177, 178 L.Ed.2d 106 (2010). \u201cIn assessing the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance, courts must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Thus, the Sixth Amendment does not require criminal defense attorneys to take a \u201cnothing to lose\u201d approach and \u201craise every available nonfrivolous defense.\u201d <em>Knowles v. Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. 111, -, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1419, 1422, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-16\">With respect to prejudice, courts ask whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687,104 S.Ct. at 2064. In the context of a claim that counsel was ineffective on appeal, \u201cthe court must first perform a review of the merits of the omitted or poorly presented claim.\u201d <em>Heath v. Jones, </em>941 F.2d 1126, 1132 (11th Cir.1991) (quotation and alteration omitted). The defendant carries his burden of establishing prejudice if the court finds that the ne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>glected claim would have had a reasonable probability of success on appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Substantively, under Florida law, the competency of a child witness is assessed based on: \u201c(1) whether the child is capable of observing and recollecting facts, (2) whether the child is capable of narrating those facts to the court or to a jury, and (3) whether the child has a moral sense of the obligation to tell the truth.\u201d <em>Griffin v. State, </em>526 So.2d 752, 753 (Fla. 1st Dist.Ct.App.1988). This inquiry is \u201cone that must be announced on the record and it must be supported by findings of fact.\u201d <em>Barion v. State, </em>704 So.2d 569, 574 (Fla. 1st Dist.Ct.App.1997). Further, the trial court is obligated to make an \u201cadequate inquiry\u201d concerning the child\u2019s sense of duty to tell the truth. <em>S.C. v. State, </em>837 So.2d 1159, 1160 (Fla. 1st Dist.Ct.App. 2003). In reviewing a trial court\u2019s competency determination, Florida appellate courts consider \u201cthe entire context of [a witness\u2019s] testimony and whether [that] testimony is corroborated by other evidence.\u201d <em>Bennett v. State, </em>971 So.2d 196, 201 (Fla. 1st Dist.Ct.App.2007). Notably, we have recognized that state courts are the final arbiters of state law and that their conclusions should not be second-guessed by federal courts. <em>See Callahan v. Campbell, </em>427 F.3d 897, 932 (11th Cir. 2005) (denying habeas relief where a state court had explicitly found that the petitioner\u2019s unraised state-law claim lacked merit).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Even assuming that the failure to appeal the competency determination by Means\u2019s appellate counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, the Florida habeas court\u2019s denial of this claim was nevertheless reasonable in light of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong. The trial record provides a sufficient basis for concluding that the victim was competent to testify under state law, since there was evidence showing that she could recall facts and that she had a sense of duty to tell the truth. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Means\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition without first holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Based on a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-6\">.
