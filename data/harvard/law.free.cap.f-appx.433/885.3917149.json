He raises two arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred in finding that his mental impairments were not severe. Second, Delia contends that the ALJ erred in rejecting the testimony of the Vocational Expert (\u201cVE\u201d) in response to his hypothetical questions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Delia first claims that the ALJ erred by failing to find that Delia\u2019s chronic pain syndrome and depression were \u201csevere impairments\u201d as that term is used in determining social security benefits. When we consider Social Security appeals, we must examine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and based on the proper legal standards. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">A five-step process is used to determine whether an applicant is disabled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-7\">(1) whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments; (3) whether the impairment meets or equals the severity of the specified impairments in the Listing of Impairments; (4) based on a residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) assessment, whether the claimant can perform any of his or her past relevant work despite the impairment; and (5) whether there are significant numbers of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform given the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApG\"><em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1178. \u201cStep two is a threshold inquiry.\u201d <em>McDaniel v. Bowen, </em>800 F.2d 1026, 1031 (11th Cir.1986). Only slight, trivial impairments that \u201cwould clearly not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irrespective of age, education or work experience\u201d are not severe at this step. <em>Id. </em>At steps three, four, and five, the ALJ considers the claimant\u2019s entire medical condition, including impairments that are not severe at step two. <em>Jamison v. Bowen, </em>814 F.2d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">Substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding, at step two, that Delia\u2019s mental impairments were not severe because the medical evidence showed that these impairments did cause restrictions in daily living, social functioning, and maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace. However, the ALJ deemed several of Delia\u2019s other medical impairments to be severe and therefore continued on in the sequential inquiry. The ALJ considered Delia\u2019s mental impairments at steps three, four, and five. Because the ALJ gave full consideration to the consequences of Delia\u2019s mental impairments on his ability to work at later stages of the analysis, the error at step two was harmless and is not cause for reversal. <em>See Reeves v. Heckler, </em>734 F.2d 519, 524 (11th Cir.1984) (rejecting a challenge to an ALJ\u2019s conclusion as harmless error when the ALJ had considered the relevant evidence in making the disability determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">Delia\u2019s second argument is that the ALJ erred in rejecting the VE\u2019s testimony in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>response to his hypothetical questions. At step five, the burden is on the Commissioner to show that there is work in the national economy that the claimant could perform. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001). The Commissioner may meet this burden by showing \u201cthat the claimant can perform other jobs ... through the testimony of a VE.\u201d <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1229 (11th Cir. 1999). \u201cIn order for a VE\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An ALJ is \u201cnot required to include findings in the hypothetical that the ALJ ha[s] properly rejected as unsupported.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1160 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">The ALJ properly rejected the VE\u2019s responses to Delia\u2019s hypothetical questions because the evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s rejection of the work-related restrictions Delia included in his questions. The ALJ concluded that these limitations were not supported by the medical evidence or by Delia\u2019s own statements. Though these limitations were included in the findings of two of Delia\u2019s treating physicians, they belied that same physicians\u2019 treatment notes and the findings of the other doctors who examined Delia. Thus, the rejection of the limitations was supported by substantial evidence, and the ALJ did not err in rejecting the VE\u2019s testimony in response to these questions. <em>See Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1161. Having properly rejected the responses to Delia\u2019s hypothetical, the ALJ was free to accept the VE\u2019s responses to his own hypothetical question, fulfilling the burden placed on the Commissioner at step five to show that there are jobs in the national economy that Delia can perform. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-15\">. In his appeal, Delia offers a general explanation of the manner in which a worker can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>be considered disabled even if he is able to attend work on a full-time basis. As part of this explanation, he offers the hypothetical example of an employee who works a 40-hour work week but is only able to complete 90% of his assigned work during that time due to a medical condition. Delia nowhere asserts that this hypothetical relates specifically to the facts of his disability claim or that the district court erred in its interpretation of how productive an employee must be in order to not be considered disabled. Regardless of whether the claim is being asserted as part of Delia\u2019s appeal, he did not raise this argument in the district court so it is waived and we will not address its merits. <em>See Stewart v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>26 F.3d 115, 115 (11th Cir. 1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-5\">.
