The offense involved the burglary of a pawn shop, during which Johnson and his codefendants stole several firearms. Johnson argues on appeal that the four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), for possession of a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony, is appropriate only where there is proof that the firearm facilitated the other felony. Thus, he argues, the district court erroneously applied \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) in his case, because the government failed to prove that his possession of the firearm facilitated another offense. Johnson concedes in his responsive brief that the issue has been resolved by an amendment to the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">We review a district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Subsection 2K2.1(b)(6) of the Guidelines states that \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense ... increase [the base offense level by] 4 levels.... \u201d In <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>we held that the phrase, \u201cin connection with,\u201d does not require that the firearm facilitate the underlying offense. <em>Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695. In order to resolve a circuit conflict pertaining to the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), specifically with respect to the use of a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d a burglary offense, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 691 in 2006, noting that the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) is warranted in the case of a burglary \u201cbecause of the potential that the presence of the firearm has for facilitating another felony offense....\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 691. Subsection 2K2.1(b)(6) now applies \u201cin a case in which a defendant, who during the course of a burglary, finds and takes a firearm, even if the defendant did not engage in any other conduct with that firearm during the course of the burglary.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n. 14(B)). The enhancement applies \u201cif the firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at comment, (n. 14(A)). For the purposes of this enhancement, \u201canother felony offense\u201d is defined as \u201cany federal, state, or local offense, other than the ... firearms possession or trafficking offense ... regardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at comment. (n.l4(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement was correctly applied in this case, because under Amendment 691, the enhancement required only that the presence of the firearm had the potential of facilitating the burglary. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n. 14(B)). Accordingly, we affirm Johnson\u2019s total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
