The district court found that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the post-conviction petition, but also ruled that the petition was untimely and lacked merit. Myrthil\u2019s relevant arguments first assert that, with respect to his original conviction, the government failed to properly allege and prove the existence of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to convict and sentence him under the statutes charged. Myrthil requests that the judgments against him be dismissed, and also requests a release from prison. We review <em>\u201cde novo </em>questions concerning the jurisdiction of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194 n. 9 (11th Cir.2010). Whether a district court has the authority to modify and vacate a sentence is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Id. \u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">\u201cA \u00a7 2255 motion is aimed at having a judgment of conviction and sentence set aside because of some constitutional violation, jurisdictional defect, or other ground that makes the judgment subject to collateral attack.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Sec\u2019yfor Dep\u2019t of </em>Com, 366 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2004). See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a) (providing the basis for relief if a prisoner in custody claims \u201cthe right to be released upon the ground that ... the court was without jurisdiction to impose such a sentence.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">\u201cFederal courts are obligated to look beyond the label of a <em>pro se </em>inmate\u2019s motion to determine if it is cognizable under a different statutory framework.\u201d <em>United States v. Stossel, </em>348 F.3d 1320, 1322 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003). Therefore, a district court is authorized to recharacterize a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s motion for relief from a criminal judgment as a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 382-83, 124 S.Ct. 786, 792, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). However, when a district court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asl\">recharacterizes a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s motion as a first \u00a7 2255 motion ... [,] the district court must notify the <em>pro se </em>litigant that it intends to recharacterize the pleading, warn the litigant that this re-characterization means that any subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion will be subject to the restrictions on \u2018second or successive\u2019 motions, and provide the litigant an opportunity to withdraw the motion or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>amend it so that it contains all the \u00a7 2255 claims he believes he has. If the court fails to do so, the motion cannot be considered to have become a \u00a7 2255 motion for purposes of applying to later motions the law\u2019s \u2018second or successive\u2019 restrictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 383,124 S.Ct. at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">After a review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that since the record does not indicate that the district court considered the possibility of construing Myrthil\u2019s petition as his first \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, and since Myrthil\u2019s jurisdictional claim can be properly brought under \u00a7 2255, the district court should have explored this possibility, along with the issues of the motion\u2019s timeliness, whether equitable tolling applied, and whether the <em>Castro </em>warnings must be given to Myrthil. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f) (establishing a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion); <em>Sandvik v. United States, </em>177 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that \u201c[ejquitable tolling is appropriate when a movant untimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence\u201d); <em>Castro, </em>540 U.S. at 382-83, 124 S.Ct. at 792. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court, and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">VACATE AND REMAND.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-9\">.
