The Board affirmed the findings of the immigration judge that Liu failed to establish that she had a well-founded fear of forced sterilization or economic penalties amounting to persecution in the Fujian Province for violating family planning laws. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Because the Board agreed with the finding of the immigration judge that Liu failed to establish that she had an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution, we review the decisions of the Board and the immigration judge. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). We review <em>de novo </em>the legal conclusions of the Board and the immigration judge, and we review related findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1350. We must affirm the decision of the Board so long as it is \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351 (quoting <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001)). To reverse findings of fact by the Board, \u201c \u2018we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003)). The \u201c \u2018mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Liu argues that the Board failed to consider all the documentary evidence that she submitted, but we disagree. The Board stated that it had conducted a <em>\u201cde novo </em>review\u201d of the evidence and based its decision on the \u201cdocumentation assessed in [its] published cases\u201d and the evidence submitted by Liu and the Department of Homeland Security. <em>See Morales v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir.2000). The Board \u201cannouncefd] its decision in terms sufficient\u201d to convey that it had given reasoned consideration to Liu\u2019s petition. <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Liu failed to qualify for asylum relief based on a well-founded fear of forced sterilization. Liu submitted evidence about some incidents of forced sterilization that tended to prove she has a subjective fear of punishment, but the record does not compel the conclusion that Liu has an objectively reasonable fear that she will be persecuted for giving birth to two children in the United States. <em>See In re J-H-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 196, 198-99 (BIA 2007). The 2007 Asylum Profile and the County of Origin Information Research Section report states that couples who have children born abroad are not deemed to have violated the one-child policy if the children are not registered as permanent residents when they return to China. The Asylum Profile, citing regulations of the Fujian Province and a letter from the Fujian Province Population and Family Planning Committee on October 13, 2006, states that, even if a couple violates the family planning policy, they cannot be punished physically and instead will be fined. Although Liu submitted copies of two letters from family planning committees in the Fujian Province stating that Liu would be a \u201ctarget for family planning sterilization,\u201d the letters were not properly authenticated, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 287.6, 1287.6, and the Asylum Profile reported that documents from the province were \u201csubject to widespread fabrication and fraud.\u201d Liu also submitted affidavits from her mother and mother-in-law stating that local officials said they would force Liu to undergo sterilization, but the 2006 letter from the Fujian Province Committee stated that village committees lacked authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>\u201cto make decisions on family planning disposition\u201d and any \u201ccertificate/proof issued by said Committee should be deemed ineffective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Substantial evidence also supports the finding that Liu will not suffer economic persecution. Liu failed to prove that the likely amount of the fine she faces would cause \u201csevere economic disadvantage\u201d and reduce her family to \u201can impoverished existence.\u201d <em>In re T-Z-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 163, 173, 174 (BIA 2007). The Asylum Profile states that there is a \u201cwide variation in the amount of social compensation fees\u201d imposed in the Fujian Province and that \u201ccouples unable to pay the fee immediately may be allowed to pay in installments.\u201d Liu and Wang testified that they might have to pay $7,000, but Wang paid more than seven times that amount to be smuggled into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Liu also does not qualify for withholding of removal. To obtain relief, Liu had to prove that it is more likely than not that her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in [China] because of [her] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Because Liu cannot satisfy the \u201c \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum, it is a fortiori that [she] cannot meet the withholding of removal standard.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">We DENY Liu\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
