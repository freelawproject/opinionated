Pursuant to his plea agreement, defendant waived his right to appeal and was sentenced as a second felony offender to a determinate sentence of 10 years in prison. Defendant now argues that this sentence was harsh and excessive. However, because defendant waived his right to appeal as part of a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty, he has failed to preserve this issue for our review <em>(see, People v Buchanan, </em>236 AD2d 741, <em>lv denied </em>89 NY2d 1032). Nevertheless, were we to reach this issue, we would find no abuse of Supreme Court\u2019s discretion and no extraordinary circumstances warranting a modification in the interest of justice <em>(see, People v Brown, </em>251 AD2d 694, <em>lv denied </em>92 NY2d 1029; <em>People v Motter, </em>235 AD2d 582, 589, <em>lv denied </em>89 NY2d 1038).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Cardona, P.
