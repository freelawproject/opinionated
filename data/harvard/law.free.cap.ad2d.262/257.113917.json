The complaint originally contained five causes of action. By order dated January 21, 1997, the plaintiff was awarded nominal damages in the sum of one dollar on the first cause of action and the second cause of action was dismissed. Thereafter, the plaintiff withdrew the third cause of action, which was to recover damages based on an account stated. The fourth cause of action, seeking to recover damages based on negligence, and the fifth cause of action, alleging fraud, should also be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">A written modification to the lease agreement expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>limited the defendants\u2019 liability for collision damages to an amount equal to the insurance deductible. Inasmuch as the plaintiff cannot recover any additional damages, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment. It is well settled that summary judgment may be granted where a contract is clear and unambiguous on its face or where the ambiguity can be resolved without resort to extrinsic evidence <em>(see, Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v Wesolowski, </em>33 NY2d 169, 172). The lease does not, however, give the defendants the right to recover the legal fees they incurred in defending this action. Santucci, J. P., Joy, Goldstein and Schmidt, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
