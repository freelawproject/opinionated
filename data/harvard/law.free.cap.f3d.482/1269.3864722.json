Arias asserts the BIA and IJ denied his due process right to have his \u00a7 212(c) waiver application properly considered. We conclude Arias\u2019s due process claim is actually an abuse of discretion claim couched in constitutional language, and we dismiss his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-19\">Arias was lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence on August 17, 1973. On May 13, 1988, Arias pled guilty to and was convicted of two counts of sale of cocaine, in violation of section 893.13(l)(a), Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-20\">On May 12, 2003, upon returning from traveling abroad, Arias applied for admission to the United States as a returning lawful permanent resident and was paroled into the United States. Subsequently, Arias was served with a notice to appear (NTA), charging him with inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), as an alien convicted of violating a law relating to a controlled substance, and 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C), as an alien who immigration officials had reason to believe had been an illicit trafficker of, or had aided in, the illicit trafficking of a controlled substance. At his master calendar hearing, Arias admitted the allegations contained in the NTA, conceded both charges of inadmissibility, and gave the IJ notice of his intent to file an application for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">At the removal hearing, the IJ denied Arias\u2019s application for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver and ordered that Arias be removed. The IJ found several negative factors in Arias\u2019s case, including: (1) his 1988 conviction for sale of cocaine; (2) a 1997 arrest for auto theft; (3) an Alaska arrest warrant for drug trafficking; (4) the fact he absconded from the Alaska arrest warrant; and (5) the fact he owed $8,000 to the IRS. The IJ found positive factors in Arias\u2019s favor as well, including: (1) he had been a lawful permanent resident for 30 years; (2) his mother and one of his daughters were United States citizens; (3) he helped his mother purchase her house; (4) his 1988 conviction occurred many years ago; and (5) he was employed. Nonetheless, the IJ found the positive factors did not outweigh the negative ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">Arias appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. The BIA noted that even if it did not consider the IJ\u2019s findings that Arias had evaded arrest in Alaska or Arias\u2019s 1997 arrest for auto theft, the record still supported the denial of the waiver. The BIA dismissed Arias\u2019s appeal, finding the \u201cpositive equities\u201d did not outweigh the \u201cadverse factors.\u201d Arias now appeals the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-10\">We are obligated to inquire into our jurisdiction whenever it may be lacking. <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>whether we have subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) states, \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law ... no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1182(a)(2).\u201d Arias conceded he had been convicted of a criminal offense covered in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2), namely, two counts of sale of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">Additionally, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), we lack jurisdiction to review a discretionary decision of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security. The decision to grant or deny a \u00a7 212(c) waiver is within the discretion of the Attorney General. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1996).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-13\">Nevertheless, the REAL ID Act of 2005, which amended 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>stored some of our jurisdiction to decide questions of law or constitutional claims an alien raises in a petition to review a final order of removal. <em>Balogun v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1359 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1920, 164 L.Ed.2d 665 (2006). Specifically, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) now provides that notwithstanding the limitations on judicial review under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) or (C), such limitations do not preclude judicial review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised in a petition for review. Because the REAL ID amendments \u201care retroactively applicable to all pending proceedings regardless of the date of the final administrative order,\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) applies to Arias\u2019s case. <em>See Balogun, </em>425 F.3d at 1360. Accordingly, unless Arias raises a question of law or constitutional claim arising out of his removal proceedings, we lack jurisdiction over his petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"A2KQ\">Arias generally claims the BIA and IJ denied his due process right to have his \u00a7 212(c) waiver application properly considered. While we \u201cretain jurisdiction to review due process challenges under the constitutional claims language of the REAL ID Act, a petitioner must allege at least a colorable constitutional violation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Saloum v. U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs., </em>437 F.3d 238, 243 (2d Cir.2006) (quotations omitted). \u201cA petitioner may not create the jurisdiction that Congress chose to remove simply by cloaking an abuse of discretion argument in constitutional garb.\u201d <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 800-01 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Saloum, </em>437 F.3d at 243; <em>Mehilli v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 86, 93-94 (1st Cir.2005). \u201c[A]ny other outcome \u2018would ... circumvent clear congressional intent to eliminate judicial review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mehilli, </em>433 F.3d at 93-94 (quoting <em>Torres-Aguilar, </em>246 F.3d at 1271). In fact, we have previously recognized, \u201c[wjhere a constitutional claim has no merit ... we do not have jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir.2003). We agree with our sister Circuits that we lack jurisdiction over abuse of discretion claims merely couched in constitutional language.</p>\n<p id=\"AZGx\">We conclude Arias\u2019s constitutional claims are not colorable and are abuse of discretion arguments merely couched in constitutional language. Although Arias uses the term \u201cdue process\u201d in making his arguments, he cites no specific due process violations. Instead, Arias maintains the BIA and IJ erred in (1) failing to consider and weigh all the factors presented by Arias in support of the waiver; (2) finding Arias absconded from a warrant for his arrest in Alaska when such a finding was not supported by any evidence in the record; and (3) finding Arias owed $8,000 in back taxes and characterizing the amount as \u201cexorbitant.\u201d He further asserts the IJ was intemperate and abusive. Arias simply challenges the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s exercise of discretion, claiming the BIA and IJ erred in their weighing of certain adverse and positive factors. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to consider Arias\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"AO4\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">. If an alien violates any law relating to a controlled substance, the alien is inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) and (a)(2)(C), and Arias conceded he was inadmissible under these sections. Under former INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1996), however, legal permanent residents such as Arias, who (1) were inadmissible under the above-listed sections, (2) temporarily traveled abroad voluntarily, and (3) were returning to a lawful, unrelinquished domicile of at least seven years, could be admitted into the United States in the Attorney General\u2019s discretion under a waiver of inadmissibility. Even though \u00a7 212(c) has been repealed, the Supreme Court held <em>\" </em>\u00a7 212(c) relief remains available for aliens ... whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.\u201d <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2293, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). A \u00a7 212(c) waiver is available for Arias because he pled guilty to the relevant offenses when \u00a7 212(c) was still in effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ag1d\">. For a constitutional claim to be colorable, \"the alleged violation need not be substantial, but the claim must have some possible validity.\u201d <em>Mehilli v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 86, 93-94 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
