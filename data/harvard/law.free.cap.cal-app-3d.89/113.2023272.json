(hereafter ERISA) precludes California courts from joining pension funds in marriage dissolution proceedings and from ordering such funds to divide pension payments between the employee and his or her former spouse. We conclude that ERISA has no such effect for the reasons we discuss below.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">As a preliminaiy question we also decide that a spouse may join the pension plan here involved without first submitting a claim to the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">A. In 1975 Christine Campa (hereafter Christine) petitioned for dissolution of her 21-year marriage. She and her husband entered into a written property settlement agreement. As part of the division of the community property the agreement provided that Christine would receive a specified portion of her husband\u2019s monthly retirement benefits from the Carpenters Pension Tmst Fund for Northern California (hereafter Fund). Christine also waived spousal support. The Fund was not a party at this stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Christine obtained an interlocutory judgment of dissolution which incorporated the agreement and, shortly thereafter, a final judgment. The Fund at first assured Christine that it would pay her her portion of her ex-husband\u2019s benefits. The Fund changed its mind and notified Christine that it would make all pension payments directly to her husband. As a result Christine successfully moved for an order setting aside the portion of the judgment relating to retirement pay and ordering the Fund to be joined as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The Fund removed the action to the United States District Court (N.D.Cal.) on the basis of its preemption claim. The district court remanded. It concluded that the action was \u201ca simple domestic relations matter founded solely upon state law\u201d and that the mere existence of a disputed issue of federal law did not give the court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">After remand the Fund answered. As defenses it pled lack of jurisdiction, failure of the joinder petition to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and ERISA\u2019s preemption of \u201cany and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to\u201d the Fund. Cross-motions for summary judgment ultimately followed. In its motion the Fund for the first time contended that Christine had not complied with provisions of the Trust Agreement and Pension Plan (hereafter Trust Agreement) which require that any claim for benefits be submitted to the trustees of the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The trial court denied Christine\u2019s summary judgment motion, and entered a judgment dismissing the Fund. Christine appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">B. Joan Durkin (hereafter Joan) petitioned for dissolution of her 10-year marriage in 1976. On her motion early in the proceedings the Fund was joined as a party. The Fund\u2019s answer avers that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, that Joan had not complied with the provisions of the Trust Agreement purporting to require her to file a claim with the trustee and that ERISA preempts applicable California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The Fund unsuccessfully sought a summary judgment. Ultimately the trial court entered an interlocutory judgment of dissolution. The judgment included a provision ordering the Fund to pay Joan a specified portion of her husband\u2019s pension when he received pension payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The Fund appeals from the interlocutory judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (j).) We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">C. The third case comes to us not directly from a marriage dissolution proceeding but from a declaratory relief action that followed in its wake. Carolyn Biyant (hereafter Carolyn) brought that action against her former husband, William, and against the Fund. Carolyn alleged that she had been divorced from William in 1973 and that she and William owned a community property asset which the dissolution judgment had failed to divide, namely William\u2019s pension \u201cin said\u201d Fund. She sought a declaration that she owned a half-interest in the pension and an order requiring the Fund to show her ownership on its records.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Following abortive efforts by William and the Fund to remove the action to the United States District Court and to obtain a summary judgment in the state court, the case went to trial. The Fund\u2019s defenses were the same as in <em>Durkin. </em>The court found in favor of Carolyn, fixed her interest in accordance with a formula based on the pension credits acquired during the marriage and ordered the Fund to pay directly to Carolyn her share of the pension when William starts to receive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The Fund appeals from the judgment. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The contention that the wives in the three cases first had to present their claims to the trustees of the Fund need not detain us long.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">A. The issue may not properly be before us in <em>Campa. </em>The Fund first raised it in connection with the cross-motions for summary judgment, almost a year after the Fund had been made a party. The Fund did not plead it as a defense in its answer. Under those circumstances the defense may well have been waived. (Compare <em>Gunderson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 138, 143-145 [120 Cal.Rptr. 35].) However, since the issue is clearly present in the other two cases, we shall decide it on its merits as to all three.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>B.  There is no doubt that the Trust Agreement sets forth the procedure which the Fund contends that the wives should have used.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is, of course, familiar law that normally such internal remedies must be exhausted before resort to the courts will be allowed. (2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1970) Actions, \u00a7 177, p. 1041.) \u201cSuch internal remedies are designed not only to promote the settlement of grievances but also to promote more harmonious relationships, and the courts look with favor upon them.\u201d <em>(Holderby </em>v. <em>Internat. Union etc. Engrs. </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 843, 846 [291 P.2d 463].)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The principle requiring exhaustion of private administrative remedies has a number of exceptions. One of the better known of these covers situations where the decision of the administrative body is certain to be adverse. <em>(Ogo Associates </em>v. <em>City of Torrance </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 830, 834 [112 Cal.Rptr. 761]; 2 Witkin, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 177, p. 1044.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Application to the Fund by the wives would have been the essence of futility. Christine tried it informally with the noted results. The Fund\u2019s position throughout the litigation of these cases has been that it would not and could not divide the pension checks between the covered husbands and their ex-wives. Indeed, in December 1975 the Trust Agreement was amended to explicitly limit spouses of retired employees \u201cto a community property share of the pension actually received by a Retired Employee, after such receipt. ...\u201d Under this provision, which antedates all proceedings against the Fund in the cases before us, the trustees of the Fund would have no alternative but to turn down the wives\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Under these circumstances, we will not require the empty ritual of first going to the trustees of the Fund. Such a step would certainly not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>\u201cpromote the settlement of grievances\u201d or \u201cmore harmonious relationships\u201d <em>(Holderby, supra, </em>at p. 846) or any other purpose of the exhaustion of remedies rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">We turn to the main issue. As indicated earlier, we are required to decide whether ERISA precludes our courts from making pension plans parties to marriage dissolution proceedings and from ordering them to divide pension payments between the employee and his or her ex-spouse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Our inquiry is delineated by <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co. </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 519, 525 [51 L.Ed.2d 604, 613-614, 97 S.Ct. 1305]: \u201cOur prior decisions have clearly laid out the path we must follow to answer this question. The first inquiry is whether Congress, pursuant to its power to regulate commerce, U. S. Const., Art. 1, \u00a7 8, has prohibited state regulation of the particular aspects of commerce involved in this case. Where, as here, the field which Congress is said to have pre-empted has been traditionally occupied by the States, see, <em>e.g., </em>U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 10; <em>Patapsco Guano Co. </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>171 U.S. 345, 358 (1898), \u2018we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u2019 <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947). This assumption provides assurance that \u2018the federal-state balance,\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971), will not be disturbed unintentionally by Congress or unnecessarily by the courts. But when Congress has \u2018unmistakably . . . ordained,\u2019 <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 142 (1963), that its enactments alone are to regulate a part of commerce, state laws regulating that aspect of commerce must fall. This result is compelled whether Congress\u2019 command is explicitly stated in the statute\u2019s language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose. <em>City of Burbank </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number><em>Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 624, 633 (1973); <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., supra, </em>at 230.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><em>Jones </em>dealt with state regulation of commerce, but the same principles apply to determine the effect of a congressional enactment on other state law. (E.g., <em>Malone </em>v. <em>White Motor Corp. </em>(1978) 435 U.S. 497 [55 L.Ed.2d 443, 98 S.Ct. 1185]; <em>Wissner </em>v. <em>Wissner </em>(1950) 338 U.S. 655 [94 L.Ed. 424, 70 S.Ct. 398].) In determining whether Congress has \u201cunmistakably ordained\u201d preemption in the situation before us, we will examine ERISA, including its provision that subchapters I and III of the act \u201csupersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan. . . .\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a) (hereafter \u00a7 1144(a)).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We will also analyze the aspects of California law which the Fund contends are superseded in order to determine if they \u201crelate to\u201d employee benefit plans within the meaning of section 1144(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">ERISA is a pension reform law of major importance. Its objectives and principal provisions are not difficult to understand. The act must be viewed in light of the abuses it was designed to correct. Private pension plans grew rapidly after the end of World War II. In many cases they were inadequate, mismanaged and promised benefits that proved to be illusory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A three-year congressional study of the private pension system \u201cclearly established that too many workers, rather than being able to retire in dignity and security after a lifetime of labor rendered on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>promise of a future pension, find that their earned expectations are not to be <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">To remedy this situation ERISA mandates major reforms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">\u2014It limits the maximum length of time that an employee has to work before becoming a participant in a pension plan established by his employer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\u2014It sets minimum \u201cvesting\u201d standards, giving employees nonforfeitable rights to a pension upon reaching retirement age, whether or not they leave their employment before that age. (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1053.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">\u2014It requires \u201cthat contributions are made to pension plans at a rate sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that adequate funds will be on hand to meet all vested benefit claims.\u201d (1974 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, at p. 5177; see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1081 et seq.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">\u2014It provides \u201can insurance system which will protect employees and their beneficiaries in their vested pension rights, despite premature plan termination.\u201d (1974 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, at p. 5177; see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301 et seq.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">\u2014It imposes \u201cstrict fiduciaiy obligations upon those who exercise management or control over the assets or administration of an employee pension or welfare fund, as well as . . . reporting and disclosure requirements.\u201d (1974 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 5177-5178; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">\u2014It provides for administrative and judicial remedies. (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 et seq.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-11\">\u2014It makes tax changes, among them the creation of tax incentives for the establishment of individual retirement accounts. (1974 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, at p. 5178.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Congress, in essence, aimed at assuring that pension rights are real\u2014that new employees are not kept from participating in a plan for a long time and that expected benefits do not evaporate due to underfunding, maladministration, a company going out of business or a termination of employment after many years of work. The preemption claim and ERISA\u2019s section 1144(a) must be viewed in this setting. By section 1144(a) Congress clearly wanted to protect the standards and safeguards which it had created against state interference. <em>(In re Marriage of Pardee </em>(C.D.Cal. 1976) 408 F.Supp. 666.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The crucial question becomes whether the state laws involved in the cases before us constitute such interference\u2014whether, in other words, they frustrate or contravene what Congress intended to do and did.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">California treats pension rights, whether or not vested, as community property to the extent that they derive from employment during marriage. <em>(In re Marriage of Brown </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 838 [126 Cal.Rptr. 633, 544 P.2d 561]; <em>In re Marriage of Fithian </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 592 [111 Cal.Rptr. 369, 517 P.2d 449]; see also Reppy, <em>Community and Separate Interests in Pension and Social Security Benefits after Marriage of Brown and ERISA </em>(1978) 25 UCLA L.Rev. 417.) It does so out of a recognition of the economic importance of pension rights and the need to treat them equitably. <em>(In re Marriage of Brown, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">When a marriage terminates the community property is divided equally between the spouses, either by agreement between them or, if they cannot agree, by the court. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 4800.) As far as pension rights are concerned this is often done by awarding them to the employee and compensating his or her spouse with other property of equal value. <em>(Phillipson </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 32 [89 Cal.Rptr. 61, 473 P.2d 765]; <em>In re Marriage of Brown, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 848.) When pension rights are handled in this manner, pension plans are unaffected: When the employee-spouse retires they pay the whole pension to him. But this approach is often not feasible when the pension rights are not vested because of the difficulty in ascertaining their value. It may also be impractical because of the absence of offsetting property. Or the parties themselves may prefer to have the nonemployee spouse share in the pension once it starts being paid in order to provide a measure of security in later years. In such cases the court can \u201caward each spouse an appropriate portion of each pension payment as it is paid.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Brown, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 848.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>In order to effectuate the division of the pension check, a pension plan may be made a party to a marriage dissolution proceeding and ordered to send two monthly checks instead of one. <em>(In re Marriage of Sommers </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 509 [126 Cal.Rptr. 220].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial courts in <em>Durkin </em>and <em>Bryant </em>followed the above procedures; in <em>Campa </em>the court below declined to do so for the reason we have mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Thus, California law as applicable to the cases before us is concerned with effectuating a fair division of the monthly pension check between the former spouses. This concern plainly has no bearing on the effort of Congress, embodied in ERISA, to assure genuine pension rights. To ask a pension plan to send two monthly checks instead of one does not interfere with any of the Congressional objectives. It is, in fact, consonant with the objective of assuring that the members of the family receive the pension which they anticipated. We cannot find in ERISA or its extensive legislative history an unmistakable ordaining or \u201cclear and manifest purpose\u201d to prevent states from achieving this simple and sensible aim in their domestic relations proceedings. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., supra, </em>430 U.S. 519; <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(1978) 435 U.S. 151 [55 L.Ed.2d 179, 98 S.Ct. 988, 994]; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Stone, supra, </em>450 F.Supp. 919.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Our conclusion is reinforced by several factors. First, as we have indicated, control over how state courts dispose family assets in a divorce is wholly unnecessary in achieving the objectives of ERISA.  Secondly, \u201c[d]omestic relations is a field peculiarly suited to state regulation and control, and peculiarly unsuited to control by federal courts.\u201d <em>(Buechold </em>v. <em>Ortiz </em>(9th Cir. 1968) 401 F.2d 371, 373.) We will not lightly infer that Congress intended the \u201cradical disturbance\u201d <em>(Stone </em>v. <em>Stone, supra, </em>450 F.Supp. at p. 932) of \u201cthe federal-state balance\u201d <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., </em>supra) which would result from ousting state regulation of community property in the situations before us. One federal court has observed that the consequence would be \u201clegalized chaos\u201d in which \u201cthe federal judiciary will have been granted a roving commission to delineate family property law with little assistance from the Congress as to how to proceed.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Pardee, supra, </em>408 F.Supp. at p. 669.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Third, the California procedure accomplishes important objectives that do not conflict with Congress\u2019: The family assets are fairly divided, the divorce proceedings are conclusively resolved with respect to the pension and both spouses ultimately share in the pension. The integrity of pension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>funds remains unaffected. They do not pay out one cent more than their plans call for.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The Fund urges that ERISA seeks to reward employees for long service, to further the interest of employers in a stable work force, to insure financial security for retired employees and to provide security for the retired worker\u2019s surviving spouse. The argument that such objectives are contravened by California\u2019s treatment of pension benefits in marriage dissolutions has been rejected by our Supreme Court. (See <em>In re Marriage of Fithian, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 592 at pp. 597-604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">It remains for us to address several specific contentions made by the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">A.  The Fund points to ERISA\u2019s restrictions on assignment or alienation of pension benefits (29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206(d)(1), 1056(d)(1)) as evidence of Congress\u2019 concern that the pension benefits be preserved intact until an employee reaches retirement age. But dividing the benefits, once they are received, between an employee and his former spouse in no way clashes with this objective. It merely assures that the ex-wife partakes of the pension to the extent that it was earned as a result of the community effort. (See <em>In re Marriage of Brown, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at pp. 851-852.) Her rights are those of an owner, not a creditor. <em>(Phillipson </em>v. <em>Board of Administration, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 44.)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The same argument was made and rejected in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Stone, supra. </em>We agree with what the court said there (450 F.Supp. at p. 926): \u201cThe payment of benefits to a nonemployee spouse in satisfaction of her community property claim does not conflict with the purposes of \u00a7 206(d)(1). Members of the families of employees are included in the class which ERISA protects. The basic purpose of ERISA is to protect the literally millions of people who depend on benefits from private pension plans for financial independence after retirement. H.Rep.No. 93-533, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., 1974 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 4639, 4640-4641; S.Rep.No. 93-127, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., 1974 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 4838, 4839-4840. Congress was concerned not only about the workers themselves whose employment entitles them to benefits. Congress was also concerned about the families of those workers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>who depend to the same degree on the actual availability of those benefits. It would be ironic indeed if a provision designed in part to ensure that an employee spouse would be able to meet his obligations to family after retirement were interpreted to permit him to evade them with impunity after divorce. Construing \u00a7 206(d)(1) to prevent a nonemployee spouse from enforcing marital property obligations against an employee benefit plan covered by ERISA would frustrate rather than further the policies of that provision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">B. The fund also places great stress on <em>Hewlett-Packard Co. </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(N.D.Cal. 1977) 425 F.Supp. 1294, affirmed (9th Cir. 1978) 571 F.2d 502. There, the. court held ERISA preempts a state statute which regulated employee health benefit plans in detail. The plans involved in <em>Hewlett-Packard </em>were concededly subject to regulation under ERISA. Thus, the case involved competing regulatory schemes. The irrelevance of <em>Hewlett-Packard </em>to the question before us is highlighted by the fact that its author also wrote <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Stone, supra, </em>which reached the same conclusion as we do on the precise issue here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">C. The Fund contends that Congress was aware of community property laws when it enacted ERISA and intended to supersede them. To bolster this contention the Fund points to tax sections of ERISA which indeed provide that they should be applied without regard to community property laws. (26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 219, 402(e), 408.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The argument proves too much. The fact that Congress chose to supersede community property laws <em>selectively </em>gives rise to a strong inference that Congress did not intend to preempt them <em>generally.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">D.  The Fund next maintains that section 1144 of ERISA affirms the principle that provisions of collective bargaining agreements negotiated under the aegis of the National Labor Relations Act generally supersede conflicting state law. (E.g., <em>Teamsters Union </em>v. <em>Oliver </em>(1959) 358 U.S. 283 [3 L.Ed.2d 312, 79 S.Ct. 297].) The pension plan here purports to prohibit the nonemployee spouse from obtaining any order or other process against the Fund. This provision, the Fund urges, must prevail over contrary California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>This argument is untenable in light of <em>Malone </em>v. <em>White Motor Co., supra, </em>435 U.S. 497 [98 S.Ct. 1185]. There the court held that the Minnesota Private Benefit Protection Act was not preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. The court noted that \u201c \u2018We cannot declare pre-empted all local regulation that touches or concerns in any way the complex interrelationships between employees, employers and unions; obviously, much of this is left to the states.\u2019 <em>Motor Coach Employees </em>v. <em>Lockridge, </em>403 U.S. 274, 289, 91 S.Ct. 1909, 1919, 29 L.Ed.2d 473 (1971)\u201d (435 U.S. at p. 504, [55 L.Ed.2d at p. 450, 451, 98 S.Ct. at p. 1190].) The court went on to say <em>(ibid.): </em>\u201cThere is little doubt that under the federal statutes governing labor-management relations, an employer must bargain about wages, hours, and working conditions and that pension benefits are proper subjects of compulsory bargaining. But there is nothing in the NLRA, including those sections on which appellee relies, which expressly forecloses all state regulatory power with respect to those issues, such as pension plans, that may be the subject of collective bargaining. If the Pension Act is preempted here, the congressional intent to do so must be <em>implied </em>from the relevant provisions of the labor statutes. We have concluded, however, that such implication should not be made here. . . .\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">An implication that Congress in the NLRA intended to abrogate community property and domestic relations laws which divide pensions between ex-spouses is even less warranted than the one unsuccessfully urged in <em>Malone.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">E. The Fund also contends that ERISA expressly requires it not to consent to being joined as a party to marriage dissolution proceedings and not to honor a state court order requiring benefit payments to divorced spouses. This contention is based on 29 United States Code section 1104(a) which provides, in the part relied on by the Fund: \u201c(a)(1) Subject to sections 1103(c) and (d), 1342, and 1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and\u2014[\u00b6] (A) for the exclusive purpose of: [\u00b6] (i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and [\u00b6] (ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan; ... [\u00b6] (D) in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u201cThe criterion for determining whether state and federal laws are so inconsistent that the state law must give way is firmly established in our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>decisions. Our task is \u2018to determine whether, under the circumstances of this particular case, [the State\u2019s] law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., supra, </em>430 U.S. at p. 526 [51 L.Ed.2d at p. 614].)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Section 1104 is the basic fiduciary section of ERISA. In enacting it Congress was concerned over the course of conduct in pension fund transactions, the degree of responsibility required of fiduciaries, the types of persons who should be deemed fiduciaries and standards of accountability for them. (See, e.g., 1974 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 4847,4645, 5075 et seq.) Adherence to fiduciary standards is essential to the proper administration of a pension plan. Dividing pension benefits, once they are being paid out, between the former spouses, has no bearing on the honest and skillful administration of a pension plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\"><em>Wissner </em>v. <em>Wissner, supra, </em>338 U.S. 655, relied on by the Fund, does not aid its position. <em>Wissner </em>dealt with a section of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940 which gave the insured under a serviceman\u2019s policy the right to designate the beneficiary. The court held that California could not frustrate this right by ordering half the proceeds of the policy to be paid to the serviceman\u2019s widow. Thus, <em>Wissner </em>involved a head-on clash between a specific enactment of Congress and state law. As the <em>Wissner </em>court noted, \u201cthe judgment below nullifies the soldier\u2019s choice and frustrates the deliberate purpose of Congress.\u201d (338 U.S. at p. 659 [94 L.Ed.2d at p. 429].) Here, as we have seen, there is no clash and no frustration.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">F. The Fund urges that legislation enacted in California in 1977 demonstrates that California community property laws \u201crelate to\u201d pension plans within the meaning of section 1144(a), regulate them and conflict with ERISA. The legislation referred to is Statutes 1977, chapter 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">We note that this legislation, which went into effect on January 1, 1978, is not involved in any of the cases before us. The actions of the trial courts occurred before its operative date. But since the Fund claims that the statute sheds light on how our community property laws affect pension plans, we will consider the point. It is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Chapter 860 amends two sections of and adds two sections to our statutes dealing with termination of marriage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>(1) It amends Civil Code section 4351 to provide that an order or judgment in a dissolution proceeding can only be enforced against a pension plan if the plan has been joined as a party.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">(2) It amends Civil Code section 4363 to provide that a pension plan can be made a party only in accord with section 4363.1.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">(3) New Civil Code section 4363.1 sets out the joinder procedure.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It gives the pension plan 45 days to respond\u2014a longer period than the norm (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 412.20, subd. (a)(3); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1254(b))\u2014and frees it from paying all filing fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>(4) New Civil Code section 4363.2 gives a pension plan which elects to be governed by it an option not to appear at any hearing in the dissolution action and a right, even if it does not appear, to move to set aside or modify any court order aimed at the plan within 30 days.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">It is immediately apparent that chapter 860 continues the joinder practice used in two of the cases before us and recognized by <em>In re Marriage of Sommers, supra. Sommers </em>was based on California statutory law as it then existed. (53 Cal.App.3d at p. 513.) What chapter 860 evinces is added concern for the practical needs of the pension plans: They cannot be subjected to orders dividing a pension unless they are joined, they are given a longer time to appear than ordinary litigants, they are freed from payment of filing fees and they are given a special option <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>not to appear at all but nevertheless to retain the right to object to the court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But the important point is that chapter 860 does not basically change California practice; it changes only details and those in ways favorable to pension plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The Fund nevertheless asserts that compliance with California law is burdensome to it. The Fund claims that in a two-year period it has been joined in twenty-one marital dissolution proceedings. The Fund has 37,000 participants.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Fund does not tell us whether all of these cases resulted in orders against it.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Assuming they did, the Fund would ultimately have to mail two monthly checks instead of one in these cases and do the related record keeping. Recognizing that the total number of cases in which the Fund has to do that is likely to increase over the years, the task is, nevertheless, hardly overwhelming. As to appearing in marriage dissolution proceedings, we have seen that chapter 860 does not make the Fund\u2019s participation in them more onerous and in most of these proceedings there will be little, if any, need for the Fund to participate actively. The Fund does not contend that the cost of compliance threatens its fiscal integrity; on oral argument the Fund conceded that the cost does not make its compliance with California law economically unfeasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Our analysis necessitates the conclusion that in enacting ERISA Congress did not intend to preclude the states from dividing pension rights in marital dissolution proceedings in the manner in which this is done by California courts. Accordingly, we dispose of the cases before us as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">A. <em>In re Marriage of Campa</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The trial court denied Christine\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted the Fund\u2019s motion. The denial is not appealable but may be reviewed on Christine\u2019s appeal from the judgment against her. <em>(Aas </em>v. <em>Avemco Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 312, 323 [127 Cal.Rptr. 192]; Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Civ. Proc., \u00a7 906.) We have concluded that the Fund has presented no meritorious defense to being made a party. The record reveals no factual disputes between the Fund and Christine. She is, therefore, entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed with directions to the trial court to enter judgment in favor of Christine and against the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">B. <em>In re Marriage of Durkin</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">C. <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Carpenters Pension Trust Fund</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Caldecott, P.
