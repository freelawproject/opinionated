John Schaller is its president. The corporation was in the business of collecting both current support and accrued arrearages, on a contingent fee basis<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for custodial parents, including former and current aid to families with dependent children (hereinafter AFDC) recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">On October 22, 1976, the District Attorney of Santa Clara County filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief on behalf of Santa Clara County against appellants. The complaint alleged that the action of Support, Inc. in accepting assignments and pursuing collections interfered with the county\u2019s right to assigned arrearages under both express and equitable assignments and its duty to enforce support obligations and to collect support arrearages. This action was alleged to result in irreparable injury arising out of the loss of incentive funds, additional loss of state and federal funds for the welfare program and a multiplicity of lawsuits in order for the county to protect its rights in each case where Support, Inc. was pursuing collections.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In the second cause of action, the county contended that child support rights are not assignable except with judicial approval or in accordance with statute. A controversy was alleged to exist in that the county asserted that it is the only party that can collect support arrears of former or current welfare recipients who have assigned their support rights by equitable assignment and/or by operation of law to the county and that, therefore, the assignments to Support, Inc. are void and against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Finally, the county contended that its interest in the support arrears of former welfare recipients had priority and must be satisfied in full, notwithstanding the priority in terms of time, before the former welfare recipient receives any arrears.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">A temporary restraining order was granted on October 22, 1976. Demurrers were filed on behalf of appellants, asserting that neither the first nor the second cause of action stated facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. On November 5 and 10, 1976, the hearing on the preliminary injunction was held. Various affidavits and declarations were submitted and testimony was taken both on behalf of and against the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>On December 15, 1976, appellants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the district attorney was an improper attorney to bring an action on behalf of Santa Clara County and that the county board of supervisors had not authorized the action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">On February 16, 1977, the court issued a preliminary injunction<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> prohibiting appellants from the following acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u201cA. From the taking of assignments for the purpose of collecting past-due child and/or spousal support from any person who has at any time in the past received Public Assistance in Santa Clara County, without first securing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u201c(1) An affidavit from the Santa Clara County District Attorney, Family Support Division, that there are no monies owing Santa Clara County on account of such assistance or;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">\u201c(2) A release from the Santa Clara County Family Support Division in full and complete satisfaction of all unreimbursed expense on account of such assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">\u201cB. From proceeding to collect, either by way of any assignment taken prior to the date of this order, or without benefit of any assignment, past-due child and/or spousal support from any person who has at any time in the past received Public Assistance in Santa Clara County without first securing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">\u201c(1) An affidavit from the Santa Clara County District Attorney, Family Support Division, that there are no monies owing Santa Clara County on account of such assistance or;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-11\">\u201c(2) A release from the Santa Clara County Family Support Division in full and complete satisfaction of all unreimbursed expense on account of such assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-12\">\u201cC. From obtaining an order vacating any order providing for the payments of support to the Santa Clara County Adult Probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Department or the Family Support Trustee without first filing and serving on the Santa Clara County District Attorney\u2019s Office a notice of motion requesting the vacating of said order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">\u201cD. From disbursing any funds previously collected or received during the pendency of this action as and for past-due child and/or spousal support on behalf of any person who has at any time in the past received Public Assistance in Santa Clara County. Said funds shall be held in trust pending further determination by this Court of the appropriate disposition thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201cE. From proceeding with collection on behalf of any person who has represented that they have never received Public Assistance in Santa Clara County, which collections initiated or commenced from and after the filing of the Complaint herein, without first obtaining written verification from the Santa Clara County District Attorney\u2019s Office that said person has, in fact, never received Public Assistance in Santa Clara County. The Santa Clara County District Attorney is ordered to respond to any such inquiry by Support, Incorporated within seven (7) days of its receipt of such inquiry.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">On February 22, 1977, the complaint of the County of Santa Clara was answered by appellant and a cross-complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief was filed by Support, Inc. against the County of Santa Clara District Attorney, County of Santa Clara Probation Department, County of Santa Clara Department of Social Services, State of California Department of Benefit Payments, and Joseph Califano, U.S. Secretary of H.E.W.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The three county departments moved to strike the cross-complaint, alleging that the request for declaratory relief was redundant on the basis that the cross-complaint did not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action, that the same cause of action was pending in another action, and that the cross-complaint was uncertain and ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">On April 4, 1977, the court granted the motion to strike the cross-complaint on the grounds that the cross-complaint did not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>The court sustained the state\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend on the basis that the \u201calleged issues raised by said cross-complaint are fully covered in the main action and an independent cause of action is raised as to the Department\u2019s breach of administerial duties as no \u2018substantial failure to perform\u2019 said duties by any \u2018lesser\u2019 agency has been or seems possible of being pled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Summary of Statutory Background</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">To fully understand appellants\u2019 contentions, it is necessary to examine family support law as it existed both before and after September 20, 1975, the date on which California passed emergency legislation conforming state law to federal requirements of title IV of the Social Security Act amendments. All states were required as a condition of eligibility for federal reimbursement for assistance granted to welfare dependents to conform their state law to federal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Prior to September 20, 1975, a California county providing public assistance and welfare aid to dependent parents and children was subrogated to the rights of the obligee pursuant to section 248 of the California Civil Code,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> thus creating an equitable assignment in the county. As stated in <em>Marriage of Shore, </em>71 Cal.App.3d 290, 297 [139 Cal.Rptr. 349]: \u201cAs repeatedly underlined, equitable assignment or right of subrogation is a creature of equity and applies to all cases where one party involuntarily pays a debt for which another is primarily liable and which in equity and good conscience should have been paid by the latter <em>(Estate of Kemmerrer </em>(1952) 114 Cal.App.2d 810, 814 [251 P.2d 345, 35 A.L.R.2d 1393]; <em>Fireman\u2019s etc. Co. </em>v. <em>State Comp. etc. Fund </em>(1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 408, 412-413 [209 P.2d 55]; 7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Equity, \u00a7 124 et seq., p. 5342).\u201d (See also 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) \u00a7 101, pp. 1776-1777.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The amount of reimbursement that the county could recover to offset, unreimbursed expenses paid out for the support of the custodial parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>and dependent children is set out in section 11350 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">In 1975, federal legislation established a comprehensive mandatory program to enforce child support to be carried out by the states. Public Law No. 93-647 added title IV-D, codified as 42 United States Code sections 651-659. At the same time, conforming amendments were made to title IV-A of the Social Security Act (the AFDC program), most importantly to section 602 of title 42 of the United States Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Title IV-D requires, inter alia, that each applicant for public assistance must assign to the state any rights to support which have accrued at the time the assignment is executed. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)26(A).) Section 657 of title 42 of the United States Code contains instructions for distributing the amounts collected, providing generally that for families receiving assistance the monthly support payments shall be retained by the state as reimbursement unless the monthly required payment exceeds the grant in which case the recipient receives the funds. Amounts in excess of the monthly support payment (arrearages) are retained as reimbursement for past assistance, if any exists. When a family ceases to receive assistance, the law provides that the state may continue to collect for three months, and continue to collect at the end of that time if authorized by the custodial parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The title IV-D legislation also provides for sanctions for noncompliance by the states. The amount payable to the state for its AFDC program shall be reduced by 5 percent if the state is found to have failed to have an effective program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 603(h)).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In response to the federal legislation, California enacted section 11475 et seq. of the Welfare, and Institutions Code. For the purposes of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>action, section 11475 of the Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> designated the Department of Benefit Payments as the single organizational unit with the duty to administer the state plan. However, \u201cState plan functions shall be performed by other agencies as required by law, by delegation of the department, or by cooperative agreements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Section 11475.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code provides in pertinent part: \u201cEach county shall maintain a single organizational unit located in the office of the district attorney which shall have responsibility for promptly and effectively enforcing the obligation of parents to support their children .... The district attorney shall take appropriate action, both civil and criminal, to enforce this obligation when the child is receiving public assistance and when requested to do so by the individual on whose behalf the enforcement efforts will be made when the child is not receiving public assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">In order to comply with the federal law and to protect the local, state and federal share of aid granted to recipients, section 11477 of the Welfare and Institutions Code states that as a condition of eligibility for aid, each applicant shall: \u201c(a) Assign to the county any rights to support from any other person such applicant may have in their own behalf or in behalf of any other family member for whom the applicant is applying for or receiving aid, and which have accrued at the time such assignment is made. Receipt of public assistance under this chapter shall operate as an assignment by operation of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Collection and disbursement of funds assigned pursuant to section 11477 is set forth in section 11457 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Basically, this section requires direct payment of child support money to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the district attorney by the noncustodial parent and prohibits crediting advance payments to child support unless amounts have been collected which fully satisfy the assigned support obligation for current months and all past months.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The leading case in interpreting the 1975 emergency legislation is <em>In re Marriage of Shore, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.3d 290, which was decided by this court. In that case, Mary Shore had received over a five-year period $10,075.61 AFDC aid, of which $6,239.91 remained unreimbursed to the county. After going off AFDC, Mary assigned her right to the past child and spousal support to appellant, a private collection agency.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The principal issue on appeal was whether an AFDC recipient was authorized to assign to appellant her rights as to the past support payments which had accrued at the time she was receiving AFDC or whether she was limited to assign for collection only rights as to the future payments which fell due when she was no longer an AFDC recipient. We held that (1) under the law existing prior to September 20, 1975, the county paying aid for support of needy children was entitled to reimbursement from the custodial parent, and in order to secure such right the county obtained an equitable assignment or subrogation right; (2) after September 20, 1975, a custodial parent applying for and receiving aid assigns by operation of law all support rights that have accrued before and during the grant of the aid; and (3) the right of a county to collect past due payments from a custodial parent does not terminate when a custodial parent ceases to receive aid under the AFDC program.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Appellants argue that the court should reconsider its holding that prior to 1975 there was an equitable subrogation of an AFDC recipient\u2019s accrued arrearages. They cite three cases which purportedly reach a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">We agree with respondent\u2019s analysis of these cases. In <em>County of San Bernardino </em>v. <em>Simmons </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 394 [296 P.2d 329], the court interpreted the statutory scheme relating to responsible relatives. Since the statutes provided specific procedures for recoupment, the county could not seek recoupment under the general provisions of law establishing a duty of support. In the instant action, the statutes provide for reimbursement. In <em>Ogdon </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Board </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 192 [113 Cal.Rptr. 206, 520 P.2d 1022], the court considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>claim of the county for reimbursement from a workmen\u2019s compensation award made to a disabled employee. Benefits had been paid to the employee for support of himself and his family. The court held that under California statutes no liability rests on the recipient of public assistance to reimburse the county for aid properly received. The court pointed out that specific statutory authority did exist for reimbursement from -the absent parent for aid granted to a spouse or children, pursuant to section 11350 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 201.) <em>County of Santa Barbara </em>v.. <em>Flanders </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 486 [133 Cal.Rptr. 798] does not discuss equitable assignments, but does recognize that the county may proceed against the absent parent on either its own behalf or that of the parent. Thus, the cases are consistent with the decision in <em>Shore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Child Support Prior to September 20, 1975</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Appellants contend that it was improper to enjoin Support, Inc. from taking assignments from and making collections for those custodial parents who received no welfare subsequent to September 20, 1975, on the grounds that the injunction erroneously covers funds which were not subrogated. They cite a hypothetical case where accrued arrearages exceed the amount of assistance paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">We agree with appellants that with respect to the pre-1975 cases, the county is subrogated only to the actual amount of aid paid. However, as we stated in <em>Shore, </em>\u201conce a valid assignment is made, the assignor cannot cancel or modify the completed assignment by unilateral action without the assent of the assignee, nor may he defeat or impair the rights of the assignee in any other way [citations].\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Shore, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.3d at p. 296.) Consequently, it is appropriate for the subject injunction to preclude appellants\u2019 acceptance of assignments without first securing an affidavit from the district attorney\u2019s office that there are no monies owing to the county or a release from the county\u2019s family support division in full and complete satisfaction of unreimbursed expense on account of past assistance. Once the county\u2019s claim is satisfied, the custodial parent is free to make any assignments deemed desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Appellants argue that its clients come from all over the United States and there is no way for the County of Santa Clara to know which persons received assistance since there is no central registry of welfare recipients. This objection has no merit. The instant injunction merely requires an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>affidavit that there are no monies owing Santa Clara County. This information is certainly available to the district attorney from the Santa Clara Family Support Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Child Support Subsequent to September 20, 1975</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Appellants next address the problem of post-1975 cases.  They contend that the court erred in enjoining Support, Inc. from collecting past due installments in the situation where the custodial parent received AFDC subsequent to September 20, 1975, but is currently off AFDC and additional installments are past due since going off AFDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Appellants are correct that, after welfare assistance has terminated, the state may only continue to collect support payments from the absent parent for three months without special authorization from the custodial parent (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 11476; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(c)).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, \u201cWhen a family ceases receiving assistance .. . the assignment of support rights . . . terminates, except with respect to the amount of any unpaid support obligation that has accrued under such assignment.\u201d (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.5 l(f).)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>As noted above, <em>Shore </em>prohibits the former AFDC recipient from impairing the rights of the assignee in any way. If, as appellants argue, the custodial parent is permitted to collect first on the assets of the noncustodial parent, the remaining assets could be insufficient to satisfy the county\u2019s claim and the county\u2019s rights substantially impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The issue where subsequent to September 20, 1975, there was receipt of AFDC but there is no aid currently being given and past due support is greater than the AFDC given was raised and answered in <em>Shore. </em>We held that such arrearages were assigned in full to the county and that the assignment remained in effect after the family went off aid, until the county is reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Similarly, the issue of whether past due installments due from months when the child was not receiving welfare benefits are assigned to the county was determined in <em>Shore. </em> The county has the exclusive right to collect in welfare cases (see also <em>In re Marriage of Simmons </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 205 <em>[139 </em>Cal.Rptr. 832]).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Spousal Support</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Appellants argue that the court erred in precluding collection of spousal support arrearages by Support, Inc., since Department of Benefit Payments regulations do not require the collection of spousal support. Thus, where the county does not collect spousal support, the custodial parent is left with no recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">While it is true that state law does not mandate the county\u2019s collection of spousal support, it is also true that both before and after September 20, 1975, support rights were subrogated or assigned to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>county. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 248; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(26)(A); <em>In re Marriage of Shore, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.3d 290.) At its own option, the county may collect spousal support as well as child support. Should the county elect not to collect spousal support, a release can be given as soon as reimbursement from child support is obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">We next consider whether the district attorney could properly bring an action for injunction. As we stated in <em>Shore, </em>\u201cthe enforcement of the support rights owed to the needy children or the parent receiving AFDC aid is, as a matter of statute, entrusted to the district attorney who proceeds on behalf of the county.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 301.)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Finally, appellants contend that the trial court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction. They assert that this is a doubtful case, that there is no showing that other remedies are inadequate or that irreparable harm would result; that the injunction is injurious to third parties; that there is no multiplicity of suits; and that the injunction forbids activity which <em>Shore </em>permits\u2014namely, the collection of arrearages accruing after the family ceases receiving aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The granting or denial of a preliminary injunction is in the discretion of the trial court, such discretion being abused only where it exceeds the bounds of reason or contravenes the uncontradicted evidence. (Con<em>tinental Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Katz </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 512, 527 [67 Cal.Rptr. 761, 439 P.2d 889].) A review of the record in this case provides a substantial basis for the court\u2019s findings and supports the issuance of an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">First, and most importantly, this is not a doubtful case. An explicit statutoiy scheme clearly establishes the rights and duties of the county in the collection process. Second, the trial court found, that, on balancing the equities, \u201cthe potential irreparable injury to plaintiff herein is of greater magnitude and of more grave consequence warranting interim relief than any injuiy likely to result to defendant by the granting of such relief.\u201d In reaching its conclusion of irreparable injury, the court pointed out that under the comprehensive federal scheme each state must conform to the federal statute and regulations and that failure to conform could place receipt of federal funds in jeopardy. Permitting defendants to collect on a contingent fee basis would effectively preclude reimbursement of the federal share. Obviously, this would result in great and nearly incalculable injury from immediate loss of federal incentive funds and</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>possible future sanctions for which compensation in d\u00e1mages would be entirely inadequate. Third, the assertion that third parties would be better represented by Support, Inc. than by the District Attorney of Santa Clara may veiy well be true in certain instances. However, section 11475.2<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of the Welfare and Institutions Code specifies the legal steps available if the public agency fails to comply with the state plan securing child support. Fourth, it is clear that, absent an injunction, the county will be involved in a multiplicity of individual actions litigating the same issue, as it was required to do in the <em>Shore </em>case. Finally, as we discussed above, <em>Shore </em>did not hold that subsequent to receiving benefits an AFDC recipient may impair the subrogated rights of the county. Consequently, we find no abuse of discretion in issuing the subject injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">However, the trial court should consider at its hearing on the permanent injunction whether or not the present language in the preliminary injunction is the most effective way of protecting the rights of all parties. We are concerned about the situation where the proposed assignor (1) is currently not receiving public assistance aid from the County of Santa Clara (2) has received public assistance aid from the county in the past for which the county has not been reimbursed, and (3) desires to assign only support rights that have accrued since the assignor stopped receiving public assistance aid. In such a situation it would seem appropriate that the appellant may take an assignment of such support rights or attempt to collect same with or without an assignment provided that he first execute an agreement with the county that out of any funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>he may collect the county shall first be reimbursed for any amounts owing to it prior to distribution of such funds. Or, in the alternative, the appellant shall execute an agreement that the county shall have a lien on the funds collected to the extent that there are funds owing to it for assistance rendered in the past for which it has not been reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">In light of the foregoing conclusion, it is not necessary to determine whether the ruling of the trial court should also be sustained on the additional ground that the assignment of child and spousal support payments for collection on a contingency fee basis is void as against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Santa Clara County\u2019s Demurrer to the Cross-complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">We find that the trial court\u2019s order striking the cross-complaint and sustaining the demurrer of the county cross-defendant are not properly before this court, since they are nonappealable orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The right to appeal is wholly statutory and governed by sections 904 and 904.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. An order sustaining a demurrer does not come within these statutes. <em>(Parenti </em>v. <em>Lifeline Blood Bank </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 331, 334 [122 Cal.Rptr. 709]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clausen </em>(1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 770, 776 [57 Cal.Rptr. 227].)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">California follows the \u201cone judgment rule.\u201d Under that rule, a cross-complaint is not sufficiently independent to allow a separate judgment to be entered upon it unless the judgment on the cross-complaint may be considered a final judgment as to a specific party. <em>(Lemaire </em>v. <em>All City Employees Assn. </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 106 [110 Cal.Rptr. 507].)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Plaintiff in the underlying complaint is the County of Santa Clara. In the cross-complaint the three specific county agencies named as cross-defendants submitted the demurrer and motion to strike to the court. These three agencies all come within the party plaintiff \u201cCounty of Santa Clara\u201d in the underlying action and any decision of the court would be binding on the specific agencies and departments of the county. Since there are no different, independent parties subject to the order entered on April 4, 1977, the order is not a final judgment and is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>California State Department of Benefit Payments Demurrer</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The cross-complaint filed by Support, Inc. also included the State Department of Benefit Payments. Appellants contend that the court erred in granting the demurrer with respect to the right of a. former welfare recipient to a fair hearing before the Department of Benefit Payments. They assert that the \u201cfinding\u201d of an insubstantial violation on a demurrer is hardly proper, since the right of a person to have a fair hearing relative to amounts subrogated or assigned affects the rights of all former welfare recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Respondent argues that under section 10950 of the Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the right to a fair hearing is limited to action by the county welfare department. Under the IV-D plan in California, the district attorney has the responsibility of collecting child support arrearages. Accordingly, the district attorney must obtain an accounting from the welfare department in order to determine the amount of reimbursement due to the county. However, merely providing an accounting of actual welfare expenditures to the district attorney cannot reasonably be said to be an \u201caction of the county welfare department relating to his application for or receipt of aid,\u201d which establishes a right to the fair hearing described in section <em>10950. </em>In addition, it is clear that section 10950 is applicable only to applicants or recipients of aid\u2014not former recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The general issues of notice of the amount of reimbursement claimed and what procedures would be appropriate between the district attorney</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>and Support, Inc. to resolve disputes as to the amount of reimbursement are before the court in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Consequently, we find that the demurrer was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Accordingly, all of the orders made by the trial court are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Taylor, P. J., and Kane, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 22, 1979, and appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 29, 1979.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b588-13\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The fee was 50 percent of arrearages collected and 5 percent of current support.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-13\">No further reference to this motion to dismiss appears in the clerk\u2019s transcript, but apparently it was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b590-14\">The injunction continued the terms of the temporary restraining order issued on October 22, 1976, and ordered to remain in effect pending decision on the injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The injunction was subsequently modified by stipulation to provide for payments of the current month\u2019s support from any money collected within that month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b591-10\">The cross-complaint against Joseph Califano was dismissed by appellants because the United States did not consent to being sued in state court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Section 248 stated: \u201cThe obligee may enforce his right of support against the obligor and the county may proceed on behalf of the obligee to enforce his right of support against the obligor.
