The first is whether larceny from the person is a \u201cspecified felony\u201d for the purposes of MCL 750.224f(6)(i), thus subjecting defendant to more stringent requirements in order to regain his right to possess a firearm. We conclude that larceny from the person involves a substantial risk that force will be used during its commission and, therefore, hold that it is a specified felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The second issue is whether the prosecution is always required to show that a person convicted of a specified felony has not had his or her right to possess a firearm restored pursuant to MCL 750.224(2)(b), or whether the prosecution\u2019s burden to disprove restoration only arises if the defendant first introduces evidence that the defendant\u2019s right to possess a firearm has been restored. We conclude, on the basis of MCL 776.20 and <em>People v Henderson, </em>391 Mich 612, 616; 218 NW2d 2 (1974), that the defendant has the burden of producing evidence to establish that his or her right to possess a firearm has been restored. Once the defendant meets this burden of production, the prosecution bears the burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>doubt. In this case, defendant failed to produce evidence that his firearm rights were restored, and the prosecution thus was not required to prove the lack of restoration. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In 1977, defendant David M. Perkins was convicted of the felony offense of larceny from the person in violation of MCL 750.357. In 2001, Perkins was involved in an altercation where he pointed a gun at another person, and, in the subsequent struggle, the gun discharged. As a result, Perkins was charged with, among other things,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> being a felon in possession of a firearm (felon in possession) in violation of MCL 750.224f(2). This statute makes it a crime for a person who has been convicted of a \u201cspecified felony\u201d \u2014 one that either involves a substantial risk of, or contains as an element the threatened, attempted, or actual use of, physical force against a person or property \u2014 to possess a firearm until that person has had the right to possess a firearm restored pursuant to MCL 28.424 and fulfilled certain other requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The trial court, after a bench trial, concluded that the 1977 conviction for larceny from the person was a specified felony and, thus, MCL 750.224f(2) could apply to Perkins. Moreover, the court construed the statute as requiring the prosecution to prove that Perkins\u2019s right to possess a firearm had not been restored only if Perkins first affirmatively produced evidence that his right to possess had been restored by a proper concealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>weapons licensing board. Therefore, the trial court convicted Perkins of the offense because he had not produced any such evidence, thus relieving the prosecution of the burden of proving that Perkins\u2019s right to possession had not been restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It concluded that larceny from the person constitutes a specified felony within the meaning of MCL 750.224f, and that a defendant must present evidence of a claimed restoration of the right to possess a firearm before the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving a lack of restoration arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">This case involves issues of statutory construction. These are issues of law that we review de novo. <em>People v Koonce, </em>466 Mich 515, 518; 648 NW2d 153 (2002). When interpreting statutes, our goal is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature by reviewing the plain language of the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">III. LARCENY FROM THE PERSON IS A \u201cSPECIFIED FELONY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">MCL 750.2241<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> places felons in two different categories. The first category consists of persons convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>a \u201cfelony.\u201d These persons regain their right to possess a firearm three years after paying all fines imposed for their violations, serving all jail time imposed, and successfully completing all conditions of parole or probation. MCL 750.224f(l). The second category consists of persons convicted of a \u201cspecified felony.\u201d These persons must wait five years after completing the same requirements and, moreover, must have their right to possess a firearm restored. MCL 750.224f(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The term \u201cspecified felony\u201d is defined in MCL 750.224f(6), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">As used in subsection (2), \u201cspecified felony\u201d means a felony in which 1 or more of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">(i) An element of that felony is the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>property of another, or that <em>by its nature, </em>involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\"><em>(ii) </em>An element of that felony is the unlawful manufacture, possession, importation, exportation, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\"><em>(Hi) </em>An element of that felony is the unlawful possession or distribution of a firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\"><em>(iv) </em>An element of that felony is the unlawful use of an explosive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\"><em>(v) </em>The felony is burglary of an occupied dwelling, or breaking and entering an occupied dwelling, or arson. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">The prosecution in this case has neither alleged that an element of larceny from the person is \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,\u201d MCL 750.224f(6)(i), nor that any of the criteria in subsections <em>ii </em>through <em>v </em>apply in this case. Therefore, the inquiry is whether larceny from the person is a crime that \u201cby its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">The crime of larceny from the person consists of a larceny effectuated by \u201cstealing from the person of another.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant acknowledges that there is a risk of force inherent in the crime of larceny from the person because of the potential for the victim to notice the taking of his or her personal property and use force to prevent it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, he claims that such a risk is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>substantial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">\u201cSubstantial\u201d is defined as \u201cof ample or considerable amount, quantity, size, etc.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1995). Therefore, the issue is whether larceny from the person by its nature involves a substantial or considerable risk that physical force will be used. We believe that it does. In order to commit a larceny from the person, the defendant must steal something from a person in that person\u2019s presence. That is, the victim must be present when the defendant steals something from the victim. Unless the victim submits to the theft or does not notice the theft, physical force will almost certainly be used in response.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">[T]he offense of larceny from a person is separated from other larceny offenses because it is committed in the immediate presence of another person. The \u201cLegislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>decided that larceny from a person presents a social problem separate and apart from simple larceny.\u201d Specifically, \u201cthe invasion of the person or immediate presence of the victim.\u201d Because a person whose property is stolen from his presence may take steps to retain possession, and the offender may react violently, we conclude that the offense of larceny from a person, <em>\u201cby its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense. \u201d </em>We therefore hold that larceny from a person is a specified felony within the meaning of MCL 750.224f. <em>{Perkins, supra </em>at 272 (citations omitted; emphasis in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">That the Legislature has recognized that larceny from the person involves a substantial risk of physical force is demonstrated by the different punishments that it has chosen to impose for larceny<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and larceny from the person. If a defendant<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> steals property from another outside the person\u2019s presence and the property is worth less than $1,000, the defendant is only guilty of a misdemeanor. MCL 750.356(4)(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the property is worth less than $200, the defendant cannot be imprisoned for more than ninety-three days. MCL 750.356(5).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On the other hand, if the same defendant steals the same property directly from the person, the defendant can be imprisoned for ten years. A defendant who steals property from a person outside the person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>presence can only face a ten-year sentence if the property is worth $20,000 or more. MCL 750.356(2)(a). That the Legislature has chosen to subject a defendant who steals property from a person in that person\u2019s presence to a ten-year sentence, regardless of the value of the property, and has chosen to subject a defendant who steals property worth less than $200 from a person outside that person\u2019s presence to a ninety-three-day sentence demonstrates that the Legislature recognized the substantial risk of force that is involved when one steals something from somebody\u2019s person, a risk that is absent when one steals something outside the person\u2019s presence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Therefore, we hold that larceny from the person is a \u201cspecified felony\u201d under MCL 750.224f(6)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">IV THE DEFENDANT BEARS THE BURDEN OF PRODUCING EVIDENCE THAT THE DEFENDANT\u2019S FIREARM RIGHTS HAVE BEEN RESTORED</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Subsection 2 of the felon-in-possession statute prohibits a person convicted of a specified felony from possessing a firearm \u201cuntil\u201d certain conditions are satisfied. MCL 750.224f(2). One of the conditions set forth in the statute is that the defendant\u2019s right to possess a firearm must have been legally restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">MCL 750.224f(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">A person convicted of a specified felony shall not possess, use, transport, sell, purchase, carry, ship, receive, or distribute a firearm in this state <em>until all of the following circumstances exist-.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>(a) The expiration of 5 years after all of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-4\">(i) The person has paid all fines imposed for the violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">(ii) The person has served all terms of imprisonment imposed for the violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\"><em>(Hi) </em>The person has successfully completed all conditions of probation or parole imposed for the violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">(b) The person\u2019s right to possess, use, transport, sell, purchase, carry, ship, receive, or distribute a firearm has been restored pursuant to section 4 of Act No. 372 of the Public Acts of 1927, being section 28.424 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Thus, the statute provides that a person convicted of a specified felony may not possess a firearm \u201cuntil\u201d all the listed circumstances exist. Specifically, the felon may not possess a firearm \u201cuntil\u201d (1) five years have expired from the payment of all fines, the service of all terms of imprisonment, and the successful completion of all conditions of probation or parole, and (2) the person\u2019s right to possess a firearm has been restored. In this case, as noted in our discussion of the first issue, the prosecution established that the defendant was convicted of a specified felony and that he possessed a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">The question remains, however, whether the prosecution must prove that the defendant\u2019s possession of the firearm occurred before the restoration of firearm rights where, as here, the defendant produced no evidence that his firearm rights had been restored. In answering this question, we must consider MCL 776.20, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">In any prosecution for the violation of any acts of the. state relative to use, licensing and possession of pistols or firearms, the burden of establishing any exception, excuse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>proviso or exemption contained in any such act shall be upon the defendant but this does not shift the burden of proof for the violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">It appears that the Legislature enacted this statute in response to <em>People v Schrader, </em>10 Mich App 211, 217; 159 NW2d 147 (1968). <em>In People v Jiminez, </em>27 Mich App 633, 635; 183 NW2d 853 (1970), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">Prior to 1968, we would have given serious consideration to such an objection. <em>People v Schrader </em>(1968), 10 Mich App 211. However, in that year, the legislature took notice of our decisions holding that it was the burden of the prosecutor to prove that the defendant did not come within a statutory exception. The legislature responded by enacting a law [MCL 776.20] which held that, in trials for carrying concealed weapons, the burden is on the defendant to show that he comes within one of the exemptions.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The broad language used in MCL 776.20 plainly extends to the felon-in-possession statute, MCL 750.224\u00cd, because it is a statute regarding the use, licensing, and possession of firearms. We must therefore give effect to the plain language of MCL 776.20 requiring the defendant to establish \u201cany\u201d exception, excuse, proviso, or exemption contained in any statute \u201crelative to use, licensing and possession\u201d of firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">In applying the text of MCL 776.20, we adhere to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Court\u2019s interpretation in <em>Henderson. </em>In <em>Henderson, </em>this Court considered the effect of MCL 776.20 in a prosecution for carrying a pistol in a motor vehicle in violation of MCL 750.227. The issue was whether the prosecution or the defendant bore the burden of establishing whether the defendant had a license to carry a pistol. After considering the text of MCL 776.20, this Court concluded that the defendant bore the burden of <em>producing </em>evidence regarding licensure, while the prosecution bore the ultimate burden of persuasion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Specifically, the <em>Henderson </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">Accordingly, we hold that upon a showing that a defendant has carried a pistol in a vehicle operated or occupied by him, [a] prima facie case of violation of the statute has been made out. Upon the establishment of such a prima facie case, <em>the defendant has the burden of injecting the issue of license by offering some proof-not necessarily by official record </em>\u2014 that <em>he has been so licensed. </em>The people thereupon are obliged to establish the contrary beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>[Henderson, supra </em>at 616 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The interpretation set forth in <em>Henderson </em>accords with the well-established principle that \u201c[c]ourts must give effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a statute, and must avoid an interpretation that would render any part of the statute surplusage or nugatory.\u201d <em>Koontz v Ameritech Services, Inc, </em>466 Mich 304, 312; 645 NW2d 34 (2002). The <em>Henderson </em>Court gave effect to the entirety of MCL 776.20. By recognizing that the defendant bore the burden of producing or going forward with evidence that he was licensed, the <em>Henderson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Court gave effect to the statutory phrase \u201cthe burden of establishing any exception, excuse, proviso or exemption contained in any such act shall be upon the defendant...And by concluding that the prosecution bore the ultimate burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt, the <em>Henderson </em>Court avoided rendering nugatory the phrase \u201cbut this does not shift the burden of proof for the violation.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">We thus adhere to the framework established in <em>Henderson. </em>Like the firearms offense considered in <em>Henderson, </em>the offense of felon in possession falls within the strictures of MCL 776.20 requiring the defendant to establish \u201cany exception, excuse, proviso or exemption ....\u201d We may consult dictionary definitions of terms that are not defined in a statute. <em>Koontz, supra </em>at 312. The dictionary definition of the term \u201cproviso\u201d is instructive. A \u201cproviso\u201d is \u201can article or clause that introduces a condition: stipulation.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary </em>(1967). MCL 750.224f(2) contains a clause that introduces conditions that must be met before a person convicted of a specified felony may possess a firearm. Specifically, the five-year period from the specified events described in the statute must have expired, and the felon\u2019s firearm rights must have been restored. Until those conditions are satisfied, the felon may not possess a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">We conclude that the felon-in-possession statute contains a proviso. Thus, we are bound to follow the plain language of MCL 776.20 and the analytic approach established in <em>Henderson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Defendant here produced no evidence to establish that his right to possess a firearm had been restored. Because defendant failed to meet his burden of production, the prosecution was not required to prove the lack of restoration of firearm rights beyond a reasonable doubt. MCL 776.20; <em>Henderson, supra </em>at 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">We conclude that larceny from the person is a crime that carries a substantial risk that physical force will be used or threatened against another. Therefore, we agree with the Court of Appeals that it qualifies as a specified felony under MCL 750.224f(6)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Also, a defendant bears the burden of producing evidence to establish that his or her right to possess a firearm has been restored, in light of MCL 776.20 and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Henderson. </em>Because defendant failed to meet his burden of production in this case, the prosecution was not required to prove the lack of restoration of firearm rights beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b734-8\">Taylor, C.J., and Weaver, Corrigan, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-8\"> Although we mention only possession in this opinion, MCL 750.224\u00cd does not pertain only to the possession of firearms, but also to the use, transportation, sale, purchase, carrying, shipping, receiving, or distribution of firearms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\"> Defendant was also charged with felonious assault in violation of MCL 750.82, and possession of a firearm while committing or attempting to commit a felony in violation of MCL 750.227b.

However, Justice Cavanagh fails fully to appreciate that not all felonies require the defendant to steal something from the victim\u2019s presence. Because a defendant must steal something from the victim\u2019s presence in order to commit a larceny from the person, a larceny from the person does not just pose <em>a </em>risk of force, it poses a <em>substantial </em>risk of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">Justice Cavanagh also contends that, if detected, a perpetrator could \u201cchoose to avoid confrontation if it becomes apparent that force or the threat of force must be used to complete the intended act.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 665. However, if the perpetrator chooses to abandon the attempt to steal the property from the victim once detected, the perpetrator has not committed a larceny from the person. In order to commit a larceny from the person, the perpetrator would, in all likelihood, have to use force or the threat of force to steal the property from the victim. Therefore, a larceny from the person involves more than a \u201cmere <em>potential\u201d </em>of force or threat of force; <em>post </em>at 665, rather, it involves a \u201csubstantial\u201d risk of force or threat of force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b728-5\"> A larceny is committed when one steals the property of another outside the person\u2019s presence.

The Legislature has the authority to change the law if it wishes, and this is what it did by enacting MCL 776.20. After its enactment, MCL 776.20 was controlling. Moreover, contrary to Justice Kelly\u2019s statements, MCL 776.20 never altered MCL 750.224f because it predated it. This fact also undercuts Justice Kelly\u2019s rule of lenity and due process arguments because, when enacted, MCL 750.224\u00cd had to be read as fitting into the legal context already created by MCL 776.20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b732-7\"> Justice Kelly asserts that <em>Henderson </em>\u201ccannot be correct\u201d because it would mean that there are only two, not three, elements to the crime of carrying a concealed weapon in a vehicle. <em>Post </em>at 656.

UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Defendant was arrested after a dispute involving a firearm. He was charged with felonious assault,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> felon in possession,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and possession of a firearm when committing or attempting to commit a felony (felony-firearm).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The court acquitted him of the assault charge, concluding that, at the time of the offense, he was too intoxicated to formulate the intent necessary for the crime. Defendant stipulated that he had been convicted in 1977 of larceny from a person. MCL 750.357. The court convicted him of the two firearm charges. It ruled that defendant\u2019s admissions of the 1977 felony conviction and of possessing a firearm provided sufficient evidence to convict him of the offense of felon in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court\u2019s rulings stating: \u201cThe prosecutor must prove that the defendant\u2019s right to possess a firearm has not been restored only if the defendant produces some evidence that his right has been restored.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271. It also concluded that larceny from a person constitutes a specified felony within the meaning of MCL 750.224f.

FELONIES AND SPECIFIED FELONIES</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Both questions before this Court involve issues of statutory construction. Hence, we review them de novo. <em>People v Kimble, </em>470 Mich 305, 308-309; 684 NW2d 669 (2004). The first question is whether larceny from a person is a specified felony under the felon-in-possession statute. MCL 750.224f.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">The statute divides felonies into two types, \u201cfelonies\u201d and \u201cspecified felonies.\u201d A person convicted of a \u201cfelony\u201d cam legally possess a firearm three years after (a) completing all terms of imprisonment imposed for the violation, (b) paying all fines imposed for the violation, and (c) completing all conditions of probation or parole. MCL 750.224f(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>A person convicted of a \u201cspecified felony\u201d must satisfy the same requirements and must obtain restoration of the right to possess a firearm pursuant to MCL 28.424. Also, the person must wait five years after completion of the statutory requirements, as compared to three years for other felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The Legislature defines \u201cspecified felony\u201d in MCL 750.224f(6). It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">As used in subsection (2), \u201cspecified felony\u201d means a felony in which 1 or more of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">(i) An element of that felony is the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or that <em>by its nature, </em>involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\"><em>(if) </em>An element of that felony is the unlawful manufacture, possession, importation, exportation, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\"><em>(Hi) </em>An element of that felony is the unlawful possession or distribution of a firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">. <em>(iv) </em>An element of that felony is the unlawful use of an explosive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-11\"><em>(v) </em>The felony is burglary of an occupied dwelling, or breaking and entering an occupied dwelling, or arson. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">All parties agree that subsections <em>ii </em>through <em>v </em>do not apply to this case. Therefore, to constitute a specified felony, defendant\u2019s 1977 conviction of larceny from a person must fall within the definition in subsection i.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">The use, attempted use, and threatened use of force are not elements of larceny from a person. In fact, the absence of force and the absence of the threat of force are what distinguish larceny from a person from rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>bery. <em>People v Randolph, </em>466 Mich 532, 544; 648 NW2d 164 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">But subsection <em>i </em>includes more crimes than just those in which force is an element. It includes crimes that, by their nature, involve a substantial risk of the use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">III. A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF FORCE</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">In this case, defense counsel conceded at oral argument that larceny from a person involves a risk that force will be used. However, he asserted that the risk is not \u201csubstantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">\u201cSubstantial\u201d is defined as \u201cof ample or considerable amount, quantity, size, etc.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001). The question becomes whether, during the commission of a larceny from a person, there is an \u201cample or considerable amount\u201d of risk that force will be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">The statute prohibiting larceny from a person provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-10\">Any person who shall commit the offense of larceny by stealing <em>from the person </em>of another shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison not more than 10 years. [MCL 750.357 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">Hence, larceny from a person requires direct contact with the victim. The perpetrator must take personal property from the victim while it is in the victim\u2019s possession. This increases the risk that force will be used. A perpetrator is obliged to use force or threaten the use of force to obtain the property unless the victim willingly submits to or remains ignorant of the theft.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Larceny from a person quickly evolves into robbery when force is employed to complete the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Physical force may be used during the commission of many felonies, especially if the perpetrator is caught in the act. However, the risk that force will be used during a larceny from a person is considerably greater than the risk of force in many other felonies. This is because the crime, by its nature, is often confrontational and always involves the presence of the victim. Its perpetration requires either direct contact with or the actual presence of the victim. Also, the risk of detection is heightened. With an ample risk of confrontation and detection comes an ample risk of the use or threatened use of force to complete the crime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, larceny from a person involves a \u201csubstantial\u201d risk of the use or threat of physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Additionally, the very structure of the larceny statute, when compared with the larceny-from-a-person statute, supports a conclusion that the Legislature recognized that larceny from a person involves a substantial risk that force will be used. The general larceny statute<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> allocates punishment according to the value of the property taken. For example, if the property is valued at from $200 to $1,000, the thief is guilty of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>misdemeanor punishable by as much as one year in jail, a $2,000 fine, or both. MCL 750.356(4). But if it has a value of from $1,000 to $20,000, the crime is a felony punishable by as much as five years\u2019 imprisonment, a $10,000 fine, or both. MCL 750.356(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">This contrasts with larceny from a person, which abandons a gradation of punishment. The defendant is subject to a possible ten years in prison without regard to the value of the property stolen. MCL 750.357.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The only difference between the crimes of larceny and larceny from a person is the presence of the victim. Without question, the possibility of harm to the victim is greater if the property is taken from his person. Consequently, it appears that the threat to the victim was of greater concern to the Legislature than the loss of the property, and hence, it provided a greater penalty for larceny from a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">The magnitude of the difference in penalties demonstrates just how seriously the Legislature viewed the risk of force against the victim of a larceny from a person. If the value of the property taken in a normal larceny is less than $200, the defendant is subject to no more than ninety-three days in jail. But, if the defendant takes that same property directly from a person, he is guilty of a felony and subject to potentially ten years in prison. MCL 750.356(5); MCL 750.357.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">The only logical reason for the great difference in penalties is that a significant danger exists that force will be used, injuring the victim of a larceny from a person. Therefore, the Legislature viewed that crime as involving a substantial risk that physical force will be employed against another. This qualifies it as a specified felony under MCL 750.224f(6)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>IV RESTORATION OF RIGHTS IS AN ELEMENT OF MCL 750.224f(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">A. THE LANGUAGE AND STRUCTURE OF MCL 750.224f(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Section 2 of the felon-in-possession statute indicates the circumstances under which a person convicted of a specified felony may possess a firearm. MCL 750.224f(2). One of the requirements contained in that statute is that the defendant must have had his right to possess a firearm legally restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">But in this case, the prosecution argues that it need not show that restoration has not occurred in order to establish the elements of the crime. Rather, it asserts that it is defendant who bears that burden. Neither the language nor the structure of the statute supports the prosecution\u2019s contention.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APeq\">MCL 750.224f(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">A person convicted of a specified felony shall not possess, use, transport, sell, purchase, carry, ship, receive, or distribute a firearm in this state <em>until all of the following circumstances exist:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">(a) The expiration of 5 years after all of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">(i) The person has paid all fines imposed for the violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>(ii) The person has served all terms of imprisonment imposed for the violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\"><em>(Hi) </em>The person has successfully completed all conditions of probation or parole imposed for the violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">(b) The person\u2019s right to possess, use, transport, sell, purchase, carry, ship, receive, or distribute a firearm has been restored pursuant to section 4 of Act No. 372 of the Public Acts of 1927, being section 28.424 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">In interpreting MCL 750.224f(2), our goal is to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>People v Koonce, </em>466 Mich 515, 518; 648 NW2d 153 (2002). We start with the language of the statute itself. The language of MCL 750.224f(2) demonstrates a clear intent to include among the prosecution\u2019s proofs a showing that the right to possess a firearm was not restored to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">B. CREATION OF AN EXCEPTION BY USE OF THE TERM \u201cUNLESS\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">The Legislature has demonstrated that it knows how to create an exception, and it created one in subsection 4 of the very statute in question. MCL 750.224f(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\">This section does not apply to a conviction that has been expunged or set aside, or for which the person has been pardoned, <em>unless </em>the expunction, order, or pardon expressly provides that the person shall not possess a firearm. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">By using the term \u201cunless,\u201d it demonstrated its intent to create an exception.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cUnless\u201d is an exclusionary term. By contrast, in subsection 2 of the felon-in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>possession statute, the Legislature chose not to use an exclusionary term. Instead, it used the phrase \u201cuntil all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Looking at the definition of \u201cuntil\u201d helps demonstrate that \u201cuntil all\u201d is an inclusive phrase. The definition is \u201c1. up to the time that or when; till. 2. before... 3. onward to or till....\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001). Applying this definition to the statute, the defendant is guilty of the offense of felon in possession only if he (1) was convicted of a specified offense and (2) possessed a firearm \u201cbefore\u201d (a) the passage of five years from the time he paid all pertinent fines, or he served his term, or he successfully completed all conditions of probation or parole, or (b) his right to possess a firearm was not restored. MCL 750.224f(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Therefore, to prove the crime, the prosecution must demonstrate that the possession occurred \u201cbefore\u201d one of the specified events. If the prosecution fails to prove this, it has not met the burden created by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The result would be quite different had the Legislature chosen to use an exclusionary term like \u201cunless.\u201d \u201cUnless\u201d is defined as \u201c1. except under the circumstances that... 2. except; but; save[.]\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Substituting this word into the statute would change the statute\u2019s meaning, so that the prosecution would need to prove only that the defendant (1) had been convicted of a specified offense and (2) possessed a firearm. The defendant would be left to produce evidence that, more than five years before, he had (1) paid all pertinent fines, (2) served his term, (3) successfully completed all conditions of probation and parole, and that (4) he currently had the right to possess the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Hence, the difference in the burden of production on the prosecution and on the defense is enormous depending on whether \u201cuntil\u201d introduces an element or an exception. Accordingly, we should assume that the decision to use \u201cuntil\u201d rather than \u201cunless\u201d was carefully made.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">We presuppose that the words the Legislature uses have a purpose. And we should not speculate that it inadvertently used one word or phrase when it intended another. The chosen wording is presumed intentional. <em>Detroit v Redford Twp, </em>253 Mich 453, 456; 235 NW 217 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">When writing this statute, the Legislature demonstrated a clear knowledge of how to create an exception, but it chose not to do so. Its use of the term \u201cuntil\u201d is a strong indication that it intended the restoration of rights to be a contingent element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Because the Legislature chose to use the term \u201cuntil,\u201d the prosecution bears the burden of production for MCL 750.224f(2). Here the prosecution failed to present any evidence that defendant\u2019s right to possess a firearm had not been restored. And it made no effort to show that any of the three other factual circumstances listed in MCL 750.224f(2) had not occurred. Hence, it did not satisfy its burden, and defendant\u2019s convictions were in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">C. MCL 776.20</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">The majority asserts that MCL 776.20 controls this case and holds that it requires that defendant bear the burden of production regarding the restoration of the right to possess a firearm. MCL 776.20 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">In any prosecution for the violation of any acts of the state relative to use, licensing and possession of pistols or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>firearms, the burden of establishing any exception, excuse, proviso or exemption contained in any such act shall be upon the defendant but this does not shift the burden of proof for the violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">MCL 776.20 comes into play only after the prosecution proves all the elements of a crime. Therefore, for the majority\u2019s argument to have merit, I would have to accept the conclusion that MCL 750.224f(2)(b) is an exception. As discussed above, this conclusion is implausible given the language and structure chosen by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">I find MCL 776.20 inapplicable to this case. I believe that, if the Legislature had intended MCL 776.20 to apply, it specifically would have used a term contained in that statute. Alternatively, it would have used its often repeated term \u201cuntil,\u201d or a similarly clear expression, to create an exception or a proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The words \u201c exception,[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] excuse,[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] proviso[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] or exemption[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]\u201d in MCL 776.20 apply to situations where all the elements of a crime have been established. Once the prosecution has satisfied all the elements, it is for the defendant to produce evidence showing the existence of a circumstance excusing him from culpability.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>An example of a situation in which MCL 776.20 would apply can be seen in MCL 750.224f(4): \u201cThis section does not apply to a conviction that has been expunged or set aside, or for which the person has been pardoned . . . .\u201d This subsection creates an exception to the felon-in-possession crime. Under MCL 776.20, the defendant would have the burden of producing evidence to prove the exception.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In MCL 776.20, the Legislature demonstrated its ability to use the terms \u201cexception,\u201d \u201cexcuse,\u201d \u201cexception,\u201d and \u201cproviso.\u201d But in 750.224f(2), it used none of them. It could have stated in MCL 750.224f(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">A person convicted' of a specified felony shall not possess, use, transport, sell, purchase, carry, ship, receive, or distribute a firearm in this state <em>providing the following circumstances do not exist.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Or:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">A person convicted of a specified felony shall not possess, use, transport, sell, purchase, carry, ship, receive, or distribute a firearm in this state, <em>except when all of the following circumstances exist.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Or:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">A person convicted of a specified felony shall not possess, use, transport, sell, purchase, carry, ship, receive, or distribute a firearm in this state, <em>but the person is excused when the following circumstances exist.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Instead of any of these or other wordings, the Legislature chose to use \u201cuntil all.\u201d I believe this is a strong indication that it intended that MCL 776.20 should not apply to MCL 750.224f(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">In interpreting statutes, we are reluctant to assume that the Legislature wrote what it did by accident or error. But this is what the majority presumes in its holding today. I support giving effect to the Legislature\u2019s chosen phrasing rather than changing it to fit within MCL 776.20.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">The existence of MCL 776.20 does not alter what the prosecution has to prove in order to obtain a conviction for felon in possession. But reading MCL 750.224f(2)(b) as a proviso does shift the burden of production from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>what the Legislature intended, because it turns what is an element of the crime into a proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">D. <em>PEOPLE v PEGENAU</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The prosecution relies on <em>People v </em>Pegenau<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to support its argument. This reliance is misplaced. In <em>Pegenau, </em>the defendant was charged with unlawful possession of Xanax and Valium pursuant to MCL 333.7403(1).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>People v Pegenau, </em>447 Mich 278, 281; 523 NW2d 325 (1994). The only question at trial was whether the defendant had a valid prescription, which would exclude him from prosecution under the language of MCL 333.7403 and MCL 333.7531.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Pegenau, supra </em>at 282. This Court held that the burden of proof regarding the existence of a valid prescription was on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number><em>Pegenau </em>is distinguishable from the present case because MCL 333.7403 expressly uses a term creating an exception. In fact, MCL 333.7403 uses the term \u201cunless.\u201d As discussed above, \u201cunless\u201d is defined as \u201c1. except under the circumstances that... 2. except; but; save[.]\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001). Because an exception is specifically created, the defendant bears the burden of production under MCL 333.7531.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">In contrast, MCL 750.224f(2) does not provide an exception or exemption to felon-in-possession prosecutions. The Legislature did not use a term that would create an exception. It used the inclusive phrase \u201cuntil all.\u201d Therefore, the subsections are elements of the crime rather than exceptions, and MCL 776.20 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\"><em>Pegenau </em>is inapplicable and is in clear contrast to this case. Therefore, I find it of no support to the prosecution\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">E. <em>PEOPLE v HENDERSON</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The majority finds <em>People v </em>Henderson<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> persuasive on the issue whether restoration of the right to possess a firearm is an element of felon in possession. I believe that this decision does not aid the majority\u2019s position.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, I find that <em>Henderson </em>was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>Henderson </em>dealt with MCL 750.227, which, at that time, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\">Any person who shall carry a dagger, dirk, stiletto or other dangerous weapon except hunting knives adapted and carried as such, concealed on or about his person, or whether concealed or otherwise in any vehicle operated or occupied by him, except in his dwelling house or place of business or on other land possessed by him; and any person who shall carry a pistol concealed on or about his person, or, whether concealed or otherwise, in any vehicle operated or occupied by him, except in his dwelling house or place of business or on other land possessed by him, without a license to so carry said pistol as provided by law, shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years, or by fine of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The <em>Henderson </em>Court concluded that, as regards the facts of that case, the only elements of the crime were: (1) the defendant was carrying a pistol and (2) he was in a vehicle operated or occupied by him. It ruled that the language \u201cwithout a license to so carry said pistol\u201d did not add an element to the offense. <em>People v Henderson, </em>391 Mich 612, 616; 218 NW2d 2 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">This conclusion cannot be correct. If only two elements existed, the sole defenses available to a defendant would be (1) that he did not carry a pistol or (2) that he was not in a vehicle with it. Whether the defendant was licensed to carry that pistol would not matter. He would be guilty of the crime, even though licensed, because he (1) carried a pistol (2) in a vehicle. It is obvious that there is a third key element. It is found in the statute\u2019s language \u201cwithout a license.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>My interpretation is strengthened by the fact that, in writing MCL 750.227, the Legislature did not use any of the terms listed in MCL 776.20. The clause \u201cwithout a license\u201d is not prefaced by anything signaling or otherwise phrased to signal that it constitutes an exception, excuse, proviso, or exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Contrast this with the language \u201cexcept in his dwelling house or place of business or on other land possessed by him\u201d that is also contained in the statute. The Legislature knew how to create an exception, excuse, proviso, or exemption when it wrote MCL 750.227. And, in fact, it did so in that statute by explicitly using the term \u201cexcept.\u201d But it did not use any of those terms with respect to the lack of a license. Again, the Legislature\u2019s choice of wording should not be presumed accidental. <em>Redford Twp, supra </em>at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">To rule as it did, the <em>Henderson </em>Court had to read words into the statute. Specifically, it had to read in some form of exception, excuse, proviso, or exemption before the language \u201cwithout a license.\u201d But this violates the well-established rule of statutory construction that a court cannot read into a statute what is not there. <em>AFSCME v Detroit, </em>468 Mich 388, 412; 662 NW2d 695 (2003).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Therefore, the <em>Henderson </em>Court failed to construe the language actually chosen by the Legislature. Instead, it added language to change the burden of production. The majority today falls into the same trap. And in doing so, it violates its own repeatedly stated rule of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>E THE MAJORITY\u2019S PHILOSOPHICAL CONTRADICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The justices of the majority have departed from their own rules of statutory construction in construing MCL 750.224f(2). During this very court term, most of the same justices stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">Fundamental canons of statutory interpretation require us to discern and give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent as expressed by the language of its statutes. If such language is unambiguous, as most such [sic] language is, we presume that the Legislature intended the meaning clearly expressed \u2014 no further judicial construction is required or permitted, and the statute must be enforced as written. <em>[Garg v Macomb Co Community Mental Health Services, </em>472 Mich 263, 281; 696 NW2d 646 (2005) (citations and quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">There is no suggestion that the majority finds the language in MCL 750.224f(2) ambiguous. Hence, it violates its own rules of statutory interpretation when it relies on decisions in sister states to interpret the intent of the Michigan Legislature. Under the majority\u2019s judicial philosophy, reference to outside material is of no value in the face of a clear text.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Moreover, the citation of the annotation at 69 ALR3d 1054 adds nothing to the majority\u2019s analysis of the statute in this case. The decisions cited in the annotation are based on widely divergent statutory language in other states. Because that language is so different from the language of MCL 750.224f(2), conclusions in the annotation are of no assistance in determining what the Michigan Legislature intended when enacting our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Beyond this, at least some of the cases cited in the annotation demonstrate that a legislature can create an easily recognizable exception or proviso when it desires to do so. For example, the Pennsylvania statute pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>vides that no person shall carry a firearm in public \u201c <em>\u2018unless </em>... such person is licensed to carry a firearm!.] \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth v Bigelow, </em>250 Pa Super 330, 332; 378 A2d 961 (1977), quoting 18 Pa Consol Stat 6108 (emphasis added). Clearly the Michigan Legislature could have done what the Pennsylvania legislature did: it explicitly created an exemption.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Furthermore, even under the analysis offered by the majority, <em>Henderson </em>was wrongly decided. One thing the majority and I agree about in the instant case is that an exception, excuse, proviso, or exemption has to be clearly indicated by the language of the statute. In the statute before us, MCL 750.224f(2), the majority argues that the word \u201cuntil\u201d introduces a proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">\u2022 In contrast, the statute involved in <em>Henderson </em>contains nothing preceding the language \u201cwithout a license\u201d that could be argued to introduce an exemption, excuse, proviso, or exemption.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Therefore, I believe that, under the majority\u2019s analysis, <em>Henderson </em>must be found to have been wrongly decided. In addition, its reliance on <em>Henderson </em>contradicts the majority\u2019s analysis discussing exceptions, excuses, provisos, and exemptions. In the end, <em>Henderson </em>offers nothing supportive of the majority\u2019s construction of MCL 750.224f(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Again, the Legislature knows how to use the terms \u201cexception,\u201d \u201cexcuse,\u201d \u201cproviso,\u201d or \u201cexemption.\u201d And it knows how to create exceptions by the use of the term \u201cunless,\u201d as it has repeatedly done throughout the Penal Code. But the Legislature chose not to use <em>any </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>those terms in either MCL 750.224f(2) or MCL 750.227, the statute analyzed in <em>Henderson. </em>I would not turn a blind eye to those choices. Instead, I would enforce the statutes as the Legislature wrote them. In this case, it requires finding that the restoration of the right to possess a firearm is an element of the offense of felon in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">G. THE BURDEN PLACED ON THE PROSECUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The prosecution asserts that, if it must initially go forward with evidence that defendant\u2019s right to possess a firearm has not been restored, its burden of proof will be rendered too difficult. It argues that, to make this showing, it would have to obtain certificates showing no restoration of defendant\u2019s right to possess firearms from all eighty-three counties in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">I believe that this is a wildly exaggerated approach to the situation. Normally, to satisfy MCL 750.224f(2), the prosecution would have to show simply that five years had not passed since the defendant served his term or completed probation or paid his fines. Only if none of those situations existed would it become necessary to address whether the right to carry a firearm had been restored. And then, in almost every case, the prosecution could show that the defendant resided in one or two counties while eligible to have the right restored and that those counties had not restored the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">My reading of the statute requires more proofs from the prosecution then it would prefer. But the fact that it may find difficulty in proving a crime does not provide a reason for this Court to rewrite the law to change the Legislature\u2019s intent. I am satisfied that the language of the statute demonstrates that a showing of no restora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>tion of the right to possess a firearm is an element of the crime. Hence, the burdens of production and persuasion are on the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">H. THE RULE OF LENITY</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">A consistent textualist would have to admit that no language in MCL 750.224f(2) or MCL 750.227 creates an explicit exception, excuse, proviso, or exemption. At most, those statutes could be read to infer an exception or proviso by adding words to them. By finding an exception and a proviso, the majority violates its textualist philosophy. Its holding today seems to require that any time words can be added to a statute to form an exception or proviso, those words should be added. Surely, this does not give effect to the text of the statute as written. Rather, it reads into the statute what the Legislature did not include and perhaps chose not to include. Not only is this inconsistent with the majority\u2019s \"plain language\u201d textualist approach, it also violates the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Courts have long held that any ambiguity regarding the scope of criminal statutes must be resolved in favor of lenity. <em>Huddleston v United States, </em>415 US 814, 830-831, 94 S Ct 1262; 39 L Ed 2d 782 (1974), quoting <em>Rewis v United States, </em>401 US 808, 812; 91 S Ct 1056; 28 L Ed 2d 493 (1971). This is part of the time-honored rule that penal statutes are construed in favor of the defendant. As Chief Justice Marshall of United States Supreme Court stated in 1820:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-8\">The rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly, is perhaps not much less old than construction itself. It is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals; and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department. It is the legislature, not the Court, which is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>define a crime, and ordain its punishment. <em>[United States v Wiltberger, </em>18 US (5 Wheat) 76, 95; 5 L Ed 37 (1820).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">I believe that a court may go beyond the text of a statute when it is ambiguous or when serious questions arise regarding the reasonable meaning of its language. But when weighing the words of a criminal statute, the court must place on the scales the rule of lenity. This rule requires that the statute be construed strictly in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Here, the majority disregards the language contained in MCL 776.20 and effectively finds that, if certain words are added to form an exception or proviso, the statute should be read that way. This interpretation violates the rule of lenity. Far from reading the statute in favor of defendant, it requires that the statute be read to disfavor him.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">I believe that my interpretation of the statute best gives effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. And it best adheres to the long-established tradition of applying the rule of lenity to criminal statutes. The majority\u2019s construction violates the spirit of the rule of lenity. And it turns a hardened eye on the \u201ctenderness of the law for the rights of individuals. . . .\u201d <em>Wiltberger, supra </em>at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Instead of following this longstanding rule, the majority focuses on the potential burden placed on the prosecution. I continue to adhere to the rule of lenity. Therefore, I would hold that the prosecution bears the burden of production regardless of whether it might, at times, find that burden difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">I. THE DUE PROCESS PROBLEM</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">This Court has ruled that exemptions and provisos in criminal statutes must be defined with specificity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Exemptions and provisos within a criminal statute must be defined with the same specificity as the prohibitive language of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">This court is not able, within the bounds of due process, to \u201cinterpret\u201d a criminal statute which contains an ambiguous exemption such that it results in conviction of the defendant charged in the specific case. That is not the \u201cfair warning\u201d demanded by the Constitution. <em>[People v Dempster, </em>396 Mich 700, 715; 242 NW2d 381 (1976) (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Therefore, when a \u201cclarifying gloss\u201d is placed on a statute by a court, it can apply only to future violations. It cannot apply retroactively. This includes cases that clarify when an exemption or proviso exists. <em>Id. </em>at 715-717.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">This case constitutes the first instance when the \u201cclarifying gloss\u201d in question has been placed on MCL 750.224f(2). Therefore, at the least, the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute cannot apply retroactively. Because the majority finds for the first time that the statute contains a proviso, defendant did not have constitutional fair warning of what he would have to prove. Accordingly, his conviction cannot stand. <em>Dempster, supra </em>at 717-718.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">J. MY CONCLUSION REGARDING THE FELON-IN-POSSESSION STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The felon-in-possession statute indicates clearly that the prosecution has the burden of showing that five years have not passed (1) since the defendant paid all fines, or (2) since the defendant served his term of imprisonment, or (3) since the defendant successfully completed all conditions of probation or parole, or of showing (4) that the defendant\u2019s right to possess a firearm has not been restored. In this case, the prosecution concedes that it presented no evidence showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>that one of the four occurrences did not take place. Therefore, it failed to satisfy its burden. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in part and vacate defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The risk that force will be used during a larceny from a person is considerably greater than the risk of force in many other felonies. This is because the crime, by its nature, is often confrontational and always involves the presence of the victim. Therefore, I concur with the majority that larceny from a person is a specified felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">But I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding on the second issue. The felon-in-possession statute indicates clearly that the prosecution has the burden of production and persuasion on all the elements of the offense. This includes the lack of restoration of the right to possess a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">I would affirm in part the decision of the Court of Appeals, reverse it in part, and vacate defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-9\"> MCL 750.82.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b735-10\"> MCL 750.224f.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b735-11\"> MCL 750.227b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b736-10\"> <em>People v Perkins, </em>262 Mich App 267; 686 NW2d 237 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b738-12\"> Justice Cavanagh argues that the perpetrator could abort the attempt to obtain the property when it becomes apparent that he may need to use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>or threaten force to obtain the property.

The prosecution would have the option of carrying its burden on only one of the four subparts of MCL 750.224f(2). Once it proves one of the four, it need not go further. Therefore, I believe that the Legislature intended the prosecution to choose which element of MCL 750.224f(2) to address. But the contingent nature of the element should not change on whom the burdens of production and persuasion lie.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b742-13\"> The Legislature has repeatedly used the term \u201cunless\u201d to create an exception in the Penal Code.

Interpretive aids, such as the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>are meant to aid us in arriving at the meaning intended by the Legislature. By using a term in a list, the Legislature gave this Court a legitimate means of finding its intent. The main goal in interpreting any statute is to ascertain and give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>People v Tombs, </em>472 Mich 446, 451; 697 NW2d 494 (2005).

But this is not true. I simply find the statute inapplicable to this case. It would fully apply to other statutes actually containing an exception, excuse, proviso, or exemption. MCL 750.224f(4) provides an example of when I would apply MCL 776.20. A defendant would bear the burden of proving that his crime had been expunged, set aside, or pardoned. Just because I disagree with the application of MCL 776.20 to this case does not mean that my reading renders it nugatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b747-11\"> I believe that the majority has misunderstood my argument in n 14 of its opinion, <em>ante </em>at 637. Of course I know that the Legislature can change the law. My point is that the Legislature intentionally drafted MCL 750.224f(2) so that MCL 776.20 would not apply to it. The Legislature enacted MCL 750.224f(2) after it enacted MCL 776.20. Hence, it knew when it wrote MCL 750.224f(2) that MCL 776.20 requires the defendant to shoulder the burden of production in matters involving a proviso. Accordingly, if it had wanted to make a proviso in MCL 750.224f(2), it knew it had to write the statute to clearly contain a proviso.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">The Legislature has defined a \u201cspecified felony\u201d as including a felony in which the following circumstance exists:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>An element of that felony is the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense. [MCL 750.224f(6)(i).][<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">Larceny from the person is defined as follows: \u201cAny person who shall commit the offense of larceny by stealing from the person of another shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison not more than 10 years.\u201d MCL 750.357. Larceny from the person differs from robbery because larceny from the person is committed without the use of force or the threat of force. \u201c[R]obbery is a larceny aggravated by the fact that the taking is from the person, or in his presence, accomplished with force or the threat of force. \u201d <em>People v Randolph, </em>466 Mich 532, 544; 648 NW2d 164 (2002). By its very nature, larceny from the person involves the <em>absence </em>of force or threat of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">While I agree with the majority that there is a risk of force or threat of force when larceny from the person is committed, this is essentially the case with <em>every </em>felony. Indeed, one can conceive of a risk of force in almost every situation in which a felony is committed. However, I do not believe that the mere <em>potential </em>for force or threat of force, or the mere <em>potential </em>that a perpetrator <em>may </em>become confrontational if detected, means larceny from the person presents a <em>\u201csubstantial </em>risk\u201d of force or threat of force. A perpetrator could just as likely choose to avoid confrontation if it becomes apparent that force or the threat of force must be used to complete the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>intended act. Therefore, because there is not a <em>\u201csubstantial risk\u201d </em>of force or threat of force when larceny from the person is committed, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-6\"> Other subsections of the statute specifying additional circumstances that also define a specified felony are not applicable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
