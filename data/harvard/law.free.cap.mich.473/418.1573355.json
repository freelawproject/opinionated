In addressing this issue, we revisit our decision in <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Lardie,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which held, <em>inter alia, </em>that to convict a defendant of OUIL causing death, the prosecution must prove \u201cthat the defendant\u2019s <em>intoxicated </em>driving was a <em>substantial cause </em>of the victim\u2019s death.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">We conclude that the <em>Lardie </em>Court erred in holding that the defendant\u2019s <em>\u201cintoxicated </em>driving\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> must be a substantial cause of the victim\u2019s death. The plain text of \u00a7 625(4) does not require that the prosecution prove the defendant\u2019s intoxicated state affected his or her operation of the motor vehicle. Indeed, \u00a7 625(4) requires no causal link at all between the defendant\u2019s intoxication and the victim\u2019s death. The statute requires that the defendant\u2019s <em>operation </em>of the motor vehicle, not the defendant\u2019s intoxicated manner of driving, must cause the victim\u2019s death. The defendant\u2019s status as \u201cintoxicated\u201d is a separate element of the offense of OUIL causing death. It specifies the class of persons subject to liability under \u00a7 625(4): intoxicated drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Quite simply, by enacting \u00a7 625(4), the Legislature intended to punish \u201coperating while intoxicated,\u201d not \u201coperating in an intoxicated manner.\u201d Therefore, to the extent that <em>Lardie </em>held that the defendant\u2019s <em>intoxicated </em>driving must be a substantial cause of the victim\u2019s death, it is overruled.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Accordingly, in <em>People v Schaefer, </em>we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>to the Court of Appeals to address defendant\u2019s remaining argument that the trial court erred so as to require reversal in making repeated references to defendant\u2019s stipulation as to his 0.16 blood-alcohol level during the jury instructions. In <em>People v </em>Large, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the district court for reconsideration of whether to bind defendant over on the charge of OUIL causing death in light of the principles set forth in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"AQb\">A. <em>PEOPLE v SCHAEFER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In January 2002, defendant was driving on Interstate-75 in the city of Lincoln Park with his friend as a passenger in the vehicle. Defendant admitted that he consumed three beers before getting behind the wheel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to several eyewitnesses, defendant was tailgating various cars and driving erratically.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">While on the freeway, defendant\u2019s passenger abruptly told him that they had reached their freeway exit. Defendant swerved to exit the freeway, hit the curb, and lost control of the car. The car rolled over, killing the passenger. Defendant stipulated at trial that he had a 0.16 blood-alcohol level almost three hours after the accident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Defendant was charged with OUIL causing death<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>and manslaughter with a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At trial, a defense expert witness testified that the exit ramp was safe for speeds up to thirty miles per hour, but dangerous at any greater speed. He stated that he would have expected numerous accidents, including rollovers, during the thirty-six years that the ramp was in existence and that he was surprised to learn that there had been no other rollover accidents in over twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In instructing the jury, instead of reading the standard instruction for OUIL causing death, CJI2d 15.11,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the trial court read the text of the OUIL causing death statute. When the jury asked for additional instructions during deliberations, the trial court said all it could do was tell them what the statute said. Thus, the court again read the statute to the jury. The jury convicted defendant of OUIL causing death and negligent homi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>tide.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Defendant was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of fifty months to fifteen years for OUIL causing death and one to two years for negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s negligent homicide conviction, but reversed his conviction of OUIL causing death.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In a two-to-one decision, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court erred in instructing the jury because it did not inform the jury that defendant\u2019s <em>intoxicated </em>driving must be a \u201csubstantial cause\u201d of the victim\u2019s death, as required by Lardie.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The dissent concluded that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the causation element of OUIL causing death by reading the statute to the jury. We granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal and ordered that this case be argued and submitted with <em>People v Large.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">B. <em>PEOPLE V LARGE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">In July 2003, while driving on a road in Jackson County, defendant struck and killed an eleven-year-old girl who was riding her bicycle in the late afternoon. The girl emerged onto the road after descending from an elevated driveway, the street view of which was partially obstructed by vegetation. The bicycle that she was riding did not have any brakes. Defendant was driving approximately five miles an hour over the posted speed limit of fifty-five miles per hour. Despite swerving in an attempt to avoid hitting the girl, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>two collided. At the time of the accident, defendant had a 0.10 blood-alcohol level.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Defendant was charged with manslaughter with a motor vehicle,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> OUIL causing death,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> OUIL (second offense),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and violation of license restrictions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> At defendant\u2019s preliminary examination, the prosecution called a sheriffs deputy who testified as an expert witness in accident reconstruction. The deputy testified that the accident was unavoidable, opining that the collision still would have occurred had defendant been sober and driving the speed limit. According to the deputy, a sober driver would have required at least IV2 seconds to notice the girl and attempt to avoid hitting her. On the basis of his investigation, the deputy concluded that the girl emerged onto the road, and the impact occurred, all within less than one second.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The district court bound defendant over on all counts except OUIL causing death. On appeal to the circuit court, the court refused to reinstate the charge of OUIL causing death.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The prosecution then appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the circuit court.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Lardie, </em>the Court of Appeals held that \u201c[t]he prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence to justify a finding that defendant\u2019s intoxicated driving was a substantial cause of the victim\u2019s death____\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>refusing to entertain the prosecutor\u2019s argument that <em>Lardie </em>was wrongly decided, the Court of Appeals stated that \u201c \u2018[a] decision of the Supreme Court is binding upon this Court until the Supreme Court overrules itself.\u2019 Therefore, we may not revisit the holding of <em>Lardie.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal and ordered that this case be argued and submitted with <em>People v Schaefer</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Statutory interpretation is a question of law that is reviewed by this Court de novo.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Similarly, jury instructions that involve questions of law are also reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In reviewing a district court\u2019s decision to bind over a defendant, the lower court\u2019s determination regarding the sufficiency of the evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, but the lower court\u2019s rulings based on questions of law are reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AMy\">A. MCL 257.625(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Our Legislature first enacted the \u201cOUIL causing death\u201d statute as part of 1991 PA 98 in an attempt to increase the criminal penalties associated with driving while intoxicated.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Legislature evidently believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>that sentences resulting from involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide convictions inadequately deterred intoxicated drivers from getting behind the wheel.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Thus, to address this concern, the Legislature enacted the OUIL causing death statute, which provides more severe penalties, with the apparent expectation that these heightened penalties would deter intoxicated individuals from driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Our OUIL causing death statute, MCL 257.625(4), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">A person, whether licensed or not, who operates a motor vehicle in violation of subsection (1) [under the influence of alcoholic liquor, a controlled substance, or a combination of alcoholic liquor and a controlled substance, or having an unlawful body alcohol content], (3) [visibly impaired by the consumption of alcoholic liquor, a controlled substance, or a combination of alcoholic liquor and a controlled substance], or (8) [any body content of a schedule 1 controlled substance] <em>and by the operation of that motor vehicle causes the death of another person </em>is guilty of a crime as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">(a)... [A] felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 15 years or a fine of not less than $2,500.00 or more than $10,000.00, or both. [<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">B. <em>PEOPLE v LARDIE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">In <em>People v Lardie, </em>this Court was presented with a due process challenge to the OUIL causing death statute.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The defendants in the two consolidated cases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>Lardie </em>alleged that \u00a7 625(4) imposed criminal liability without requiring a culpable mental state. In rejecting the defendants\u2019 due process arguments, this Court held that OUIL causing death is a general intent crime and that \u201cthe culpable act that the Legislature wishes to prevent is the one in which a person becomes intoxicated and then decides to drive.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We further held that \u201cthere is no requirement [under \u00a7 625(4)] that the people prove gross negligence or negligence\u201d because \u201cthe Legislature essentially has presumed that driving while intoxicated is gross negligence as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">This Court then proceeded to examine the causation element of the OUIL causing death offense, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">The Legislature passed [\u00a7 625(4)] in order to reduce the number of alcohol-related traffic fatalities. The Legislature sought to deter drivers who are \u201cwilling to risk current penalties\u201d from drinking and driving. In seeking to reduce fatalities by deterring drunken driving, the statute must have been designed to punish drivers when their <em>drunken </em>driving caused another\u2019s death. Otherwise, the statute would impose a penalty on a driver even when his wrongful decision to drive while intoxicated had no bearing on the death that resulted. Such an interpretation of the statute would produce an absurd result by divorcing the defendant\u2019s fault from the resulting injury. We seek to avoid such an interpretation.[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Thus, relying on policy justifications and its belief that a contrary construction would lead to an \u201cabsurd re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>suit,\u201d the <em>Lardie </em>Court held that \u201cin proving causation, the people must establish that the particular defendant\u2019s decision to drive while intoxicated produced a <em>change in that driver\u2019s operation of the vehicle </em>that caused the death of the victim.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> According to the <em>Lardie </em>Court, \u201c[i]t is the <em>change </em>that such intoxication produces, and whether it caused the death, which is the focus of [the causation] element of the crime.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The <em>Lardie </em>Court summarized the three distinct elements the prosecution must prove in securing a conviction for OUIL causing death: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">(1) [That] the defendant was operating his motor vehicle while he was intoxicated, (2) that he voluntarily decided to drive knowing that he had consumed alcohol and might be intoxicated, and <em>(3) that the defendant\u2019s intoxicated driving was a substantial cause of the victim\u2019s death.[</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">C. PRINCIPLES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">When interpreting a statute, it is the court\u2019s duty to give effect to the intent of the Legislature as expressed in the actual language used in the statute.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It is the role of the judiciary to interpret, not write, the law.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, the statute is enforced as written.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Judicial construction is neither necessary nor permitted because it is presumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>that the Legislature intended the clear meaning it expressed.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">D. THE CAUSATION ELEMENT OF \u00a7 625(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The plain text of \u00a7 625(4) requires no causal link between the defendant\u2019s intoxication and the victim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Section 625(4) provides, \u201cA person, whether licensed or not, who operates a motor vehicle [while intoxicated] and <em>by the operation </em>of that motor vehicle <em>causes </em>the death of another person is guilty of a crime . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Accordingly, it is the defendant\u2019s <em>operation </em>of the motor vehicle that must cause the victim\u2019s death, not the defendant\u2019s \u201cintoxication.\u201d While a defendant\u2019s status as \u201cintoxicated\u201d is certainly an element of the offense of OUIL causing death, it is not a component of the <em>causation </em>element of the offense. Justice WEAVER succinctly stated this point in her concurrence in Lardie:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">The plain language of the statute clearly indicates that the Legislature intended causation to turn on the fact that the defendant <em>operated </em>the vehicle while intoxicated, rather than the <em>changed manner in which, or how, the defendant operated </em>the vehicle while intoxicated.[<footnotemark>42</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The <em>Lardie </em>Court\u2019s reliance on policy considerations in construing \u00a7 625(4) was misplaced. It is true that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> However, the Legislature\u2019s intent must be ascertained from the actual text of the statute, not from extra-textual judicial divinations of \u201cwhat the Legislature really meant.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> As we stated in <em>Lansing Mayor, supra, </em>\u201crather than engaging in legislative mind-reading to discern [legislative intent], we believe that the best measure of the Legislature\u2019s intent is simply the words that it has chosen to enact into law.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The <em>Lardie </em>Court also erred in assuming that judicial adherence to and application of the actual text of \u00a7 625(4) \u201cwould produce an absurd result.\u201d The result that the Court in <em>Lardie </em>viewed as \u201cabsurd\u201d-imposing criminal liability under \u00a7 625(4) when a victim\u2019s death is caused by a defendant\u2019s <em>operation </em>of the vehicle rather than the defendant\u2019s <em>intoxicated </em>operation-reflects a policy choice adopted by a majority of the Legislature. A court is not free to cast aside a specific policy choice adopted on behalf of the people of the state by their elected representatives in the Legislature simply because the court would prefer a different policy choice. To do so would be to empower the least politically accountable branch of government with unbridled policymaking power. Such a model of government was not envisioned by the people of Michigan in ratifying our Constitution, and modifying our structure of government by judicial fiat will not be endorsed by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Instead, we must construe the causation element of \u00a7 625(4) according to the actual text of the statute. Section 625(4) plainly requires that the victim\u2019s death be caused by the defendant\u2019s <em>operation </em>of the vehicle, not the defendant\u2019s <em>intoxicated </em>operation. Thus, the manner in which the defendant\u2019s intoxication affected his or her operation of the vehicle is unrelated to the causation element of the crime. The defendant\u2019s status as \u201cintoxicated\u201d is a separate element of the offense used to identify the class of persons subject to liability under \u00a7 625(4).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Accordingly, we overrule <em>Lardie </em>only to the extent it held that the prosecution must prove \u201cthat the defendant\u2019s <em>intoxicated </em>driving was a <em>substantial cause </em>of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>victim\u2019s death.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> We hold that the prosecution, in proving OUIL causing death, must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the defendant was operating his or her motor vehicle in violation of MCL 257.625(1), (3), or (8); (2) the defendant voluntarily decided to drive, knowing that he or she had consumed an intoxicating agent and might be intoxicated; and (3) the defendant\u2019s operation of the motor vehicle caused the victim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">It is ironic that the <em>Lardie </em>Court recognized that the Legislature\u2019s intent in passing \u00a7 625(4) was \u201cto deter th[e] gravely dangerous conduct\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> of driving while intoxicated, yet interpreted \u00a7 625(4) in such a way so as to limit substantially the applicability of \u00a7 625(4) beyond that which the Legislature envisioned. As Justice WEAVER noted in her <em>Lardie </em>concurrence, the <em>Lardie </em>majority\u2019s \u201cdemanding burden of proof-requiring the prosecution to show that the defendant\u2019s intoxication <em>changed </em>his or her manner of operation-\u201cwas not intended by the Legislature and is not found in the language of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Unlike the <em>Lardie </em>Court, we believe that the best way to \u201cdeter this gravely dangerous conduct\u201d is to enforce the statute <em>as written </em>and thereby give the statute the teeth that the Legislature intended.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Having determined that \u00a7 625(4) requires the victim\u2019s death to be caused by the defendant\u2019s <em>operation </em>,of the vehicle, rather than the defendant\u2019s <em>intoxicated manner of operation, </em>we turn to the issue of defining the term \u201ccause.\u201d In the criminal law context, the word \u201ccause\u201d has acquired a unique, technical meaning.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Accordingly, pursuant to MCL 8.3a, we must construe the term \u201caccording to [its] peculiar and appropriate meaning\u201d in the law.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In criminal jurisprudence, the causation element of an offense is generally comprised of two components: factual cause and proximate cause.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The concept of factual causation is relatively straightforward. In determining whether a defendant\u2019s conduct is a factual cause of the result, one must ask, \u201cbut for\u201d the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>conduct, would the result have occurred?<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> If the result would not have occurred absent the defendant\u2019s conduct, then factual causation exists.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The existence of factual causation alone, however, will not support the imposition of criminal liability.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Proximate causation must also be established. As we noted in <em>Tims, </em>proximate causation is a \u201clegal colloquialism.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> It is a legal construct designed to prevent criminal liability from attaching when the result of the defendant\u2019s conduct is viewed as too remote or unnatural.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Thus, a proximate cause is simply a factual cause \u201cof which the law will take cognizance.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">For a defendant\u2019s conduct to be regarded as a proximate cause, the victim\u2019s injury must be a \u201cdirect and natural result\u201d of the defendant\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> In making this determination, it is necessary to examine whether there was an intervening cause that superseded the defendant\u2019s conduct such that the causal link between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the defendant\u2019s conduct and the victim\u2019s injury was broken. If an intervening cause did indeed <em>supersede </em>the defendant\u2019s act as a legally significant causal factor, then the defendant\u2019s conduct will not be deemed a proximate cause of the victim\u2019s injury.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The standard by which to gauge whether an intervening cause supersedes, and thus severs the causal link, is generally one of reasonable foreseeability. For example, suppose that a defendant stabs a victim and the victim is then taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. If the physician is negligent in providing medical care to the victim and the victim later dies, the defendant is still considered to have proximately caused the victim\u2019s death because it is reasonably foreseeable that negligent medical care might be provided.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> At the same time, <em>gross </em>negligence or intentional misconduct by a treating physician is not reasonably foreseeable, and would thus break the causal chain between the defendant and the victim.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The linchpin in the superseding cause analysis, therefore, is whether the intervening cause was foreseeable based on an objective standard of reasonableness. If it was reasonably foreseeable, then the defendant\u2019s conduct will be considered a proximate cause. If, however, the intervening act by the victim or a third party was not reasonably foreseeable \u2014 e.g., <em>gross </em>negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>gence or intentional misconduct \u2014 then generally the causal link is severed and the defendant\u2019s conduct is not regarded as a proximate cause of the victim\u2019s injury or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In criminal law, \u201cgross negligence\u201d is not merely an elevated or enhanced form of ordinary negligence. As we held in <em>Barnes, supra, </em>in criminal jurisprudence, gross negligence \u201cmeans wantonness and disregard of the consequences which may ensue, and indifference to the rights of others that is equivalent to a criminal intent.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Accordingly, in examining the causation element of OUIL causing death, it must first be determined whether the defendant\u2019s operation of the vehicle was a factual cause of the victim\u2019s death. If factual causation is established, it must then be determined whether the defendant\u2019s operation of the vehicle was a proximate cause. In doing so, one must inquire whether the victim\u2019s death was a direct and natural result of the defendant\u2019s operation of the vehicle and whether an intervening cause may have superseded and thus severed the causal link.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> While an act of God or the <em>gross </em>negligence or intentional misconduct by the victim or a third party will generally be considered a superseding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>cause, <em>ordinary </em>negligence by the victim or a third party will not be regarded as a superseding cause because ordinary negligence is reasonably foreseeable.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>E. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"AgO\">i. <em>PEOPLE V SCHAEFER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Defendant argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on OUIL causing death in two respects. First, defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s instruction on the causation element of the crime was flawed. Second, defendant argues that the trial court erred when it reminded the jury three times during instructions about defendant\u2019s stipulation as to his 0.16 blood-alcohol level.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In initially instructing the jury on the causation element of OUIL causing death, the trial court read the text of \u00a7 625(4) to the jury. Defendant objected to the instruction, arguing that the standard jury instruction for OUIL causing death, CJI2d 15.11, which incorporated this Court\u2019s <em>Lardie </em>holding, should have been read instead. Less than an hour into deliberations, the jury specifically requested clarification from the trial court on the causation element of OUIL causing death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay. You\u2019re asking to explain under the influence, as is stated in Count I [OUIL causing death]. [I]s that what you want to know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">\n<em>Juror No. 11: Also causing death.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\"><em>The Court: </em>I\u2019m sorry; also what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\"><em>Juror No. 11: </em>Under the influence <em>causing death.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\"><em>The Court: </em>Yeah, okay. All I can do is tell you what the statute says. If that was the case, you have to decide that. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Defendant again objected to the instruction, arguing that the trial court did not adequately explain the causation element of OUIL causing death.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We agree that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on causation, but not for the reasons offered by defendant. Defendant argues that the causation instruction was flawed because the trial court did not instruct the jury that defendant\u2019s intoxicated driving must be a \u201csubstantial cause\u201d of the victim\u2019s death, as required by <em>Lardie. </em>As discussed above, the <em>Lardie </em>Court erred in requiring that the defendant\u2019s <em>intoxication, </em>rather than the defendant\u2019s <em>operation </em>of the motor vehicle, constitute the substantial cause. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s causation instruction was not flawed in the manner asserted by defendant. Instead, we conclude that the trial court erred because the word \u201ccause\u201d in \u00a7 625(4) is a legal term of art normally not within the common understanding of jurors, and thus, simply reading the statute to the jury was insufficient. The jury could not be expected to understand that the statute required the prosecutor to prove <em>both </em>factual causation and proximate causation.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Having determined that the causation instruction was flawed, we turn to whether the error was harmless. Mere error alone in instructing the jury is insufficient to set aside a criminal conviction. Instead, a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>must establish that the erroneous instruction resulted in <em>\u201ca </em>miscarriage of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Specifically, by enacting MCL 769.26, our Legislature has provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-4\">No judgment or verdict shall be set aside or reversed or a new trial be granted by any court of this state in any criminal case, <em>on the ground of misdirection of the jury, </em>or the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or for error as to any matter of pleading or procedure, unless in the opinion of the court, after an examination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in <em>a miscarriage of justice.[</em><footnotemark><em>70</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">As we noted in <em>People v Cornell,</em><footnotemark><em>71</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in giving effect to the \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d standard of MCL 769.26, a reviewing court is required to classify the type of alleged instructional error as either constitutional or nonconstitutional, and as either preserved or unpreserved.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> In <em>Cornell, </em>we held that instructional error based on the misapplication of a statute is generally considered non-constitutional error.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> As such, any error that the trial court committed in the present case in failing to explain the causation element of \u00a7 625(4) was nonconstitutional. Moreover, because defendant promptly objected to the instruction and adequately articulated the basis for the objection, the alleged error was properly preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Accordingly, the alleged instructional error in this case is appropriately classified as preserved, nonconsti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>tutional error, as noted by the Court of Appeals. In <em>People v </em>Lukity,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> we held that MCL 769.26 creates a presumption that preserved nonconstitutional error, is harmless unless the defendant demonstrates that the error was outcome determinative.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Specifically, in <em>Lukity </em>we stated that MCL 769.26 \u201cpresumes that a preserved, nonconstitutional error is not a ground for reversal unless \u2018after an examination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively appear\u2019 that it is more probable than not that the error was outcome determinative.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> An error is not \u201coutcome determinative\u201d unless it \u201c \u2018undermined the reliability of the verdict.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Applying the <em>Lukity </em>standard to the alleged instructional error in the present case, we conclude that any error on the part of the trial court in merely reading the statute and failing to explain the causation element of OUIL causing death was harmless. There is no evidence that the trial court\u2019s failure to explain fully both the factual cause and proximate cause components of the causation element of the offense was \u201coutcome determinative\u201d or that the \u201creliability of the verdict was undermined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Assuming, arguendo, that the jury gave full credit to the testimony of defendant\u2019s expert witness on highway design, the most that the witness\u2019s testimony established was that the freeway exit was negligently designed. The witness presented no evidence that there was any <em>gross </em>negligence in the design of the freeway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>exit. As such, the design of the freeway exit could not be considered a superseding cause that would prevent defendant from being legally regarded as a proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death. We conclude, therefore, that defendant has failed to rebut the presumption that the alleged instructional error was harmless because he has not demonstrated that the alleged error was outcome determinative in that it undermined the reliability of the verdict, as required by MCL 769.26 and <em>Lukity </em><footnotemark><em>78</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Defendant also argues that the trial court committed error requiring reversal when it reminded the jury three times during instructions about defendant\u2019s stipulation as to his 0.16 blood-alcohol level.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> However, the Court of Appeals declined to address this argument in light of its resolution of this case. Accordingly, we remand this case to the Court of Appeals limited solely to the issue of whether the trial court committed error requiring reversal in making repeated references to the stipulation regarding defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol level.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>We do not retain jurisdiction.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">ii. <em>PEOPLE v LARGE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The first two elements of OUIL causing death are not in dispute. Defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol level was 0.10 grams and he voluntarily chose to drive knowing that he had consumed alcohol. The uncertainty lies in the causation element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Defendant\u2019s operation of the vehicle was undeniably a factual cause of the young girl\u2019s death. Absent defendant\u2019s operation of the vehicle, the collision would not have occurred. The issue of proximate causation, however, is less certain. There is evidence that the victim\u2019s death was the direct and natural result of defendant\u2019s operation of the vehicle. At the same time, the victim rode a bicycle without brakes down a partially obstructed hill onto a busy road and, thus, according to the prosecution\u2019s own expert witness, made the collision unavoidable. Given the fact that during the preliminary examination the parties did not directly address the proximate cause issue, including whether the victim\u2019s own behavior was a superseding cause, the proper course is to remand this case to the district court for reconsideration of whether to bind over defendant in light of the principles discussed in this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">The <em>Lardie </em>Court erred in holding that the defendant\u2019s \u201cintoxicated driving\u201d must be a substantial cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>of the victim\u2019s death. There is no textual basis for the <em>Lardie </em>Court\u2019s holding. Indeed, the plain text of the OUIL causing death statute requires no causal link at all between the defendant\u2019s intoxication and the victim\u2019s death. The defendant\u2019s status as \u201cintoxicated\u201d is a separate element of the offense and entirely irrelevant to the causation element of the crime. It is the defendant\u2019s <em>operation </em>of the motor vehicle that must cause the victim\u2019s death under \u00a7 625(4), not the manner by which the defendant\u2019s intoxication may or may not have affected the defendant\u2019s operating ability. Therefore, to the extent that <em>Lardie </em>held that \u00a7 625(4) requires the defendant\u2019s intoxicated driving to be a substantial cause of the victim\u2019s death, it is overruled. In proving the causation element of OUIL causing death, the people need only prove that the defendant\u2019s <em>operation </em>of the motor vehicle caused, both factually and proximately, the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Accordingly, <em>in People v Schaefer, </em>the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals to address defendant\u2019s remaining argument that the trial court erred so as to require reversal in making repeated references to defendant\u2019s stipulation as to his 0.16 blood-alcohol level during the jury instructions. In <em>People v Large, </em>the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court for reconsideration of whether to bind defendant over on the charge of OUIL causing death in light of the principles set forth in this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction in either case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b540-7\">Taylor, C.J., and Weaver, Corrigan, and Markman, JJ., concurred with YOUNG, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\"> 452 Mich 231; 551 NW2d 656 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 259-260 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-10\"> <em>Id. </em>at 234 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b516-11\"> We do not disturb our other holdings in <em>Lardie, </em>including that the prosecution need not prove negligence or gross negligence by the defendant, that the defendant must have \u201cvoluntarily\u201d decided to drive \u201cknowing that he had consumed an intoxicating liquor,\u201d and that \u00a7 625(4) comports with constitutional due process principles. <em>Id. </em>at 249-251, 265-267.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\"> Defendant denied drinking the beer contained in the empty bottles found in his vehicle.

MCL 257.904(4). The text of \u00a7 904(4) parallels the language in \u00a7 625(4). Section 904(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">A person who operates a motor vehicle [under a suspended or revoked license] and who, <em>by operation of that motor vehicle, causes the death of another person </em>is guilty of a felony .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Under the <em>Lardie </em>Court\u2019s rationale, \u00a7 904(4) would require that the defendant\u2019s suspension or revocation somehow affect (i.e., be a \u201csubstantial cause\u201d of) the manner by which the defendant operates the vehicle before criminal liability may be imposed. There is obviously no textual basis for such a conclusion, just as there was no such basis in <em>Lardie. </em>As Justice Weaver pointed out in her concurrence in <em>Lardie, </em>the <em>Lardie </em>majority fundamentally misunderstood the nature of a \u201cstatus crime.\u201d <em>Lardie, supra </em>at 271 n 8. The <em>Lardie </em>majority mistakenly took the status element of the crime \u2014 that the defendant was intoxicated \u2014 and fused it with the causation element of the offense. Therefore, to the extent that the <em>Lardie </em>Court was simply attempting to articulate a proximate cause requirement by creating its \u201csubstantial cause\u201d test, the <em>Lardie </em>Court erred in conflating the \u201cstatus\u201d and \u201ccausation\u201d elements of the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\"> <em>Lardie, supra </em>at 259-260 (emphasis added).

Justice Cavanagh mischaraeterizes both <em>Lardie </em>and the present cases. First, we do not read <em>Lardie </em>to impose the heightened form of proximate cause in criminal law that Justice Cavanagh advocates. In fact, in <em>Tims, </em>which was decided just one year before <em>Lardie, </em>we explicitly rejected that same argument. Second, contrary to Justice Cavanagh\u2019s assertion, we do not adopt a heightened form of proximate cause in the present cases.

Specifically \u00a7 841(a)(1) makes it illegal to \u201cknowingly or intentionally . . . distribute ... a controlled substance\u201d and \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) provides an enhanced sentence \u201cif death or serious bodily injury <em>results </em>from the use of such substance ....\u201d (Emphasis added.)

However, now that the issue is squarely before the Court, and I have reexamined the language of the statute in the two cases before us, I now agree that the Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201ccauses the death\u201d indicates that the common-law meaning of \u201ccause\u201d must be used, and both cause in fact and proximate cause need to be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The dangers of driving under the influence are no doubt of concern to the Legislature; however, as the majority indicates, had the Legislature wanted to remove a showing of proximate cause from the statute prohibiting OUIL causing death, it could have used the term \u201cresulting in the death\u201d instead.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b541-7\">CORRIGAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APp\">(concurring). I concur in and join every aspect of the majority opinion. I write separately to suggest an analytic approach to the sole remaining issue to be resolved on remand in <em>People v Schaefer, </em>i.e., whether the trial court committed error requiring reversal when it reminded the jury three times during instructions about defendant\u2019s stipulation regarding his blood-alcohol level of 0.16 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>As the majority correctly observes, <em>ante </em>at 445 n 81, in determining whether the multiple references to the stipulation constitute an error requiring reversal, the Court of Appeals should consider whether defendant has established that a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d occurred, as required by MCL 769.26 and <em>People v Lukity, </em>460 Mich 484; 596 NW2d 607 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">In assessing whether a miscarriage of justice occurred, I believe it is noteworthy that defendant is mistaken in assuming that his blood-alcohol level at the time of the accident is the sole factor that the jury was entitled to consider in finding that he was intoxicated. MCL 257.625(1) clearly provides two independent bases on which the jury could have concluded that defendant was intoxicated. Specifically, at the time defendant was charged, \u00a7 625(1) provided that a defendant is considered intoxicated for the purpose of OUIL causing death if <em>either </em>of the following applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">(a) The person is under the influence of intoxicating liquor, a controlled substance, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">(b) The person has an alcohol content of 0.10 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 625(1), the jury could have found that defendant was intoxicated <em>either </em>on the basis of evidence of defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol level, <em>or </em>on the basis of evidence presented at trial demonstrating that defendant was \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">In instructing the jury, the trial court repeatedly informed the jury of these two alternative bases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\"><em>The Court: </em>So, the elements are <em>either </em>operating under the influence, that\u2019s one. <em>Or, </em>operating a motor vehicle while the blood alcohol content is 0.10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>It\u2019s <em>either </em>driving under the influence, <em>or </em>driving with a blood alcohol content of 0.10. And as a result of so operating a motor vehicle, causes the death of another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">Those are the elements of Count 1 [OUIL causing death],...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">So, if you find in Count 1 [OUIL causing death] that the defendant operated a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicants, <em>or </em>that he at the time had a blood alcohol level in excess of .10. And that as a result of that, a person was killed. That is what you call homicide caused by driving under the influence. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Moreover, the trial court explicitly instructed the jury that it was free to reject defendant\u2019s stipulation about his blood-alcohol level. Specifically, the trial court told the jury, \u201cYou have a right to accept [the stipulation], or you have a right to reject it. It\u2019s entirely up to you.\u201d It is thus quite possible that the jury chose to ignore completely defendant\u2019s stipulation about his blood-alcohol level when it found defendant guilty of OUIL causing death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Accordingly, in addressing on remand whether the trial court committed error requiring reversal in making repeated references to the stipulation, the Court of Appeals should consider the alternative bases provided by \u00a7 625(l)(a) and (b) and the trial court\u2019s instruction that the jury was entitled to disregard the stipulation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-8\"> The prosecution presented various evidence at trial to demonstrate that defendant was \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 625(l)(a). First, defendant himself admitted that he consumed at least three beers before getting behind the wheel. Defendant also admitted that his blood-alcohol level was 0.16 grams less than three hours after the accident and that he did not consume any alcoholic beverages between the time of the accident and when his blood was later drawn at the hospital. The accident occurred about 10:08 p.m., and defendant\u2019s blood was drawn at the hospital about 12:56 a.m. The victim, defendant\u2019s passenger, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.35 grams approximately forty minutes after the accident occurred. Three hours after the accident, the victim\u2019s blood-alcohol level had <em>declined </em>to 0.24 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"ARU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Second, several eyewitnesses told the police that defendant was tailgating various cars on the freeway, driving erratically, and swerved suddenly to get off the highway. Evidence was presented at trial that defendant followed a car on the freeway for one mile with less than one-half of a car length between the vehicles and while traveling at a speed of sixty-five miles an hour. Defendant acknowledged that the other two lanes of the freeway were clear for the entire mile that he was tailgating. Defendant then proceeded to tailgate a tractor-trailer in a similar manner.</p>\n<p id=\"AVq\">Third, when the police investigated the crime scene, officers found numerous empty bottles of alcohol in defendant\u2019s vehicle. In addition to the empty bottles of beer, the police also found an empty vodka bottle in defendant\u2019s vehicle. Defendant denied drinking any vodka on the night of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"AyN\">Fourth, the nature of the accident itself was described in great detail at trial. Defendant suddenly swerved to get off the freeway and his vehicle rolled over. In the prior twenty years, there had been no rollover accidents on that same freeway exit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b544-6\">CAVANAGH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJG\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I concur in the result reached by the majority that, to convict a defendant of OUIL causing death under MCL 257.625(4), the prosecution must prove that the defendant was intoxicated and that his or her driving was both the factual and the proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death. Like Justice WEAVER, I have carefully reexamined the language of the statute and this Court\u2019s interpretation of that language in <em>People v Lardie, </em>452 Mich 231; 551 NW2d 656 (1996). In doing so, I have come to the conclusion that the <em>Lardie </em>Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute did not effectuate the intent of the Legislature. As Justice WEAVER noted in her <em>Lardie </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>concurrence, the <em>Lardie </em>majority\u2019s conclusion that the focus must be on the defendant\u2019s \u201cintoxicated driving\u201d imposed an unworkable burden on the prosecution. <em>Lardie, supra </em>at 272 (WEAVER, J., concurring). After due consideration, I now believe that the correct interpretation of the statute is that set forth by the current majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">I would also suggest that the <em>Lardie </em>majority\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s driving must be a \u201csubstantial\u201d cause of the victim\u2019s death, while inartfully worded, was likely an attempt to accentuate that the concept of proximate cause in a criminal context is a more demanding standard than that found in tort law. <em>People v Barnes, </em>182 Mich 179, 196-199; 148 NW 400 (1914); LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law (2d ed), \u00a7 3.12, pp 279,282. This is true \u201cbecause the potential deprivation of personal rights is obviously much more extreme in criminal, as opposed to tort, actions.\u201d <em>People v Harding, </em>443 Mich 693, 738; 506 NW2d 482 (1993) (CAVANAGH, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Thus, in a criminal context, \u201c[t]he proximate cause standard requires a sufficient causal connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the result of that conduct. \u2018[I]t [must] appear[] that the death resulted as the natural, direct, and necessary result of the unlawful act....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 737, quoting <em>Barnes, supra </em>at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">As our criminal jury instructions suggest, \u201cthe criminal standard for proximate cause requires a more direct causal connection than the tort concept of proximate cause.\u201d <em>Harding, supra </em>at 738. Thus, in establishing causation under MCL 257.625(4), it is critical to note the following caveats:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">[C]riminal liability requires a more direct causal connection than merely finding that the defendant\u2019s actions were \u201ca\u201d cause. Where there are multiple independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>causes contributing to the victim\u2019s injury or death, so that the defendant\u2019s conduct alone would not have caused the death, we would not impose liability for criminal negligence unless the defendant\u2019s conduct sufficiently dominated the other contributing factors, to be fairly deemed a criminal proximate cause, and the injury was reasonably foreseeable from the defendant\u2019s negligence. More specifically, even though a victim\u2019s contributory negligence is not an affir- ' mative defense, it is a factor to be considered by the trier of fact in determining whether the prima facie element of proximate cause has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>[People v Tims, </em>449 Mich 83, 111; 534 NW2d 675 (1995) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Thus, the <em>Lardie </em>Court\u2019s underlying premise, that proximate cause should be examined differently in a criminal case, was correct, but the current majority\u2019s approach more accurately conveys the concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">I dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s decision to remand these cases for further proceedings under the rule set forth in today\u2019s opinion because I believe that \u2022 applying the new rule, which overturns our prior interpretation of MCL 257.625(4), violates due process and infringes on the protections inherent in the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States and Michigan constitutions. US Const, art I, \u00a7 10; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>In <em>People v Dempster, </em>396 Mich 700; 242 NW2d 381 (1976), this Court recognized the longstanding rule that to avoid a deprivation of due process, \u201c[a] criminal statute must be \u2018sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715, quoting <em>Connally v Gen Constr Co, </em>269 US 385, 391; 46 S Ct 126; 70 L Ed 322 (1926). In <em>Lardie, </em>this Court examined MCL 257.625(4) in great detail in an attempt to clarify its meaning. We engaged in extensive endeavors of statutory construction to determine things that were not evident on the statute\u2019s face. In particular, we examined whether the statute was meant to impose strict liability; if it was not, whether it created a general or specific intent crime; whether the Legislature intended that the prosecution prove some type of fault; and what the parameters of the statute\u2019s causation requirement were.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The resulting judicial interpretation of the statute had, of course, the force of law, and sufficiently explained to the citizenry what type of conduct on their part would lead to criminal culpability. Through that decision, the people of this state were given \u201cfair warning\u201d of a prohibited type of conduct. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, \u201cThere can be no doubt that a deprivation of the right of fair warning can result not only from vague statutory language but also from an unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of narrow and precise statutory language.\u201d <em>Bouie, supra </em>at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Our decision in <em>Lardie, </em>which had the support of six justices, was the settled state of the law at the relevant time of these defendants\u2019 conduct. Due process precludes \u201cretroactive application of a \u2018judicial construction of a criminal statute [that] is \u201cunexpected and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue <em>Doyle, supra </em>at 101, quoting <em>Bouie, supra </em>at 354, quoting Hall, <em>General Principles of Criminal Law </em>(2d ed), p 61. There was nothing in <em>Lardie </em>that suggested that the law was in some state of flux or that this Court\u2019s construction of the statute was less than clear or complete. No fair reading of <em>Lardie </em>would alert a person that <em>Lardie </em>would later be revisited or revised. Thus, at the time of these defendants\u2019 conduct, any construction different than that set forth in <em>Lardie </em>was both unexpected and indefensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The majority\u2019s assertion that \u201cit is not \u2018indefensible or unexpected\u2019 that a court would, as we do today, overrule a case that failed to abide by the express terms of a statute,\u201d completely eliminates the protections against ex post facto punishments and due process violations. See <em>ante </em>at 444 n 80. Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, no new court opinion would ever be \u201cindefensible or unexpected,\u201d because the new opinion would always be \u201ccorrect.\u201d But this ignores the fact that <em>every </em>court believes an opinion it issues is correct, just as the <em>Lardie </em>Court believed in 1996, or it would not issue the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Further, the majority\u2019s reasoning imposes on our citizenry the untenable burden of guessing and predicting when one court might overturn a prior court\u2019s settled interpretation of a statute. I find such a result in grave conflict with the notions of due process and, thus, fatally flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">As such, I disagree that these defendants must again undergo the criminal process under our new interpretation of what was, at the relevant time, settled law. Such a ruling violates the fundamental principles of due process and subjects defendants to ex post facto pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>ishment. While the prosecution had a more difficult burden under <em>Lardie, </em>today\u2019s decision lessens that burden, making our new interpretation an unforeseeable judicial expansion of a criminal statute. Subjecting defendants to a new rule that increases the chance of culpability, when their conduct was committed when the old rule was settled law, is a clear violation of defendants\u2019 constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Accordingly, I would affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of defendant Large\u2019s case because the district court found that, under <em>Lardie, </em>probable cause that defendant committed a crime was nonexistent. The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding so. I would, though, remand defendant Schaefer\u2019s case for a new trial. On remand, I would instruct the trial court to give the jury instruction to which defendant Schaefer was entitled at his original trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\"> Although the Ex Post Facto Clauses do not directly apply to the judiciary, <em>People v Doyle, </em>451 Mich 93, 99; 545 NW2d 627 (1996), citing <em>Marks v United States, </em>430 US 188; 97 S Ct 990; 51 L Ed 2d 260 (1977), the \u201cprinciples are applicable to the judiciary by analogy through the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d <em>Doyle, supra </em>at 100, citing <em>Bouie v City of Columbia, </em>378 US 347; 84 S Ct 1697; 12 L Ed 2d 894 (1964); see also <em>People v Stevenson, </em>416 Mich 383, 395; 331 NW2d 143 (1982); <em>People v Dempster, </em>396 Mich 700, 714-718; 242 NW2d 381 (1976). For the purposes of my analysis, I consider the concepts inextricably intertwined. When a defendant is deprived of due process, and, thus, is subjected to a punishment not available at the time of his or her conduct, this treatment is precisely what is contemplated, and prohibited, under ex post facto principles.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b549-5\">KELLY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOL\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I concur with the majority\u2019s interpretation of MCL 257.625(4). I write separately to note that I too have reexamined the language of MCL 257.625(4) and past readings of it. I continue to believe that the opinion of this Court in <em>People v </em>Lardie<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that of the Court of Appeals on which I sat<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were both correct in ruling that the statute is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The defendant in <em>Lardie </em>had contended and the trial court had found that the statute creates an unconstitutional strict liability, public welfare offense. Both appellate courts disagreed that the statute is unconstitutional. I now believe that the statute does not impose strict liability on the intoxicated driver, as the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Appeals ruled. Nor does it require the prosecutor to prove that the intoxication caused the injury, as this Court ruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\"><em>Lardie </em>presented a different issue than the issue in these cases; it concerned intent. Causation was not the focus in <em>Lardie, </em>but it is here. The question here is what causal link between defendant\u2019s actions and the death does the statute require that the prosecutor show. After thorough consideration, I conclude that the correct interpretation of MCL 257.625(4) is that the prosecutor must prove (1) the defendant was intoxicated and (2) the defendant\u2019s driving was the factual and proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">I agree with Justice CAVANAGH that the majority errs in remanding <em>People v Large </em>for further proceedings under the new rule set forth in its decision. Doing so violates fundamental notions of fairness that are embedded in the Due Process Clause of the federal and state constitutions.
