The trial court granted summary disposition to defendant on both issues, ruling that there was insufficient notice to Ford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>to support the negligent retention theory, and that plaintiff could not pursue a claim under the CRA without demonstrating at least a \u201cquasi-employment\u201d relationship. The Court of Appeals affirmed with respect to the CRA claim, but reversed with respect to plaintiffs negligent retention claim. We hold that: (1) a common-law claim for negligent retention cannot be premised upon workplace sexual harassment; and (2) because plaintiff has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact that defendant affected or controlled a term, condition, or privilege of her employment, she cannot bring a claim against defendant under the CRA. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and reinstate the. trial court\u2019s order of summary disposition in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Defendant Ford Motor Company hired AVI Food Systems to operate three cafeterias at its Wixom assembly plant. Plaintiff Milissa McClements was hired by AVI as a cashier at the Wixom plant in March 1998.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff testified that Daniel Bennett, then a superintendent in the predelivery department of the plant, had in November 1998<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> invited her on \u201cthree or four\u201d occasions to meet him at a local fast food restaurant. On each occasion, plaintiff rebuffed his invitation. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ing to plaintiff, Bennett \u201cseemed very persistent, like he didn\u2019t understand that I wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d Plaintiff acknowledged that, at this point, Bennett was polite, and there was no testimony that he used sexual or foul language. Bennett denies making any such invitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Plaintiff described two additional encounters with Bennett that occurred during this same time period. During the first of these encounters, Bennett allegedly entered the cafeteria while it was closed, and approached plaintiff from behind. Plaintiff testified that \u201cI was facing the opposite way. He came up and just grabbed me and turned me around and stuck his tongue in my mouth.\u201d After \u201ca few days,\u201d plaintiff allegedly had a second encounter with Bennett in the closed cafeteria. According to plaintiff, Bennett again grabbed her from behind, attempted to stick his tongue in her mouth, and stated, \u201cCome on, I know you want it. Isn\u2019t there somewhere we can go and have sex?\u201d Plaintiff refused this advance, and Bennett left the cafeteria. Plaintiff allegedly reported the incidents to her union steward, but claims that she was advised that if she reported the incident to defendant, it would \u201cturn around and stab you in the back and you [would] end up losing your job.\u201d Plaintiff did not report the incident to either defendant or AVI until the instant lawsuit was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In 2000, plaintiff was approached by another Ford employee, Justine Maldonado,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who claimed that she had also been sexually harassed by Bennett. Specifically, Maldonado claimed that in January or February 1998, Bennett exposed himself to her and demanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>oral sex in the parking lot of the Wixom plant. Bennett also allegedly followed Maldonado in his car, got out after she had stopped at a floral shop, and reached into her car and tugged on her blouse. In late-October 1998, Maldonado told Joe Howard, her uncle and a production manager at Wixom, about the incidents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During \u201cthe last couple days\u201d in October, Maldonado told David Ferris, a former Ford superintendent who was on temporary assignment to her union, about the incidents. Maldonado testified that she spoke with Ferris just before undergoing knee surgery on November 2, 1998. Ferris testified that \u201ctwo or three days\u201d later, he confronted Bennett about Maldonado\u2019s accusations. The next day, Ferris informed Jerome Rush, Wixom\u2019s director of labor relations, about the alleged incidents of sexual harassment. Ferris testified that the conversation lasted a minute \u201cat the most.\u201d Rush allegedly told Ferris that he \u201cneed not be involved in these types of issues\u201d and took no further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Even after learning of the Maldonado incidents, plaintiff did not come forward with her allegations. However, plaintiffs attitude changed after Maldonado informed her in August 2001 that Bennett had exposed himself to three teenage girls. In 1995, Bennett was convicted of misdemeanor indecent exposure, for exposing himself to three teenage girls on 1-275 while he was driving a company car. Defendant was aware of the incident, because the police determined Bennett\u2019s identity by tracing the car through Ford.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>After learning about the indecent exposure arrest and conviction, plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit in September 2001. Plaintiff claimed that defendant: (1) negligently retained Bennett, whom it knew had a propensity to sexually harass women; and (2) breached its obligation under the CRA to prevent Bennett from sexually harassing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition. First, the trial court found that there was no evidence that defendant knew of Bennett\u2019s propensity to sexually harass women in the workplace. Maldonado\u2019s complaints to her uncle and friend were not sufficient to give defendant notice of Bennett\u2019s sexually harassing behavior and the 1995 conviction alone is insufficient to establish that propensity. Thus, defendant could not be held liable under the negligent retention theory. Second, the trial court found that plaintiff as a nonemployee could not hold defendant liable under the CRA. However, even if defendant were potentially liable under the CRA, it could not be held liable under these circumstances, because its higher management was never made aware of the allegedly sexually harassing behavior. In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the trial court. Unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued April 22, 2004 (Docket No. 243764). The Court of Appeals held that defendant\u2019s knowledge of the indecent exposure arrest and Maldonado\u2019s allegations created a genuine issue of material fact whether defendant \u201cknew or should have known of Bennett\u2019s sexually derogatory behavior toward female employees.\u201d However, the Court of Appeals also applied the \u201ceconomic reality test,\u201d <em>Ashker v Ford Motor Co, </em>245 Mich App 9, 14; 627 NW2d 1 (2001), and held that defendant was not plaintiffs employer. As a result, the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>concluded that plaintiff could not maintain a CRA complaint against an entity that is not her employer. This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal, as well as plaintiffs application for leave to file a cross-appeal. 471 Mich 937 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">We review de novo the grant or denial of a motion for summary disposition. <em>Kreiner v Fischer, </em>471 Mich 109, 129; 683 NW2d 611 (2004). A motion under MCR 2.116(C)(10) tests the factual support of a plaintiffs claim. <em>Spiek v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>456 Mich 331, 337; 572 NW2d 201 (1998). Summary disposition is only permitted if the evidence, while viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, fails to establish a claim as a matter of law. <em>Wilkinson v Lee, </em>463 Mich 388, 391; 617 NW2d 305 (2000). We review de novo the questions whether the CRA displaces a common-law claim for negligent retention based upon sexual harassment in the workplace and whether an employer can be held liable under the CRA for sexual harassment against a nonemployee because they are questions of law. <em>Morales v Auto-Owners Ins Co (After Remand), </em>469 Mich 487, 490; 672 NW2d 849 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The issue in this case is not whether Bennett has engaged in reprehensible conduct either inside or outside the workplace. Rather, the issues are: (1) whether defendant negligently retained Bennett as a supervisor as of the time Bennett allegedly sexually harassed plaintiff, despite the fact that it knew or should have known of his propensity to sexually harass women; and (2) whether defendant is responsible under the CRA for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>failing to prevent sexual harassment of plaintiff even though plaintiff was not a direct employee of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">A. NEGLIGENT RETENTION CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Plaintiffs first theory is that defendant negligently retained Bennett as a supervisor aftef learning of his propensity to sexually harass women. In general, an employer is not responsible for an intentional tort in the workplace committed by its employee acting outside the scope of employment. <em>Martin v Jones, </em>302 Mich 355, 358; 4 NW2d 686 (1942). However, this Court has previously recognized an exception to this general rule of liability when the employer \u201c \u2018knew or should have known of his employee\u2019s propensities and criminal record before commission of an intentional tort by [that] employee ....\u2019\u201d <em>Hersh v Kentfield Builders, Inc, </em>385 Mich 410, 412; 189 NW2d 286 (1971) (citation omitted). Plaintiff argues that defendant knew of Bennett\u2019s \u201cpropensity\u201d to engage in sexually harassing behavior because of: (1) Bennett\u2019s 1995 indecent exposure conviction; and (2) Maldonado\u2019s complaints to defendant\u2019s supervisor (Howard) and labor relations representative (Rush) concerning Bennett\u2019s harassment. Plaintiff concludes that defendant breached its duty of reasonable care by retaining Bennett despite its knowledge of his previous actions. The Court of Appeals held that whether defendant \u201cknew or should have known\u201d of Bennett\u2019s propensities was a question of fact for the jury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>However, in those cases in which we have held that an employer can be held liable on the basis of its knowledge of an employee\u2019s propensities, the underlying conduct comprised the common-law tort of assault. See <em>Hersh, supra </em>at 412; <em>Bradley v Stevens, </em>329 Mich 556, 563; 46 NW2d 382 (1951). In the instant case, however, the entire premise for plaintiffs negligent retention claim is the <em>statutorily based </em>tort of sexual harassment. Before passage of the CRA, Michigan did not provide a common-law remedy for workplace discrimination. <em>Pompey v Gen Motors Corp, </em>385 Mich 537, 552; 189 NW2d 243 (1971). Plaintiffs protections against being sexually harassed in the workplace are wholly creatures of statute. \u201c \u2018Where a statute gives new rights and prescribes new remedies, such remedies must be strictly pursued; and a party seeking a remedy under the act is confined to the remedy conferred thereby and to that only.\u2019 \u201d <em>Monroe Beverage Co, Inc v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>454 Mich 41, 45; 559 NW2d 297 (1997), quoting <em>Lafayette Transfer &amp; Storage Co v Pub Utilities Comm, </em>287 Mich 488, 491; 283 NW 659 (1939). Here, the CRA provides the right to be free from sexual harassment, MCL 37.2103(i), and accords an aggrieved worker the remedy of \u201ca civil action for appropriate injunctive relief or damages, or both.\u201d MCL 37.2801(1). Plaintiffs remedy, then, for any act of sexual harassment is limited to those provided by the CRA. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ingly, there is no common-law claim for negligent retention in the context of workplace sexual harassment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Plaintiff invokes MCL 37.2803, which states that the CRA \u201cshall not be construed to diminish the right of a person to direct or immediate legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state.\u201d However, contrary to the dissent\u2019s theory, <em>post </em>at 397, this statutory language does not allow a worker to bring a CRA claim under the guise of a negligent retention claim. Rather, this provision simply allows a worker to bring suit under any legal theory that existed before the passage of the CRA. Thus, a worker would not be barred by the CRA from bringing a common-law negligent retention claim, as long as the premise for that claim is a tort that existed before passage of civil rights legislation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Therefore, because the CRA provides the exclusive remedy for a claim based on sexual harassment, plaintiff has failed to establish a claim of negligent retention,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and no inquiry into whether defendant possessed sufficient notice that Bennett was engaged in sexual harassment is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>B. CIVIL RIGHTS ACT CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Plaintiffs second theory is that defendant failed to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace. MCL 37.2202(1) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">An employer shall not do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">(a) Fail or refuse to hire or recruit, discharge, or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to employment, compensation, or a term, condition, or privilege of employment, because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">(b) Limit, segregate, or classify an employee or applicant for employment in a way that deprives or tends to deprive the employee or applicant of an employment opportunity, or otherwise adversely affects the status of an employee or applicant because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">(c) Segregate, classify, or otherwise discriminate against a person on the basis of sex with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment, including, but not limited to, a benefit plan or system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Discrimination based on sex includes sexual harassment. MCL 37.2103(i). The statute defines sexual harassment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">Sexual harassment means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature under the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">(i) Submission to the conduct or communication is made a term or condition either explicitly or implicitly to obtain employment, public accommodations or public services, education, or housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-13\"><em>(ii) </em>Submission to or rejection of the conduct or communication by an individual is used as a factor in decisions affecting the individual\u2019s employment, public accommodations or public services, education, or housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>(iii) The conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual\u2019s employment, public accommodations or public services, education, or housing, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive employment, public accommodations, public services, educational, or housing environment. [MCL 37.2103(i).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Plaintiff claims that CRA forbids <em>any </em>entity classified as an employer from discriminating against <em>any </em>individual, including nonemployees. Therefore, because the actions of defendant\u2019s employee allegedly created a sexually hostile work environment, defendant can be held hable under the CRA. Defendant, on the other hand, argues that an employer can only be held liable for discrimination against a nonemployee if some form of employment relationship exists between the parties. Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals held that plaintiff was required to prove at least a \u201cquasi-employment relationship\u201d before a claim under the CRA could be maintained. We conclude that, unless an individual can establish a genuine issue of material fact that an employer affected or controlled a term, condition, or privilege of his or her employment, a nonemployee may not bring a claim under the CRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Fundamental canons of statutory interpretation require us to discern and give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent as expressed by the language of its statutes. <em>DiBenedetto v West Shore Hosp, </em>461 Mich 394, 402; 605 NW2d 300 (2000). If the language is unambiguous, as is generally the case, <em>Klapp v United Ins Group Agency, Inc, </em>468 Mich 459; 663 NW2d 447 (2003), \u201cwe presume that the Legislature intended the meaning clearly expressed \u2014 no further judicial construction is required or permitted, and the statute must be enforced as written.\u201d <em>DiBenedetto, supra </em>at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>MCL 37.2201(a) defines an \u201cemployer\u201d for purposes of the CRA as \u201ca person who has 1 or more employees, and includes an agent of that person.\u201d As recognized by plaintiff, the language of the statute does not otherwise narrow the scope of who may be considered an employer. Thus, MCL 37.2202 forbids <em>any </em>employer from engaging in acts of discrimination that are prohibited by the CRA. MCL 37.2202 does not state that an employer is only forbidden from engaging in such acts against its own employees. Indeed, the CRA appears to clearly envision claims by nonemployees for the failure or refusal to hire or recruit, MCL 37.2202(l)(a); the improper classification of applicants by a status prohibited under the CRA, MCL 37.2202(l)(b); and the discrimination against former employees by operation of a benefit plan or system, MCL 37.2202(l)(c). Accordingly, to limit the availability of relief under the CRA to those suits brought by an employee against his or her employer is not consistent with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">However, the language of the statute is also clear in requiring some form of nexus or connection between the employer and the status of the nonemployee. MCL 37.2202 forbids an employer from using a classification protected by the CRA: to \u201cdiscriminate against an individual with respect to .. . a term, condition, or privilege of employment,\u201d MCL 37.2202(1)(a); to \u201cdeprive the ... applicant of an employment opportunity,\u201d MCL 37.2202(l)(b); or to \u201cdiscriminate against a person . . . with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment,\u201d MCL 37.2202(1)(c). In other words, an employer is liable under the CRA when it utilizes a prohibited characteristic in order to adversely affect or control an individual\u2019s employment or potential employment. Thus, the key to liability under the CRA is not simply the status of an individual as an \u201cemployee\u201d; rather, liability is contingent upon the employer\u2019s af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>fecting or controlling that individual\u2019s work status. Accordingly, an employer can be held liable under the CRA for discriminatory acts against a nonemployee if the nonemployee can demonstrate that the employer affected or controlled a term, condition, or privilege of the nonemployee\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">In <em>Chiles v Machine Shop, Inc, </em>238 Mich App 462; 606 NW2d 398 (1999), the Court of Appeals came to the same conclusion while interpreting similar language in the Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act (PWD-CRA), MCL 37.1202.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Chiles, </em>an employee injured his back on the job and filed for worker\u2019s compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>benefits. After he was laid off, the employee brought suit under the PWDCRA. The \u201cemployer,\u201d who laid off the plaintiff, argued that it was not liable under the PWDCRA because the employee was technically employed by a separate, though affiliated, company. The Court in <em>Chiles </em>noted that the PWDCRA</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">addresses the conduct of an \u201cemployer\u201d who <em>takes adverse employment action against </em>an \u201cindividual\u201d because of a handicap that is unrelated to the individual\u2019s ability to perform the duties of a particular job. MCL 37.1202(l)(a); MSA 3.550(202)(l)(a). The act does not limit the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d to the plaintiffs employer but, instead, simply defines it as a \u201cperson who has 1 or more employees.\u201d MCL 37.1201(b); MSA 3.550(201)(b). <em>[Chiles, supra </em>at 468 (emphasis supplied).][<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Thus, liability under the PWDCRA \u201cdoes not require that an employment relationship exist,\u201d but it does require that the employer defendant \u201chave the authority to affect a plaintiffs employment or potential employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468-469. However, the authority to affect a worker\u2019s employment <em>alone </em>is not sufficient to impose liability upon an employer defendant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Rather, in order to be liable under the PWDCRA, the employer defendant must also \u201ctake[] adverse employment action\u201d against the worker plaintiff. Accordingly, under <em>Chiles, </em>the employer defendant must (1) have \u201cthe ability to affect adversely the terms and conditions of an individual\u2019s employment or potential employment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 468; and (2) \u201ctake[] adverse employment action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>against an \u2018individual\u2019 because of a handicap that is unrelated to the individual\u2019s ability to perform the duties of a particular job .... e.g., discriminatorily refusing to hire an applicant on account of a disability,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 468, quoting MCL 37.1202(l)(a). In other words, the more precise articulation of the <em>Chiles </em>rule is that the employer defendant must, in fact, <em>use </em>such authority by \u201ctak[ing] adverse employment action against an individual\u201d in violation of the PWDCRA. Thus, to be liable under the PWDCRA, the employer defendant must actually affect or control a term, condition, or privilege of an individual\u2019s employment. The Court of Appeals in <em>Chiles </em>determined that the employer defendant directly supervised the employee, controlled what tasks he worked at, and had the ability to fire or discipline the employee. Further, the employer defendant actually affected the plaintiffs employment by laying him off. As a result, the Court of Appeals determined that the parties\u2019 relationship fell within the scope of the PWDCRA and, therefore, the plaintiff could maintain an action under the PWDCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">We hold that a worker is entitled to bring an action against a nonemployer defendant if the worker can establish that the defendant affected or controlled a term, condition, or privilege of the worker\u2019s employment. In the instant case, plaintiff has failed to establish that defendant affected or controlled a term, condition, or privilege of her employment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>hired, paid, and subject to discipline by AVI. AVI placed plaintiff in the Wixom plant and had the sole authority to move her to different cafeterias or even to another plant. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that defendant affected or controlled whether she was hired, her benefits of employment, or where she was assigned to work. Further, although the cafeterias were located in the Wixom plant, they were operated solely by AVI, and were off-limits to defendant\u2019s employees except during break-times.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">We conclude that plaintiff failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that defendant affected or controlled a term, condition, or privilege of her employment. Accordingly, plaintiff may not maintain a cause of action under the CRA against this defendant, and, again, no inquiry into whether defendant possessed sufficient notice that Bennett was engaged in sexual harassment is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">We conclude that plaintiff has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact that defendant affected or controlled a term, condition, or privilege of her employment and, therefore, she cannot bring a claim against defendant under the CRA. Further, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>that a common-law claim for negligent retention cannot be premised upon workplace sexual harassment. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals that plaintiff has failed to establish that she may bring a claim under the CRA against this defendant, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals that plaintiff has an actionable claim for negligent retention, and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order of judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b485-4\">TAYLOR, C.J., and CORRIGAN and YOUNG, JJ., concurred with MARKMAN, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\"> Within a month, plaintiff filed a complaint with AVI alleging that she was sexually harassed by a non-AVI contractor.

We agree that whether a duty exists to a particular plaintiff is a question for the court. <em>Williams v Cunningham Drug Stores, Inc, </em>429 Mich 495, 500-501; 418 NW2d 381 (1988). An employer\u2019s duty is to exercise reasonable care in selecting and retaining its employees. However, it is the province of the jury to determine whether an employer has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>breached that duty by retaining the employee in question. In order for the jury to determine whether an employer has breached this duty, it must first determine whether the employer \u201cknew or should have known\u201d that its employee had a propensity to engage in the conduct that caused the injury to the plaintiff. The propensity at issue in the instant case is an alleged propensity to sexually harass women. Because plaintiffs exclusive remedy for a claim based on sexual harassment is the CEA, there is no question of fact for the jury and, therefore, summary disposition was appropriate. .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\"> We note defendant\u2019s assertion that the <em>Hersh </em>rule is contrary to public policy concerning the rehabilitation of first-time offenders. According to defendant, <em>Hersh </em>encourages employers to refuse to hire anyone who was ever convicted of even a misdemeanor, for fear that they might later be held hable for any conduct by the employee that somehow could be linked, after the fact, to the circumstances of that crime. Because we hold that plaintiffs neghgent retention claim cannot be maintained, there is no need at this time to reach defendant\u2019s pubhc policy argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\"> For example, if an employee had a history of committing simple assault, and the employer knew or should have known of that history, then a third party who was assaulted by the employee might be able to hold the employer hable under a neghgent retention theory premised on simple assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\"> Both the dissent and the concurrence/dissent argue that plaintiffs neghgent retention claim \u201cimplicates other torts such as assault and battery.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 392. While that may be, plaintiff premised her claim on sexual harassment, not assault or battery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b481-5\"> For example, a secretary who works for a temporary employment agency might not be an \u201cemployee\u201d at the office where she is sent to fill in. However, there is little question that the employer at that office would dictate a term, condition, or privilege of her employment with the temporary employment agency, at least during the pendency of her temporary employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\"> This provision of the PWDCRA is identical in all relevant respects to the CRA.

MCL 37.2201(l)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\"> Thus, contrary to the concurrence\\dissent\u2019s position, the fact that plaintiff produced <em>some </em>evidence that defendant had the ability to \u201caffect or control a term, condition, or privilege of plaintiffs employment,\u201d <em>post </em>at 391, is not sufficient to present a genuine issue of material fact for the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b483-5\"> The dissent argues that, because defendant had the authority to control Bennett and Bennett affected a condition of plaintiffs employment, it follows that defendant itself \u201caffect[ed] a condition of plaintiffs employment.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 396. Based on this reasoning, an employer would apparently <em>always </em>be liable for its agent\u2019s creation of a sexually hostile work environment. However, we have held that such imposition of vicarious liability is proper only in sexual discrimination cases in which the employer\u2019s agent has used his or her authority to affect an individu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>al\u2019s employment. <em>Chambers v Trettco, Inc, </em>463 Mich 297, 310; 614 NW2d 910 (2000), citing <em>Champion v Nation Wide Security, Inc, </em>450 Mich 702, 708-709; 545 NW2d 596 (1996). We have declined to treat sexually hostile work environment cases in the same manner, noting that \u201cstrict imposition of vicarious liability on an employer \u2018is illogical in a pure hostile environment setting\u2019 because, generally, in such a case, \u2018the supervisor acts outside \u2018the scope of actual or apparent authority to hire, fire, discipline, or promote.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chambers, supra </em>at 311, quoting <em>Radtke v Everett, </em>442 Mich 368, 396 n 46; 501 NW2d 155 (1993). We again decline to strictly impose vicarious liability in sexually hostile work environment cases, absent an awareness by the employer of the offensive conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b485-5\">WEAVER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8B\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I concur in the majority\u2019s holding that a worker may bring a claim against a nonemployer defendant under the Civil Rights Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> if the worker can establish that the nonemployer defendant affected or controlled a term, condition, or privilege of the worker\u2019s employment. <em>Ante </em>at 389. But I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff failed to present a genuine issue of material fact that defendant affected or controlled a term, condition, or privilege of plaintiffs employment. As noted by the majority, when plaintiff reported the incidents to her union steward, she stated that she was advised that if she reported the incidents to defendant, defendant would \u201c \u2018turn around and stab you in the back and you [would] end up losing your job.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 377. While this statement standing alone would probably not be sufficient to establish that defendant did, in fact, affect or control a term, condition, or privilege of plaintiffs employment, it does raise a question whether defendant had that ability. Therefore, I would allow the parties to present evidence on this issue and let the question go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>I also dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff may not pursue a common-law claim for negligent retention. As noted by the majority, MCL 37.2803 provides that \u201c[t]his act shall not be construed to diminish the right of a person to direct or immediate legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state.\u201d As explained in <em>Hersh v Kentfield Builders, Inc, </em>385 Mich 410, 412; 189 NW2d 286 (1971), under the common-law claim of negligent retention, an employer may be held liable for an intentional tort committed by one of its employees if the employer \u201c \u2018knew or should have known of his employee\u2019s propensities and criminal record before commission of an intentional tort....\u2019\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The majority asserts that plaintiff may not pursue a common-law negligent retention claim because the claim is premised entirely on \u201cthe statutorily based tort of sexual harassment.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 382 (emphasis deleted). I disagree. Plaintiffs negligent retention claim is not premised solely on \u201cthe statutorily based tort of sexual harassment,\u201d but also implicates other torts such as assault and battery. Therefore, I would allow plaintiff the opportunity to establish her negligent retention claim and let the jury determine whether she has successfully done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">CAVANAGH, J. (dissenting). I believe there is ample evidence for a jury to decide the issue of whether defendant had adequate notice that one of its supervisors, Daniel Bennett, had the propensity to sexually harass and assault women and was indeed doing so. Accordingly, because plaintiff presented sufficient evidence of notice, a jury should be allowed to determine plaintiffs claims against defendant for sexual harassment under the Civil Rights Act (CRA), MCL 37.2101 <em>et </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>seq., </em>and negligent retention. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision dismissing all of plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">I. THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT DEFENDANT HAD NOTICE OF BENNETT\u2019S PROPENSITY FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT AND ALLEGATIONS THAT HE WAS INDEED SEXUALLY HARASSING AND ASSAULTING WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Plaintiff presented sufficient evidence that defendant had adequate notice of Bennett\u2019s propensity to sexually harass and assault women and the pervasiveness of the existing sexual harassment perpetrated by Bennett. Bennett was one of defendant\u2019s supervisors. In 1995, defendant learned that Bennett had exposed himself to three teenage girls while driving one of defendant\u2019s vehicles. Bennett was convicted of indecent exposure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the facts related to this conviction alone may not be enough to put defendant on notice, defendant received other information that Bennett was sexually harassing women.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In late October 1998, Justine Maldonado, another of defendant\u2019s employees, reported to a production manager that Bennett was sexually harassing her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Maldonado also told another of defendant\u2019s employees, David Ferris, about the sexual harassment. Ferris told Jerome Rush, defendant\u2019s director of labor relations at defendant\u2019s Wixom plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Maldonado\u2019s complaint was not the first complaint of this nature against Bennett. As detailed in <em>Elezovic v Ford Motor Co, </em>472 Mich 408, 433, 442-444; 697 NW2d 851 (2005) (CAVANAGH, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part; WEAVER, J., concurring in part and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>dissenting in part), defendant also had notice in October 1998 that Lula Elezovic had stated that Bennett sexually harassed her. This information was shared with the director of labor relations-i/ie <em>same director of labor relations </em>who learned of Maldonado\u2019s complaints. Further, other coworkers had also discussed sexual harassment involving Bennett with the director of labor relations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">An employer can only avoid liability if it <em>adequately investigates a claim of sexual harassment </em>and takes prompt and appropriate remedial action. <em>Radtke v Everett, </em>442 Mich 368, 396; 501 NW2d 155 (1993). Managers and the director of labor relations knew of claims that Bennett was sexually harassing women. These claims, along with knowledge that Bennett had exposed himself to three teenage girls, are sufficient evidence to allow a jury to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, defendant adequately investigated these claims and took appropriate remedial action. See <em>Chambers v Trettco, Inc, </em>463 Mich 297, 312, 318-319; 614 NW2d 910 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">II. PLAINTIFF CAN BRING A CLAIM AGAINST DEFENDANT UNDER THE CRA</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The CRA, in MCL 37.2201(a), defines \u201c[e]mployer\u201d as <em>\u201ca </em>person who has 1 or more employees, and includes an agent of that person.\u201d An employer is prohibited from discriminating against an individual by doing any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>(a) Fail or refuse to hire or recruit, discharge, or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to employment, compensation, or a term, condition, or privilege of employment, because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">(b) Limit, segregate, or classify an employee or applicant for employment in a way that deprives or tends to deprive the employee or applicant of an employment opportunity, or otherwise adversely affects the status of an employee or applicant because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">(c) Segregate, classify, or otherwise discriminate against a person on the basis of sex with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment, including, but not limited to, a benefit plan or system. [MCL 37.2202(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u201cDiscrimination because of sex includes sexual harassment.\u201d MCL 37.2103(i).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">Sexual harassment means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature under the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\"><em>(Hi) </em>The conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual\u2019s employment, public accommodations or public services, education, or housing, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive employment, public accommodations, public services, educational, or , housing environment. [MCL 37.2103(i)(iii).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The majority acknowledges that the CRA allows for claims by nonemployees, but the majority states that \u201cunless an individual can establish a genuine issue of material fact that an employer affected or controlled the terms, conditions, or privileges of his or her employment, a nonemployee may not bring a claim under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>CRA.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 385. According to the majority, plaintiff cannot bring a claim against defendant because \u201c[pjlaintiff was hired, paid, and subject to discipline by AVI [Food Systems]. AVI placed plaintiff in the Wixom plant and had the sole authority to move her to different cafeterias or even to another plant.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 389-390. The majority\u2019s application of the statute in this case iignores the specific language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">MCL 37.2202(l)(a) states that an employer cannot \u201cotherwise discriminate ag\u00e1inst an individual with respect to ... a term, condition, or privilege of employment . . ..\u201d Discrimination includes sexual harassment. MCL 37.2103(i). Sexual harassment includes creating a sexually hostile or offensive work environment, MCL 37.2103(i)(iii), and this is exactly what defendant, through its supervisor Bennett, allegedly did to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Defendant\u2019s supervisor, Bennett, did not merely have the ability or authority to affect a condition of plaintiffs employment, he allegedly did so because plaintiff alleged Bennett\u2019s conduct created a sexually hostile work environment at plaintiff\u2019s workplace. Notably, defendant was the only one who had the authority to control <em>Bennett </em>and, therefore, affect a condition of plaintiff\u2019s employment. The CRA prohibits sexual harassment by an employer or an employer\u2019s agent. Bennett was defendant\u2019s agent when he allegedly sexually harassed plaintiff. Therefore, plaintiff can bring a claim against defendant for sexual harassment under the CRA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>III. PLAINTIFF CAN BRING A CLAIM AGAINST DEFENDANT FOR NEGLIGENT RETENTION</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">MCL 37.2803 states that the CRA \u201cshall not be construed to diminish the right of a person to direct or immediate legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state.\u201d When a statute provides a remedy for enforcement of a common-law right, it is cumulative and not exclusive. <em>Pompey v Gen Motors Corp, </em>385 Mich 537, 552-553; 189 NW2d 243 (1971). The passage of the CRA did not abolish plaintiffs right to bring a negligent retention claim against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">As stated by plaintiffs counsel during oral argument, Bennett\u2019s conduct, while indeed sexual harassment, was also \u201cclassic assault and battery, [a] common law tort.\u201d Plaintiffs complaint also alleged that Bennett posed a \u201cknown danger to women\u201d and \u201csexually assaulted\u201d plaintiff. Plaintiffs claim that Bennett grabbed her and tried to put his tongue in her mouth, as well as Maldonado\u2019s claims that Bennett assaulted her and exposed himself to her and Elezovic\u2019s claims that Bennett assaulted her, certainly qualify as assaultive behavior. See, e.g., <em>Radtke, supra </em>at 395 (sexual assault can be sexual harassment that creates a hostile work environment).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence that defendant was aware of Bennett\u2019s propensity to sexually harass and assault women and that defendant negligently retained Bennett in light of this information. See <em>Hersh v Kentfield Builders, Inc, </em>385 Mich 410, 412, 415; 189 NW2d 286 (1971). Accordingly, I believe that plaintiff can present a claim for common-law negligent retention to a jury, and the jury should decide whether defendant acted reasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">I believe that plaintiff presented sufficient evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>that defendant had adequate notice of Bennett\u2019s propensity to sexually harass and assault women and that Bennett was indeed doing so in the workplace. It is then a question for the jury whether defendant\u2019s subsequent conduct was reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in part and allow plaintiff to proceed on her claim under the CRA. I would also affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in part and allow plaintiff to proceed on her claim for negligent retention.</p>\n<judges id=\"b492-4\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-6\"> MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\"> This conviction was later expunged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-9\"> The production manager was also Maldonado\u2019s uncle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\"> Interestingly, in yet another case involving Bennett, <em>Perez v Ford Motor Co, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 10, 2005 (Docket No. 249737), slip op at 3, the Court of Appeals notes, \u201cDefendant admits that the proper procedure for reporting a sexual harassment claim was to report to the <em>labor relations department </em>or a UAW committeeperson.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\"> Contrary to the majority\u2019s presentation of the dissent\u2019s position, see <em>ante </em>at 389 n 14, defendant would be hable only if it had notice and did not adequately investigate the claim and take prompt and appropriate remedial measures, just as in all other hostile work environment sexual harassment cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
