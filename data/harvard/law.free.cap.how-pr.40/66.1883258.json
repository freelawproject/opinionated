This motion, on the order to show cause, came on before his Honor Justice Ingraham, and his Honor denied the motion in part and granted it in part. That is, Judge Ingraham struck out some portion of the complaint as irrelevant, and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>nied the motion to strike out certain other parts of the complaint as irrelevant, or to make more definite and certain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\">The defendants now appeal from so much of the order of Justice Ingraham as refuses to strike out certain parts '.of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint as irrelevant, and to make more definite and certain.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ARb\">Thomas Allison, <em>attorney, and</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ADs\">Henry L.

The orders refusing to strike out irrelevant matters, and to compel the plaintiffs to make the allegations in their complaints more definite and certain, are appealable as involving the merits or affecting a substantial right. <em>(See Code \u00a7 </em>349.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-9\">It is clearly \u201c a substantial right,\u201d possessed by both parties to go to trial only upon <em>material </em>and <em>issueable </em>facts. This \u201csubstantial right\u201d can be protected and enforced in no other way than by having the pleadings purged of irrelevant matters, and made more definite and certain where the allegations are so loose and indefinite as not to apprise (within the rules of pleading), the defendants of the facts sought to be established against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-10\">In <em>Hunter </em>agt. <em>Powell, </em>15 <em>How., </em>221, the court at general term entertained an appeal from an order at special term, striking out portions of a complaint, and decided the matter upon its merits. The right to appeal under the section of the Code above cited, on' the ground that the order affected a substantial right, was so clear that it was not questioned by the counsel on either sid\u2019e, or by any of the judges. (Allen, James and Rosekrans,) constituting the general term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-11\">In <em>Seeley </em>agt. <em>Engel, </em>3 <em>Kern., </em>548, Denio, Ch, J., in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>speaking of an <em>allegation </em>which was loose and general, says : <em>\u201c </em>If the allegation in that respect was too general in its terms, the remedy of the plaintiff was, by a motion under section 160, to compel the defendant to make it more certain. <em>(The People </em>agt. <em>Ryder, 2 Kern., </em>433.) By omitting to do this, and especially by replying, as though he understood what was intended to be set up, <em>he was \u00a1precluded from objecting to </em>the evidence on the trial.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AP0\">- If the defendants, in the cases at bar, are compelled to answer while the allegations in the complaints remain so loose and indefinite, they will be precluded from objecting to evidence on the trial of any facts not specified in the complaints, but which ought to be stated in them, in' order to apprize the defendants of the specific charges sought to be made against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-6\">In <em>White agt. Spencer, </em>(14 N. Y., 250,) Denio, Ch. J., says, after reviewing the authorities : \u201c The doctrine established by these cases is, that a defective pleading, <em>though the defect he of one substance, </em>will not warrant the judge at the circuit in excluding evidence of the claim or defence thus imperfectly set up.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-7\">In <em>Wall </em>agt. <em>The Buffalo Water Works Co., </em>18 <em>N. Y., 122, </em>Rosevelt, J., in delivering the opinion <em>of </em>the majority of the court of appeals, says: \u201c But the plaintiff, if dissatisfied with the vagueness and uncertainty of the pleading had his remedy by motion. Not having applied at the proper time for an order to compel the defendants to be <em>\u2018 </em>more definite and certain,\u2019 he is presumed to have been satisfied with the pleading as it stood, especially as he knew-that under the present system, it was made the duty of the court to construe pleadings liberally, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-8\">In <em>Quintard </em>agt. <em>Newton, </em>5 <em>Rob., </em>79,. Roberston, Ch. J., in delivering the opinion of the court at general term, says: \u201c Where a defendant, therefore, has omitted to move to make more definite and certain, or to strike out irrelevant or redundant matter, it may be assumed that he fully un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>derstands the nature of the charge against him, and is prepared to meet it, and that nothing contained in the complaint is to be rejected, as irrelevant or redundant, provided it relates to a cause of action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-5\">The principle underlying the above decisions are also recognized and adj udicated in the following cases: <em>(Curry </em>agt. <em>Coles, </em>6 <em>Bos,, </em>452; <em>McMurray </em>agt. <em>Gifford, 5 How,, </em>14; <em>Burrall </em>agt. <em>Bowen, </em>21 <em>How,, </em>378.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-7\">IL The order at special term, should be reversed so far as it denies the motions to strike out, or make definite and certain the portions of the complaints specified in appellant\u2019s points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-8\">H. Daily, Jr., <em>attorney and counsel for plaintiffs, and respondents.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-10\">I. An order refusing to strike out certain portions of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint as irrelevant, is not an appealable order. It does not <em>(i </em>involve the merits, or any part thereof.\u201d The very ground of this motion is, that the matter sought to be stricken out, <em>\u201cis irrelevant\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-11\">If the matter is <em>irrelevant </em>it <em>cannot involve the merits, </em>and if it does <em>not </em>involve the merits, then <em>the order is not appealable. (Bedell </em>agt. <em>Stickles, </em>4 <em>How., </em>432; <em>Whitney </em>agt. <em>Whitney, </em>4 <em>How., </em>313; \u00a7 349 <em>of the Code.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-12\">If, however, it should be claimed that the matter does involve the merits, then the order of Justice Ingraham is right in refusing to strike out the merits, and his order should be affirmed if the appeal is entertained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-13\">The order of Justice Ingraham is clearly right. The power to strike out matters in a pleading as irrelevant or redundant, has always been cautiously exercised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-14\">II. The power to strike out parts of a pleading should be carefully exercised, and a motion of this kind should be denied, unless it clearly appears that the defendant will be greatly prejudiced by the retention of the alleged matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>in the pleading. In this case, no such fact appears. <em>(The People </em>agt. <em>McCumber, et al., </em>18 <em>N. Y., </em>315; <em>Webb </em>agt. <em>Van </em>Zant, 16 <em>Abb., </em>190.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-5\"><em>It </em>this appeal is entertained, then the order of Justice - Ingraham should be affirmed with costs.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\">At a general term of the supreme court of the state of New York, held at the county court house in the city of New York, on the 7th day of June, A.D. 1870.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Present, <em>Hon. </em>George G.

L. Clinton, Esq., in favor of appellant, and H. Daily, Jr. Esq., in favor of the respondent: It is ordered, that said appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed, and the order of Justice Ingraham affirmed, with costs, on the ground that the order of his Honor, Justice Ingraham is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">A like order was entered in each of the other two causes,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
