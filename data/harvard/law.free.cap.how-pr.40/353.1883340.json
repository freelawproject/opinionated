Whaley recovered a judgment in supreme court, against Albert Babcock, Richard Skinner and Samuel P. Marsh, for the sum of $1,140 14, damages and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-11\">In 1867, the judgment was still outstanding, due and unpaid. Previous to 1867, Marsh had taken the benefit of the two-third act, Skinner had moved to Little Falls, in Herkimer county, and Babcock remained in Oneida county, but his property was so covered that Whaley had never attempted to collect the judgment of him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-12\">Dr. Whaley regarded Skinner as an honest man, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>poof. He had paid to Dr. Whaley his individual indebtedness, and Dr. Whaley and he were friends, and the doctos.\u2019 <em>did not intend to press the judgment against Skinner.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-5\">About the 1st of December, 1867, White (the plaintiff) <em>'who was an attorney </em>of this court, knew of this judgment and was acquainted with Skinner. About that time White met Skinner, rode with him to Oriskany Falls, in Oneida county, and then learned that Skinner had removed from Little Falls to Oriskany Falls, and had a mill there, and had just bought a quantity of wheat and was engaged in business in his own name, as a miller, and that the judgment could all be collected of him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-6\">After he had acquired this knowledge, White called on Doctor Whaley and endeavored to buy the judgment. Doctor Whaley told White that he and Skinner were friends, that Skinner had paid his individual account, and he believed him to be <em>honest and poor, </em>and he did not want anything done against Skinner. That he had a family and could not earn more than enough to support them, that he believed Skinner would pay as fast as he could 5 and also told White that Skinner lived at Little Falls.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-7\">White, who <em>knew </em>that Skinner had left Little Falls and moved to Oriskany Falls, in Oneida county, <em>and was perfectly good for the judgment, concealed from defendant </em>his knowledge of Skinner, and in order to induce the doctor to sell the judgment, he (White) told him that he wanted the judgment to use <em>against Babcock </em>only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-8\">He said he had filed a bill to reach a house and lot held by Babcock\u2019s wife, but which was in fact the property of Babcock, and described to the doctor how he intended to get the house and lot, and averred that there was some doubt as to the judgment on which he had filed the bill, and he wanted the Whaley judgment <em>to use against </em>Babcock, as he knew that xyas all right. Doctor Whaley refused to sell the judgment and then White proposed to have Whaley make Mm (White) bis (Whaley\u2019s) <em>attorney to collect it</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Doctor Whaley, relying on the statement of White, arranged with him to take the judgment, <em>as Ms </em>attorney, and to divide what should be collected <em>onit out </em>of Babcock, and a power of attorney was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">Immediately on getting the authority, White went to Oriskany Falls, put an execution into the hands of the sheriff of Oneida county, <em>against </em>Skinner, and ordered a levy immediately on about $2,000 worth of flour, &amp;c= Skinner paid White $175, and called on Dr. Whaley and informed him of the levy, &amp;c\u201e, which was the <em>first intimation </em>Whaley had of the attempt to enforce the judgment against Skinner, <em>or that Skinner was a resident of Oneida </em>county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\">Whaley having given to White the power of attorney did not know he could do anything himself and <em>supposed, he could not, </em>but as he was unwilling to have Skinner ruined, called on White, and claimed that White had obtained the power of attorney by <em>ufalse representationsf </em>and had told him <em>u </em>things that are not .true j\u201d that he had said <em>u </em>he was going to collect it out of Babcock, out of the house and lot.\u201d But offered Mm $150 to give up the power of attorney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-7\">Ho satisfaction was obtained of White, and upon the representation that Skinner would be ruined if the sale should go on, Dr. Whaley took counsel in regard to the matter, and if he could interfere, and was advised that if White had procured the power of attorney <em>by fraud </em>and was enforcing it as he had been informed he must not do, that he (Whaley) could disregard the power of attorney, and arrange with Skinner on equitable terms as he pleased. He did so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-8\">Afterwards White brought this action. It was defended by Dr. Whaley squarely on the ground that when the plaintiff first called on Whaley to purchase the judgment, he <em>knew </em>that Skinner was in Oneida county, <em>and good, </em>and that Whaley <em>did not know it. </em>That when he found that he could not buy the judgment, then he persuaded the doctor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>to make him <em>his attorney to collect it, </em>and procured himself to be so appointed, by persuading Whaley <em>that he did not intend to use it against Skinner, or collect it of him, </em>(which he knew Whaley would never consent to), but wanted it to use as <em>against Babcock, </em>when in truth he never intended to use it against Babcock, but did fraudulently design to use it against Skinner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-5\">At the conclusion of the proofs, the court ordered a verdict for the defendant, on the ground that <em>\u201c </em>White by omitting to tell Dr. Whaley what he knew of Skinner, makes void the agreement.\u201d And \u201c upon the ground that he could not make a negotiation binding on Dr. Whaley, to conduct his business <em>as an attorney, </em>without <em>disclosing </em>all that was necessary for Dr. Whaley to understand before he concluded that negotiation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-6\">The plaintiff now moves for a new trial on a case and exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b360-7\">C. W. White, <em>plaintiff in person.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-8\">I. We say in the first place that the well established rule that an attorney has no right to deal or treat with his client without disclosing to him all he knows, which may be material in reference to the subject matter of the contract, has no application to this case; for the simple reason that no such relation existed at the time this contract was made. It appears that Dennison and Lynch were the attorneys of record in the judgment which was the subject of contract. It is very clear that this case was disposed of at the circuit under the erroneous idea that the relation of attorney and client did exist between the plaintiff and defendant at the time this contract was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-9\">II. There being no evidence in this case that the relation of attorney and client existed at the time this contract was made, and that relation in fact having no existence, the case is to be decided without reference to that question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>and the parties treated as standing at \"arm\u2019s length\u201d during the negotiation. In short, there was no legal relation of trust or confidence reposed, which made it obligatory upon the plaintiff to disclose to the defendant facts which he knew in reference to Skinner\u2019s property, even if he had any such information, <em>(2 Kent's </em>Com., 482; <em>Story's Eq., \u00a7\u00a7 </em>147, 148, 207; <em>Laidlow </em>agt. Oregon, <em>2 </em>Wheat., 178 ; <em>Fox </em>agt. <em>Markreth, 2 </em>Bro. <em>Ch. Rep., </em>420; <em>Bench </em>agt. Sheldon, 14 <em>Barb., </em>66).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-4\">III. Upon the trial the defendant objected to any evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s concealment of any knowledge he had of Skinner\u2019s situation, upon the ground that no such allegation was set forth in the answer. This objection was overruled, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-5\">This is claimed to be error there being\" no allegation of fraudulent concealment of Skinner\u2019s situation contained therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-6\">IV. We say further if there, was any evidence of fraudulent representations given upon the trial by the defendant, it was contradicted by the plaintiff, and the question should have been presented to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-7\">It is insisted, therefore, that a new trial should be granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-8\"><em>Johnson </em>&amp; Prescott, <em>respondent's </em>attorney.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiG\">I. The first exception of plaintiff in the case is at <em>folio </em>54. \u201c Question : On the occasion when you rode down with him in the stage, did you talk with him freely about Ms circumstances, and did he tell you what he was doing and what his property consisted off</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-11\">\u201c Objected to, as there is nothing of this kind set up in the answer, and as immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-12\"><em>u By the </em>court.\u2014I am inclined to think that an attorney is bound, in a contract of this kind, to disclose all the facts he has; otherwise it might be taking an undue advantage.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>It will be observed that this was a question to the plaintiff/ on cross-examination. Besides there is no objection to the <em>form </em>of the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-5\">Mr. White <em>was an attorney. </em>He had in some way procured Dr. Whaley to appoint him his attorney to collect a judgment. That judgment was $1,140 14, and interest on it for nine years and thirteen days, and which on the 25th December, 1867, amounted to $1,841 41. Of this, <em>White was to have one half, </em>less ten per cent, <em>on the face of the original judgment, i.e. </em>$110 40, thus giving Mr. White $865 50, for issuing an execution against.a man <em>perfectly responsible-, </em>and under which a levy was made at once of personal property worth at least $2,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-6\">This is so unusual, that of itself it would challenge inquiry and invite criticism.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-7\">This defendant was defending on the ground that <em>White had been guilty of a fraud, </em>that, in his character of attorney, he had taken advantage of the confidence of Whaley.\" It was competent, relevant and proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-8\">But the <em>only </em>objection is, \u201c there is nothing of this kind set up. in the answer, and as immaterial,\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-9\">To that we say: (1.) It is fully set up in the answer, the averment is in these words, that White \u201c was well aware of the fact that Skinner was good, and that the judgment was Collectable of him.\u201d And White had sworn, \u201c <em>X did not know at that time, Skinner had property then.\u201d </em>We offered to show that <em>he did know it, </em>and it was finally drawn out of him <em>that he did know all about it.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-11\">Again, the defendant avers that the power of attorney \u201c was obtained of this defendant by false and fraudulent statements,\u201d &amp;c., and \u201cthat the said power of attorney was fraudulently procured by the said White, with intent to defraud this defendant and deceive him.\u201d It is clear, therefore, that the first objection was untenable, we had a right to prove the fraud we had alleged by any evidence that would sustain the allegation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>(2.) <em>It was not immaterial, </em>for, if true, it went to the foundation of the action. If it was trne, then it was conclusive evidence of the fraud, and the plaintiff could not recover. We had averred fraud generally and specifically, and offered to prove that <em>before </em>White approached Dr. Whaley in regard to this judgment, he had seen Skinner, rode in the stage from Clinton to Oriskany Falls, and talked freely with him about his business and circumstances, property, &amp;c,, and <em>lenew </em>that Skinner was good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-5\">Again, the same facts were proyen by Skinner on bis examination <em>without </em>objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-6\">II. The only other exception in the case is at <em>folio </em>114-15. <em>The court </em>said: \u201cI direct a verdict against you upon the ground that he could not make a negotiation binding upon Mr. Whaley, to conduct this business as an attorney^ without disclosing all that was necessary for Mr. Whaley to understand, before he concluded that negotiation. It is upon the ground of constructive fraud, not actual fraud.\u201d There is no rule of law better settled than that laid down by Story in his Commentaries, \u00a7 218.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-7\"><em>\" </em>But by far the most comprehensive class of cases of undue concealment, arises from some peculiar relation, or fiduciary character between the parties. Among this class of cases are to be found those which arise from the relation of <em>client and attorney. </em>* * * * In these, and like cases, the law, in order to prevent undue advantage from the unlimited confidence, affection, or sense of duty, which the relation naturally creates, requires the <em>utmost </em>degree of good faith, <em>(uberrima fidesj) </em>in all transactions between the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-8\"><em>a </em>If there is any misrepresentation, or any <em>concealment </em>of a material fact, or any just suspicion of artifice or undue influence, courts of equity will interpose, and pronounce the transaction <em>void, </em>and as far as possible restore the parties to their original rights.\u201d <em>(Story's Eg.

It appeared that the defendant in the judgment owned a farm, and the deed was on record, <em>notice to all, </em>the client as well as attorney. There was no proof of <em>actual </em>knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>edge or fraud, </em>as against the attorney, and yet the court decreed that the attorney should pay over the full amount, exclusive of costs, and the $75 paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-5\">In <em>Starr et all agt. </em>Vanderheyden, (9 <em>J.

In such cases <em>the law presumes </em>that undue advantage has been taken of the confidential relation existing between attorney and client, and attorneys, in order to sustain such transfers .to them, have been required to show <em>affirmatively </em>either that they paid an adequate consideration, or that a gratuity was intended by the client, and that to obtain it, no advantage was taken of the confidential relation existing between them, <em>and that everything was honest and fair on their part\"</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-9\">The same judge reviews all the leading cases, indorses and adopts them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-10\">White was not only the attorney for Whaley in regard to <em>this </em>judgment. He had before tjiis acted as Whaley?s attorney in other suits. He had interposed defenses in two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>suits, then on the calendar, before he approached the defendant in regard to this judgment, and the relation of client and attorney clearly appears.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-5\">The plaintiff not only <em>concealed </em>from Dr. Whaley the fact that Skinner had <em>returned </em>to Oneida county, <em>and was then good, </em>that the whole judgment could readily be collected, and was in all respects worth 100 cents on the dollar, principal and interest, but he informed him that he wanted it to use <em>against Babcock, </em>to collect it of <em>him, </em>when he never had the slightest idea of attempting to enforce it as against Babcock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-6\">Again, he not only <em>never attenuated </em>to enforce or collect it of Babcock, but on the <em>very next day, </em>after he had consummated his agreement with Dr. Whaley, he went to Oriskany Falls, and had a levy made on $2,000 worth of Skinner\u2019s property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-7\">White says: <em>\u201cI </em>never filed any bill on Whaley\u2019s judgment, or used it for any such purpose\u201d.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-9\">Again, White took the power of attorney on the 25th December, 1867. He <em>says </em>he did not go down to Oriskany Falls <em>the next day, </em>but the execution which he made out in Waterville the day the levy was made, is dated the 26th, and he stayed there until the levy was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-10\">White <em>knew that Skinner was good before </em>he approached Whaley as to the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-11\">And yet he ventures to swear, <em>u </em>I did not know at that time Skinner had property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-12\">Again, White admits in his testimony, \u201c I knew at that time Skinner resided at the Falls,\u201d and yet he says, \u201cI did not tell him in any of those conversations that Skinner resided in this county, or at Oriskany Falls.

The relation of trust and confidence as to that judgment was then created. It is clear from all the evidence that the plaintiff was at that time in the possession of information on the subject of the value and collectability of that judgment which he did not disclose to the defendant, but concealed from hito for the purpose of obtaining a more favorable bargain to himself, and obtaining a larger share of the debt for his trouble of collecting than he would be able to get otherwise. This he does not deny in his test!<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>mony\u201e If he denies it at all, it is only by a peradventure and guess. On the other side, the evidence is full and positive, not only as to the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, but to his silence and misleading pretences. It was, therefore, a mere question of law, whether the plaintiff could enforce a contract of that kind, made under such circumstances. In order to entitle the plaintiff to recover on such\" a contract, the onus lay upon him of proving that he took\" no advantage, but gave to his client, all the information he possessed or could obtain on the subject, and advised him as he would have done in relation to a third person, offering to become a purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">This general rule applies alike to trustees, agents, attorneys, solicitors, and guardians.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In short, it applies to all persons who undertake to act for others in a fiduciary capacity. <em>See White and </em>Tudor, <em>(Lead.

Cas., </em>126 <em>to </em>146), where most of the cases on the subject are collected</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The plaintiff insists that the case does not fall within this rule, inasmuch as he was not the attorney of the defendant in the action in which the judgment was obtained, and only became such when the contract was executed and delivered; and that in the negotiations before that, they were dealing at arms length the same as any other parties. But this distinction is quite too fine to affect the application o\u00a3 the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The plaintiff was an attorney and the very object of the negotiation was to bring about and create the confidential relation of attorney and client, and fix the measure of the compensation of the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The relation and the contract came into existence at the same instant.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">The duty and the obligation were simultaneous and the latter is affected by the omission of the former. The reason of the rule applies as well to such a case as to one where the relation precedes the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>The defendant was at liberty to abandon the contract and refuse to be bound by it, whenever he discovered the suppression, of which his attorney had been guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">A new trial must, therefore, be denied, and judgment ordered for defendant on the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
