(\u201cCibro\u201d) and the Albany Port District Commission (\u201cAPDC\u201d) are involved in a contract dispute that is currently before the Bankruptcy Court as an adversary proceeding (the \u201cPILOT Adversary Proceeding\u201d). Petitioner APDC now seeks a stay of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s proceedings pending appeal of that court\u2019s refusal to compel arbitration of this matter. For the reasons stated below, the Bankruptcy Court lacks jurisdiction to try the PILOT Adversary Proceeding pending APDC\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">A. The Underlying Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b133-17\">This case involves a contract dispute between Cibro and APDC. Cibro is a company formerly engaged in refining, marketing, transporting, and distributing petroleum and asphalt products; it used to operate a refinery at the Port of Albany (\u201cCibro Facility\u201d). <em>See </em>4/5/01 Affidavit of Defendant\u2019s Attorney Jeremy J.O. Har-wood, (\u201cHarwood Aff. No. 1\u201d) \u00b64. Cibro filed for Chapter 11 relief on January 3, 1992. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 3. It has ceased operations and remains in bankruptcy pending confirmation of a reorganization plan. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-18\">The Cibro Facility was leased pursuant to three written leases executed in 1978 and 1979 (\u201cthe APDC Leases\u201d). <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 5. Each lease contained an identical, broadly-worded arbitration provision. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-19\">In 1991, Cibro, the City, and APDC entered into an agreement called an \u201cAgreement for Payments in Lieu of Taxes\u201d (the \u201cPILOT Agreement\u201d). <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 11. Under this agreement, Cibro was to make payments in lieu of City, County and School taxes. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 12. The PILOT Agreement makes specific reference to the APDC Leases. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 25. In 1994, Cibro discontinued making the payments required under the PILOT Agreement. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 13. APDC asserts that the payments called for by the PILOT Agreement are collateral obligations under the APDC Leases and that Cibro\u2019s failure to make these payments constitutes a default of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>those leases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 14. On July 1, 1998, APDC demanded arbitration of this dispute. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">On June 16, 1996, Cibro filed an action against the City challenging the enforceability of the PILOT Agreement and seeking a refund of the payments made under it (the \u201cPILOT Adversary Proceeding\u201d). <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 20. On March 23, 1998, APDC filed its Amended Intervening Answer to the Complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Mandamus Resp. Mem. \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">On March 2, 1998, Cibro filed a motion to assume the APDC Leases pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (the \u201c365 Matter\u201d). <em>See </em>Harwood Aff. No. 1 T 26. The critical issue in its motion was whether there were any defaults under the Leases. APDC argued that the Leases contained a provision that required Cibro to pay all taxes and that the PILOT Agreement was a tax; Cibro argued that the PILOT Agreement was not a tax. <em>See </em>Mandamus Resp. Mem. \u00b6 12. APDC opposed this motion and cross-moved on May 15, 1998, seeking, inter alia, a stay and an order compelling arbitration of the \u201cissue of whether there are existing defaults under the APDC Leases ....\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 27. Cibro then refiled its assumption motion as a motion for partial summary judgment with respect to assumption of the APDC I/eases. APDC opposed the motion for partial summary judgment and by cross-motion dated July 6, 1998, again requested a stay and an order compelling arbitration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">B. The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Arbitration Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">On January 27, 1999, the Bankruptcy Court issued its decision on Cibro\u2019s motion for summary judgment and APDC\u2019s motion to compel arbitration. <em>See In re Winimo Realty Corp., et al., </em>No. 92-B-420026 (Decision of Judge Cornelius Blackshear dated 1/27/99) (\u201cArbitration Decision\u201d), Ex. 12 to Harwood Aff. No. 1. <em>First, </em>the court rejected APDC\u2019s contention that it lacked jurisdiction to pass judgement on the underlying breach of contract issues, explaining that a bankruptcy court has \u201cjurisdiction over a core proceeding to enforce a contractual agreement between parties that ha[ve] filed proofs of claim against the debtor\u2019s estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6 (citations omitted). <em>Second, </em>the court denied Cibro\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, finding certain terms of the APDC Leases to be ambiguous. <em>See id. </em>at 8-9. <em>Third, </em>with respect to APDC\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings, the court found that the APDC Leases indicated that \u201cthe parties have agreed to arbitrate,\u201d and that \u201cthe breach allegation is arbitrable since it does \u2018touch matters\u2019 covered by the agreement.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 11. Cib-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ro argued that APDC had waived any right to arbitration, but Judge Blackshear explicitly rejected this contention. <em>See id. </em>at 12 (\u201cAPDC has not waived its right to enforce the arbitration clause outlined in Article Twelve of the leases.\u201d). Nevertheless, the Bankruptcy Court ordered mediation in lieu of arbitration \u201cdue to APDC\u2019s delay in invoking the arbitration clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">C. The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Initial Denial of Arbitration</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">After the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision, mediation commenced and continued until November 2000, when APDC reported that the mediation had been unsuccessful. <em>See </em>Harwood Aff. No. 1 \u00b6 36. At a status conference on November 16, 2000, APDC requested that the court, in line with the Arbitration Decision, now order arbitration of the issues previously subject to mediation. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 37. At a hearing on January 24, 2001, the court acknowledged that it had determined that the issues in the proceeding were arbitrable, but refused to enter an order compelling arbitration until after the court had tried the issues. <em>See </em>1/24/01 Transcript, Ex. 15 to Harwood Aff. No. 1, at 36 (\u201c[Y]ou can go to arbitration after I have made my ruling.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">D. APDC\u2019s Motion for a Writ of Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">On April 6, 2001, APDC filed an application for an Order to Show Cause requesting a writ of mandamus directing the Bankruptcy Court to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings pending arbitration. <em>See </em>APDC\u2019s Combined Application and Memorandum of Law in Support of Its Order to Show Cause for a Writ of Mandamus. At a hearing on April 13, 2001, this Court found that, while the Arbitration Decision had determined that the 365 Matter is arbitratable, the Bankruptcy Court had not ruled on the arbitrability of the PILOT Adversary Proceeding. <em>See </em>4/13/01 Transcript, Ex. 16 to 7/01 Affidavit of Jeremy J.O. Harwood (\u201cHarwood Aff. No. 2\u201d), at 3-4, 19-20.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On April 25, 2001, this Court issued an order remanding the following issues to the Bankruptcy Court: (1) whether \u201cthe [PILOT] adversary proceeding is subject to arbitration,\u201d and (2) if the proceeding is subject arbitration, \u201cwhether such arbitration must proceed prior to the trial of the adversary proceeding.\u201d Order on APDC\u2019s Motion for Writ of Mandamus to Compel Arbitration (\u201cRemand Order\u201d), Ex. 17 to Harwood Aff. No. 2, at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">On May 10, 2001, APDC filed a motion for an order compelling arbitration of the PILOT Adversary Proceeding and staying proceedings pending arbitration. <em>See </em>Combined Motion and ADPC\u2019s Memorandum of Law in Support of its Request for An Order Compelling Arbitration and Staying an Adversary Proceeding Pending Arbitration (\u201cRemand Motion\u201d), Ex. 19 to Harwood Aff. No. 2. Cibro filed its opposition to this motion on May 25, 2001. <em>See </em>Debtors\u2019 Memorandum in Opposition to APDC\u2019s Motion for an Order Compelling Arbitration and Staying an Adversary Proceeding Pending Arbitration (\u201cRemand Resp.\u201d), Ex. 20 to Harwood Aff. No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">E.The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Remand Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">On June 28, 2001, the Bankruptcy Court issued a decision denying APDC\u2019s request for an order compelling arbitration and a stay pending arbitration. <em>See </em>Decision on Remand by District Court to Consider Whether the Issues to be Tried are Arbi-trable (\u201cRemand Decision\u201d), Ex. 25 to Harwood Aff. No. 2. The Bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Court made three essential rulings. <em>First, </em>the court found that the PILOT Adversary-proceeding was a \u201ccore proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. The court reasoned that settlement of a dispute involving \u201cenforcement of a contractual agreement between parties that filed proofs of claim against the Debtor ... is essential to the administration of the estate\u201d and that \u201cadministering all property of [sic] the bankrupt\u2019s possession, is a core bankruptcy function ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). <em>Second, </em>the court determined that \u201c[t]he underlying purpose of the Bankruptcy Code may adversely be affected by enforcing the arbitration provision.\u201d <em>Id. Third, </em>the court determined that an adversary proceeding would be a more \u201cexpeditious\u201d means of resolving this matter. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the court ordered the matter scheduled for trial. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">On July 3, 2001, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying a stay pending appeal. <em>See </em>Order Denying Stay Pending Appeal (\u201cStay Order\u201d), Ex. 24 to Harwood jiff. No. 2. On July 13, 2001, APDC filed a Notice of Appeal from the Stay Order pursuant to Rule 8005 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. <em>See </em>Notice of Appeal (\u201cNotice of Appeal No. 1\u201d), Ex. 26 to Harwood Aff. No. 2. On July 17, 2001, APDC moved this Court for a stay pending appeal. <em>See </em>APDC\u2019s Combined Emergency Motion and Memorandum of Law in Support of APDC\u2019s Request for a Stay Pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 8005 Pending Appeal from a Decision of the Bankruptcy Court (\u201cStay Motion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On August 14, 2001, this Court determined that the Remand Decision did not dearly answer the questions presented on remand. <em>See </em>8/14/01 Order (\u201cSecond Remand Order\u201d). While \u201cthe Bankruptcy Court clearly answered the second question, holding that in the exercise of its discretion it would decline to compel arbitration, and would proceed immediately with the adversary proceeding,\u201d this Court remained unclear \u201cas to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s answer to the first question, \u2018whether the above-captioned adversary proceeding is arbitrable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1-2 (quoting Remand Order). Therefore, this Court ordered the Bankruptcy Court to \u201cadvise this Court in writing, no later than August 17, 2001, as to whether it concludes that disputes arising under the PILOT Agreement are arbitrable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The Bankruptcy Court responded to the Second Remand Order on August 16, 2001. <em>See </em>Memorandum in Response to Order (\u201cRemand Memorandum\u201d). This memorandum is still somewhat confusing. While the first sentence states that \u201c[t]his court has found that disputes under the PILOT Agreement are <em>not arbitrable </em>in two prior decisions,\u201d the second sentence states that \u201cdisputes under the Debtors\u2019 Leases, including disputes surrounding payment of the obligations under the PILOT agreements, <em>are arbitrable </em>under the Arbitration Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2 (emphasis added). Apparently, the Bankruptcy Court failed to distinguish between the issue of arbitrability and the discretionary denial of arbitration, <em>see </em>APDC\u2019s Supplemental Letter Brief (\u201cAPDC\u2019s Supp. Letter\u201d) at 4 n. 2, for the court later states more clearly that \u201cwhile disputes under the PILOT Agreement would normally be subject to the Arbitration [Act] ... this Court has [decided] not to enforce the arbitration clause and to proceed with a trial on the merits,\u201d Remand Memorandum at 3. Therefore, while the Bankruptcy Court appears to have concluded that the PILOT Adversary Proceeding falls within the arbitration clause of the APDC Leases and is therefore \u201carbitrable,\u201d it has chosen to exercise its discretion not to enforce that clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>On August 15, 2001, this Court directed the parties to submit supplemental letter briefs on (1) the \u201cdivestiture\u201d issue and (2) the \u201ccore\u201d/\u201cnon-core\u201d issue. APDC submitted a supplemental letter brief addressing these issues on August 17, 2000, <em>see </em>APDC Supp. Letter, and Cibro submitted its supplemental letter brief on August 20, 2001, <em>see </em>8/20/01 Supplemental Letter Brief (\u201cCibro Supp. Letter\u201d). On August 22, 2001, APDC filed a notice of appeal from the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s first Remand Decision and subsequent Remand Memorandum. <em>See </em>Notice of Appeal (\u201cNotice of Appeal No. 2\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">APDC moves to stay the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s proceedings while it appeals the Remand Decision. Pursuant to section 16(a) of the Federal Arbitration Act, APDC has a right to appeal an order denying a petition to compel arbitration or refusing to stay an action pending arbitration. <em>See PPG Indus., Inc. v. Webster Auto Parts, Inc., </em>128 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir.1997); 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(l)(A)-(B). Pursuant to Rule 8005 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, APDC may make a motion for a stay of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order pending appeal of that order to the District Court. <em>See In re Bogdanovich, </em>No. 00 Civ. 2266, 2000 WL 1708163, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 14, 2000); Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8005.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">A. Jurisdictional Effect of APDC\u2019s Notice of Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">1. Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">APDC filed a notice of appeal on August 22, 2001. <em>See </em>Notice of Appeal No. 2. It is well established that the filing of a notice of appeal \u201cconfers jurisdiction on the [appellate court] and divests the [trial] court of control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodgers, </em>101 F.3d 247, 251 (2d Cir.1996) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Satcom Int\u2019l Group v. Orbcomm Int\u2019l Partners, </em>55 F.Supp.2d 231, 233 (S.D.N.Y. 1999). This divestiture rule is founded on \u201cconcerns of efficiency,\u201d <em>Rodgers, </em>101 F.3d at 251, and the desire to protect \u201cthe integrity of the appellate process,\u201d <em>Prudential Lines, Inc. v. Am. S.S. Owners Mutual Protection and Indem. Assoc., Inc. (In re Prudential Lines), </em>170 B.R. 222, 243 (S.D.N.Y.1994). Its purpose is to avoid \u201cconfusion or waste of time from having the same issues before two courts at the same time.\u201d <em>United States v. Salerno, </em>868 F.2d 524, 540 (2d Cir.1989) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">The divestiture rule applies to appeals of bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See Hagel v. Drummand (In re Hagel), </em>184 B.R. 793, 798 (9th Cir. BAP 1995) (\u201cA pending appeal ... divests a bankruptcy court of jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>In re Duratech Industries, Inc., </em>241 B.R. 283, 289 (E.D.N.Y.1999); <em>In re Prudential Lines, </em>170 B.R. at 243. However, it is also well established that \u201cwhile an appeal of an order is pending, the [bankruptcy] court retains jurisdiction to implement or enforce the order.\u201d <em>In re Hagel, </em>184 B.R. at 798 (citing <em>In re Prudential Lines, </em>170 B.R. at 243); <em>see also In re Bd. of Dir. of Hopewell Int\u2019l Insur. Ltd., </em>258 B.R. 580, 583 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.2001). \u201cThis is true because in implementing an appealed order, the court does not disrupt the appellate process so long as its decision remains intact for the appellate court to review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, courts have recognized a distinction between actions that \u201cenforce\u201d or \u201cimplement\u201d an order, which are permissible, and acts that \u201cexpand\u201d or \u201calter\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>that order, which are prohibited.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Any actions that interfere with the appeal process or decide an issue identical to the one appealed are beyond mere \u201cenforcement\u201d and are therefore impermissible. <em>See In re Allen-Main Assoc., LP, </em>243 B.R. 606, 608 (Bankr.D.Conn.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In this case, the Bankruptcy Court is planning to proceed on the merits of a dispute arising under the PILOT Agreement pending appeal of its order declining to compel arbitration of that dispute. There is disagreement among the circuits as to whether the issues involved in deciding the arbitrability of a dispute are distinct from the merits of that dispute. <em>Compare Bradford-Scott Data Corp. v. Physician Computer Network, Inc., </em>128 F.3d 504, 505 (7th Cir.1997) (holding that presumption should be against proceeding on the merits during pendency of appeal of order denying arbitration) <em>with Britton v. Co-op Banking Group, </em>916 F.2d 1405, 1411 (9th Cir.1990) (holding that trial court has discretion whether to proceed on the merits after notice of appeal of order denying arbitration has been filed). The Second Circuit has \u201cnot squarely addressed this issue.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Satcom, </em>55 F.Supp.2d at 236; <em>see also Intertec Contracting A/S Intertec (Gibraltara) Ltd. v. Turner Steinder Int\u2019l, S.A., </em>No. 98 Civ. 9116, 2001 WL 812224, at *7 n. 4, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9950, at *23 n. 4 (S.D.N.Y. July 17, 2001); <em>In re Application of Smoothline and Great Sino Elec. Ltd., </em>No. M 19-375, 2000 WL 1727706, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov.20, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">In a non-bankruptcy context, three Southern District judges have addressed the question of whether an appeal of a decision denying arbitration divests the trial court of jurisdiction to proceed on the merits. <em>See Intertec Contracting, </em>2001 WL 812224, at *7 n. 4, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9950, at *23 n. 4; <em>Cendant Corp. v. Forbes, </em>72 F.Supp.2d 341, 342 (S.D.N.Y.1999); <em>Satcom, 55 </em>F.Supp.2d at 236. Each of these courts reached a slightly different conclusion. In <em>Satcom, </em>Judge Cote adopted the Seventh Circuit view that \u201cthe district court is ordinarily divested of jurisdiction during pendency of an appeal\u201d from an order denying arbitration.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Satcom, 55 </em>F.Supp.2d at 236. She reasoned that proceedings should be stayed because \u201cthe appeal raises the same issues as would further proceedings before [the trial] court on the merits,\u201d namely \u201cthe proper forum for the resolution of the remaining issues in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Judge Cote also noted that the application of the dives<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>titure rule would be \u201centirely in keeping with the principle of judicial economy from which the rule arises\u201d because it avoids the possibility of duplicate proceedings in both the appellate and the trial courts. <em>Id. </em>at 236-67. In <em>Cendant, </em>Judge Rakoff took a slightly more lenient approach to the question of divestiture, concluding that the trial court has discretion to deny a stay pending appeal \u201cin at least\u201d cases where the appeal is \u201cfrivolous or improper or taken for an obviously improper purpose.\u201d <em>Cendant, </em>72 F.Supp.2d at 342. While Judge Rakoff recognized that \u201cthere may be still other bases for denying the stay, such as considerations of judicial economy, avoidance of conflicting or piecemeal determinations, and the like,\u201d he warned that granting a stay is generally the better approach so as not to deprive appellants of \u201cthe possibility of having the underlying controversy presented to an arbitrator in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, in <em>Intertec Contracting, </em>Judge Haight took the most lenient approach to divestiture. According to Judge Haight, the district court always has \u201cdiscretion to take action during the pen-dency of the appeal, so long as it is very carefully exercised and in a distinctly limited fashion.\u201d <em>Intertec Contracting, </em>2001 WL 812224, at *7 n. 4, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9950, at *23 n. 4 (holding that district court retained jurisdiction to supervise discovery pending appeal of order denying arbitration).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">While the conclusions of Judges Cote, Rakoff and Haight are instructive, these cases are not precisely on point because each involved non-bankruptcy proceedings, where the issue on appeal was the arbitrability of the entire case. In contrast, the appeal in this case involves the arbitrability of a specific issue \u2014 namely, the contract dispute arising under the PILOT Agreement \u2014 that is just one element of a larger bankruptcy proceeding. Accordingly, a determination of whether a trial of the PILOT Adversary Proceeding would \u201cinterfere with the appellate process,\u201d <em>In re Prudential Lines, </em>170 B.R. at 243, or \u201cdecide an issue identical to one appealed,\u201d <em>In re Allen-Main Assoc., </em>243 B.R. at 608, requires an examination of the particular facts and circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">One of APDC\u2019s arguments on appeal is that the Bankruptcy Court did not have discretion to refuse to compel arbitration. <em>See </em>Stay Motion at 23-25. A bankruptcy court has discretion not to enforce an arbitration clause if enforcement of the clause \u201c \u2018would seriously jeopardize the objectives of the [Bankruptcy] Code.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re U.S. Lines, </em>197 F.3d 631, 640 (2d Cir.1999), <em>cert, denied, Am. S.S. Owners Mut. Protection and Indem. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. U.S. Lines, Inc., </em>529 U.S. 1038, 120 S.Ct. 1532, 146 L.Ed.2d 347 (2000) (quoting <em>Hays &amp; Co. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>885 F.2d 1149, 1161 (3d Cir. 1989)). The Second Circuit has held that, while \u201cnot all core bankruptcy proceedings are premised on provisions of the Code that inherently conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act,\u201d \u201ccore\u201d proceedings are more likely than \u201cnon-core\u201d proceedings to create this kind of conflict.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Thus, on appeal, this Court must review the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s determination that the PI<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>LOT Adversary Proceeding was \u201ca core proceeding\u201d. Remand Decision at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The \u201ccore\u201d/\u201cnon-core\u201d issue will also arise in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s trial of the PILOT Adversary Proceeding. The PILOT Agreement is a pre-petition contract. Bankruptcy judges may only resolve a dispute arising under a pre-petition contract if the proceeding is \u201ccore\u201d. <em>See In re U.S. Lines, </em>197 F.3d at 636; <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(1) (giving bankruptcy courts authority to \u201chear and determine all ... core proceedings arising under title 11\u201d). Therefore, the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s jurisdiction to try the issues involved in the PILOT Adversary Proceeding hinges on fcs determination that the proceeding is \u201ccore.\u201d <em>See </em>Arbitration Decision at 6 (holding that Bankruptcy Court had \u201cjurisdiction over the present <em>core </em>proceeding\u201d) (emphasis added). Because the \u201ccore\u201d/ \u201cnon-core\u201d issue will be before this Court on appeal, \u201c[cjontinuation of proceedings in the [bankruptcy] court ... creates a risk of inconsistent handling of the case by two tribunals.\u201d <em>Satcom, </em>55 F.Supp.2d at 235 (quoting <em>Bradford-Scott Data, </em>128 F.3d at 505).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Application of the divestiture rule is appropriate in this case because trial of the PILOT Adversary Proceeding will involve a key issue identical to one of the issues involved in the order being appealed. <em>See In re Allen-Main Assoc., </em>243 B.R. at 608; <em>In re Prudential Lines, </em>170 B.R. at 243. Moreover, issuance of a stay will not implicate any of the public policy concerns raised by courts that have cautioned against application of the divestiture rule in similar circumstances. APDC\u2019s appeal, regardless of its likelihood of success, does not appear to be a frivolous motion intended to stall litigation. <em>See Britton, </em>916 F.2d at 1412 (noting this concern); <em>Cendant, </em>72 F.Supp.2d at 342 (same). Nor would issuance of a stay result in \u201cconflicting or piecemeal determinations.\u201d <em>Cendant, </em>72 F.Supp.2d at 342. To the contrary, staying the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s proceedings pending appeal will prevent inconsistent rulings and ensure that judicial resources are not wasted on useless litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">For the foregoing reasons, APDC\u2019s filing of a notice of appeal has divested the Bankruptcy Court of jurisdiction over the PILOT Adversary Proceeding. Because the Bankruptcy Court cannot try that matter until this Court has decided APDC\u2019s appeal, it is not necessary to reach the merits of APDC\u2019s motion to stay further proceedings on that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">SO ORDERED:</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\">.

Cibro contended that \u201c[n]owhere did [APDC's] cross motion seek to stay the Pilot Adversary Proceeding.\u201d Mandamus Resp. Mem. \u00b6 12. Petitioner's July 6, 1998, cross-motion did not explicitly request a stay of the action. Rather it requested a stay of Cibro\u2019s motion and an order directing arbitration of whether there are defaults under the APDC Leases. It also requested \"such other and further relief as may be just and proper.\u201d Notice of Motion, Ex. 11 to Harwood Aff.

This distinction is particularly important in the context of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases, where the court will issue \u201cinnumerable orders involving a myriad of issues, one or more of which may be on appeal at any given moment.\u201d <em>In re Prudential Lines, </em>170 B.R. at 244. Permitting the bankruptcy court to enforce orders that are on appeal while prohibiting the court from altering such orders \"allows the least disruption of the court's administration of a bankruptcy plan.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">. In <em>Weiner v. Gutfreund (In re Salomon Inc. S\u2019holders\u2019 Derivative Litig.), </em>68 F.3d 554, 557 (2d Cir.1995), the Second Circuit upheld a district court\u2019s decision refusing to stay proceedings pending appeal of the district court's order declining to compel arbitration. The Second Circuit provided no reason for its decision and did not \u201cindicate whether the basis for its decision was the frivolousness or abusiveness of the appeal or a more general view that proceedings before the [trial court] may continue at the [trial court's] discretion during pendency of an appeal\u201d from an order refusing to compel arbitration. <em>Satcom, </em>55 F.Supp.2d at 236.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b138-11\">.Judge Cote reaffirmed this view in <em>In re Smoothline. See </em>2000 WL 1727706, at *1. The Seventh Circuit's position was also adopted in <em>Baron v.

APDC correctly notes that the Fifth Circuit has held that discretion is based on the \u201cunderlying nature of the proceeding, <em>i.e., </em>whether the proceeding derives exclusively from the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code\u201d rather than the \u201ccore\u20197\"non-core\u201d determination. APDC Supp. Letter at 5 (quoting <em>In re Nat'I Gypsum Co., </em>118 F.3d 1056, 1067 (5th Cir. 1997)). Although the Second Circuit decided <em>In re U.S. Lines </em>after the Fifth Circuit decided <em>In re Nat\u2019l Gypsum, </em>the Second Circuit did not adopt the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach when it had a chance to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
