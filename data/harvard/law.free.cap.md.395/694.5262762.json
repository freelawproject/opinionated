The filling station is located in the Cloverly neighborhood of Montgomery County. The appellants in this case, the Cloverly Civic Association and Dr. Edward D. Pu-rich, an owner of property adjacent to the station, (herein collectively referred to as \u201cPurich\u201d) contest the operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the automobile filling station under the Montgomery County Zoning Ordinance (\u201cZoning Ordinance\u201d). The appellee, Draper Properties, Inc. (\u201cDPI\u201d), owns the property on which the automobile filling station in question is situated. The filling station has been in operation since some time in the early 1960\u2019s.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From early 1963 until 1997, the automobile filling station operated under the Zoning Ordinance as a lawful nonconforming use.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1997, DPI\u2019s lessee of the property, Shell Oil Co. (\u201cShell\u201d), applied for a special exception<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for its use of the Property as an automobile filling station and the special exception was granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The automobile filling station was operated under the auspices of that special exception until July 11, 2003-even though it appears that none of the improvements attached as condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>tions to the special exception by the Board was made. At that time, pursuant to the request of DPI\u2019s new lessee, Petroleum Marketing Group, Inc. (\u201cPMG\u201d), the Board revoked the special exception and found that the lawful nonconforming use remained. On July 18, 2003, Purich objected to the Board via letter-arguing against the revocation of the special exception and seeking a hearing. The hearing was eventually held on December 1, 2004, at which time the Board voted against reconsideration of the issue. A written decision was issued by the Board on February 11, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Purich appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and a hearing was held on August 4, 2005. On August 8, 2005, an order was issued from that court affirming the Board\u2019s decision. Purich then timely appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. This Court, on its own initiative and prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court, granted certiorari. <em>Purich v. Draper, </em>393 Md. 160, 900 A.2d 206 (2006). Purich submits two questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">\u201c1. In Montgomery County, when an applicant seeks and obtains a special exception of a particular type, and thereafter uses the subject land in the manner authorized by the grant of approval, can the special exception holder nevertheless simultaneously claim that the special exception has been abandoned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">2. In Montgomery County, may nonconforming use status be reestablished, even though the abandonment period prescribed by law has run while the use operates lawfully under a properly obtained special exception?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">We answer both questions in the negative. During the period between the time of the granting of a special exception and the time when a special exception is \u201crevoked\u201d for failure to meet all of the conditions, the Property was being operated pursuant to the special exception or it would have been improper for the owner or lessee to begin any of the improvements for which the applicant applied. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the use granted by the special exception-an automobile filling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>station-was immediately established, albeit the applicant may not have complied with all of the conditions even though the special exception was later revoked.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Once the special exception was granted, the use became \u201cpermitted\u201d and the nonconforming use terminated, or at least the six month period of abandonment on the nonconforming use of the property began to run.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If not sooner terminated, the nonconforming use was thereafter abandoned when the Property was operated as a \u201cpermitted use\u201d under the special exception for six months. Once that period elapsed the nonconforming use could not be reestablished. \u00a7 59-G-4.14 of the Zoning Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The automobile filling station in question is located at 15541 New Hampshire Avenue in Silver Spring, Maryland-a Convenience Commercial (C-l) zone. DPI owns the Property and has been the owner for the entire period of time relevant to the issues at hand. Sometime early in 1963, DPI leased the Property to Shell for the operation of the filling station. Up until May 1, 1963, automobile filling stations were classified as permitted uses under the C-l zone. On May 1, 1963, however, pursuant to a change in the Zoning Ordinance, the operation of new automobile filling stations began to require a special exception. <em>See supra, </em>footnote 1; \u00a7\u00a7 59-A-2.1 and 59-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>C-4.2 of the Zoning Ordinance. One of the effects of the new ordinance was that if an operator sought to upgrade its facility, it would have to apply for, and receive, a special exception to operate a filling station. The property at issue here continued to be operated as a filling station, but as a nonconforming use until 1997. \u00a7\u00a7 59-A-2.1 and 59-G-4.1 of the Zoning Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In 1997, Shell applied to the Board for a special exception. The petition, contained in the record, clearly states that the proposed special exception applied for was for a \u201cuse\u201d as an \u201cAutomobile Filling Station.\u201d The attached \u201cStatement of Justification\u201d indicates that Shell simply \u201cdesire[d] to renovate the existing gas station.\u201d The Board\u2019s opinion states that the reason for the application for the special exception was, pursuant to \u00a7 59-G-2.06<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Zoning Ordinance, \u201cto permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>modernization of [the] existing automobile filling station----\u201d On April 7, 1997, in Case No. S-2217, the Board granted the special exception, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201cWith respect to the requested special exception for an automobile filling station, based on the testimony and exhibits in the record the Board finds that the petition satisfies all the requirements of Section 59-G-2.06 of the Zoning Ordinance for an automobile filling station and the general requirements for special exceptions contained in Section 59-G-1.21 of the Ordinance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The special exception provided that Shell could install new pump islands, construct a new canopy, upgrade the landscaping, install a new sign, renovate the exterior and service bay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>areas of the station, add a handicap parking space, install a trash enclosure, and install new lighting, which may not have been permitted unless a \u201cspecial exception\u201d for an automobile filling station use was first obtained. Shell continued to operate the filling station as it had before obtaining the special exception. There is no evidence in the record that Shell implemented any of the upgrades contained in the grant of the special exception, but, upon the granting of the special exception, it had the authority to begin the upgrades. This is because it was no longer operating as a nonconforming use, but as a permitted special exception use.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">On December 31, 2002, Shell\u2019s lease was due to expire. Shell had stopped selling gasoline on August 12, 2002. DPI then entered into a lease with PMG and it began selling gasoline on February 6, 2003. Both parties agree that this period from August 12, 2002, through February 6, 2003 (not quite six months), did not result in a \u201ccessation of use\u201d or abandonment of any nonconforming use \u2014 had one still existed at the time. \u00a7 59-G-4.14 of the Zoning Ordinance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">On December 2, 2002, prior to leasing the Property from DPI, PMG sent a letter to the Montgomery County Department of Permitting Services (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) requesting a determination as to whether the Property still maintained a nonconforming use status. PMG asserted that the improvements authorized by the special exception were never undertaken and, thus, pursuant to \u00a7 59-A \u2014 4.53(b)(2) of the Zoning Ordinance,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the special exception had lapsed and the Property had reverted to a nonconforming use status. PMG desired to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>add an additional multi-purpose pump dispenser to the filling station and erect a canopy over the dispensers as an \u201cintensification\u201d of the alleged nonconforming use.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On December 16, 2002, the Department responded by letter to PMG\u2019s counsel, finding that the special exception had expired and the use of the station reverted to the nonconforming status.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Additionally, the Department found that the nonconforming use of the Property was not abandoned and that the installation of the additional pump dispenser and construction of a canopy over the dispensers would be considered an intensification of the nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">On February 7, 2003, PMG sent another letter, via fax, to the Department in order to confirm the nonconforming status of the Property. On that same date the Department sent a letter to the Board informing it of the Department\u2019s position that the special exception had lapsed and that the Property had reverted back to a nonconforming status. The letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>requested that the Board revoke the special exception per \u00a7 59 \u2014 G\u20141.3(d)(ii)(2) of the Zoning Ordinance.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On April 16, 2003, the Board met and found that, pursuant to \u00a7 59-A-4.53(b)(2) of the Zoning Ordinance, the special exception was never implemented. Therefore, effective July 11, 2003, the Board revoked the Property\u2019s special exception.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Purich, by letter dated July 18, 2003, made a request to the Board for a public hearing \u201cto decide whether it is appropriate to deny revoking the special exception.\u201d The Board received Purich\u2019s letter on July 23, 2003, and first considered the request for reconsideration on September 10, 2003. But, in order to allow Purich to serve all of the parties involved, the Board deferred action until November 12, 2003. At that time, the Board voted to suspend the July 11, 2003, resolution revoking the special exception, finding that Purich had presented new evidence that warranted consideration. A resolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>tion was issued on November 21, 2003.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A new Board hearing on the matter of the revocation was scheduled for January 7, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">DPI, in the interim, appealed the November 21, 2003, Board resolution to reconsider the revocation to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Civil Action No. 248301). The Circuit Court dismissed the appeal as interlocutory and remanded the case to the Board for a final determination of whether reconsideration should be granted. The January 7, 2004, hearing never took place, rather, a hearing was held by the Board on December 1, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Purich\u2019s reconsideration request before the Board consisted of a discussion of certain \u201cthreshold issues.\u201d As the Chair of the Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">\u201cAs I recall, the last time we met we were going to gather again together for two issues. Should the Board have issued the resolution to revoke the special exception, or is it revoked by operation of law; and number two, can the Board force a special exception holder to accept the special exception. These are my recollection of the threshold issues the Board must decide before we consider the revocation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">After hearing argument, the Board orally voted to deny reconsideration. On February 11, 2005, the Board issued a written decision, in which it only addressed the question of whether the Board can require a special exception holder to accept a special exception it does not want. The Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB2\">\u201cBecause we find it dispositive, we shall address only our second issue. In this case, the special exception holder, [DPI], has clearly manifested its intent that it does not desire to proceed under, or make use of, the approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>special exception. It has done so by (a) failing to appeal the July 11, 2003 Resolution revoking the special exception, and (b) opposing [Purich\u2019s] request for reconsideration, to the extent that it sought (prematurely, as the Court determined) judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision to hear the request for reconsideration. In its arguments to the Board, [DPI] has clearly and unequivocally indicated that it considers the special exception to have been abandoned and has no intention to seek reinstatement or, even if reinstated, to make use of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">\u201cUnder these circumstances, it is [DPI\u2019s] right to have the special exception revoked. As [Purich\u2019s] counsel has fairly pointed out, a special exception is an authorization to use land in a particular way, never a command to do so. A special exception must be requested and used. A special exception holder who manifests the intent not to use the special exception is deemed to have relinquished its authorization. That intent may be manifested in one of several ways, such as non-implementation, abandonment, or by express actions or words. While the Zoning Ordinance only expressly addresses the first two of these circumstances, we find that the third is necessarily implicit in the very nature of a special exception. Consequently, once [DPI] manifested its intent not to use the automobile filling station special exception, the issue of whether it had failed to implement the special exception became moot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">\u201cAccordingly, we conclude that, because the special exception holder has consented to the revocation of the special exception of the property, the revocation must stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Board of Appeals for Montgomery County, Case No. S-2217, February 11, 2005. On February 18, 2005, Purich filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision with the Board. On March 9, 2005, the Board denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">On March 10, 2005, Purich filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The court heard argument on August 4, 2005. On August 8, 2005, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>court issued an order affirming the Board\u2019s February 11, 2005, decision to revoke the special exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Before continuing our discussion, it is necessary to point out what appears obvious to the Court, but apparently not to the parties. The determinative issue is: When a special exception is \u201crevoked,\u201d is that particular property thereafter required to be operated only as a permitted use in that particular district, or does a prior nonconforming use again spring into life after not having been utilized for a number of years?</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">In <em>Alviani v. Dixon, </em>365 Md. 95, 775 A.2d 1234 (2001), we discussed the standard of review of administrative agency decisions in the context of special exceptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">\u201cA proceeding on a special exception is subject to a full judicial review. <em>Mossburg v. Montgomery County, </em>329 Md. 494, 506, 620 A.2d 886, 892 (1993). We examined the correct standard of judicial review in <em>White v. North, </em>356 Md. 31, 44, 736 A.2d 1072, 1079-80 (1999), when we stated that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">In judicial review of zoning matters, including special exceptions and variances, \u2018the correct test to be applied is whether the issue before the administrative body is \u201cfairly debatable,\u201d that is, whether its determination is based upon evidence from which reasonable persons could come to different conclusions.\u2019 <em>Sembly v. County Bd. of Appeals, </em>269 Md. 177, 182, 304 A.2d 814, 818 (1973). <em>See also Board of County Comm\u2019rs v.

Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>262 Md. 1, 17, 276 A.2d 646, 654 (1971); <em>Gerachis v. Montgomery County Bd. of Appeals, </em>261 Md. 153, 156, 274 A.2d 379, 381 (1971). For its conclusion to be fairly debatable, the administrative agency overseeing the variance decision must have \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 on the record supporting its decision. <em>See Mayor of Annapolis v. Annapolis Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. 383, 395, 396 A.2d 1080, 1087 (1979); Mont<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number><em>gomery County v.

Nat'l Bureau [of Cas. </em>Underwriters], 248 Md. 292, 309, 236 A.2d 282 (1967), or as \u2018 \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u201d <em>Bulluck v.

North, </em>355 Md. 259, 267, 734 A.2d 227, 232 (1999), citing <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. v.

The Board\u2019s decision in this case was premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The central issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>concerns an interpretation of the law of nonconforming uses. The law is well established that a nonconforming use exists if a person utilizes property in a certain manner that is lawful before and up to the time of the adoption of a zoning ordinance, though the then-adopted zoning ordinance may make that previously lawful use non-permitted. <em>Bd. of Zoning Appeals of Howard County v.

Montgomery County, </em>85 Md.App. 477, 496, 584 A.2d 142, 151 (1991); 1 Kenneth H. Young, <em>Anderson\u2019s American Law of Zoning </em>\u00a7 6.01 (4th ed. 1996, unchanged through 2006 Supp.) (\u201cA use which lawfully existed prior to the enactment of a zoning ordinance, and which is maintained after the effective date of the ordinance, although it does not comply with the zoning restrictions applicable to the district in which it is situated, is commonly referred to as a \u2018nonconforming use.\u2019 \u201d). As Judge Grason, writing for the Court, cogently expressed in <em>Amereihn:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">\u201cIf a property is used for a factory, and thereafter the neighborhood in which it is located is zoned residential, if such regulations applied to the factory it would cease to exist, and the zoning regulation would have the effect of confiscating such property and destroying a vested right therein of the owner. Manifestly this cannot be done, because it would amount to a confiscation of the property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>and nonconforming use is a vested right and entitled to constitutional protection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">194 Md. at 601, 71 A.2d at 869 (see authority cited).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">This Court further discussed nonconforming uses in <em>Beyer v. Mayor and City Council, </em>182 Md. 444, 34 A.2d 765 (1943), in which Judge Marbury, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">\u201cNon-conforming uses have been before this court in several cases. They are common to all zoning statutes or ordinances and are those permitted by such statutes or ordinances to continue even though similar uses are not permitted in the area in which they are located. The reason for this is stated in the leading work on the subject: \u2018The view that has been followed is that a few non-conforming buildings and uses if allowed to continue will not be a substantial injury to a community if only such non-conforming buildings are not allowed to multiply where they are harmful or improper. Zoning has sought to safeguard the future, in the expectation that time will repair the mistakes of the past.\u2019 <em>Bassett on Zoning, </em>Chap.

E.L. Gardner, Inc., </em>293 Md. 259, 443 A.2d 114 (1982). In <em>Gardner, </em>the question was \u201cwhether, under the applicable provisions of the Prince George\u2019s County Code ..., the owner of a nonconforming surface mining sand and gravel operation [could] obtain a special exception to operate a sand and gravel wet-processing facility at the same location.\u201d 293 Md. at 261, 443 A.2d at 115. The Court answered the question by holding that the addition of a sand and gravel wet-processing facility would change the use of the property and, under the applicable local ordinances, such a change in use was explicitly prohibited. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 443 A.2d at 119. Discussing zoning in general, the Court stated: \u201cOne of the basic tenets of zoning is that some uses of land are incompatible with others, and that more efficient employment of land resources is achieved if such incompatible uses are separated.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 266, 443 A.2d at 118. In an attempt to create homogenous land use, zoning ordinances have been established on a county by county and city by city basis. Local zoning ordinances, however, \u201cunavoidably include land devoted to uses proscribed by the zoning regulations. Such nonconforming uses pose a formidable threat to the success of zoning. They limit the effectiveness of land use controls, contribute to urban blight, imperil the success of the community plan, and injure property values.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 443 A.2d at 118 (citing 1 R.M.

For these reasons and because it was thought that to require immediate cessation would be harsh and unreasonable, a deprivation of rights in property out of proportion to the public benefits to be obtained and, so, unconstitutional, and finally a red flag to property owners at a time when strong opposition might have jeopardized the chance of any zoning, most, if not all, zoning ordinances provided that lawful uses existing on the effective date of the law could continue although such uses could not thereafter be begun. <em>Nevertheless, the earnest aim and ultimate purpose of zoning was and is to reduce nonconformance to conformance as speedily as possible with due regard to the legitimate interests of all concerned, and the ordinances forbid or limit expansion of nonconforming uses and forfeit the right to them upon abandonment of the use </em>or the destruction of the improvements housing the use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number><em>Grant, </em>212 Md. at 307, 129 A.2d at 365 (emphasis added).

Moreover, this Court has further recognized that the purpose of such restrictions is to achieve the ultimate elimination of nonconforming uses through economic attrition and physical obsolescence. <em>The Arundel Corp. v.

DPI asserts that the application by its lessee Shell in 1997 for a special exception, and its subsequent granting and then possible revocation, do not disturb the nonconforming use status of the Property. In opposition, Purich argues that, though the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Property may have been operated as a nonconforming use prior to 1997, once the special exception was obtained and utilized for six months, the nonconforming use was abandoned-thus it was eliminated. Thereafter, the Property, if operated as an automobile filling station, could only be operated as a special exception. We find that, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the nonconforming use status, if not earlier terminated, was abandoned after the special exception was granted and six months elapsed. We explain below.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">First, we look to the Montgomery County Zoning Ordinance in analyzing the status of the Property\u2019s nonconforming use. It is important for our analysis to note that the applicable Zoning Ordinance provisions must be strictly construed. <em>Gardner, </em>293 Md. at 268, 443 A.2d at 119 (\u201cThese local ordinances and regulations must be strictly construed in order to effectuate the purpose of eliminating nonconforming uses.\u201d) (citing <em>City of Hagerstown v. Wood, </em>257 Md. 558, 563, 263 A.2d 532, 534 (1970); <em>Hewitt v. County Comm\u2019rs of Baltimore County, </em>220 Md. 48, 59, 151 A.2d 144, 150 (1959); <em>Mayor of Baltimore v. Byrd, </em>191 Md. 632, 638, 62 A.2d 588, 591 (1948); <em>Colati, </em>186 Md. at 658-59, 47 A.2d at 616; <em>Knox v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>180 Md. 88, 96, 23 A.2d 15, 18 (1941)).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The filling station was presumably in operation as a lawful nonconforming use, as defined by \u00a7 59-A-2.1 of the Zoning Ordinance, prior to the granting of the special exception applied for by Shell in 1997. Special exceptions are defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">\u201cThe grant of a specific use that would not be appropriate generally or without restriction, which must be based on a finding that certain conditions governing special exceptions as detailed in Article 59-G exist, and that the use is consistent with the applicable master plan and is compatible with the existing neighborhood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">\u00a7 59-A-2.1 of the Zoning Ordinance. We said in <em>Stacy v. Montgomery County, </em>239 Md. 189, 193, 210 A.2d 540, 542 (1965): \u201cA special exception within the meaning of the zoning ordinance is one which is controlled and which is expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>permissible in a given zone.\u201d Thus, when one applies for and is granted a special exception for a use being made, or to be made, that use becomes a permitted use even if it had theretofore been a nonconforming use. This reclassification normally carries with it several advantages, such as being able to, as a matter of right, recommence or replace the use after its destruction by fire or other disaster. The special exception for an automobile filling station is delineated in \u00a7 59-G-2.06 of the Zoning Ordinance. That section is entitled \u201cAutomobile filling stations\u201d and states that \u201c[a]n automobile filling station may be permitted ...\u201d upon meeting several requirements. \u00a7 59-G-2.06. The special exception was granted by the Board to Shell on April 7, 1997. At that point, under our cases, the use became a permitted use for the operation of the filling station. Thus, it was no longer a nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">DPI contends that the special exception was for the \u201cmodernization\u201d of an existing automobile filling station operated as a lawful nonconforming use. Purich contends that special exceptions cannot be issued simply for modernization. In resolving this conflict we look to the Zoning Ordinance. The only provision in the Zoning Ordinance that references automobile filling stations-in regard to special exceptions-is \u00a7 59-G-2.06, and it does not mention modernization; it only refers to the operation of a filling station in general. The Zoning Ordinance, in fact, does not mention modernization in regard to special exceptions at all.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Much of the confusion surrounding this issue stems from the Board\u2019s April 7, 1997, opinion, where it stated: \u201cCase No. S-2217 is the petition of Shell Oil Company, for a special exception, pursuant to Section 59 \u2014 [G]\u2014 2.06 (Automobile Filling Station) of the Zoning Ordinance to permit <em>modernization </em>of an existing automobile filling station <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>and variances as described below.\u201d Board of Appeals for Montgomery County, Case No. S-2217 <em>&amp; </em>A-4485, April 7, 1997 (emphasis added). This is a statement that the reason the applicant wanted the special exception was that under such exception, if it was granted, Shell could modernize the facility. The special exception use was, however, not <em>for </em>modernization, but for the automobile filling station <em>use </em>itself. Unfortunately, the Board\u2019s initial characterization of the special exception for the Property was misleading and has apparently subsequently misled the Board and the trial court. Additionally, it is clear from Shell\u2019s actual petition, that the \u201cUse proposed\u201d by it, and consequently DPI, was an \u201cAutomobile Filling Station,\u201d not just the modernization.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In Montgomery County, special exceptions are the \u201cgrant of a specific <em>use </em>that would not be appropriate generally or without restriction.... \u201d \u00a7 59-A-2.1 of the Zoning Ordinance (emphasis added). The Zoning Ordinance defines \u201cUse\u201d as: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided, the principal purpose for which a lot or the main building thereon is designed, arranged, or intended, and for which it is or may be used, occupied, or maintained.\u201d \u00a7 59-A-2.1. It is evident from the Zoning Ordinance that the special exception for an automobile filling station is only for that particular use. Special exceptions, pursuant to portions of the Zoning Ordinance applicable here, are for <em>uses, </em>not modernization-although a desire to be permitted to modernize may be the reason an applicant applies for a special exception, i.e., a special exception may permit modernization where it would not be permitted if the filling station was operating as a nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">A special exception brings a property into conformance with applicable zoning laws. The use becomes permitted, albeit there may be conditions. In this case, the nonconforming use of the Property as an automobile filling station prior to April 7, 1997, though lawful, was in conflict with Montgomery County\u2019s zoning goals. Once the special exception was granted on April 7, 1997, the use of the Property came into conformance with the zoning law; hence, the nonconforming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>use ceased. Subject to \u00a7 59-G-4.14 of the Zoning Ordinance, \u201c[a] nonconforming use is abandoned if the nonconforming use stops for at least 6 months.\u201d In addition, \u201c[i]f a nonconforming use is abandoned, it <em>must not be reestablished.\u201d </em>\u00a7 59-G-4.14 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The nonconforming use stopped on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>April 7,1997, and the Property was operated under the special exception from that point forward. Thereafter, the six month period by which abandonment is calculated under the statute, if even applicable, began immediately upon the grant of, and operation under, the special exception.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Once Shell applied for and was granted a special exception for the operation of the filling station on the Property, it began to conform with the overall zoning provisions. Nonconformance became conformance and, pursuant to <em>Gardner </em>and <em>Grant, </em>the Zoning Ordinance must be strictly construed to eliminate the nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The special exception was for an automobile filling station, and the Property operated as just that both prior to and after April 7, 1997. It is clear from the record that DPI did not reestablish, or even attempt to reestablish, the nonconforming use within six months of April 7, 1997. The first attempt was on December 2, 2002, when PMG, a lessee of the Property, sent a letter to the Montgomery County Department of Permitting seeking a determination that the Property was still operating as a nonconforming use. The determination of the Department at that time-finding a continuing nonconforming use-was erroneous because the nonconforming use, if not earlier terminated upon the granting of the special exception, was abandoned and, once abandoned, <em>must not be reestablished. </em>\u00a7 59-G-4.14 of the Zoning Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">This result is in harmony with the policy of eliminating nonconforming uses. We stated in <em>Beyer:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">\u201c[T]he mere cessation of the use for a reasonable period does not of itself work an abandonment, but once the abandonment is clearly indicated by intention and action, or failure of action for a sufficient period of time, then the owner has lost his right to the non-conforming use, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>must use his property only in conformity with the uses allowed to other properties in the neighborhood. Were the law otherwise an owner could keep his property in a nonconforming class forever, which would be entirely contrary to the policy underlying zoning acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">182 Md. at 454, 34 A.2d at 769; <em>Landay v. MacWilliams, </em>173 Md. 460, 196 A. 293 (1938). DPI and Shell abandoned the operation of the filling station as a nonconforming use when Shell sought and obtained the special exception for the operation of the filling station. A property cannot operate where the use is both a nonconforming use and a special exception use <em>when it is the same use </em>because the permitted use extinguishes the nonconforming character of the use. The law requires that the conforming, permitted, use be favored, i.e., the special exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">DPI argues that the special exception was never implemented and, therefore, that the nonconforming use of the Property never actually ceased. DPI cites to <em>Pemberton v. Montgomery County, </em>275 Md. 363, 340 A.2d 240 (1975) in discussing \u201cthe factors that constitute actual implementation of a special exception.\u201d While it did not involve a pre-existing nonconforming use, <em>Pemberton </em>concerned another automobile filling station in Montgomery County. A party sought to build a <em>new </em>filling station and obtained a special exception for the use. The Court quoted from the zoning regulation in effect at the time, Montgomery County Code (1955) \u00a7 111-32(c)-a predecessor to the current Zoning Ordinance-which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">\u201cA decision of the board or the director permitting the erection or alteration of a building shall be valid for a period of twelve months, during which time a building permit for such erection or alteration must be obtained and the erection or alteration started. No decision of the board permitting the use of a building or land shall be valid for a period longer than twelve months, unless such use is established within such period____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-8\"><em>Pemberton, </em>275 Md. at 366, 340 A.2d at 242. In that case, a citizen, Mrs. Pemberton, opposed the construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>filling station and claimed that Exxon, the special exception holder, had failed to implement the special exception. The Court affirmed the Board\u2019s finding that the special exception had been implemented by Exxon through its obtaining a building permit and beginning construction within the required twelve month period. DPI argues that \u201cin contrast to the special exception holder in <em>Pemberton, </em>neither Shell nor [DPI] sought a building permit, initiated construction, or implemented any of the conditions of the special exception within the requisite twenty four (24) months.\u201d This argument, however, does not have merit when applied to the situation at hand. Here, a filling station already existed and was being operated and continued to be operated. The pertinent question is whether the legal status of its use changed upon the initial granting of the special exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The Zoning Ordinance provides in \u00a7 59-A-4.53(b)(2) that, in general, \u201c[a] special exception is not valid after 24 months if the <em>use </em>is not established or a building permit is not obtained and construction started within the period.\u201d (Emphasis added). This language, when applied to property which at the time of an application for a special exception is already being operated as a \u201cpermitted\u201d use (as opposed to a nonconforming use) is relatively clear. In such a case, if the rights granted under the special exception are lost, the property can be used as it was before because uses \u201cpermitted\u201d by right under such an ordinance are never abandoned. The right to use property as \u201cpermitted\u201d by the ordinance always remains. This language, however, when considered in the context of a special exception which changes a prior nonconforming use to a permitted use, is somewhat confusing. The change to a permitted use (i.e., the special exception) terminates the nonconforming use, which then cannot be revived or renewed. There is nothing to revive and nothing to renew. DPI contends that none of the steps toward modernization-as provided for in the grant of special exception-were taken, and thus the special exception is not valid.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> There is little evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>record showing that all of the requirements of the special exception were met. That, however, is not entirely dispositive in the case <em>sub judice. </em>As discussed <em>supra, </em>the use\u2019s legal status as a permitted use was established the moment the special exception was granted because the filling station was, in fact, already operating.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">DPI\u2019s argument hinges on the <em>modernization </em>being the operative scope of the special exception.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We hold, however, that the <em>use </em>is what defines a special exception in Montgomery County. \u00a7 59-A-2.1 of the Zoning Ordinance (defining \u201cSpecial Exception\u201d as \u201c[t]he grant of a specific <em>use </em>.... \u201d (emphasis added)). Therefore, whether DPI or Shell actually did or did not take any steps to modernize the Property is not dispositive to the establishment of the special exception for an automobile filling station. \u00a7\u00a7 59-A-2.1 and \u00a7 59-A-4.53(b)(2) of the Zoning Ordinance. What is dispositive is that the Property was operating as an automobile filling station while a special exception permitting the operation of a filling station existed. That operation constitutes the <em>use </em>under the special exception. It was at that point a permitted use, albeit it might have been operating in violation of the Zoning Ordinance\u2019s requirements for such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>To reiterate, the Board\u2019s February 11, 2005, Resolution only addressed one question, which the Board found determinative in the case: \u201cCan the Board require a special exception holder to accept a special exception it does not want?\u201d As we discussed <em>supra, </em>the Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">\u201cIn this case, the special exception holder, [DPI], has clearly manifested its intent that it does not desire to proceed under, or make use of, the approved special exception. It has done so by (a) failing to appeal the July 11, 2003 Resolution revoking the special exception, and (b) opposing [Punch's] request for reconsideration, to the extent that it sought (prematurely, as the Court determined) judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision to hear the request for reconsideration. In its arguments to the Board, [DPI] has clearly and unequivocally indicated that it considers the special exception to have been abandoned and has no intention to seek reinstatement or, even if reinstated, to make use of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">\u201cUnder these circumstances, it is [DPI\u2019s] right to have the special exception revoked. As [Punch's] counsel has fairly pointed out, a special exception is an authorization to use land in a particular way, never a command to do so. A special exception must be requested and used. A special exception holder who manifests the intent not to use the special exception is deemed to have relinquished its authorization. That intent may be manifested in one of several ways, such as non-implementation, abandonment, or by express actions or words. While the Zoning Ordinance only expressly addresses the first two of these circumstances, we find that the third is necessarily implicit in the very nature of a special exception. Consequently, once [DPI] manifested its intent not to use the automobile filling station special exception, the issue of whether it had failed to implement the special exception became moot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">\u201cAccordingly, we conclude that, because the special exception holder has consented to the revocation of the special exception of the property, the revocation must stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Board of Appeals for Montgomery County, Case No. S-2217, February 11, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">On August 8, 2005, the Circuit Court issued an order affirming the decision of the Board. The Circuit Court\u2019s finding was premised upon the special exception being issued for modernization rather than for the use as an automobile ffliing station. As discussed <em>supra, </em>that is not the correct interpretation. Therefore, the Circuit Court was incorrect in affirming the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">In any case, the Board\u2019s decision did not properly address the issues now before the Court. The Board misconstrued the function of the granting of a special exception and, because of that, misconstrued when a special exception begins to exist. The situation extant is that once a special exception is applied for, granted, and operation of the subject property is begun or continued pursuant to it, the owner of the property has six months to revert back to a prior nonconforming use (if one existed) before it is abandoned. But in this case the special exception was not \u201crevoked\u201d within that six month period. Even if DPI could decide not to make use of that special exception and could pursue the revocation of the special exception, the result, however, would be that the Property could then only be operated pursuant to Montgomery County\u2019s Convenience Commercial (C-l) requirements. Thus, as the nonconforming use no longer exists, the Property can be operated as an automobile filling station only pursuant to a special exception-if it still exists. If the special exception was properly revoked then the only uses that may be made of the property are those uses permitted by right in the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Because of our holding, there is an issue remaining as to whether the special exception was, in fact, properly revoked<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>given that the Board and DPI mistakenly believed that they were returning the Property to its nonconforming status. As we cannot make that determination on the basis of the record before us, we shall remand to the Circuit Court for it to remand the issue to the Board for its reconsideration of the issue of whether the revocation of the special exception was properly accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In vacating the decision of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, we find that the Circuit Court\u2019s and the Board\u2019s decision were based upon an erroneous conclusion of law. Special exceptions in Montgomery County are provided for <em>uses </em>of property. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Property was in operation as an automobile filling station pursuant to a special exception. Once that use began, either the nonconforming use was immediately terminated or, at a minimum, the six month period of abandonment started in respect to the prior nonconforming use status of the Property. Those six months passed and the nonconforming use, if not sooner terminated, was thus abandoned. For the reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and remand the case to that court for it to remand the case to the Board for a re-determination of the status of the special exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY VACATED.

Normally, the abandonment of a nonconforming use would occur when all use of the Property ceased for six months and no other use was made of the Property.

It is, at a minimum, unclear whether a nonconforming use is terminated <em>immediately </em>upon the change from a nonconforming use to a permitted use. Because we are holding under these particular circumstances that a nonconforming use had ceased for the requisite six months provided for in the ordinance, it is not necessary to resolve the issue of immediate termination although it will be discussed to some degree, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b727-6\">.

DPI references a June 4, 2004, decision by the Board (Case No. S-2199), referred to as the \"River Road\u201d case, where, similar to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the owner of an automobile filling station sought revocation of a special exception and reversion of the property to nonconforming use status. Board of Appeals of Montgomery County, Case No. S-2199, June 4, 2004. In that administrative agency decision reference was made to the fact that a new canopy and gas pumps had been installed on the subject property. The Board found those improvements to be an \"intensification\u201d of the nonconforming use, rather than something requiring a special exception. As far as we are aware the \u201cRiver Road\u201d case has not been the subject of any judicial proceedings, at least at the appellate level. We need not reach whether such improvements result in a valid intensification of a nonconforming use in the case <em>sub judice </em>because of our disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\">. No authority was proffered for this position taken by the Department (i.e., that uses can revert back to a \"legal\u201d nonconforming status). We know of no authority that recognizes that a nonconforming use continues when a property is operated as a permitted use (e.g., a special exception). Nor are we aware of any authority permitting that which has been abandoned (in this case not operated as a nonconforming use for six months) to later be determined to have been revived or not abandoned. If it was abandoned six months after the grant of the special exception it cannot be \"un-abandoned.\u201d Additionally, if it was abandoned it cannot be revived because of the prohibition in this county (as in most, if not all, counties) against creating illegal nonconforming uses after the relevant legislation has been enacted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\">.

DPI has asserted that the Board was not required to issue such a Resolution in order to revoke the special exception; that the exception expired (was no longer valid) as a matter of law pursuant to \u00a7 59-A-4.53(b)(2) of the Zoning Ordinance. Even if that were so, it would not revive the nonconforming use status. It would merely mean that the property would thereafter have to be operated as a permitted use under the present ordinance which presumably would prohibit the operation of a filling station.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b732-9\">. The Board relied on the Board of Appeals' Rules of Procedure Rule 10.1.2, which states: \"The Board may grant reconsideration only on evidence of changed circumstances, new evidence that could not reasonably have been presented at the original hearing, or if some mistake or misrepresentation was made at the original hearing that requires rehearing and reargument in order to be corrected.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">. None of the cases referred to in the supporting strip cite offer any support for the term \"recommence after abandonment.\u201d The cases cited concern instances where a different, less onerous nonconforming use is authorized by statute and is substituted, or concerns the legalization of terminated uses via the variance process. We are unaware whether variances have been, or could be, sought in the instant case or whether the proceedings to \"revive\u201d the nonconforming use were in the nature of variance requests.

Chief Judge Bell, writing for the Court, recently discussed abandonment in <em>Trip Associates, Inc. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>392 Md. 563, 898 A.2d 449 (2006), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">\"Abandonment ... focuses not on the owner's intent, but rather, on whether the owner failed to use the property as a nonconforming use in the time period specified in the zoning ordinance. <em>See Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. v.

The Court continued, however, stating that, \"[o]n the other hand, the abandonment or discontinuance must be active and actual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 898 A.2d at 458. Discussing this, the Court cited to <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Dembo, Inc., </em>123 Md.App. 527, 719 A.2d 1007 (1998). In that case an adult night club had been operating without a proper license for two years. The question became, whether the failure to obtain the license operated to abandon the otherwise lawful nonconforming use. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\"We shall follow the majority of jurisdictions and apply the rule that a valid nonconforming use will not be forfeited by the failure of the business owner to secure a license to operate his business. We consider that this rule accords reasonable protection to the property right that has been long recognized under Maryland law as a vested right subject to constitutional protection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-7\"><em>Dembo, </em>123 Md.App. at 541, 719 A.2d at 1015. The situation in <em>Dembo, </em>however, is distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice. </em>DPI's lessee, Shell, took an affirmative action to apply for the special exception. That affirmative act is distinctive from the passive lack of action by the club owner in <em>Dembo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">This is further supported by the Court's analysis of a predecessor to \u00a7 59-G-4.14 of the Zoning Ordinance, \u00a7 111-57(c) of the 1965 Code. The Court in <em>Canada\u2019s Tavern, Inc. v. Town of Glen Echo, </em>260 Md. 206, 271 A.2d 664 (1970), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">\"We think the Council, having in mind a larger purpose, intended to align itself with those local governments which have found it desirable to delete the factor of intent in respect of the abandonment, discontinuance or cessation of nonconforming uses rather than continuing to run the gamut of its judicial determination in a succession of infinitely variable factual situations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">260 Md. at 211, 271 A.2d at 666 (footnote omitted). Montgomery County has made it explicitly clear in \u00a7 59-G-4.14 of the Zoning Ordinance that: \"If a nonconforming use is abandoned, it must not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>reestablished. <em>A nonconforming use is abandoned if the nonconforming use stops for at least 6 months.\" </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\">.

Purich asserts in its brief that Shell took some steps to fulfill the conditions of the special exception. There was, however, no evidentia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>ry fact-finding in the proceedings below. The Board\u2019s proceedings were limited to discussing the \u201cthreshold issue\u201d of whether the Board could reconsider the revocation decision concerning the special exception itself. Because DPI did not challenge the revocation and stated that it did not intend to use the special exception, the Board found that the issue of whether it failed to implement the special exception became moot. Board of Appeals for Montgomery County, Case No. S-2217, February 11, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">. As stated <em>supra, </em>the actual original petition for the special exception was made by DPI\u2019s lessee at the time, Shell. In the petition, Shell indicated that the proposed use for the special exception was: \u201cAutomobile Filling Station.\u201d Shell did not mention \u201cmodernization.\u201d Shell simply indicated in the \u201cStatement of Justification,\u201d which was attached to the petition, that it \u201cdesire[d] to renovate the existing gas station.\u201d Shell applied for the special exception because it could not make the renovations it desired while operating the filling station as a nonconforming use.

It is my view that, on the facts of this case, the Majority opinion improperly resolves the tension existing between a nonconforming use as a disfavored aspect of land use regulation, yet one that enjoys protection as a vested right. The Majority, in what I consider to be an opportunistic rush to declare extinguished the nonconforming use in the present case, imagines an intent to abandon the safe harbor of the nonconforming automobile filling and service station use simply because a prior tenant applied for and received paper approval of a special exception for a proposed conforming automobile filling station operation on the property in question. The Majority then misapprehends the significance of the utter failure of the tenant or property owner to take any affirmative act, subsequent to and in reliance on that paper special exception approval, to change or modify the nonconforming use into one conforming to the special exception and applicable zoning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">There was neither abandonment nor termination of the nonconforming use here. The record is devoid of any evidence (substantial or otherwise) that the nonconforming automobile filling and service station use changed even by one whit since its establishment in the early 1960\u2019s and running through the closure of the evidentiary record in this case. Viewed in criminal law vernacular and even in a light most favorable to the Majority\u2019s view, the record at best reveals an intent to change (i.e., the obtention of the paper special exception approval) that might supply, had the Board of Appeals chosen to interpret it so, the <em>mens rea </em>of abandonment or termination, but which does not come close to satisfying the <em>actus reus </em>required before a declaration may be made of abandonment or termination of the constitutionally protected vested right to maintain and continue the nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">A lawful nonconforming use includes generally a vested right to its continuance. <em>Trip Assoc. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>392 Md. 563, 574, 898 A.2d 449, 456 (2006); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number><em>County Comm\u2019rs of Carroll County v. Uhler, </em>78 Md.App. 140, 148, 552 A.2d 942, 945-46 (1989). As part of that vested right, the property owner is entitled to maintain that use, subject only to local ordinance limitations on expansion, abandonment, amortization, and the like. <em>County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. E.L. Gardner, Inc., </em>293 Md. 259, 268, 443 A.2d 114, 119 (1982). Local ordinances regulating nonconforming uses generally seek to achieve the desired goal of the elimination of nonconforming uses through economic attrition and physical obsolescence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Abandonment or termination of a nonconforming use in modern land use regulation usually does not turn on the showing of mere intent to abandon the use. Compare <em>Trip Assoc., </em>392 Md. at 577, 898 A.2d at 457-58, and <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Dembo, </em>123 Md.App. 527, 539, 719 A.2d 1007, 1013-14 (1998) (citing <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. v. Loveman, </em>349 Md. 560, 581-82, 709 A.2d 749, 759 (1998)), with <em>Landay v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>173 Md. 460, 469, 196 A. 293, 297 (1938). Usually, it is the actual conduct of the user in ceasing the use for some statutory period that is determinative. <em>Trip Assoc., id.; Canada\u2019s Tavern, Inc. v. Town of Glen Echo, </em>260 Md. 206, 210-11, 271 A.2d 664, 666 (1970). As this Court said in <em>Trip Associates, </em>a sufficient predicate to conclude \u201cabandonment or discontinuance must be active and actual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the Montgomery County Zoning Ordinance governing abandonment of a nonconforming use places no premium on proof of intent to abandon, but instead focuses on actual stoppage or discontinuance of the use. <em>See </em>Mont. Cty. Code, \u00a7 59-G-4.14 (\u201cA nonconforming use is abandoned if the nonconforming use stops for at least 6 months.\u201d). I submit that the mere paper shuffling of the prior tenant in this case did not evince an intent to abandon the nonconforming use sufficient to proclaim abandonment or termination on the part of the property owner who continued the nonconforming use through a subsequent tenant. <em>See Kastendike v. Baltimore Ass\u2019n for Retarded Children, </em>267 Md. 389, 297 A.2d 745 (1972) (mere change of ownership does not destroy a nonconforming use; a use transferred to a successor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>in interest will continue to be legal so long as the nature and character of that use is unchanged and substantially the same facilities are used).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The major deviation between the Majority opinion and my view regards whether the automobile filling and service station use operated after the approval of the special exception was carried out solely under the legal authority of the special exception or was a continuation of the nonconforming use. The Majority\u2019s facile conclusion that it was the former <em>(see, e.g., </em>Maj. op. at 696-97, 912 A.2d at 600 \u2014 \u201cThe automobile filling station was operated under the auspices of the special exception [until revoked on 11 July 2003, at the new tenant\u2019s request] \u2014 even though it appears that none of the improvements attached as conditions to the special exception ... were made.\u201d), is insupportable. It is undisputed that neither the tenant-applicant for the special exception nor the property owner implemented or established any of the improvements or changes in the operation of the use required by the special exception approval. This leads to the inescapable conclusion that the special exception never was established or relied on.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The Montgomery County Board of Appeals\u2019s 1997 approval of the special exception in this case included 15 express conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">Accordingly, the Board grants the requested exception and variances subject to the following conditions.

The use was not established, for purposes of the viability of the special exception, at any time at or after the approval of the special exception. The alternative scenario envisioned by the Zoning Ordinance, the issuance of a building permit where improvements are needed to implement the approved special exception (as was the case for most of the 15 conditions attached to the approval of the special exception), was not fulfilled. Thus, it was entirely correct for the Montgomery County Board of Appeals to declare the special exception (and variances) void because no affirmative actions were taken by the tenants or property owner to effectuate the approval within the time provided by the Zoning Ordinance. <em>See generally Pemberton v. Montgomery County, </em>275 Md. 363, 340 A.2d 240 (1975) (administrative agency\u2019s determination of whether a special exception was implemented or abandoned is a mixed question of fact and law and, thus, is entitled to deferential review on judicial review).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Were there evidence in this record that a tenant or the property owner had implemented, or even attempted to implement, any of the conditions of the special exception, or perhaps changed in some meaningful way the use as it operated before the special exception was approved (from which an inference might be drawn that the entity took advantage of the special exception), my view might be different. As noted <em>supra, </em>the proper legislative inducements for the elimination of nonconforming uses are economic attrition and physical obsolescence. In a sense, those very factors may have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>on the prior tenant\u2019s mind when it applied for the special exception and on the Board of Appeals\u2019s mind when it approved the special exception. For example, Shell Oil\u2019s purpose in seeking the special exception was described by the Board of Appeals\u2019s in its approval as \u201cto upgrade the existing gasoline filling station by installing new pump islands; ... construction of a new canopy; addition of landscaping in the front of the station ...; installation of a new freestanding sign ...; renovation of the exterior of the service station and service bay areas; ... installation of a trash enclosure; installation of new lighting ...\u201d and other site improvements and upgrades. The Board\u2019s approval was expressed in terms of permitting a \u201cmodernization\u201d and \u201cupgrade\u201d of the existing filling station. Regretfully, not one thing proposed by Shell and approved by the Board ever came to fruition. Accordingly, there is no affirmative evidence that the nonconforming use was abandoned or terminated. At best, despite good intentions, no change in the status quo of the ongoing nonconforming use ever occurred. There is no basis in law or fact for the Majority opinion\u2019s contrarian result. The Board of Appeals and the Circuit Court got it right.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<judges id=\"b757-5\">Judges RAKER and GREENE authorized me to state that they join the views expressed in this dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\">. The Majority opinion claims that \"[o]nce the special exception was granted ..., the use of the Property came into conformance with the zoning law; hence, the nonconforming use ceased.\u201d Maj. op. at 698, 912 A.2d at 611. This statement is a mere <em>ipse dixit </em>and erroneous. Not only would the use not conform with the Zoning Ordinance unless and until all of the conditions of the special exception approval were implemented, the existence of the variances, approved at the same time as the special exception, epitomize why the use as it continued could not be said to be in \"conformance with the zoning law\u201d or that the nonconforming use had ceased. The variances, mostly to set-back, landscaping, or screening requirements of the Zoning Ordinance prevailing at the time of approval of the special exception, were acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>edged by the Board of Appeals as necessary because of existing conditions as the nonconforming use was being operated, as well as for the proposed improvements under the proposed special exception. Because no improvements were ever implemented, the continued use of the property as it was established in the 1960's continued to represent contravention of a host of Zoning Ordinance requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
