In April, 2006, Bar Counsel, having learned that, in November, 2005, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals had found that respondent, John Midlen, Jr., violated certain D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct (DCRPC) and had suspended him from the practice of law for a period of eighteen months, filed a petition seeking reciprocal discipline in Maryland. The petition, filed pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-773(b), alleged that, based on the findings of the D.C. Court, Midlen had violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC) 1.15 (safekeeping property in which a client has an interest), 1.16 (requirements upon termination of representation), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d) (violating other MRPC; engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation that is prejudicial to administration of justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In accordance with Rule 16-773(c) we issued an order directing the parties to show cause why, based on any of the grounds set forth in Rule 16-773(e), corresponding discipline should not be imposed. Both parties responded to that order. Mr. Midlen\u2019s principal response was (1) that the suspension by the D.C. Court of Appeals violated his right to due process of law in that the court, by adopting the recommendation of its Board of Professional Responsibility, effectively discarded the factual findings of the Hearing Committee that had been appointed to consider the complaint of the D.C. Bar Counsel, findings which, in Mr. Midlen\u2019s view, were binding on the court, and (2) that the eighteen month suspension conflicted with sanctions imposed by this Court for comparable violations. We find no merit in Midlen\u2019s response, but shall examine the manner in which the reciprocal sanction should be implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">To address Midlen\u2019s response, it is necessary to understand both the procedure for resolving disciplinary complaints in the District of Columbia and the nature of the charges filed against him in that jurisdiction. We described the disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>procedure in the District in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Parsons, </em>310 Md. 132, 138-39, n. 6, 527 A.2d 325, 328, n. 6 (1987), and it appears from the current D.C. Bar Rules that the procedure there has not changed substantially since then. In addition to Bar Counsel, whose duties are to receive and investigate complaints and prosecute disciplinary proceedings, there are three layers to the disciplinary process \u2014 the Court of Appeals itself, at the top, a nine-person Board of Professional Responsibility appointed by the court, and a three-person Hearing Committee appointed by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">A disciplinary case is prosecuted first before a Hearing Committee, which is charged with conducting an evidentiary hearing on Bar Counsel\u2019s petition in accordance with rules adopted by the Board. Within 60 days following the hearing, the Committee submits to the Board a report containing its findings and recommendation, together with a record of its proceedings. If no exceptions are filed to the report, the Board may decide the case on the basis of the Hearing Committee record. If exceptions <em>are </em>filed, the Board schedules the matter for submission of briefs and oral argument. Promptly after oral argument or, if there is no oral argument, after reviewing the Hearing Committee record, the Board may \u201cadopt or modify the recommendation of the Hearing Committee, remand the case to the Hearing Committee for further proceedings, direct Bar Counsel to issue an informal admonition, or dismiss the petition.\u201d D.C.Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 9(c). Unless the Board dismisses the petition, remands the case, or concludes the case by a reprimand or direction for informal admonition, the Board prepares a report containing <em>its </em>findings and recommendation. That report is transmitted to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">As with the Hearing Committee report, either party may file exceptions to the Board\u2019s report. If exceptions are filed, the court schedules the matter for consideration and enters an appropriate order. In determining that order, \u201cthe Court shall accept the findings of fact made by <em>the Board </em>unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence of record, and shall adopt the recommended disposition <em>of the Board </em>unless to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>so would foster a tendency toward inconsistent dispositions for comparable conduct or would otherwise be unwarranted.\u201d D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 9(g). (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The complaint against Mr. Midlen arose from his representation of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries (JSM), which produced and broadcast religious programs on various cable television outlets. Initially through a law firm, Midlen <em>&amp; </em>Guillot (M <em>&amp; </em>G), Midlen was retained by JSM to represent it in the royalty distribution process, under which, pursuant to Federal law, the Librarian of Congress distributes royalties to copyright owners. As the D.C. Court of Appeals pointed out, the distribution process has two phases. First, royalties are allocated among eight designated claimant groups, one of which was the Devotional Group, of which JSM was a member. In the second phase, payments are allocated to the members of the designated claimant group. If the members of the group agree on an allocation, they sign a settlement agreement specifying the distribution; otherwise, the allocation is litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Though generally eschewing long quotations, we choose to recite the facts underlying the D.C. complaint as stated by the D.C. Court of Appeals, rather than attempt to paraphrase them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">\u201cThe 1991 retainer agreement between Midlen\u2019s firm and JSM provided that services generally would be billed on an hourly basis and that JSM was expected to make \u2018full and prompt payments of the amounts invoiced.\u2019 M &amp; G agreed, however, \u2018at least for the 1990 [royalty] claim period, to allow [JSM] to pay only our out-of-pocket expenses until such time as the royalties actually are distributed.\u2019 Once that happened \u2014 i.e., when 1990 distribution checks were sent to M <em>&amp; </em>G as escrow agent, see note 3, supra \u2014 M &amp; G would \u2018deduct the fees incurred as of that date for professional services rendered\u2019 and \u2018forward [ ] the balance to [JSM].\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">In July 1991, and for each July thereafter until 1997, Midlen filed a claim with the Library of Congress on JSM\u2019s behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>for royalties earned in the preceding year. In 1992, after deducting its attorney\u2019s fees and expenses from the first distribution for the 1990 claim period, M &amp; G sent the rest of those funds to JSM. In September 1993, M &amp; G sent JSM a second disbursement check for that claim period, pointing out that its legal fees had been deducted from this distribution as well. An accompanying spreadsheet stated that a balance of $10,009.22 was being \u2018reserved,\u2019 i.e., not disbursed, by M <em>&amp; </em>G. JSM informed Midlen that it would not consent to M <em>&amp; </em>G holding this \u2018reserve\u2019; it reminded him that costs other than out-of-pocket expenses were to be reimbursed to M &amp; G \u2018when [royalty] funds are disbursed\u2014 not escrowed against.\u2019 JSM said nothing in opposition to the two fee deductions M &amp; G had taken from the distributed funds. Midlen forwarded the $10,009.22 to JSM.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\">In late 1994, JSM\u2019s Chairman of the Board of Directors, Clyde Fuller, wrote Midlen expressing concern about the amounts being billed in light of the results achieved. Near the end of December 1994, Midlen informed JSM that his legal fees would be deducted from the upcoming 1991 royalty distribution. Although it appeared that JSM owed M &amp; G substantial overdue fees, Fuller objected to the deductions in several phone conversations. On December 27, 1994, JSM instructed Midlen in writing that \u2018no attorneys\u2019 fees are to be withheld from the proceeds. In other words, the entire amount disbursed is to be sent to us and we will, in turn, reimburse your firm when an amount is agreed upon.\u2019 When Midlen objected to these instructions as contrary to the retainer agreement, JSM fired him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, a few days later the claimants in JSM\u2019s group reached a settlement enabling JSM to receive a 1991 distribution, and JSM rehired Midlen \u2014 in order, Frances Swaggart of JSM testified, to insure that JSM obtained this money. On or around January 3, 1995, JSM received a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>distribution from M &amp; G from which Midlen had withheld $20,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs. JSM made no objection to this deduction. In late January 1995, Midlen and Guillot dissolved their partnership and Midlen formed his own law firm. In a letter, he proposed that JSM continue its relationship with him on the same basis as before, and JSM accepted, remaining with him because, as Frances Swaggart testified, \u2018his fees were lower than\u2019 Guillot had proposed in similarly offering to represent JSM. At this time, too, JSM raised no questions about Midlen\u2019s deductions of fees from royalty payments or the size of his fees. On August 18,1995, however, Mrs. Swaggart sent a letter to Midlen stating that JSM \u2018continued to disagree with [him] concerning [his] billings over the past two years and that the matter must be resolved.\u2019 The letter complained that his last bill was \u2018ridiculous\u2019 and directed him to \u2018list the hours you work for us plus state the charge per hour.\u2019 It continued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">\u2018You also know that we do not give and we have not given you permission to deposit any royalties into your account, delete your expenses, and remit the balance to us. Instead, we have consistently instructed you to send the full amount of royalties received to us and we will remit payment to you. However, that remittance will only be when we feel we are being charged the correct amounts for the work done and your invoices are in the format requested.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">A second letter to Midlen from Barry Miller, an attorney for JSM, in October 1995 reiterated the request that Midlen itemize the hours spent on each daily service referenced in his bills. Miller further expressed his belief that JSM had not authorized Midlen to deduct legal fees directly from royalty disbursements, a practice \u2018particularly problematic since there may be a dispute concerning your bills.\u2019 Midlen answered the October letter by proposing different formats for his bills and by reminding Miller of the original engagement letter. \u2018Given the Ministry\u2019s payment history,\u2019 Midlen wrote, \u2018the one thing that is not negotiable is that I remit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>anything to JSM while leaving payment of my legal fees to some future agreement and compensation.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">In March and May 1996, Midlen notified JSM that distributions would soon be issued for the 1992 and 1993 claim periods, but that JSM\u2019s share would be insufficient to cover his unpaid legal fees. On multiple occasions after 1996 and through 1997, Midlen received royalties on JSM\u2019s behalf but failed to notify it of the distributions. This prompted Miller in August 1996 to write to Midlen requesting an accounting, because \u2018it appears that you did receive some distributions and that you, without authorization of the Ministries, applied them to payment of your legal fees which we still question.\u2019 In October 1996, Miller again wrote Midlen asking for \u2018an accounting of all sums which have been collected to date and the disbursal of such sums.\u2019 A year later in October 1997, Midlen wrote JMS a letter admitting that he had failed so far to provide \u2018an accounting for monies received and disbursed since May 1996,\u2019 and promising to furnish one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">Another lawyer for JSM, Frank Koszorus, met with Midlen in November 1997 and again asked for an accounting of monies received on JSM\u2019s behalf. In December, when Koszorus repeated the request for a \u2018full, detailed and intelligible accounting of the royalty sums,\u2019 Midlen twice replied by admitting that the accounting he owed JSM was not completed. On or about February 9, 1998, JSM terminated Midlen\u2019s services and directed him promptly to deliver all files concerning JSM to Koszorus. Pointing to unanswered inquiries about its bills, JSM again told Midlen that he was not authorized to withdraw money from the sums held on JSM\u2019s behalf. During February and March 1998, a flurry of correspondence ensued in which JSM asked for the accounting and for its files, and Midlen requested more time to finish the accounting. On April 29, 1998, he sent JSM the final accounting which identified all royalty disbursements JSM had been entitled to and all escrow funds applied to unpaid legal fees from June 1996 to April 1998. Midlen did not turn over the JSM files until months later. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Previously, on October 31 and December 30, 1997, Midlen had written himself checks from his escrow account for $6,628.63 and $5,602.32, respectively, to pay down JSM\u2019s outstanding legal fees. He did not deposit either check until September 1998, after his services had been terminated and he had rendered the final accounting. Altogether, Midlen had disbursed to JSM approximately $341,000 in royalty payments between 1992 and 1997, and paid himself some $123,000 in fees and costs during the same period. (JSM made direct payments to him, ending in 1994, of approximately $52,000). The Board found \u2018no evidence on the record that Midlen took more [in attorney\u2019s fees and costs] than was his due.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><em>In re Midlen, </em>885 A.2d 1280, 1283-85 (D.C.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The Court also recited the facts surrounding Respondent\u2019s handling of an addendum to a settlement agreement between the Devotional Claimants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\u201cIn October of 1997, Midlen informed JSM that it was necessary to amend the Devotional Claimants\u2019 1992-93 Settlement Agreement because one of the other claimants had failed to file a claim in the royalty proceeding. In a fax to JSM on November 12, Midlen reported on the status of this proceeding and attached a proposed draft Addendum. On November 14, JSM informed Midlen that it needed time to review the matter and that Midlen was not authorized to execute or sign any document on its behalf until JSM informed him of its decision. Midlen offered to answer any questions regarding the Addendum. He also reminded JSM that the Addendum did not make any substantive changes to the earlier agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">Thereafter, JSM advised Midlen that Frank Koszorus would be contacting him regarding the Addendum and reminded him that \u2018the directives given to you in our letter of November 14, 1997, are still in effect.\u2019 Midlen met with Koszorus, who indicated that he understood the Addendum and did not have any questions for Midlen. On December 12, Midlen forwarded the final version of the Addendum to JSM and advised it that the final version would go forward the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>following week. The same day, Reverend (Jimmy) Swaggart responded to this letter, advising Midlen that he could only execute the Addendum for JSM \u2018when you have authorization in writing to do so from myself or Frances \u2014 not before.\u2019 The next day, Midlen replied to this letter noting that Koszorus had not raised any objections to the Addendum and that JSM had not raised any specific problems or questions. Midlen\u2019s letter did not advise JSM that he intended to execute the Addendum over JSM\u2019s objection. Midlen executed the Addendum on December 16, 1997. Shortly, thereafter, Midlen received a letter from Koszorus, dated December 16, reiterating JSM\u2019s directive that Midlen was not to execute the Addendum without written permission from JSM. Midlen neither replied to this letter nor took action to withdraw JSM\u2019s assent to the Addendum. JSM did not learn that Midlen had executed the Addendum until April 1998.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The operative complaint was filed in April, 1998, by Frances Swaggart, on behalf of JSM. In that complaint, Ms. Swaggart contended that she had filed an earlier complaint in 1997, of which D.C. Bar Counsel had no record, in which she had complained that Midlen had failed to provide JSM with an accounting of funds collected on JSM\u2019s behalf, that he failed to provide JSM with \u201cunderstandable legal bills,\u201d and that he had entered into agreements concerning royalty payments without JSM\u2019s knowledge and consent. Neither the 1998 complaint nor Ms. Swaggart\u2019s description of the earlier one alleged any particular fee dispute between JSM and Midlen.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Upon the complaint filed by Ms. Swaggart, D.C. Bar Counsel, on December 1, 2000, filed a petition and specification of charges, contending that Midlen had violated the following DCRPC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">Rule 1.3(c), in that Respondent failed to act with reasonable promptness in representing the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">Rule 1.4(a), in that Respondent failed to keep his client reasonably informed about the status of the matter and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>failed to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">Rule 1.4(b), in that Respondent faded to explain the matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">Rule 1.7(b) &amp; (c), in that Respondent engaged in a likely conflict of interest and failed to provide full disclosure to his client regarding his representation of another client with adverse interests;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">Rule 1.15(a), in that Respondent failed to keep complete records of accounts maintained in connection with the representation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">Rule 1.15(b), in that Respondent failed to promptly notify his client upon receiving funds in which the client had an interest, failed to promptly deliver the funds to his client, and failed to promptly provide a full accounting regarding such funds to the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">Rule 1.15(c), in that Respondent failed to keep separate from his own funds the disputed portion of the funds in which he and the client had an interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-10\">Rule 1.16(a)(3), in that Respondent continued to represent the client after Respondent had been discharged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-11\">Rule 1.16(d), in that Respondent failed to take timely steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect the client\u2019s interest, by failing to surrender papers and property to which the client was entitled; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-12\">Rule 8.4(c), in that Respondent engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">In accordance with the D.C. disciplinary procedure, upon Midlen\u2019s denial of Bar Counsel\u2019s averments, the matter was referred to a Hearing Committee, which conducted a four-day evidentiary hearing. Nine witnesses, including Midlen, testified, and more than 200 exhibits were placed in evidence. Bar Counsel and Midlen submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. On October 30, 2002, the Committee filed a 67-page Report and Recommendation, in which it concluded that Midlen had violated DCRPC 1.15(b) \u201cfor his failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>provide a prompt accounting to his client of funds held on behalf of the client,\u201d but that Bar Counsel had not sustained her burden of proof with respect to any of the other charges. In support of those ultimate conclusions, the Hearing Committee made 132 specific findings of fact and discussed at some length the various charges. We need consider only two, beyond the Rule 1.15(b) violation \u2014 misappropriation arising from Midlen\u2019s withdrawal, on seven occasions between January 3, 1995 and December 30, 1997, of an aggregate of $49,000 from his IOLTA account for fees, and the claim that he had acted dishonestly when, in December, 1997, he signed, on behalf of JSM, an addendum to the 1992-93 settlement agreement among the Devotional claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">With respect to the claim of misappropriation based on Midlen\u2019s withdrawal of funds he regarded as earned fees, the Hearing Committee concluded, first, that Bar Counsel had not actually charged Midlen with \u201cmisappropriation\u201d and it therefore disregarded any suggestion that he had engaged in such conduct. The Committee did, then, proceed to rule on the underlying basis of a misappropriation charge by concluding that Midlen was authorized to make the withdrawals. That conclusion rested to a large extent on the Committee\u2019s findings that (1) notwithstanding earlier objections about Midlen\u2019s deducting fees from royalty distributions, JSM made no objection when, in January, 1995, Midlen withheld $20,000 from a distribution and explained that the withholding was for attorneys\u2019 fees; (2) in February, 1995, when M &amp; G dissolved, JSM hired Midlen and again raised no question about his deduction of fees from the cable royalty distribution; (3) notwithstanding correspondence back and forth regarding Midlen\u2019s invoices, by the end of 1996, Midlen believed, with ample reason, that JSM had resolved whatever questions it had about his fees and billing format; and (4) that in the alleged complaint JSM filed in April, 1997, which Bar Counsel never received, no dispute was claimed with respect to fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Although the Hearing Committee found that there had been fee disputes between JSM and Midlen, it noted that \u201c[h]ere JSM appeared to withdraw its dispute and thus to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>[Midlen] to follow the practice agreed upon throughout his representation of JSM \u2014 that he could withdraw his fees from the cable royalty distributions.\u201d It thus concluded that \u201cthe fees were no longer disputed when [Midlen] withdrew them.\u201d For the Rule 1.15 violation that it found, the Hearing Committee recommended an informal admonition.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Bar Counsel filed an exception to the Hearing Committee\u2019s report \u2014 to its conclusion that she had failed to meet her burden of proof with respect to the other alleged violations and to the recommended sanction. After a review of the entire record, the Board of Professional Responsibility, on July 15, 2004, rendered its own 77-page Report to the D.C. Court of Appeals. The Board sustained the Hearing Committee\u2019s finding that Midlen had violated DCRPC 1.15(b) and concluded further that Bar Counsel had not pursued her alleged violations of DCRPC 1.3(c) and 1.15(b) regarding record-keeping. The Board departed significantly, however, from the Hearing Committee\u2019s findings with respect to some of the other alleged violations, noting that its departure \u201creflects, in our view, a dispassionate reassessment of the entire record.\u201d In that regard, the Board concluded that Midlen had violated:</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">(1) DCRPC 1.15(c) \u201cby misappropriating client funds by failing to keep separate from his own funds the disputed funds in which he and his client had an interest\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">(2) DCRPC 1.4(a) and (b) \u201cby failing to respond to requests for information regarding the fees [Midlen] withdrew from his client\u2019s disbursements and by failing to inform his client that he executed a settlement\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">(3) DCRPC 1.16(d) \u201cby failing to take reasonable steps to protect his client\u2019s interest upon termination of the representation, failing to turn over the client\u2019s file and by failing to provide a prompt accounting\u201d; and</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">(4) DCRPC 8.4(c) \u201cby engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>The Board sustained the Hearing Committee\u2019s findings that Bar Counsel had failed to sustain her burden of proof with respect to the other alleged violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Relying on Board Rule 13.7 and <em>In re Micheel, </em>610 A.2d 231, 234 (D.C.1992), the Board noted that the Hearing Committee\u2019s findings of fact will be affirmed \u201cwhen supported by \u2018substantial evidence on the record as a whole\u2019\u201d but, citing several cases from the D.C. Court of Appeals, held that it owed no deference to the Committee\u2019s determination of \u201cultimate facts,\u201d such as \u201cwhether the facts establish a violation of a Rule, and other conclusions of law.\u201d The Board observed that, although the Hearing Committee\u2019s findings of fact were \u201clargely supported by the record,\u201d it had (1) revised and reorganized some of them for ease in evaluating the violations at issue, (2) added some findings, supported by the record, necessary for a conclusion of law, (3) eliminated certain findings \u201cthat are unnecessary to any determination of the outcome,\u201d (4) eliminated certain \u201ccommentary\u201d from the Committee\u2019s findings that \u201cfails to advance the analysis of this matter,\u201d and (5) in a few instances, revised or deleted findings that \u201care not supported by substantial evidence in the record.... \u201d Those changes, the Board added, were based on documentary evidence and were made mindful of the deference owed to the Committee\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The Board recognized, as had the Hearing Committee, that the major dispute between the parties concerned whether Midlen had authority to withhold his fees from the royalty payments he received on behalf of JSM. It first made clear that an allegation of misappropriation was implicit in the alleged violation of DCRPC 1.15(c) and that the Committee erred in concluding otherwise. The issue, according to the Board, was whether Midlen was entitled to withhold those fees \u201cin the face of (i) JSM\u2019s repeated demands that all the royalty payments be delivered to JSM; (ii) JSM\u2019s specific directives that [Midlen] was not to take payments for legal fees from these funds; (iii) JSM\u2019s repeated complaints about the quantum of [Midlen\u2019s] fees; and (iv) JSM\u2019s repeated requests for an accounting of fees withdrawn and royalties paid.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Board concluded \u201cthat under these circumstances, [Midlen] misappropriated client funds in violation of Rule 1.15(c).\u201d The Board rejected the Hearing Committee\u2019s conclusion that JSM\u2019s concerns about Respondent\u2019s bills were nothing more than requests for information, which could not form the basis of a fee dispute. The Board reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-4\">\u201cJSM repeatedly demanded that all the royalty payments be delivered to JSM and that Respondent not deduct fees prior to such delivery. For example, in a 1995 letter to respondent, Mrs. Swaggart noted \u2018we have consistently instructed you to send the full amount of royalties received to us and we will remit payment to you.\u2019 RX 84. There are several other similar written directives on the record. See, e.g., RX 64, 87, 107. Accordingly, we find that JSM' clearly and unequivocally disputed Respondent\u2019s entitlement to take outstanding fees from royalty payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">Second, JSM\u2019s repeated complaints about the amount of Respondent\u2019s fees are further evidence that his client disputed Respondent\u2019s interest in the entrusted funds. We do not agree with the Committee that these complaints were \u2018vague and non-specific.\u2019 HC Report at 55. Although few of these complaints dispute specific amounts or items on the bill, they clearly convey the client\u2019s strong view that it was being charged too much for Respondent\u2019s services. See, e.g., RX 84, 87, 107. There is no dispute about the fact of these complaints. And once these complaints were made, it was Respondent\u2019s responsibility to see that they were resolved before taking any of his fees. He did not do so. Finally, this failure is all the more disturbing in light of JSM\u2019s repeated requests for an accounting of the royalties it had earned and the fees that Respondent had deducted from them. From October of 1995 forward, JSM requested such an accounting at least eight times. Respondent did not provide this information until April 1998, and in the interim he continued to receive royalties due to JSM and to deduct his fees from those payments. See Respondent\u2019s Proposed Findings at 30-34. We find that these requests for an accounting are clear evidence that JSM questioned Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>dent\u2019s interest in the royalties that he was holding on its behalf. In light of these facts, it is clear that JSM disputed Respondent\u2019s interest in the entrusted royalties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">The Board disagreed with the Hearing Committee\u2019s reliance on the retainer agreement between JSM and M &amp; G and the course of conduct between the parties as evidence that Midlen was entitled to take unpaid legal fees from any royalty payment he received on behalf of JSM. It read the retainer agreement as limiting Midlen\u2019s right to the withdrawal of fees to the 1990 calendar year and concluded that, even if that agreement could be read to allow Midlen to use cable royalty funds to satisfy his outstanding legal bills, once the client challenged that authority and once the client disputed the bills, he was no longer entitled to withhold fees from the royalty payments. The Board went on to conclude that Midlen\u2019s conduct in that regard \u201cevidenced a conscious indifference to the consequences of his actions and to his client\u2019s legitimate interest in the entrusted funds.\u201d The Board also disagreed with the Committee\u2019s conclusion regarding the addendum, reasoning that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">\u201cWhat is clear from the record is that at the time Respondent signed the Addendum his client had informed him on three separate occasions that he was not authorized to do so. Moreover, Respondent\u2019s actions after signing the Addendum were not consistent with the actions of a lawyer who honestly believed he had the authority to sign this document. Respondent did not tell his client that he had signed the Addendum. He did not send his client a copy of the signed Addendum. The day after the Addendum was signed, JSM wrote again and restated its objection. Respondent did not reply to this letter by telling his client that he had already executed the agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Believing Midlen\u2019s conduct to be reckless and dishonest, the Board recommended that he be disbarred. It added, however, that, it was dealing with a complex record and that, if the court were to conclude that the misappropriation was not reckless, a suspension of eighteen months would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>The D.C. Court of Appeals accepted most of the Board\u2019s findings but concluded that Midlen\u2019s misappropriation was negligent, rather than reckless, and the court therefore rejected the disbarment recommendation and suspended Midlen for eighteen months. <em>See In re Midlen, supra, </em>885 A.2d 1280. The Court noted Midlen\u2019s argument that the Board \u201cwrongly substituted its own fact-finding for that of the Hearing Committee,\u201d and responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\">\u201cHe cites almost no specifics in this regard, however, and our comparison of the Board\u2019s statement of the evidence with the Committee\u2019s reveals that, for the most part, the differences were over \u2018ultimate facts\u2019 \u2014 essentially \u2018conclusions of law,\u2019 <em>In re Micheel, </em>610 A.2d 231, 234 (D.C.1992)\u2014 or (what may be the same thing) were different characterizations of the basic facts. The handful of instances where the Board may be said to have disregarded findings by the Board are not, in our view, material \u2014 except in a single instance mentioned in Part III, <em>infra, </em>where Midlen receives the important benefit of that finding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1286, n. 7. The Court went on to explain its reasoning on why it regarded the record as establishing a fee dispute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avd\">\u201cMidlen\u2019s principal argument to the court is that there was never a fee dispute within the meaning of Rule 1.15(c), because (1) his original retainer agreement with JSM authorized him to deduct attorney\u2019s fees from distributed royalties, and (2) JSM periodically \u2018re-authorized\u2019 him to pay himself in that manner. On the record summarized, and in light of the principles outlined, that argument is unavailing. The retainer agreement is hardly a model of clarity. It deferred payment of attorney\u2019s fees \u2018at least for the 1990 claim period\u2019 until the royalties had been distributed, at which point M <em>&amp; </em>G would deduct its outstanding fees before forwarding the balance. It thus left ambiguous whether the same procedure would govern disbursements for succeeding claim periods. Initially, JSM raised no objection when Midlen twice deducted fees from payments for the original claim period (protesting only his plan to keep a \u2018reserve\u2019 against future fees earned), but by the end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>of 1994, JSM began questioning B &amp; G\u2019s entitlement to continue that practice. Whether, even under Rule 1.15(c)\u2019s undemanding test for a \u2018dispute,\u2019 a disagreement over the practice of deducting fees had arisen at that point is probably unclear. Despite its repeated oral and written instructions to Midlen in late 1994 not to deduct fees, JSM did not object when he again deducted $20,000 in fees from a January 1995 distribution for the 1994 claim period; and on dissolution of his partnership, it retained him again while mindful of his understanding that \u2018[t]here [would] be no change in any of the arrangements as to [their] relationship.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">Nevertheless, by August 1995 JSM was emphatically disagreeing with Midlen\u2019s \u2018billings over the past two years,\u2019 challenging the format of the bills and instructing him \u2018to send the full amount of royalties received to us and we will remit payment to you.\u2019 Two attorneys for JSM, Miller and then Koszorus, repeated the demands for itemization of time spent and disbursement of royalties without fee deduction on occasions from late 1995 through early 1998, when Midlen\u2019s services were terminated. There also began, and continued throughout that period, a succession of demands by JSM for a complete accounting of the distributed royalties and the fees and expenses Midlen had billed. Consequently, by September 1998 when Midlen withdrew from the escrow account attorney\u2019s fees totaling more than $12,000, it could not have escaped his knowledge that (as an August 1996 letter put it) this was \u2018without authorization of [JSM]\u2019 and that JSM disputed his entitlement to the fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsO\"><em>Id. </em>at 1286-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The Court also rejected Midlen\u2019s argument that the retainer agreement authorized his actions, concluding that \u201cthis assertion confuses contract law with an attorney\u2019s duties under Rule 1.15, which, as the Board and the Hearing Committee both recognized, arise because the lawyer has a fiduciary relationship with the client, rather than from the operation of a contract between them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1287 (citation omitted). The Court nonetheless concluded, however, that the misappropria<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>tion was not reckless due to the admitted ambiguity in the message JSM was seeking to convey and the one factual finding that the Board disregarded in the Court\u2019s view; that the dispute was not in good faith. <em>Id. </em>at 1289. On March 30, 2006, the court denied Midlen\u2019s motion for rehearing <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Midlen\u2019s response to this Court\u2019s order to show cause is largely a repetition of the arguments he made to the D.C. Board and the D.C. Court. His due process argument rests on the allegation that the D.C. Court \u201cdiscard[ed] in their entirety the factual findings the Hearing Committee made, substituting [the Board\u2019s factual findings].\u201d He complains that \u201cthe [Board] reviewed the written record and <em>sua sponte </em>found new facts, ignoring all aspects exculpatory of Midlen\u201d and \u201cignored the Committee\u2019s credibility findings.\u201d He did not, however, identify any specific facts relied upon by the Board or the Court that were not also found by the Committee, nor does he elaborate on how the credibility issues were implicated. His other argument was that the eighteen month suspension was too harsh under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Bar Counsel responded that the D.C. Court of Appeals had already addressed the issue of whether the Board inappropriately disregarded the factual findings of the Commission and that Midlen had failed to identify any specific instances of such factual disregard other than the \u201cultimate fact\u201d or \u201cconclusion of law\u201d that there existed a fee dispute. Bar Counsel also asserted that the punishment was appropriate under Maryland case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">We agree with Bar Counsel that the due process argument is without merit. Apart from the fact that the D.C. Court of Appeals competently considered and rejected the same argument, Midlen fails before us, as he did in the D.C. Court, to point out any new and different specific fact-finding by the Board or the court. As we have indicated, the Hearing Committee made 132 specific findings of fact and then determined that the facts it found did not establish that there was a fee dispute, which lay at the heart of the misappropriation complaint. The Board and the Court of Appeals concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>that those same facts <em>did </em>establish a fee dispute. Every fact relied upon by the Board and the Court of Appeals to establish a fee dispute is contained in the findings of fact of the Hearing Committee, and, as the D.C. Court held, no deference is due to the Hearing Committee\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion of whether those facts establish the existence of a fee dispute. <em>In re Appler, </em>669 A.2d 731, 738 (D.C.1995); <em>In re Micheel, supra, </em>610 A.2d at 234. The question of whether a fee dispute existed constitutes such an ultimate fact, because of its legal consequence. <em>See In re Micheel, supra, </em>610 A.2d at 234-35 (holding that the question of whether a misappropriation was negligent is an ultimate fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">There remains the matter of the appropriate sanction for the offenses. Maryland Rule 16-773 is captioned \u201cReciprocal discipline or inactive status,\u201d and we often refer to cases in which we are asked to respond to disciplinary rulings in other States as \u201creciprocal discipline\u201d cases. The actual text of Rule 16-773 sometimes uses the term \u201creciprocal discipline\u201d but also uses the term \u201ccorresponding discipline.\u201d <em>See </em>Rule 16-773(c), (e), and (f). There is no inconsistency in the use of those terms. Rather, when placed in context, they simply indicate that, ordinarily, \u201creciprocal\u201d discipline should \u201ccorrespond\u201d to the discipline to which we are asked to give reciprocity. That is most clear from Rule 16-773(e), which lists circumstances under which it would be inappropriate to order \u201ccorresponding\u201d discipline. Indeed, Bar Counsel\u2019s petition asks for \u201ccorresponding\u201d discipline, and his recommendation, in response to our show cause order, is that this Court enter an order suspending Midlen from practicing law in Maryland for eighteen months. If we were to accept that recommendation, as we shall, we would need to determine how it should be implemented: should it be entirely concurrent with the period of suspension in the District of Columbia or should it be at least partly consecutive? We have not addressed that issue before.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The sanction imposed by the D.C. Court took effect December 10, 2005, which means that it will likely end in June, 2007. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>If we were to impose an eighteen month suspension and have the suspension commence from the date of our mandate, which is the normal and traditional approach with respect to suspensions, the suspension would run until June or July, 2008. That is one option. The discipline is reciprocal and corresponding in that is for the same length of time and thus would reflect this Court\u2019s view that the conduct engaged in by Midlen warrants that he be suspended for a period of eighteen months. On the other hand, while the period would be comparable in length, it would not be comparable in duration. Midlen would remain suspended in Maryland for more than a year after his suspension ended in the District, for conduct committed in the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">If we were assured that Midlen had not practiced law in Maryland following his D.C. suspension, we might consider imposing an eighteen month suspension and making it retroactive to December 10, 2005, so that it could run entirely concurrently with the D.C. suspension. That, too, would be corresponding and reciprocal and would reflect our view that Midlen\u2019s conduct warrants an eighteen month suspension. We cannot do that on the record now before us, however, because the record is silent with respect to whether Midlen engaged in the practice of law in Maryland following his suspension in the District of Columbia. If there is any prospect that he did so, we cannot make our suspension retroactive, as that might have the impermissible effect of retroactively making unlawful conduct that, when engaged in, was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">A third approach is to achieve the objective of the second approach by imposing a suspension that would commence upon the issuance of our mandate and end when the suspension ordered in the District ends. That would be reciprocal and corresponding in terms of the duration of the period that Midlen is precluded from practicing law, but would not be corresponding in terms of the actual length of the Maryland suspension, as it would be for a period much shorter than eighteen months. That approach could, moreover, in some circumstances, reward an attorney for not promptly reporting an out-of-State suspension to Maryland Bar Counsel or engag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>ing in obstructive and delaying tactics once Bar Counsel becomes aware of the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Neither the Maryland Rules nor the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct and Model Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement explain, in the case of a suspension for a set period of time, whether the \u201csame\u201d or \u201cidentical\u201d or \u201creciprocal\u201d or \u201ccorresponding\u201d sanction should be an entirely concurrent suspension or a prospective suspension of equivalent length running from the date of the latter court\u2019s disposition. <em>See </em>Model Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement 22(D) (stating that generally a court should impose an \u201cidentical discipline or disability inactive status\u201d but not elaborating on what that means in the case of a suspension). A number of courts, including the D.C. Court of Appeals, when confronting this issue, have concluded that, <em>in appropriate circumstances, </em>concurrent suspensions are preferable.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In <em>Matter of Goldberg, </em>460 A.2d 982 (D.C.1983), the court had before it an order from this Court suspending an attorney for 30 days. <em>See Attorney Griev. Com\u2019n v. Goldberg, </em>292 Md. 650, 441 A.2d 338 (1982). The suspension under our order took effect March 25, 1982. The attorney, who was also admitted to practice in the District, immediately reported the suspension to D.C. Bar Counsel, who presented the matter to the Board of Professional Responsibility. The Board recommended that the attorney be suspended for 30 days. The court, reviewing the Board\u2019s recommendation, agreed that a 30-day suspension was appropriate, but considered, as a matter of first impression, how to structure the suspension. D.C. Rule XI, \u00a7 19(3) required that suspension orders take effect 30 days after entry, and the question was whether that rule applied to reciprocal suspensions. The court held that it did not, pointing out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">\u201c[I]f our reciprocal disciplinary order became effective thirty days after entry, we could never order that it run during the same period as in the state where the misconduct occurred unless the court in that jurisdiction stayed its own order. Indeed, in many cases, especially those involving short suspensions, the suspension periods in the two juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>dictions would never even intersect. <em>Such a result would tend to increase the punishment far beyond that intended by the original state and far beyond the degree of discipline warranted.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><em>Matter of Goldberg, supra, </em>460 A.2d at 985. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The court made clear that reciprocal suspensions need not always be concurrent and that there may be situations in which a concurrent suspension would result in a grave injustice. It concluded, however, that \u201cconcurrency will be the norm,\u201d and that \u201c[wjhether a particular suspension should be concurrent will depend to a considerable extent on the actions of the attorney involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court explained that, if the attorney promptly notifies Bar Counsel of the disciplinary action imposed in another State and \u201cvoluntarily refrains from practicing law in the District of Columbia during the period of suspension in the original jurisdiction,\u201d there would \u201cprobably be no reason to aggravate the discipline by making the District of Columbia suspension wholly or partially consecutive to that imposed elsewhere.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, if the attorney unreasonably delays notifying D.C. Bar Counsel or engages in practice in the District while suspended elsewhere, \u201ca more severe sanction may be justified.\u201d Because there was no evidence as to whether Goldberg practiced in the District during the period of his Maryland suspension, the court remanded the matter to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The D.C. Court of Appeals has followed <em>Goldberg </em>in a number of succeeding cases. <em>See, </em>for example, <em>In re Slosberg, </em>650 A.2d 1329 (D.C.1994); <em>In re Klein, </em>723 A.2d 864 (D.C. 1999); <em>In re Soininen, </em>853 A.2d 712 (D.C.2004); <em>In re Hines, </em>867 A.2d 963 (D.C.2005); <em>In re O\u2019Toole, </em>877 A.2d 151 (D.C. 2005). The same approach, of determining whether the facts of the particular case warrant making the reciprocal suspension concurrent, either by making it of equivalent length but retroactive or by terminating it upon termination of the suspension in the other State, has been taken in Kentucky, Ohio, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Nevada, New York, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">We believe that this is a reasonable approach, one that is fully consistent with the notion and function of reciprocal and corresponding discipline. If an attorney who is suspended in another State promptly notifies Maryland Bar Counsel of that suspension, as required by Maryland Rule 16-773(a), and promptly ceases the practice of law in Maryland during the period of that suspension, any corresponding, reciprocal period of suspension ordered by us, <em>ordinarily, </em>should be concurrent with that imposed in the other State, whether through the device of retroactive commencement of the reciprocal discipline or by terminating our suspension upon termination of the suspension to which it is reciprocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">As the D.C. Court of Appeals made clear in <em>Goldberg, </em>however, concurrence is not a matter of right but of our own discretion and practice, to be used when the circumstances warrant. When appropriate, it serves multiple purposes. It encourages attorneys suspended in other States to notify Bar Counsel promptly. It gives them the option of possibly reducing the period of suspension in Maryland by voluntarily ceasing practice here during the period of the foreign suspension, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>and thus (1) makes the sanction here more contemporaneous with the misconduct on which it is based, and (2) provides more immediate protection to the Maryland public, which is the main function of the reciprocal discipline in the first place. If the attorney delays in notifying Bar Counsel of the out-of-State suspension, or declines to cease any practice of law in Maryland, or there is any other circumstance making a concurrent suspension inappropriate, that benefit will be unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">In this case, we find no basis under Maryland Rule 16-773(e) for not imposing an eighteen month suspension based on the findings and conclusions of the D.C. Court of Appeals. Indeed, but for Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation, we may well have considered a more severe sanction. It is not clear from the record now before us when Midlen notified Bar Counsel of the D.C. suspension or whether he continued to practice law in Maryland after commencement of that suspension on December 10, 2005. We therefore have no evidentiary basis at this point for making our suspension concurrent with that imposed in the District. Accordingly, the suspension shall commence upon the issuance of this opinion and run for its full term of eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST JOHN H.
