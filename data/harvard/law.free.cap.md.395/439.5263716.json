Standard Fire filed a petition for writ of certiorari seeking review of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s judgment reversing the Circuit Court for Baltimore City\u2019s entry of summary judgment for Standard Fire and raised the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">1. When a person holds an unrecorded deed, pursuant to which grantor conveys to him a vested remainder and retains a life estate, does the court-ordered sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>property in fee simple, in an action to which the grantee is a party, extinguish the grantee\u2019s interest in the property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">2. Under the scenario described above, do the grantee\u2019s representations to the court that grantor owns the property, coupled with his failure to raise an interest in the property, estop him from claiming such an interest by virtue of the unrecorded deed or improvements to the property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">3. If a person fails to protect his economic interest in a property, does he retain an insurable interest in that property?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-7\"><em>Standard Fire Ins. v. Berrett, </em>393 Md. 160, 900 A.2d 206 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">We shall hold that Mr. Berrett continued to possess an economic interest in the property even after the court\u2019s approval of the contract of sale of the property, and that he was not estopped from claiming an insurable interest therein by his representations that his mother was the owner of the property during guardianship proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">In December, 1995, Robert Berrett relocated from California, where he had been living for some twenty years, to his home state of Maryland and began residing at 4305 Gallatin Street, his family\u2019s home. In February, 1999, after having made numerous improvements to the home, he learned that it was not insured, which precipitated his application for insurance with Standard Fire. Mr. Berrett timely paid all of the premiums on the policy and, when it expired in February, 2000, renewed for another year.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">In March, 2000, Mr. Berrett filed a verified petition, through counsel, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, to be appointed guardian over the person and proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ty of his mother, Charlotte Berrett. He alleged that he was her primary care taker and that she was no longer able to handle her financial, business, legal, and personal matters. He also alleged that his mother \u201cowns two parcels of real estate commonly known as 4305 Gallatin Street, Hyattsville, Maryland 20783 and 2303 Fordham Street, Hyattsville, Maryland 20783,\u201d and listed himself and his four siblings as interested parties to the proceedings. Mr. Berrett filed a verified amended petition in May, 2000, in which he again alleged that his mother owned 4305 Gallatin Street, and a verified emergency petition in June, iterating that she owned 4305 Gallatin Street. After a hearing on Mr. Berrett\u2019s petition, a judge of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County appointed Richard C. Daniels, an attorney, as the guardian of Charlotte Berrett\u2019s property, and Theresa Grant of the Prince George\u2019s Office of Aging, as guardian of her person. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Daniels petitioned the court for approval of a contract of sale for $89,000.00 for 4305 Gallatin Street, to which Mr. Berrett filed an opposition, alleging that the purchase amount was below market value, that the sale was not necessary to sustain his mother\u2019s care because he was supplementing her payments to the nursing home, and that his mother intended to reside at 4305 Gallatin Street in the future. The court overruled Mr. Berrett\u2019s opposition and on November 9, 2000, approved the contract. On November 25, 2000, fire destroyed the home before settlement and thereafter the purchaser exercised his right to rescind, pursuant to the contract\u2019s risk of loss clause, and the home was razed and the property subsequently sold to the same purchaser for a reduced price of $40,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In the interim, Mr. Berrett filed a claim for $388,000.00 with Standard Fire to recover for the loss of the home. Standard Fire denied the claim, alleging that the court-approved sale of 4305 Gallatin Street extinguished Mr. Berrett\u2019s interest in the property so that he did not possess an insurable interest at the time of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>In his complaint against Standard Fire,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. Berrett alleged that he had an insurable interest in 4305 Gallatin Street because his mother, in an unrecorded deed, had conveyed a remainder interest to him in the property,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> while retaining for herself a life estate, and also because Mr. Berrett had resided in and made extensive improvements to the home between 1995 and 2000. He alleged that he never recorded the deed because, by the deed\u2019s terms, it was not to be recorded until his mother\u2019s death. He further alleged that he did not disclose the existence of the unrecorded deed during the guardianship proceedings because he was under the impres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>sion that his mother\u2019s life tenancy enabled her to dispose of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">In response to Mr. Berrett\u2019s complaint, Standard Fire filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging that the judicial approval of the sale of 4305 Gallatin Street on November 9, sixteen days before the fire, had extinguished Berrett\u2019s insurable interest in the property. Standard Fire also argued that, because Mr. Berrett alleged in his verified petitions for his mother\u2019s guardianship that his mother was the owner of 4305 Gallatin Street, that he now was precluded under both the doctrines of collateral estoppel and estoppel by admission from asserting his claim in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Mr. Berrett responded by alleging that, as a remainderman in the property, he could not be divested of his interest until the property was sold and, at the time of the fire, the sale had not been completed. He further contended that he was not collaterally estopped from asserting his insurable interest because the issue during the guardianship proceedings was whether Charlotte Berrett was disabled, whereas, in the Standard Fire proceedings, the issue was whether Mr. Berrett possessed an insurable interest in the property. Moreover, Mr. Berrett maintained that his allegation that his mother was the owner of the property in the guardianship proceedings was not inconsistent with his statement of ownership during proceedings on the insurance claim because both possessed ownership interests in the property; his mother\u2019s of a life estate interest, and his of a remainder interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">After the hearing on Standard Fire\u2019s summary judgment motion, at which both parties were represented by counsel and presented oral arguments, the trial court granted summary judgment to Standard Fire, concluding that Mr. Berrett was both collaterally and judicially estopped from asserting an insurable interest in the property. Mr. Berrett noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which determined in a reported opinion that, by virtue of the unrecorded deed, Charlotte Berrett had, after retaining a life estate for herself, granted Mr. Berrett a vested, indefeasible remainder in 4305 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Gallatin Street, which was deemed to be an insurable interest. <em>Berrett v. Standard Fire Ins. Co., </em>166 Md.App. 321, 338, 888 A.2d 1189, 1196, 1199 (2005). The intermediate appellate court held that the court\u2019s approval of the sale of the property did not negate Mr. Berrett\u2019s economic interest in the property because, even if the sale of the property had been completed at the time of the fire, Mr. Berrett would have had a chose in action against the guardianship estate for his share in the sale proceeds as a remainderman. Thus, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that Mr. Berrett did possess an economic, and therefore an insurable, interest in the property at the time of the fire. The court also determined that the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not apply to Mr. Berrett\u2019s action to recover from Standard Fire because the guardianship proceedings did not address the nature of Mr. Berrett\u2019s interest in 4305 Gallatin Street and that the doctrine of judicial estoppel did not apply because Mr. Berrett never took a position regarding his own interest in the property during the guardianship proceedings which were inconsistent with his assertions in the insurance claim proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Before this Court, Standard Fire contends that, under Section 12-301(a) of the Insurance Article, Maryland Code (1997), an economic interest in property must be present in order to constitute an insurable interest therein. Standard Fire asserts that, when the contract of sale of the property was approved by the circuit court on November 9, 2000, Mr. Berrett\u2019s economic, and therefore insurable, interest in the property was extinguished because only Charlotte Berrett would benefit from the proceeds of the sale. Standard Fire also alleges that the court in the guardianship proceeding made a final determination that Charlotte Berrett was the owner of 4305 Gallatin Street, and that Mr. Berrett was a party in those proceedings. The Company maintains, as a result, that Mr. Berrett was required to assert his ownership interest during the guardianship proceedings and is now barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel from claiming an ownership interest in the property. Standard Fire also claims that Mr. Berrett is precluded under the doctrine of judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>estoppel from alleging that he was the owner of the property because he stated in all of his verified petitions for guardianship that his mother was the owner of 4305 Gallatin Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Conversely, Mr. Berrett claims that, as owner of a vested, indefeasible remainder in 4305 Gallatin Street, he possessed an insurable interest in the property of which he was not divested by the court\u2019s approval of the contract of sale. Mr. Berrett maintains that whether a party possesses an insurable interest in a property is determined at the time of the loss, and that, at the time of the loss in this case, the sale of 4305 Gallatin Street had not been completed and thus, his insurable interest was not extinguished. Mr. Berrett also claims that, even if the sale had been completed at the time of the fire, his remainder interest would not have been entirely lost, but instead, translated into a right to the proceeds, which constitutes a chose in action and thereby an insurable interest. Mr. Berrett further alleges that any claim of nonmutual collateral estoppel fails because the issue of his insurable interest in the property was not fully litigated during the guardianship proceedings. Mr. Berrett also contends that judicial estoppel does not apply in this case because the doctrine requires that he have taken an inconsistent position in the guardianship proceedings in order to gain an unfair advantage in those proceedings, which he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The entry of summary judgment is governed by Maryland Rule 2-501, which provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A16\">(f) Entry of judgment. The court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The question of whether the trial court properly granted summary judgment is a question of law and is subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal. <em>Miller v. Bay City Property Owners Ass\u2019n Inc., </em>393 Md. 620, 632, 903 A.2d 938, 945 (2006), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>Myers v. Kayhoe, </em>391 Md. 188, 203, 892 A.2d 520, 529 (2006); <em>Ross v. State Bd. of Elections, </em>387 Md. 649, 658, 876 A.2d 692, 697 (2005); <em>Todd v. MTA, </em>373 Md. 149, 154, 816 A.2d 930, 933 (2003); <em>Beyer v. Morgan State Univ., </em>369 Md. 335, 359, 800 A.2d 707, 721 (2002). If no material facts are in dispute, we must determine whether summary judgment was correctly entered as a matter of law. <em>Ross, </em>387 Md. at 659, 876 A.2d at 698; <em>Todd, </em>373 Md. at 155, 816 A.2d at 933; <em>Beyer, </em>369 Md. at 360, 800 A.2d at 721. On appeal from an order entering summary judgment, we review \u201conly the grounds upon which the trial court relied in granting summary judgment\u201d. <em>Ross, </em>387 Md. at 659, 876 A.2d at 698, quoting <em>Eid v. Duke, </em>373 Md. 2, 10, 816 A.2d 844, 849 (2003), quoting in turn <em>Lovelace v. Anderson, </em>366 Md. 690, 695, 785 A.2d 726, 729 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">There are two issues in this case: the first, whether the judicial approval of the contract of sale of 4305 Gallatin Street divested Mr. Berrett of his insurable interest in the property at the time of the fire, and the second, whether Mr. Berrett is estopped from asserting that interest by his actions during the guardianship proceedings for mother, Charlotte Berrett. We conclude that Mr. Berrett possessed an insurable interest in the property at the time of the fire and that he was not estopped from asserting that interest because of what he said and did during his mother\u2019s guardianship proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">A. Effect of the Court\u2019s Approval of the Contract of Sale on Mr. Berrett\u2019s Insurable Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Standard Fire alleges that, because the circuit court had approved the sale of 4305 Gallatin Street on November 9, 2000, Mr. Berrett no longer possessed an economic interest in the property on November 25 when the home was destroyed by fire. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\u201cInsurable interest\u201d is defined in Section 12-301 of the Insurance Article, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">an actual, lawful, and substantial economic interest in the safety or preservation of the subject of the insurance against loss, destruction, or pecuniary damage or impairment to the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Maryland Code (1997), Section 12-301(a) of the Insurance Article. Whether an individual holds an insurable interest is defined statutorily at the time of the loss, rather than at the time of the contract. Maryland Code (1997), Section 12-301(b) of the Insurance Article. Mr. Berrett contends that he owned an indefeasible, vested remainder, which constitutes an insurable interest at the time of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">A vested, indefeasible remainder is <em>\u201ca </em>present, fixed right to future enjoyment, and is an estate which the owner can convey or devise or which descends in ease of intestacy to his heirs.\u201d <em>Myers v. Myers, </em>185 Md. 210, 221, 44 A.2d 455, 460 (1945). A remainder interest is \u201cany future interest limited in favor of a transferee in such manner that it can become a present interest upon the expiration of all prior interests simultaneously created, and cannot divest any interest except an interest left in the transferor.\u201d 2 Restatement of Property \u00a7 156, at 535 (1936). The term \u201cvested\u201d connotes that the assumption of the estate by the remainderman is not contingent upon any prerequisites, but rather the remainder-man stands \u201cready to take [the property] immediately on the termination of prior ... estates.\u201d <em>In re Trust of Lane, </em>323 Md. 188, 195 n. 4, 592 A.2d 492, 496 n. 4 (1991), quoting 1 <em>American Law of Property </em>\u00a7 4.2, at 408 (A. James Casner ed. 1952). \u201cIndefeasible\u201d means that the person granted the future interest cannot be divested of that interest. <em>In re Trust of Lane, </em>323 Md. at 197, 592 A.2d at 497 (holding that remainder interest was defeasible because the interest \u201cmay be defeated by a subsequent occurrence before the termination of the precedent estate\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>We explored the insurable interests of remaindermen and life tenants in <em>Forbes v. American International Insurance Co., </em>260 Md. 181, 271 A.2d 684 (1970), when faced with the question of whether a succeeding life tenant was entitled to the proceeds of a fire insurance policy procured by the preceding life tenant. In explicating the general rule, we explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">[T]he dictum found in <em>Legge v. Canty </em>shows rather clearly that this Court some years ago manifested a disposition to follow the general rule were the issue to be presented to it. In that case Judge Offutt, writing for the Court, stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">Ordinarily, in the case of a life tenancy the life tenant would insure his interest, and the remaindermen would insure their interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 186, 271 A.2d at 686 (citations omitted), quoting <em>Legge v. Canty, </em>176 Md. 283, 289, 4 A.2d 465, 468 (1939). By so stating, we adopted the majority view that, absent a contract or fiduciary duty, neither the life tenant, nor the remainder-man, is obligated to insure the other\u2019s interest, but rather, both must individually insure his or her own interest. <em>Forbes, </em>260 Md. at 184-85, 271 A.2d at 685, quoting <em>Thompson v. Gearheart, </em>137 Va. 427, 119 S.E. 67, 68 (1923). Therefore, a remainderman does have an insurable interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Did, however, the court\u2019s approval of the contract of sale of the property in this case divest Mr. Berrett of his insurable interest as a remainderman? It is well settled in Maryland that a contract of sale of real property vests equitable title to the property in the purchaser, while the seller retains legal title. We addressed this distinction in <em>Himmighoefer v. Medallion Industries, Inc., </em>302 Md. 270, 487 A.2d 282 (1985), in which a construction vendor attempted to obtain a mechanic\u2019s lien against a property after the owner had entered into a contract for its sale. Holding that the creditor could not obtain a hen on the property, we explained that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aug\">effect of such a contract is to vest the equitable ownership of the property in the vendee, subject to the vendor\u2019s lien for unpaid purchase money, and to leave only the legal title in the vendor pending the fulfilment of the contract and the formal conveyance of the estate. The right of the vendee to have the title conveyed upon full compliance with the contract of purchase is not impaired by the fact that the vendor, subsequently to the execution of the contract, incurred a debt upon which judgment was recovered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 279, 487 A.2d at 287, quoting <em>Kinsey v. Drury, </em>146 Md. 227, 232, 126 A. 125, 127 (1924). <em>See also Knight v. Princess Builders, Inc., </em>393 Md. 31, 49, 899 A.2d 156, 167 (2006); <em>DeShields v. Broadwater, </em>338 Md. 422, 438, 659 A.2d 300, 307 (1995); <em>Watson v. Watson, </em>304 Md. 48, 60, 497 A.2d 794, 800 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In <em>Kingsley v. Makay, </em>253 Md. 24, 251 A.2d 585 (1969), we addressed whether a judgment entered against a purchaser of real property established a lien on the property where the judgment was obtained after the purchaser entered into the contract of sale, and after he had assigned his interest in the property to another party. In holding that the judgment did not establish a lien on the property, we explained that the assignment of the purchaser\u2019s equitable interest in the property was valid, despite never being recorded, because there was no requirement that a contract of sale be recorded. <em>Id. </em>at 28, 251 A.2d at 587. The contract of sale, vesting equitable title in the purchaser, as we explained, is distinguishable, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>from the completion of the sale in that \u201clegal title to land, of course, does not pass, other than by operation of law, until a deed is properly executed and recorded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 251 A.2d at 587. <em>See also </em>Maryland Code (1974, Repl. Vol. 1996), Section 3-101 (a) of the Real Property Article; <em>Childs v. Ragonese, </em>296 Md. 130, 139 n. 8, 460 A.2d 1031, 1036 n. 8 (1983) (acknowledging that in Maryland, legal title does not pass until the deed is executed and recorded). In the present case, settlement had not occurred, so that a deed to the property in the judicially-approved purchaser\u2019s name had not been executed, nor recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">We have acknowledged that an insurer remains responsible to indemnify the insured seller on losses incurred after the contract is entered into, but before the sale of the property is completed. In <em>Washington Fire Insurance Co. v. Kelly, </em>32 Md. 421 (1870), two insurers denied claims made after fire had destroyed the insured\u2019s property, contending, among other things, that the insurance contracts were rendered null and void by the insured\u2019s contract to sell the property entered into before the time of the fire. We agreed with the insurers in that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">[t]here is no doubt that an insurance against fire without an interest in the subject-matter insured is a <em>wagering </em>contract, which the law does not sanction; and it is, therefore, necessary that the insured should have an interest in the property insured, not only at the time of the insurance, but when the loss by fire occurs. If the insured sell the property, and transfer all his interest therein, or assign all interest in the policy, before the loss happens, he cannot recover....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 435-36 (emphasis in original). We determined, however, that to \u201cprevent the recovery for any loss by fire, the sale or conveyance must be made out full and complete.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436. To constitute a complete sale \u201cthe right to the property sold and to the possession thereof, must pass from the vendor to the vendee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436. A \u201cmere contract for the sale or conveyance,\u201d however, will not divest \u201cthe title of the vendor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>and vesting the same in the vendee,\u201d and therefore does not constitute a complete sale. <em>Id. </em>We held that the sale of the property was not completed at the time of the loss, and therefore \u201cthe insured as the vendors of the property, before the actual conveyance thereof, held an insurable interest therein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437. Thus, a contract of sale of real property, taken alone, before settlement, will not negate the insured\u2019s ability to recover from a loss by fire.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">B. Defensive Non-mutual Collateral Estoppel and Judicial Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">1. Defensive Non-mutual Collateral Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Standard Fire claims that Mr. Berrett is barred under the doctrine of collateral estoppel from asserting his ownership interest in 4305 Gallatin Street because the issue of ownership was addressed in his mother\u2019s guardianship proceeding, to which he was a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The traditional doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, simply means \u201cin a second suit <em>between the same parties, </em>even if the cause of action is different, any determination of fact that was actually litigated and was essential to a valid and final judgment is conclusive.\u201d <em>Rourke v.

Its purpose is \u201cto avoid the expense and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and foster reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibilities of inconsistent decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 761 A.2d at 907, quoting <em>Janes, </em>350 Md. at 295, 711 A.2d at 1324. Or, stated differently, collateral estoppel is \u201cbased upon the judicial policy that the losing litigant deserves no rematch after a defeat fairly suffered, in adversarial proceedings, on issues raised....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391, 761 A.2d at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In its traditional form, collateral estoppel requires mutuality of parties, so that the doctrine would only apply when the same two parties in a previous law suit are involved in another law suit. <em>Rourke, </em>384 Md. at 340-41, 863 A.2d at 933. This traditional notion of mutuality of parties is not always required, however, if one of the parties in the original case is involved in relitigating one of the issues determined against a different party in a successive suit. We explored this modification of collateral estopped in <em>Rourke v. Amchem Products, Inc., supra, </em>explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">If the plaintiff in the second case seeks to foreclose the defendant from relitigating an issue that the defendant previously litigated unsuccessfully <em>against other plaintiffs, </em>the doctrine invoked is <em>offensive </em>non-mutual collateral estoppel; if the defendant seeks to preclude the plaintiff from relitigating an issue that the plaintiff previously litigated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>unsuccessfully <em>against other defendants, </em>the doctrine is referred to as <em>defensive </em>non-mutual collateral estoppel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 341, 863 A.2d at 933 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In the case before us, Mr. Berrett was involved in the guardianship proceedings as the petitioner, but Standard Fire was not, so that the doctrine being invoked by Standard Fire is that of defensive, non-mutual collateral estoppel. We have approved a four-part test for determining whether the doctrine of defensive, non-mutual collateral estoppel applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">1. Was the issue decided in the prior adjudication identical with the one presented in the action in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">2. Was there a final judgment on the merits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">3. Was the party against whom the plea is asserted a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">4.

The gravamen of this test is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adb\">that the party to be bound must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues in question. When an issue was not <em>required to be litigated </em>and was <em>not in fact litigated, </em>the judgment ordinarily will not preclude its subsequent litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-11\"><em>Gerber, </em>315 Md. at 518, 555 A.2d at 490 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">We originally espoused the doctrine of defensive, non-mutual estoppel in <em>Pat Perusse Realty Co. v. Lingo, </em>249 Md. 33, 238 A.2d 100 (1968), in which a real estate broker, Perusse, entered into a contract to sell the home of the Longs, who were divorcing. When Perusse located a buyer, Mrs. Long refused to consummate the sale, and Perusse sued the Longs for the commissions he alleged were owed to him. Mrs. Long had since moved out of state, however, and could not be served with process so that Perusse only proceeded against Mr. Long. The Court determined that Perusse had failed to provide evidence of a ready, willing and able purchaser and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>dismissed the action against Mr. Long; Perusse subsequently sued Mrs. Long. Adopting the doctrine of defensive, non-mutual estoppel, we held that Perusse was estopped from suing Mrs. Long because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">Perusse, in its suit against [Mr. Long], had its full day in court and full opportunity to win on its claim that it procured a buyer ready, willing and able to buy at the seller\u2019s price. Its claim was decided against it. There can be no doubt that it sought to relitigate that precisely identical issue in the attachment against [Mrs. Long], Public policy against repetitive identical litigation, which underlies the rule of res judicata, applies here with logic and force to provide that Perusse\u2019s rights were satisfied by having had its day in court on an issue, and that it is not entitled to another day in court against a particular defendant on that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 45, 238 A.2d at 107-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Further, in <em>Welsh v. Gerber Products, Inc., supra, </em>the Welsh\u2019s son was injured when his car seat failed to restrain him during an accident. The Welshes sued both the driver of the other vehicle involved in the accident and Gerber, the car seat manufacturer, and subsequently settled with the other driver for his insurance policy limits. Gerber invoked the doctrine of defensive, non-mutual collateral estoppel, arguing that the Welshes were precluded from relitigating the issue of the amount of their damages because they had accepted the policy limit of the negligent party\u2019s insurance. In answering the certified question of law from the federal district court as to whether a consent judgment would preclude the Welsh\u2019s action against Gerber for damages, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">As a factual matter, a consent judgment may, or may not, involve a determination of the amount that represents the complete equivalent of the plaintiffs damages. Where, as apparently is the case here, the parties make no attempt to agree upon or litigate the fair value of the claim, but agree instead to accept the available insurance coverage while specifically reserving the right of the plaintiff to proceed against others for full compensation, a consent judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>entered to give effect to the agreement does not in fact represent the result of litigation of the issue of damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1Y\"><em>Id. </em>at 518-19, 555 A.2d at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">By comparison, in <em>Leeds Federal Savings and Loan Ass\u2019n v. Metcalf, supra, </em>we held that the doctrine of defensive, non-mutual collateral estoppel did apply. In that case, the Metcalfs brought simultaneous actions against Leeds Federal Savings and Loan Association and Ms. Buppert, alleging that the passport savings accounts held jointly by the Metcalfs and Ms. Lanahan was closed by Ms. Buppert without Ms. Lanahan\u2019s authority. In the action against Ms. Buppert, the Circuit Court for Carroll County found that she had acted under the authority of Ms. Lanahan and granted summary judgment for Ms. Buppert. In the action against Leeds in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the bank invoked the doctrine of defensive, non-mutual collateral estoppel. In applying estoppel, we concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">In the instant case the issue sought to be relitigated by the Metcalfs ... was essential to the decision of the Circuit Court for Carroll County, and it was resolved adversely to the Metcalfs. That issue also was central in the instant case.... The judgment of the Circuit Court for Carroll County was final; the Metcalfs were parties to that adjudication; and the Metcalfs were given a fair opportunity to be heard on the issue in the Carroll County case. Consequently, we hold that the Metcalfs were precluded from relitigating the issue in the instant case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 120, 630 A.2d at 251. <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Alison, </em>349 Md. 623, 634, 709 A.2d 1212, 1217 (1998) (holding that the doctrine of defensive, non-mutual collateral estoppel did not apply because the issue litigated in the first law suit was not identical to the issue litigated in the subsequent law suit).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">In this case, Standard Fire alleges that during the guardianship proceedings, the judge determined the ownership of 4305 Gallatin Street. We disagree. At the time of the fire, the court had not made a final determination as to the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Charlotte Berrett\u2019s property interest in 4305 Gallatin Street; it had merely determined whether she was disabled and whether she was or could have been entitled to property or benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Guardianship of property petitions are governed by the Maryland Rules of Civil Procedure and must contain verified statements concerning, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">(8) To the extent known or reasonably ascertainable, the name, address, telephone number, and nature of interest of all interested persons and all others exercising any control over the property of the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">(10) The nature, value, and location of the property of the minor or alleged disabled person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">(11) A brief description of all other property in which the minor or alleged disabled person has a concurrent interest with one or more individuals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Maryland Rule 10-301 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Once the verified petition is filed, the court may appoint a guardian of the property if the judge determines that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">(1) The person is unable to manage his property and affairs effectively because of physical or mental disability, disease, habitual drunkenness, addiction to drugs, imprisonment, compulsory hospitalization, confinement, detention by a foreign power, or disappearance; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">(2) The person <em>has or may be entitled to </em>property or benefits which require proper management.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">Maryland Code (1974, Repl. Vol. 1991), Section 13-201(c) of the Estates and Trusts Article (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">In the present case, by November 9, 2000, when the court approved the contract of sale, but before the fire, the judge had not made any final determination as to the nature of Charlotte Berrett\u2019s interest in 4305 Gallatin Street, but only that whatever interest she owned could be sold for $89,000.00. Nor did the judge make any determination as to Mr. Berrett\u2019s remainder interest. Thus, the issue in the guardianship pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>ceeding was not identical to the issue before the court in the insurance claim proceeding, nor was there a final judgment on the merits as to the issue of Mr. Berrett\u2019s ownership interest.</p>\n<p id=\"A0_\">C. Judicial Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Standard Fire also claims that Mr. Berrett was es-topped by the doctrine of judicial estoppel from asserting his ownership rights in 4305 Gallatin Street because he alleged in his verified guardianship petitions that his mother was the owner of the property. The doctrine of judicial estoppel, or estoppel by admission, has been elucidated in a historical context by Judge Alan Wilner, writing for this Court in <em>Eagan v. Calhoun, </em>347 Md. 72, 698 A.2d 1097 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">Maryland has long recognized the doctrine of estoppel by admission, derived from the rule laid down by the English Court of Exchequer in <em>Cave v. Mills, </em>that \u2018a man shall not be allowed to blow hot and cold, to claim at one time and deny at another.\u2019 In <em>Stone v. Stone[, </em>230 Md. 248, 186 A.2d 590 (1962)] and <em>Wilson Brothers v. Cooey[, </em>251 Md. 350, 247 A.2d 395 (1968)], we adopted the statement of that principle....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\u2018Generally speaking, a party will not be permitted to maintain inconsistent positions or to take a position in regard to a matter which is directly contrary to, or inconsistent with, one previously assumed by him, at least where he had, or was chargeable with, full knowledge of the facts, and another will be prejudiced by his action.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 87-88, 698 A.2d at 1105 (citations omitted). <em>See also Underwood-Gary v. Mathews, </em>366 Md. 660, 667 n. 6, 785 A.2d 708, 712 n. 6 (2001) (defining judicial estoppel as \u201ca principle that precludes a party from taking a position in a subsequent action inconsistent with a position taken by him or her in a previous action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">In <em>Kramer v. Globe Brewing Co., </em>175 Md. 461, 2 A.2d 634 (1938), the doctrine of judicial estoppel was invoked against Globe Brewing Company by Kramer, an individual who was injured while assisting an employee of Globe Brewing. Globe Brewing, in an answer to a complaint in tort, alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>workmen\u2019s compensation was Kramer\u2019s exclusive remedy, which prompted Kramer to obtain a voluntary dismissal without prejudice of his tort action and to file a worker\u2019s compensation action. In the worker\u2019s compensation action, however, Globe Brewing proffered testimony that Kramer was <em>not </em>its employee at the time of the accident, to which Kramer objected on the grounds that Globe Brewing was estopped by its prior allegations of exclusivity of worker\u2019s compensation remedies. We concluded \u201cthat under some circumstances admissions in pleadings may be explained,\u201d while \u201cunder other circumstances, in the interest of sound public policy, regardless of their truth or falsity, such admissions estop the pleader from denying their force and effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 2 A.2d at 637. We applied judicial estoppel to preclude Globe Brewing from asserting that Kramer was not its employee because Kramer was caused to \u201cchange his position to his own detriment, and to the ultimate advantage of [Globe Brewing]\u201d by Globe Brewing\u2019s previous allegation of worker\u2019s compensation exclusivity. <em>Id. </em>We further noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">[t]here is no indication in the record before us that [Globe Brewing\u2019s] special plea was hastily filed by the attorneys who represented [Globe Brewing] in the common law action, and, to the contrary, the reasonable inference is that it was filed deliberately and with the full knowledge of its plain meaning and effect on the part of the duly accredited officials of [Globe Brewing].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 472, 2 A.2d at 638, and concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKO\">it would, in our opinion, be an injustice to [Kramer], in the present suit, to permit [Globe Brewing], after having availed itself of an affirmative defense in the prior suit, to appear in a subsequent proceeding involving the same matter of controversy between the same parties, and deny the facts asserted by it, or on its behalf, in the special plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 471, 2 A.2d at 638. <em>See also Underwood-Gary, </em>366 Md. at 667 n. 6, 785 A.2d at 712 n. 6; <em>WinMark Ltd.

Atlantic Realty Co., </em>359 Md. 513, 754 A.2d 1030 (2000), we explicated the prerequisites for the application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel to be applicable in a given case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">(1) [T]he assertion of a factual \u2018position inconsistent with that taken in prior litigation;\u2019 (2) that the \u2018prior inconsistent position must have been accepted by the court; and\u2019 (3) that \u2018the party sought to be estopped must intentionally have misled the court to gain unfair advantage.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 529 n. 9, 754 A.2d at 1038-39 n. 9 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In this case, Mr. Berrett alleged in his verified petitions for a guardian of the person and property of Charlotte Berrett that Charlotte Berrett possessed an ownership interest in 4305 Gallatin Street and that he and his four siblings were interested persons in those proceedings. Those allegations are not inconsistent with his assertion in his law suit against Standard Fire that he possessed an economic interest in 4305 Gallatin Street, and thereby an insurable interest, at the time of the fire because both could exist concurrently. Also, his earlier assertion of his mother\u2019s ownership interest was not to his advantage in the guardianship proceedings; he did not gain an unfair advantage by his averments.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">We therefore conclude that, because the sale of 4305 Gallatin Street was not complete at the time of the fire, Mr. Berrett owned an economic interest, and therefore an insurable interest, in the property at the time of the loss. Mr. Berrett also did not litigate the nature of his interest during the guardianship proceedings for his mother, Charlotte Berrett, and therefore the doctrine of defensive, non-mutual estoppel does not apply. Finally, Mr. Berrett is not judicially estopped by his representations to the court in his verified petitions for a guardian of Charlotte Berrett. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY THE PETITIONER.</p>\n<judges id=\"b493-4\">RAKER, J., Dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-12\">.

Maryland Rule 10-301 addresses the petition for a guardian over the property of alleged disabled persons and minors. Section 301(c)(8) and (10) of Rule 10-301 require that the petition contain information as to the nature, value, and location of the property of the alleged disabled person, and to the extent known or reasonably ascertainable, the name, address, telephone number, and nature of the interest of all interested persons and all others exercising any control over the property of the estate. Respondent drafted the deed related to the property at issue, and he knew of its existence during these proceedings. The guardianship judge, Judge G.R.

Respondent never listed in the petition any purported interest he may have held in the property. The majority misreads the petition when it states that \u201cMr. Berrett alleged in his verified petition ... that Charlotte Berrett possessed an ownership interest in 4305 Gallatin Street.\u201d Maj. op. at 464, 910 A.2d at 1087. Respondent did not merely suggest \u201can ownership interest.\u201d Respondent averred that \u201c[Charlotte] Berrett <em>owns </em>two parcels of real estate ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In the present matter, the Circuit Court, Judge Joseph H.H. Kaplan, granted summary judgment in favor of petitioner. He stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">\u201cAs I indicated, counsel, I reviewed the file before today\u2019s proceeding and it seems to the Court and I so find that [Standard Fire] is entitled to have their motion for summary judgment granted for the reasons stated in their memorandum in support of the motion that Mr. Berrett is collaterally estopped from claiming an interest in the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>erty. In his testimony before Hovey Johnson in Prince George\u2019s County, he fully acknowledges several times throughout the proceedings, the guardianship proceedings, etc., that his mother was the owner of the property. There is nothing that says he\u2019s the owner or has any interest in the property other than an unrecorded deed which didn\u2019t give him a remainder interest, it gave him a fee simple interest. He\u2019s not claiming that he has a fee simple, had a fee simple interest in the property. He\u2019s claiming that he had, his mother had a life estate, there\u2019s no document that sets up a life estate and that he had the remainder interest. So I think that he\u2019s testified under oath too many times that his mother was the owner of the property to now come in and say no, he was the owner of the property and that\u2019s his insurable interest. So I think he\u2019s barred by collateral estoppel and estoppel by admission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Judge Kaplan was correct when he found that respondent\u2019s previous statements estopped him from claiming a proprietary interest in the property in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 basis for excusing respondent\u2019s inconsistent position is not persuasive. The fact that Berrett may not have been represented by counsel should make no difference in the analysis. An unrepresented layperson is held to the same standard as a litigant who is represented by counsel; neither litigant may take an inconsistent position. Moreover, it appears that Berrett <em>was </em>represented by counsel when the guardianship petition was filed and the property owned by his mother was listed in the petition. Finally, Berrett apparently studied law and received a juris doctor degree in 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Judicial estoppel should bar respondent from claiming that he possessed an interest over the property in question.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
