The issue before this Court is whether a conflict exists between the Law Enforcement Officer\u2019s Bill of Rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>(\u201cLEOBR\u201d), Md.Code (2008) \u00a7 3-101 et. seq. of the Public Safety Article, and the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article, when an agency pursues an administrative complaint against one of its employees, and after an administrative hearing at which the tribunal enters a finding of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d the agency seeks judicial review of that decision. The Board, comprised of three police officers from the Commission\u2019s Prince George\u2019s County Park Police Department,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> heard a case brought against fellow officer Kathleen Anderson, who was charged with violating the police department\u2019s vehicle pursuit policy. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board entered a finding of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">On July 25, 2003, the Commission petitioned the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. Officer Anderson filed a Motion to Dismiss, and the Circuit Court granted Officer Anderson\u2019s motion. On March 18, 2003, the Commission petitioned the Court of Special Appeals for judicial review. That court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Anderson, </em>164 Md.App. 540, 545, 884 A.2d 157, 160 (2005).

Anderson, </em>390 Md. 500, 889 A.2d 418 (2006). For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">While on duty on September 8, 2001, Officer Kathleen Anderson conducted a registration check on a vehicle and found that the license plates had been reported stolen. She attempted to pull over the vehicle, but the driver refused to stop. The driver exceeded the 25 mile-per-hour speed limit, crossing back and forth across the center lines of the road. Officer Anderson followed the car, staying within a distance of one-to-two car lengths. During the pursuit, the occupants abandoned the vehicle and fled the area on foot. The vehicle continued moving until it crashed into a fence and a telephone pole, causing it to stop. Officer Anderson then stopped her vehicle. Officer Anderson stated that, while following the vehicle, she did not see any other vehicles on the road and that there was no other vehicle traffic or pedestrians present. Officer Anderson stated that she was still \u201cone or two\u201d car lengths behind the vehicle when it struck the telephone pole and that the entire incident lasted \u201cbetween seven and [ten] minutes\u201d and the length of \u201cmaybe two and a half\u2019 miles. She also stated that she did not ignore any traffic control devices in attempting to get the vehicle to stop, and estimated that her top speed was \u201cbetween 35 and 40 [m.p.h.],\u201d in contrast to the posted speed limit of \u201c25 to 30 [m.p.h.].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The Department conducted an investigation of Officer Anderson\u2019s September 8, 2001, activity and charged her with violating the provisions of the Department\u2019s vehicle pursuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As required by \u00a7 3-107 of the LEOBR,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> an administrative board, comprised of park police officers, conducted a hearing on March 13 and 14, 2003, concerning the charges filed against Officer Anderson. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board issued an oral finding of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d On June 30, 2003, the Board entered its written decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">On July 25, 2003, the Commission petitioned the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. On November 3, 2003, Officer Anderson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>filed a Motion to Dismiss, asserting \u201c[t]hat the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission ... is not a party to this case and therefore lacks standing to appeal,\u201d and \u201c[i]n the alternative, that the Administrative Hearing Board entered a finding of not guilty which terminates this action and [the Commission] has no authority to appeal its own decision.\u201d In its response, the Commission asserted that it \u201cwas a party to the administrative action and therefore ha[d] standing to appeal to this Honorable Court,\u201d and \u201c[t]hat the Administrative Hearing Board\u2019s finding of \u2018not guilty\u2019 terminated the action and constituted a final decision from which the Commission properly appealed to this Honorable Court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Judge Eldridge, writing for this Court in <em>Maryland Aviation Admin. v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005), reiterated the standard of review for administrative agency decisions: \u201c[a] court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow ... it \u2018is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 576-77, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994). <em>See also </em>Md.Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Government Article. This Court, and any other court reviewing administrative decisions, \u201cshall apply the substantial evidence test to the final decisions of an administrative agency, but it must not itself make independent findings of fact or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Balt. Lutheran High Sch. Ass\u2019n v. Employment Sec. Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 662, 490 A.2d 701, 708 (1985). <em>See also Md. Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. B.G. &amp; E., </em>296 Md. 46, 51, 459 A.2d 205, 209 (1983) (stating that \u201ca party can resort to a court only when there is a final order in the administrative proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In the instant case, we must decide whether a Board\u2019s finding of \u201cnot guilty\u201d entitles the Commission to seek judicial review of that decision under the LEOBR or the APA. In addition, we must examine both statutes to determine if the judicial review provisions of the APA conflict with the judicial review provisions of the LEOBR.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The resolution of these issues requires statutory interpretation. Interpretation of a statute is a question of law, and, therefore, we review the decision of the Circuit Court <em>de novo. Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 446, 452, 879 A.2d 1111, 1114 (2005); <em>see also Salamon v. Progressive Classic Ins. Co., </em>379 Md. 301, 307, 841 A.2d 858, 862 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The parties dispute whether, under the LEOBR, the Commission may seek judicial review of the Board\u2019s finding of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d Section 3-108 of the LEOBR, entitled \u201cDisposition of administrative action,\u201d states that \u201c[a] finding of not guilty terminates the action.\u201d Officer Anderson asserts that this provision means that the agency may not seek judicial review of a finding of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d The Commission contends that the provision simply indicates the point at which the administrative action is final and therefore ripe for judicial review. The Commission also argues that an agency is authorized by the APA to seek judicial review, but Officer Anderson maintains that the LEOBR supersedes the APA, and therefore does not allow review under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Statutory Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We turn first to the principles of statutory construction. Our goal when engaging in statutory interpretation is \u201cto ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Mayor of Balt. City, </em>387 Md. 1, 11, 874 A.2d 439, 445 (2005); <em>O\u2019Connor v. Balt. County, </em>382 Md. 102, 113, 854 A.2d 1191, 1198 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">As this Court has explained, \u201c[t]o determine that purpose or policy, we look first to the language of the statute, giving it its natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>State Dept. of Assessments and Taxation v. Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>348 Md. 2, 13, 702 A.2d 690, 696 (1997); <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448, 452 (1994). This step is the point in statutory construction \u201cwith which the search for legislative intent begins, and ordinarily ends.\u201d <em>FOP, Montgomery County Lodge No. 35 v. Mehrling, </em>343 Md. 155, 174, 680 A.2d 1052, 1062 (1996). \u2018When the statutory language is clear, we need not look beyond the statutory language to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 445, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">If the language of the statute is ambiguous, then \u201ccourts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of [the] enactment [under consideration].\u201d <em>Mehrling, </em>343 Md. at 173-74, 680 A.2d at 1062 (quoting <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986)). In construing a statute, \u201cwe seek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">In addition, \u201c \u2018[t]he meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in which it appears.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 133, 669 A.2d 1339, 1341 (1996) (citations omitted). As this Court has stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>[b]ecause it is part of the context, related statutes or a statutory scheme that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal must also be considered. Thus, not only are we required to interpret the statute as a whole, but, if appropriate, in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><em>Gordon Family Partnership v. Gar on Jer, </em>348 Md. 129, 138, 702 A.2d 753, 757 (1997) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Lastly, we have stated that \u201c \u2018[w]here statutes relate to the same subject matter, and are not inconsistent with each other, they should be construed together and harmonized where consistent with their general object and scope.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gwin v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>385 Md. 440, 462, 869 A.2d 822, 834 (2005) (citations omitted); <em>State v. Ghajari, </em>346 Md. 101, 115, 695 A.2d 143, 149 (1997). Therefore, \u201cwhen two statutes appear to apply to the same situation, this Court will attempt to give effect to both statutes to the extent that they are reconcilable.\u201d <em>Ghajari, </em>346 Md. at 115, 695 A.2d at 149 (citations omitted); <em>Mayor of Oakland v. Mayor of Mountain Lake Park, </em>392 Md. 301, 316-17, 896 A.2d 1036, 1045 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The Law Enforcement Officer\u2019s Bill of Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The Maryland General Assembly enacted the LEOBR in 1974 for \u201cthe purpose of providing that all law enforcement officers have certain rights,\u201d 1974 Md. Laws, Chap. 722,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and for \u201cprovid[ing] a law-enforcement officer<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> ... with <em>substantial procedural safeguards </em>during any inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>into his [or her] conduct which could lead to the imposition of a disciplinary sanction.\u201d <em>Miner v. Novotny, </em>304 Md. 164, 173, 498 A.2d 269, 273 (1985) (emphasis added). In <em>Moats v. City of Hagerstown, </em>324 Md. 519, 530, 597 A.2d 972, 977 (1991), we held that \u201c[t]he language, legislative history and comprehensive nature of the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights establishes that the procedures provided by the Act are an officer\u2019s exclusive remedy in matters of departmental discipline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Included within the procedural safeguards of the LEOBR is the right to a hearing before a hearing board, if there is a possibility that the investigation or interrogation of the officer will result in \u201ca recommendation of demotion, dismissal, transfer, loss of pay, reassignment, or similar action that is considered punitive,\u201d as well as the right of the officer to receive notice from the agency of his right to a hearing by the hearing board. Md.Code (2003), \u00a7 3-107 of the Public Safety Article. Some of the other notable procedural protections afforded to officers include \u201cthe right to be informed in writing of the nature of an investigation prior to any interrogation, the right to reasonable limitations on the structure, time, and place of an interrogation, the right to a complete written or transcribed record of any interrogation, the right to be notified of the name of any witness and all charges and specifications against the officer not less than ten days prior to any hearing, and the right to a copy of the investigatory file and any exculpatory information.\u201d <em>Mohan v. Norris, </em>386 Md. 63, 67-68, 871 A.2d 575, 577-78 (2005); Md.Code (2003), \u00a7 3-104 of the Public Safety Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\n<em>The LEOBR and the Instant Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We next turn our attention to the applicable provisions of the LEOBR to determine whether the Legislature, when it enacted the LEOBR in 1974, intended to provide agencies with the right to judicial review of the \u201cnot guilty\u201d determinations of administrative hearing boards. To determine the intent of the Legislature, we begin with the plain language of the statute. <em>State Dept. of Assessments &amp; Taxation v. Mary</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>land-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>348 Md. 2, 12, 702 A.2d 690, 695 (1997). Because \u00a7 3-109(a) of the LEOBR is entitled \u201cJudicial review,\u201d we begin our analysis with that provision to determine which decisions the General Assembly contemplated would be entitled to judicial review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Section 3-109(a) provides that \u201c[a]n appeal from a decision made under \u00a7 3-108 [titled \u201cDisposition of administrative action\u201d] of this subtitle shall be taken to the circuit court for the county in accordance with Maryland Rule 7-202.\u201d Maryland Rule 7-202(a), provides that \u201c[a] person seeking judicial review under this chapter shall file a petition for judicial review in a circuit court authorized to provide the review.\u201d The \u201cGeneral Provisions\u201d set forth for the chapter<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> allow for judicial review only where it is \u201cauthorized by statute.\u201d Thus, it appears that an administrative agency may seek judicial review, under \u00a7 3-109 of the LEOBR, only in circumstances where it is expressly authorized by statute to do so. As a result, we examine the other provisions of the LEOBR to determine those circumstances in which the General Assembly expressly authorized judicial review of agency decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The Commission contends that it is entitled to judicial review of \u201cnot guilty\u201d findings pursuant to \u00a7 3-108 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>LEOBR,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> because a right to such review can be inferred from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>that provision. Officer Anderson counters that the Legislature did not expressly include in the LEOBR the agency\u2019s right to judicial review of a \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding, and, in fact, purposely excluded that right. Officer Anderson further argues that, if the Legislature intended to permit judicial review after a finding of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d all it had to do was say so. Conversely, the Commission observes that the Legislature provided express language to designate the point of finality for a finding of guilt, to discourage officers from appealing the findings of the administrative board before the chief had reviewed and altered them, not in order to exclude review of a \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding. The Commission also argues that, instead, the Legislature made no such express statement about the point at which a finding of \u201cnot guilty\u201d is reviewable, because the ending point is clear from the statute. We reject the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the LEOBR. Accordingly, we hold that, under the LEOBR, a party is authorized to seek judicial review only in cases where the decision of the hearing board results in a \u201cguilty\u201d determination and meets the additional statutory requirements for judicial review. By reading together the provisions of \u00a7 3-108 and \u00a7 3-109, we are confident that the General Assembly did not intend for a \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding to be considered a decision that is subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The first basis of support for our decision comes from our reading of \u00a7 3-108(a)(3), which is the only subsection that makes reference to \u201cnot guilty\u201d findings. Section 3 \u2014 108(a)(3) expressly states that \u201c[a] finding of not guilty terminates the action.\u201d The parties in the instant case disagree as to whether \u201cterminate\u201d means that the proceeding is ended and no longer subject to review, or whether the proceeding is final for the purposes of further review. In our view, the language of that provision, when read in context, clearly and unambiguously elucidates the General Assembly\u2019s intent to end the administrative proceedings upon a finding of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d In this regard, a finding of \u201cnot guilty\u201d does constitute a final decision in the context of our previous decisions. With regard to the finality of an administrative agency decision, we have previously stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\">ordinarily[,] the action of an administrative agency, like the order of a court, is final if it determines or concludes the rights of the parties, or if it denies the parties means of further prosecuting or defending their rights and interests in the subject matter in proceedings before the agency, thus leaving nothing further for the agency to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\"><em>Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>296 Md. at 56, 459 A.2d at 211. Because the General Assembly stated explicitly that a finding of not guilty \u201cterminates the action,\u201d there is clearly nothing further for the agency to do, and the decision is therefore final within the contemplation of this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">While the Board\u2019s \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding constitutes a final decision, it does not meet the additional requirements set forth by the Legislature, in \u00a7 3-108, that would classify the decision as one that is entitled to judicial review under the LEOBR. We observed in <em>Miner v. Novotny, </em>304 Md. 164, 173-74, 498 A.2d 269, 273 (1985), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">[i]f the board finds the officer innocent of the charge, that ends the proceeding. If it finds him guilty, it then makes a recommendation to the chief of police as to an appropriate punishment. The chief is bound by a determination of innocence, but not a proposed punishment in the event of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>finding of guilt. As to that, his decision (rather than that of the Board) is final.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">If the Legislature intended for \u201cnot guilty\u201d findings to be reviewable, it could have included language to express that intention, rather than stating that the action is terminated. Instead, the Legislature spent the remainder of subsection (a) discussing the disposition of administrative actions where the hearing board actually enters a finding of \u201cguilty.\u201d Specifically, \u00a7\u00a7 3-108(a)(4) and (a)(5) state that if the hearing board makes a finding of \u201cguilty,\u201d it must reconvene the hearing, receive evidence and consider the officer\u2019s past job performance and other relevant factors before making a recommendation to the Chief<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> regarding a penalty.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Section 3-108 (d)(1), \u201cReview by chief and final order,\u201d continues by describing one of the two ways in which a decision of the hearing board can fulfill the additional requirements and become subject to judicial review. Section 3-108(d)(1) indicates that within thirty days of receipt of the hearing board\u2019s recommendation, the chief must review the hearing board\u2019s findings, conclusions and recommendations and \u201cissue a final order.\u201d Subsection (d)(1) further provides that \u201c[t]he final order and decision of the chief is binding and then may be appealed in accordance with \u00a7 3-109 of this subtitle.\u201d The Legislature\u2019s lengthy prescription of all that the Board and police chief must accomplish before a \u201cguilty\u201d decision becomes subject to judicial review and its failure to include any similar language when addressing findings of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d persuades us that a hearing board\u2019s decision must be a finding of \u201cguilty\u201d to be considered reviewable under the LEOBR. Furthermore, the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cthen\u201d signals when an agency can seek judicial review of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>hearing board\u2019s decision, after all of the requirements are fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">We derive additional support for this interpretation from the language of \u00a7 3-108(c)(1), titled \u201cFinal decision of hearing board,\u201d which sets forth additional requirements that a hearing board decision must meet before that decision becomes reviewable. This provision states that the hearing board's decision as to findings of fact and any penalty is final if the chief is an eyewitness to the incident that is under investigation or \u201ca law enforcement agency or the agency\u2019s superior governmental authority has agreed with an exclusive collective bargaining<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> representative recognized or certified under applicable law that the decision is final.\u201d Subsection (c)(2) further provides that \u201c[t]he decision of the hearing board then may be appealed in accordance with \u00a7 3-109 of this subtitle.\u201d Again, we are persuaded that the Legislature intended only for \u201cguilty\u201d decisions to be reviewable because the Legislature made a finding of guilt a prerequisite for the other requirements needed to render a decision ripe for review. If the Legislature intended otherwise, then it certainly knew how to include the same or similar language when discussing the findings of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d as it did for findings of \u201cguilty.\u201d To the contrary, the Legislature expressly stated that a \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding \u201cterminates the action.\u201d When read in context with the other provisions of \u00a7 3-108 and \u00a7 3-109, the statutory language is clear. Thus, we need not look any further to discern the legislative intent as to when a hearing board decision is reviewable. <em>Marriott Employees Fed.

The Commission notes that this Court \u201chas previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>harmonized the APA and the LEOBR and even specifically given effect to the provisions of the APA addressing the scope of judicial review in the context of an appeal from [an] LEOBR decision.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Officer Anderson argues that the LEOBR conflicts with the APA because, in her view, the plain meaning of the language in the LEOBR provides that judicial review of an administrative hearing board\u2019s \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding is not permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">We conclude that the APA is not the controlling statute in this case because the General Assembly intended for the LEOBR to provide an exclusive remedy for police officers when faced with disciplinary action. In <em>Moats, </em>we stated that \u201cwhen the General Assembly enacts a comprehensive administrative remedial scheme, that administrative remedy is generally deemed exclusive [and] [t]he Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights provides such a comprehensive remedial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>scheme.\u201d <em>Moats, </em>324 Md. at 529-30, 597 A.2d at 977.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>As we </em>stated in <em>Moats, </em>\u201c[w]e believe that the LEOB[ ]R, an extremely comprehensive statute requiring nearly twenty pages in the Maryland Annotated Code, provides an \u2018adequate and available\u2019 procedure.... \u201d <em>Moats, </em>324 Md. at 524, 597 A.2d at 974. As in <em>Moats, we </em>hold that the LEOBR is an exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">W\u00e9 agree with Officer Anderson that the Legislature did not authorize judicial review of a \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding under the LEOBR and that the LEOBR and the APA are therefore in conflict on this point. To discern the legislative intent regarding reviewability of board decisions resulting in findings of \u201cnot guilty\u201d under the APA, we need not look any further than the plain language of \u00a7 10-222.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Section 10-222(a)(1) states that \u201ca party who is aggrieved by the final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review of the decision.\u201d While the General Assembly chose to set forth other prerequisites for judicial review (in addition to a finding of \u201cguilty\u201d) in \u00a7 3-108(c)(1) and (d)(1) of the LEOBR, the Gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>al Assembly, under \u00a7 10-222, required only that a party be aggrieved before it is authorized to seek review of a final decision under the APA. While we endeavor to harmonize the applicable provisions of the APA and LEOBR, we can do so only to the extent that they are consistent with each other, <em>Gwin, </em>385 Md. at 462, 869 A.2d at 834, and to the extent that they are reconcilable. <em>Ghajari, </em>346 Md. at 115, 695 A.2d at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Because the General Assembly, pursuant to \u00a7 10-222, provided that only an aggrieved party may obtain judicial review of a final agency decision, we must conclude that this section conflicts with the LEOBR, which restricts judicial review to those situations described, <em>infra. </em>Specifically, the LEOBR limits judicial review to the final decisions of the Chief, pursuant to \u00a7 3 \u2014 108(d)(1), or his designee, pursuant to \u00a7 3-108(c)(1). These limitations on the right to judicial review under the LEOBR create a direct conflict between the LEOBR and the APA in that no such limitations are contained in the language of APA. Therefore, the LEOBR and APA are inconsistent, irreconcilable and cannot be harmonized as to matters that are subject to judicial review. In our view, that conflict must be resolved in favor of the law enforcement officer and not the Commission for two different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">First, the General Assembly clearly evidenced its intent that the LEOBR control in this situation by including specific language to that effect when it drafted the LEOBR. Section 3-102, \u201cEffect of Subtitle,\u201d states that \u201c... this subtitle supersedes any other law of the State, a county, or a municipal corporation that conflicts with this subtitle.\u201d By including this language, the Legislature expressly noted its desire that the LEOBR control over any conflicting statute, including the APA. We have stated that \u201cone can scarcely imagine a clearer statement of the scope of the LEOBR. The subtitle is to be a law that is supreme and all-encompassing, within its Statewide sphere of operations.\u201d <em>Moats, </em>324 Md. at 527, 597 A.2d at 976. Because the APA conflicts with the LEOBR as to whether an agency can seek judicial review of a \u201cnot guilty\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>finding, the LEOBR controls and we further conclude that the Commission is not entitled to review in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In addition, the LEOBR supersedes the APA because the LEOBR was written with the express purpose of protecting the rights of police officers who work for specific state agencies, while the APA was written to apply more broadly to \u201call State administrative agencies not specifically exempted.\u201d <em>See </em>\u201cApplicability\u201d note, Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-201 of the State Government Article. The LEOBR, therefore, applies only to a specific subset of individuals who work for specific state agencies, whereas the APA applies to these individuals and globally to all other individuals working for all other State agencies (unless specifically exempted by the APA). \u201cIt is well settled that when two statutes, one general and one specific, are found to conflict, the specific statute will be regarded as an exception to the general statute.\u201d <em>Ghajari, </em>346 Md. at 116, 695 A.2d at 150 (citing <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank v. Schlossberg, </em>306 Md. 48, 63, 507 A.2d 172, 180 (1986)). In <em>Ghajari, </em>we stated that when the statutes conflict, \u201cthe specific statute is controlling and the general statute is repealed to the extent of the inconsistency.\u201d <em>Ghajari, </em>346 Md. at 116, 695 A.2d at 150. In such a case, \u201cthe court should give effect to the specific statute in its entirety and should retain as much of the general statute as is reasonably possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, the LEOBR controls and the Commission is not entitled to judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">We hold that within the contemplation of the provisions of the LEOBR, the Commission may not seek judicial review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the Board\u2019s findings of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d The LEOBR does not authorize judicial review because the Board\u2019s finding of \u201cnot guilty\u201d did not meet the additional requirements for review set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 3-108(c)(l) or (d)(1). We also hold that the LEOBR does conflict with the APA as to whether an agency can seek review of a \u201cnot guilty\u201d decision. The LEOBR provides an exclusive remedy and is the controlling statute and therefore supersedes the conflicting provision of the APA. Therefore, the Commission is not entitled to seek judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The cases relied upon by the Commission in support of the contention that the LEOBR does not conflict with the APA are distinguishable from the instant case.

The LEOBR controls because it was enacted to protect law enforcement officers, in part, by providing an exclusive remedy in proceedings like the proceeding at issue in the present case. This exclusive remedy permits the officer, if found guilty, to seek judicial review of that decision.

I would hold therefore that the Commission was entitled to judicial review of its administrative hearing board\u2019s finding of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d Properly construed, there is no conflict between the APA and the LEOBR. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, and remand the case to that court with directions to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County and remand to the Circuit Court for judicial review of the Board\u2019s \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>I. Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">On 17 October 2001, the Commission administratively charged Officer Kathleen Anderson of the Maryland-National Capital Park Police Department with violation of its Bi-County Directive 414.0 dealing with \u201cFresh Pursuit\u201d by its officers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On 13-14 March 2003, the Commission\u2019s \u201cHearing Board\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u201cBoard\u201d) conducted a hearing at which testimony from several officers, including Officer Anderson, was heard. After a brief deliberation, the Board rendered a finding of \u201cNOT GUILTY\u201d on all charges. The Board entered its findings on 30 June 2003, and released its written decision, entitled \u201cDecision of Hearing Board Relative to PO Kathleen Anderson.\u201d On 25 July 2003, the Commission petitioned the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for judicial review of that decision. Officer Anderson responded with a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the Circuit Court. In a reported opinion filed on 30 September 2005, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">Because a grant to the Commission under the APA of a right to judicial review of an adverse trial board decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>conflicts with the LEOBR, appellant cannot find safe harbor in the APA. As to the Commission\u2019s right to judicial review, the statutory silence in P.S. \u00a7 3-108(a)(3) is deafening. We hold that, under P.S. \u00a7 3-108(a)(3), the Commission is not entitled to judicial review of a not guilty finding rendered by the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><em>Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v.

Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">As an initial matter, both the State APA and the LEOBR ordinarily apply to administrative disciplinary proceedings involving law enforcement officers employed by State agencies such as that in the present case. <em>Younkers v.

Additionally, the Majority Opinion quite properly acknowledges the well-settled principles of statutory construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>tion that \u201c[i]f the statutory language is unambiguous when construed according to its ordinary and everyday meaning, then we give effect to the statute as written.... If, however, the statutory text reveals ambiguity, \u2018then the job of the Court is to resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, using all of the resources and tools of statutory construction at our disposal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mackey v. Compass, </em>391 Md. 117, 141, 892 A.2d 479, 493 (2006) (quoting <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The Majority even acknowledges that, when determining the legislative intent of a statutory enactment, the words used must be given their ordinary meaning in light of the full context in which they appear. Maj. op. at 182-83, 909 A.2d at 700.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Yet, the Majority Opinion holds that \u201c[t]o discern the legislative intent regarding reviewability of board decisions resulting in findings of \u2018not guilty\u2019 under the APA, we need not look any further than the plain language of \u00a7 10-222.\u201d Maj. op. at 192, 909 A.2d at 706. In this case, we are called upon to construe not only the LEOBR, but also related provisions of the State APA and how the two statutes operate in tandem. It is unfortunate that, in its analysis, the Majority fails to consider properly the context in which \u00a7 10-222(a) was enacted, and rushes by an important portion of the analysis necessary to solve this legislative puzzle. <em>See State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 133, 669 A.2d 1339 (1996) (\u201cThe \u2018meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>appears ... We may always consider evidence of legislative intent beyond the plain language of the statute.\u201d) (quoting <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514-15, 525 A.2d 628 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">While it is true that when two statutes are found to conflict, one general and one specific, the specific statute is considered an exception to the general statute, Maj. op. at 194-95, 909 A.2d at 707, we long have held that \u201c[i]n order for one statute to alter or limit another, the intention of the Legislature to do so must be clear and manifest.\u201d <em>Drew v.

Furthermore, we read together statutes on the same subject and harmonize them to the extent possible, so as to avoid rendering either statute \u201cor any portion of it, meaningless, surplusage, superfluous or nugatory.\u201d <em>Gwin, </em>385 Md. at 462, 869 A.2d at 834 (internal citations omitted); <em>Mayor &amp; Town Council of Oakland, </em>392 Md. at 316-17, 896 A.2d at 1045.

Application of the Full and Relevant Principles of Statutory Construction to the Statutes in Question.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Turning to the statutes at issue in this case, the legislative setting surrounding the enactment of the LEOBR and the APA compels the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to preclude judicial review of a \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\n<em>Section 10-222(a) of the APA Provides for Judicial Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Section 10-222(a) of the APA explicitly confers on covered State agencies the right to seek judicial review of the agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>final administrative decision where the decision was made by either an internal (i.e. the Board in the case <em>sub </em>judice) or external (i.e. an Administrative Law Judge of the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings) administrative tribunal, to which the agency, or, in this case, the LEOBR, delegated the authority to make a final decision in the agency\u2019s name.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Before 1993, \u201cMaryland jurisprudence had traditionally taken a narrow view regarding the capacity of an administrative agency to seek judicial review of its own decisions.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Anne Arundel County, </em>106 Md.App. 221, 236, 664 A.2d 400, 408 (1995). This narrow view, referred to as the <em>McKinney-Peco </em>doctrine, evolved from two decisions of this Court in <em>Board of Zoning Appeals v. McKinney, </em>174 Md. 551, 199 A. 540 (1938), and <em>Maryland Board of Pharmacy v. Peco, Inc., </em>234 Md. 200, 198 A.2d 273 (1964). These cases stood for the proposition that an agency was precluded from seeking appellate review of a circuit court decision when the circuit court overruled the agency\u2019s final administrative decision upon judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">In <em>McKinney, </em>this Court was called upon to decide whether the Board of Zoning Appeals was able properly to seek judicial review in an appellate court, when a circuit court reversed and annulled the Board\u2019s final zoning decision. 174 Md. at 556, 199 A. at 542. There, we reasoned that an administrative agency exercises quasi-judicial and judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>powers when adjudicating cases before it, and has no interests in its decisions other than to decide the cases that come before it in a fair and impartial manner. <em>McKinney, </em>174 Md. at 564, 199 A. at 546. We therefore concluded that because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\">the Board [was] not a party to this proceeding, ha[d] no interest in it different from that which any judicial or quasi-judicial agency would have, which [was] to decide the cases coming before it fairly and impartially, [was] in no sense aggrieved by the decision of the Baltimore City Court, and ha[d] no statutory right of appeal, it had no power to take this appeal, and the appeal must be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In <em>Peco, </em>following the reasoning of <em>McKinney, </em>we held that the Maryland Board of Pharmacy was <em>not </em>entitled to appellate review of a decision of the circuit court reversing the Board\u2019s denial of a permit to open a pharmacy. We reasoned that \u201c[t]he Board\u2019s function in acting upon an application for permit under the statute is quasi-judicial and not adversary. It is only a party in the circuit court for the purpose of producing the record . .., or notifying the parties \u2018to the proceeding before it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peco, </em>234 Md. at 202, 198 A.2d at 274. The reasoning undergirding the <em>McKinney-Peco </em>doctrine was applied several times in subsequent years. See, for example, <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. H. Manny Holtz, Inc., </em>60 Md.App. 133, 141, 481 A.2d 513, 517 (1984), where the Court of Special Appeals held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">[T]he disqualification, or lack of standing [of the agency], arises ultimately from the proposition that the agency is not a party to the administrative proceeding before it. That is why it has no cognizable interest in the outcome of the proceeding; that is why it is not regarded as a proper party in the circuit court, even as a respondent/appellee; and that is why it has no authority to appeal from a judgment of the circuit court that reverses or modifies its administrative decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Although the <em>McKinney-Peco </em>doctrine applied primarily to an administrative agency\u2019s attempts to secure appellate review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>of a circuit court\u2019s reversal of the agency\u2019s final decision, the Court of Special Appeals has held that the doctrine likely would have applied with equal force in instances where the agency sought circuit court reversal of its own final administrative decision. <em>Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Anne Arundel County, </em>106 Md.App. at 237-38, 664 A.2d at 408 (\u201cThe principles espoused in <em>McKinney </em>and <em>Peco, </em>although stated in the context of an agency\u2019s effort to overturn the circuit court\u2019s reversal of its own decision, would thus appear to apply with equal force under circumstances in which an agency appears to seek a court reversal of its own final decision. In both instances, it can be said that, absent statutory authority, an administrative agency that has itself supplied the final decision of the agency is not an aggrieved party or a proper party on appeal.\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Section 10-222(a) was added by the Legislature to the APA in 1993 by Chapter 59, of the Acts of 1993. In addition to \u201crevising provisions of the Administrative procedure act relating to contested cases; [and] altering the scope of that law with regard to its applicability to certain agencies,\u201d the express purpose of these enactments was to alter the provisions of the APA relating to judicial review. Ch. 59, of the Acts of 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">The 1993 enactment was a direct result of a report and recommendation from the <em>Commission to Revise the Administrative Procedure Act </em>(\u201cAPA Commission\u201d), which studied the need to revise the predecessor APA. One of the express issues the APA Commission engaged was whether to continue to follow or overrule the <em>McKinney-Peco </em>doctrine prohibiting an agency from appealing from its own final administrative action. With respect to state administrative agencies subject to the APA, the APA Commission recommended that the General Assembly enact \u00a7 10-222(a) in order to overturn the doctrine, and abrogate the principle that an administrative was not an \u201caggrieved party\u201d for the purposes of judicial review. <em>See Report of the Commission to Revise the Administrative Procedure Act: Initial Report on Subtitles 2 and k of the APA </em>10, 55-57 (1 September 1992). More specifically, the APA Commission recommended that \u201cwhen final administrative decisions resolving issues between private parties and the government are issued by the OAH or an agency, the <em>McKinney-Peco </em>doctrine should not apply. Both parties should be permitted to pursue judicial review of the decision.\u201d <em>Report of the Commission to Review the Administrative Procedure Act: Initial Report of Subtitles 2 and I of the APA </em>8, 334-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The Legislature agreed, and in Chapter 59 of the Acts of 1993, enacted \u00a7 10-222(a). The General Assembly also enacted \u00a7 10-223(b) at the same time, which overturned the specific appellate impact of the <em>McKinney-Peco </em>doctrine. Section 10-223(b) provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">(b) <em>Right of Appeal. </em>\u2014 (1) A party who is aggrieved by a final judgment of a circuit court under this subtitle may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>appeal to the Court of Special Appeals in the manner that law provides for appeal of civil cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">(2) An agency that was a party in the circuit court may appeal under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">(emphasis added). Thus, under the prevailing iteration of the APA, an agency is expressly entitled to seek judicial review of its final administrative decision in a contested case, provided that the agency was a party in the agency action. Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), State Gov\u2019t Art., \u00a7 10-222(a)(2). Because the Commission in the present case was the prosecutor of the charges brought against Officer Anderson, I would hold that the Commission clearly was entitled to judicial review under the State APA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\n<em>Does APA \u00a7 10-222(a) Conflict with the LEOBR?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Taking into consideration the legislative context surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 10-222(a) of the APA, it is necessary to determine whether it conflicts with the provisions of the LEOBR. As the Majority Opinion states, this is significant because the LEOBR would control if any conflict existed. Section 3-102(a) of the LEOBR.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, unless the LEOBR conflicts with \u00a7 10-222(a) of the APA in some way, the APA controls in the instant case and allows the Commission to seek judicial review of the Board\u2019s \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Although the LEOBR regulatory scheme was adopted initially in 1974,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Maryland Code (2003) \u00a7 3-108(a)(3) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Public Safety Article, which states that \u201c[a] finding of not guilty terminates the action,\u201d first saw light of day on or about 28 March 1977, when it was proposed by the House Judiciary Committee as an amendment to the version of S.B. 1026 referred to it by the Senate, without this language.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nothing in that enactment, or for that matter any provision in the LEOBR, however, conflicts with \u00a7 10-222(a) of the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Section 3-109 of the Public Safety Article addresses judicial review of a \u201cfinal\u201d administrative decision made under the LEOBR.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 3-108 merely addresses when the administrative decision actually becomes final,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> for purposes of trig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>gering when an aggrieved party may seek judicial review under \u00a7 3-109.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The Majority Opinion essentially concludes that because the General Assembly repeatedly used the word \u201cfinal\u201d when discussing \u201cguilty\u201d findings by the Board, and did not use the word \u201cfinal\u201d when discussing a finding of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d the General Assembly did not intend for a finding of \u201cnot guilty\u201d by the Board to be a final decision subject to judicial review in the circuit courts. Maj. op. at 190, 909 A.2d at 704. I would hold that the Legislature\u2019s silence regarding the finality of a \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding makes \u00a7 3 \u2014 108(a)(3) ambiguous, at most, rather than creating an express conflict between the judicial review provisions of the APA and the LEOBR.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">As observed by the Majority, we previously have held that an agency order is \u201cfinal\u201d and ripe for judicial review if it meets the following standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">ordinarily[,] the action of an administrative agency, like the order of a court, is final it if determines or concludes the rights of the parties, or if it denies the parties means of further prosecuting or defending their rights and interests in the subject matter in proceedings before the agency, thus leaving nothing further for the agency to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\"><em>Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Balt. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>296 Md. 46, 56, 459 A.2d 205, 211 (1983). In the present case, a \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding by the Board is final, for contested cases purposes in the administrative adjudication process, because \u201c[a] finding of not guilty terminates the action\u201d under \u00a7 3-108(a)(3). In other words, it terminates the need for further administrative review, unlike an interlocutory finding of guilt by the Board, which requires subsequent review and action by the agency head, the Chief, under the remaining provisions of \u00a7 3-108.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">A reading of the plain language of \u00a7 3-108 supports this interpretation. Section 3-108 is entitled \u201cDisposition of <em>ad</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>ministrative action,\u201d </em>and subsection (a)(3) expressly provides that a \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding terminates the \u201caction.\u201d The plain language of the statute makes it clear that when the Legislature referred to \u201caction\u201d in subsection (a)(3), it intended to refer to the administrative action itself, rather than the entire proceeding extending through judicial review or appeal. At that point, the action before the agency administrative tribunal is concluded, and there is nothing left to do. The Board\u2019s action is final in such an instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Our case law bolsters the interpretation that a finding of \u201cnot guilty\u201d is but a final administrative order of the Board in a contested case. The Majority relies on <em>Miner v. Novotny, </em>304 Md. 164, 173-74, 498 A.2d 269, 273 (1985), where we said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">[i]f the board finds the officer innocent of the charge, that ends the proceeding. If it finds him guilty, it then makes a recommendation to the chief of police as to an appropriate punishment. The chief is bound by a determination of innocent, but not a proposed punishment in the event of a finding of guilt. As to that, his decision <em>(rather than that of the </em>Board) is final.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">(emphasis added). The Majority turns to <em>Miner </em>in order to bolster its claim that if the Legislature intended for \u201cnot guilty\u201d findings to be reviewable judicially, it would have expressly said so. I attach a different meaning to the language used in <em>Miner. </em>In that passage, we essentially reasoned that, although the Chief has the final say in the proposed punishment of an officer found guilty, the Board\u2019s decision, insofar as the administrative proceedings are concerned, is final with respect to a finding of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d because the Chief is foreclosed from taking further administrative action by the determination of innocence. If the agency head is bound by such a determination of not proven guilty, then implicit in this finding is that the administrative action is concluded, and there is nothing left to be decided by the Board or the Chief. In other words, the decision meets the definition of \u201cfinal\u201d under <em>Comm\u2019n on Human Relations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>The Majority opinion essentially interprets \u00a7 3-108(a)(3) to mean that the Legislature intended to prohibit judicial review of a \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding by imposing additional requirements in order for the order to become \u201cfinal.\u201d Maj. op. at <em>188-89, </em>909 A.2d at 703. This view would have weight only if \u00a7 3-109(a) stated that \u201c[a]n appeal from a decision made under \u00a7 3-108 [ (a)(3) ],\u201d rather than the blanket reference to \u00a7 3-108 that actually appears in the statute. As it is, however, \u00a7 3-109(a), as written, is entirely consistent with \u00a7 10-222(a) of the APA. Such a construction harmonizes the relevant provisions of the two related statutory schemes, as the more relevant principles of statutory construction, ignored by the Majority, urge us to do. On this subject, the clearly expressed legislative intent of \u00a7 10-222(a) of the APA is not trumped by, nor should it be construed to be inconsistent with, the plain meaning of \u00a7 3-108(a)(3) of the LEOBR. To find an inconsistency is contrary to the canons of statutory construction that mandate a clear and manifest legislative intent in order for one statute to alter or limit another. <em>Drew, </em>379 Md. at 330, 842 A.2d at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">When construing multiple statutes, this Court presumes that the Legislature acts with full knowledge of prior legislative enactments. <em>Mayor &amp; Town Council of Oakland, </em>392 Md. at 316-17, 896 A.2d at 1045. Considering that \u00a7 10-222(a) (enacted in 1993) specifically stated that the agency itself could seek judicial review of a final administrative action in a contested case in which it was a party, one would think that, if the Legislature intended purposefully to exclude the right to judicial review of \u201cnot guilty\u201d findings as the Majority suggests, Maj. op. at 188, 909 A.2d at 703, it would have expressly done so in the language of that statute. At the very least, such an intent would have appeared in the legislative history of the enactment of \u00a7 10-222(a). The complete absence from the bill file of evidence of such a legislative intent necessitates the conclusion that it was not expressly excluded, and at the very least, not contemplated by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">It is important to keep in mind that when interpreting statutes, this Court must construe statutes in a common sense manner, and must \u201cavoid constructions that are illogical, un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>reasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Frost, </em>336 Md. at 137, 647 A.2d at 112. In <em>Calvert County Planning Commission v. Howlin Realty Management., Inc., </em>364 Md. 301, 319 n. 1, 320, 772 A.2d 1209, 1219-20 (2001), this Court held that administrative agencies are more than just \u201cneutral arbiters of disputes in which they have no independent interest.\u201d When the administrative action has the potential to affect the agency in terms of its broader responsibilities, the agency must be free to initiate or intervene in judicial review actions in order to challenge those judgments which may hamper its ability to implement its policies. <em>See also Md. Racing Comm\u2019n v. Castrenze, </em>335 Md. 284, 295 n. 4, 643 A.2d 412, 417 (1994). Although <em>Howlin </em>involved an agency\u2019s right to participate in judicial review of its final decision, the reasoning is very instructive. To preclude judicial review of the Board\u2019s \u201cnot guilty\u201d decision here directly affects the Commission\u2019s ability to implement and enforce its internal policy. Common sense dictates that the agency be allowed to enforce these policies, even if such enforcement requires judicial review of an internal tribunal\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The Majority posits that \u201cthe administrative agency may seek judicial review only in circumstances where it is expressly authorized by statute to do so.\u201d Maj. op. at 185, 909 A.2d at 702. I would hold that, because \u00a7 10-222(a) of the APA expressly authorizes judicial review by the agency of the agency\u2019s decision, and the LEOBR contains no provisions precluding judicial review of a \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding by the Board, the Commission in this situation is authorized expressly to seek judicial review in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\">.

There, the Court of Special Appeals held that it could not, because it appeared that the Commissioners themselves had not authorized the appeal.

Assuming, without deciding, that \u00a7\u00a7 10-222 stands for the proposition that the Human Relations Commission can appeal from its own appeal board's decision, the authority to seek judicial review in a contested case rests with the nine Commissioners.
