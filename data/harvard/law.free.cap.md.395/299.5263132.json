After hearing arguments on March 14, 2005, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City issued an Order denying Carmel Realty\u2019s motion and granting the BDC\u2019s motion. In an unreported opinion, filed January 24, 2006, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the ruling of the trial court and found that the BDC is subject to the requirements of both the Open Meetings Act and the requirements of Maryland\u2019s Public Information Act. The City of Baltimore Development Corporation filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 6, 2006, and Carmel Realty filed a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari on March 18, 2006.

Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">A. City of Baltimore Development Corporation</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The City of Baltimore Development Corporation (the \u201cBDC\u201d) was formed in October of 1991 with three members: Claude E. Hitchcock, Lyn W. Townsend, and Arnold Williams. The initial Board of Directors was composed of four individuals: William R. Brown, Jr., Honora M. Freeman, Robert W. Hearn, and Lynette W. Young.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The BDC is a not-for-profit corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The BDC\u2019s stated purpose is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u201c(1) To develop and implement long-range development strategies for commercial, industrial, office, residential, and other development in the City of Baltimore (the \u2018City\u2019); to serve as a liaison between the private and public sector to coordinate development efforts and to expedite the review of public approvals and other government services in the City; and to undertake any other appropriate activity to achieve the continued strong business climate, urban renewal, and development throughout the City;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\">\u201c(2) To implement, oversee, and encourage public and private development and rehabilitation projects that will increase the City\u2019s tax base (by, among other things, assisting the City (and new and existing business) to finance new and expanding operations), provide permanent and temporary jobs (and job opportunities) in the City, and foster investment and confidence in the City\u2019s economy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">\u201c(3) To enhance and improve the physical and cultural environment of the City through the creation of public open space, improved transportation systems, and the encouragement and creation of public attractions for local residents and visitors; to encourage cultural, entertainment, recreational, historic, and educational facilities that will further the promotion of the benefits of living in or visiting the City; to bring new spending power to the City\u2019s economy; to enhance and improve the image of the City as a place to live, work, and visit; and to encourage new residential initiatives in the City;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">\u201c(4) To improve the economic health of the City through attraction of new businesses, retention of existing businesses, and the stimulation and encouragement of growth and expansion of commercial office uses, manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, research, and development, including industrial application of new technologies, particularly in the medical and biotechnological spheres and \u2018space age\u2019 technologies with maximum growth potential;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">\u201c(5) To increase minority business enterprise and women\u2019s business enterprise participation in business and development activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u201c(6) To provide in the furtherance of these declared purposes, financing, financial assistance, and financial advice, including but not limited to activities permitted under programs of the Small Business Administration and other economic development programs of the Federal, state, or local governments; such activities to include buying and selling real property and developing and leasing such property, together with the creation of financial instruments and entities appropriate for such purposes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">\u201c(7) In furtherance of these declared purposes, to carry out a contract or contracts, as amended from time to time, between the Corporation and the City; such services as therein specified, or to be specified, to include, by example and not by way of limitation, the coordination of public functions such as the preparation, adoption, and execution of Urban Renewal Plans, Planned Unit Developments, Industrial Retention Zones, and Free Enterprise Zones;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">\u201c(8) To coordinate activities of local, state, and Federal agencies as well as private for-profit and non-profit entities for the purpose of achieving the Corporation\u2019s objectives, and to receive and expend funds from any legal source for any legal purpose so long as consistent with its declared purposes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201c(9) To undertake activities within the City or outside the City when such activities are reasonably anticipated to have an impact on the City; which activities may include research, planning, and investigation, as well as developing and maintaining public and private sector contacts in furtherance of these corporate purposes; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">\u201c(10) To do anything permitted by Section 2-103 of the Corporations and Associations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland as amended from time to time, subject to any limitations imposed under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Amended Articles of Incorporation of the City of Baltimore Development Corporation, ART.

Section 3 of that Ordinance states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">\u201cThat it is necessary to acquire, by purchase or by condemnation, for urban renewal purposes, the fee simple interest or any lesser interest in and to the following properties or portions thereof, together with all right, title, interest....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Section 4 of Ordinance 99-423 gives the BDC, \u201cacting pursuant to its contract with the Mayor and City Council,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> certain responsibilities with respect to the Westside project. Sections 5 and 6 of Ordinance 99-423 contain additional responsibilities the BDC is required to fulfill, separate and apart from its contract with the City.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>It is the matter referred to by the parties as the \u201cSuper-block\u201d that brings this case before the Court. The Superblock is a part of the Westside project and its boundaries are, generally, the 100 block of Clay Street and the 200 block of West Lexington Street on the north; the 100 block of North Howard Street on the west; West Fayette Street on the south; and North Liberty Street on the east. Within this perimeter are more than 50 individual properties which comprise a total of 3.62 acres. Some of the properties to be condemned or purchased by the City, as part of the Super-block project, are owned by respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">On October 27, 2003, the BDC solicited requests for proposals (\u201cRFP\u2019s\u201d) to develop the Superblock. All of the respondents submitted development proposals to the BDC for the buildings they owned or occupied by February 27, 2004. On October 23, 2004, respondents submitted a written request to the BDC seeking, under Maryland\u2019s Public Information Act, access to minutes of meetings of the BDC\u2019s Board of Directors, copies of the proposals submitted for the Superblock, and other information in the BDC\u2019s possession regarding the proposals. On November 9, 2004, the BDC\u2019s President denied the request, writing: \u201cAs a separate non-profit corporation, the City of Baltimore Development Corporation is not subject to the Maryland Public Information Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">On November 16, 2004, all of the respondents, except Carmel Realty, received a letter from the BDC stating that it would contact each of them to arrange a meeting within two weeks of the date of the letter to discuss each respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>proposal for the development of his or her property. Respondents were to \u201ccome prepared to discuss overall costs, financing sources and uses, owner\u2019s equity, anticipated public tax credit, subsidy, and grant or loan assistance.... \u201d The letter was signed by the BDC\u2019s Chief Operating Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">On November 18, 2004, respondents submitted a written request to the BDC for information regarding the BDC\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 scheduled meetings so that respondents could attend. The record does not contain a response by the BDC to this request. On that same day, the BDC\u2019s Board of Directors met and voted unanimously to recommend to the Mayor one entity as the \u201ckey developer\u201d for the Superblock. Two other developers were selected to revitalize areas within the Superblock, but Carmel Realty was the only respondent to be selected as a developer.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">On November 29, 2004, respondents filed a two count Complaint alleging that the BDC, as the \u201ceconomic development arm\u201d of Baltimore City, is subject to the provisions of the Open Meetings Act and that, as the City\u2019s instrumentality, the BDC is subject to the provisions of Maryland\u2019s Public Information Act. On March 14, 2005, the Circuit Court heard arguments on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment. On June 8, 2005, the Circuit Court issued an Order with a Memorandum Opinion granting petitioner\u2019s motion and denying respondent\u2019s motion. Respondents appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">On January 24, 2006, in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court and found that Maryland\u2019s Open Meetings and Public Information Acts applied to the BDC. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Whalen, </em>395 Md. 154, 161, 909 A.2d 683 (2006); <em>Rockwood Cas. Ins. Co. v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>385 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Md. 99, 106, 867 A.2d 1026, 1030 (2005). Prior to making a determination as to whether the trial court was correct as a matter of law, the appellate court must make an initial determination as to whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact. <em>Whalen, </em>395 Md. at 161, 909 A.2d at 688; <em>Jurgensen v. New Phoenix Atlantic Condominium Council of Unit Owners, </em>380 Md. 106, 114, 843 A.2d 865, 869 (2004). Factual disputes and reasonable inferences drawn from the facts of the case must be resolved in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Whalen, </em>395 Md. at 161, 909 A.2d at 688; <em>Jurgensen, </em>380 Md. at 114, 843 A.2d at 869. Only when there is an absence of a genuine dispute of material fact, will an appellate court make a determination as to whether the trial court was correct as a matter of law. <em>Whalen, </em>395 Md. at 161-62, 909 A.2d at 688; <em>Rockwood, </em>385 Md. at 106, 867 A.2d at 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The parties do not dispute any material facts for the purposes of determining whether the BDC is a public body under the Open Meetings Act or whether it is an instrumentality of Baltimore City under Maryland\u2019s Public Information Act. Therefore, our sole task is to make a determination as to whether the Circuit Court for Baltimore City was correct as a matter of law when it held that the Open Meetings Act and Maryland\u2019s Public Information Act do not apply to the BDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Eminent domain is the \u201c \u2018inherent power of a governmental entity to take privately owned property ... and convert it to public use....\u2019\u201d <em>J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, </em>368 Md. 71, 87, 792 A.2d 288, 297 (2002) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>541 (7th ed.1999)). It is a \u201cbasic principle of constitutional law that the power of eminent domain <em>adheres to sovereignty </em>and requires no constitutional authority for its existence.\u201d <em>Lore v. Board of Public Works of State of Maryland, </em>277 Md. 356, 358, 354 A.2d 812, 814 (1976) (emphasis added). The \u201cmode and manner of the exercise of the power of eminent domain, however, is exclusively vested in the judgment and discretion of the Legislature, and is not without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>its limitations.\u201d <em>Matthews, </em>368 Md. at 87, 792 A.2d at 297 (citations omitted) (quotations omitted). The Fifth<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Fourteenth<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Amendments to the United States Constitution, together with Article III, \u00a7 40 of the Maryland Constitution<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> limit the Legislature\u2019s power of eminent domain \u201cby requiring that the taking of private property by governmental entities \u2018be for public use and that just compensation be paid.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matthews, </em>368 Md. at 87, 792 A.2d at 297 (quoting <em>Utilities, Inc. Of Md. v. Wash. Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>362 Md. 37, 45-46, 763 A.2d 129, 133 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The recent Supreme Court decision <em>Kelo v. City of New London, </em>545 U.S. 469, 125 S.Ct. 2655, 162 L.Ed.2d 439 (2005), has sparked national, state, and local public debate over the eminent domain process. Writing for the dissent in <em>Kelo, </em>Justice O\u2019Connor explained that Court\u2019s historical interpretation of the limitations the Fifth Amendment places on the exercise of eminent domain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">\u201c[W]e have read the Fifth Amendment\u2019s language to impose two distinct conditions on the exercise of eminent domain: the taking must be for a \u2018public use\u2019 and \u2018just compensation\u2019 must be paid to the owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">\u201cThese two limitations serve to protect \u2018the security of Property,\u2019 which Alexander Hamilton described to the Philadelphia Convention as one of the \u2018great obj[ects] of Government].\u2019 Together they ensure stable property ownership by providing safeguards against excessive, unpredictable, or unfair use of the government\u2019s eminent domain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>power-particularly against those owners who, for whatever reasons, may be unable to protect themselves in the political process against the majority\u2019s will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\">\u201cWhile the Takings Clause presupposes that government can take private property without the owner\u2019s consent, the just compensation requirement spreads the cost of condemnations and thus prevents the public from loading upon one individual more than his just share of the burdens of government. The public use requirement, in turn, imposes a more basic limitation, circumscribing the very scope of the eminent domain power: Government may compel an individual to forfeit her property for the <em>public\u2019s </em>use, but not for the benefit of another private person. This requirement promotes fairness as well as security.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">\u201cWhere is the line between \u2018public\u2019 and \u2018private\u2019 property use? We give considerable deference to legislatures\u2019 determinations about what governmental activities will advantage the public. But were the political branches the sole arbiters of the public-private distinction, the Public Use Clause would amount to little more than hortatory fluff. An external, judicial check on how the public use requirement is interpreted, however limited, is necessary if this constraint on government power is to retain any meaning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\"><em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 496-97, 125 S.Ct. at 2672-73 (O\u2019Connor, J. dissenting) (citations omitted) (quotations omitted). It is clear in the present case that the BDC functions as part of the exercise of the City\u2019s powers of eminent domain.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The BDC by itself has no such power.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>We are mindful that the issues discussed by Justice O\u2019Conner above appear to be at the very root of most urban renewal disputes, but they are not presently before us and we leave them for another day. We only note that when one is forced to convey his or her property to a public entity it is in contravention, albeit alleviated by compensation and thus permitted, of a constitutional right and, seemingly, such proceedings should be even more open to public scrutiny especially when the property might ultimately be conveyed to other private parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">A. Statutory Interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In <em>Chow v. State, </em>the Court recited the principles of statutory interpretation which we have so often stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\u201c \u2018The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. Statutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">\u201c \u2018In construing the plain language, [a] court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application. Statutory text should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory. The plain language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation. Rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u201c \u2018If statutory language is unambiguous when construed according to its ordinary and everyday meaning, then we give effect to the statute as it is written. If there is no ambiguity in that language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends; we do not need to resort to the various, and sometimes inconsistent, external rules of construction, for the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><em>Chow, </em>393 Md. 431, 443-44, 903 A.2d 388, 395 (2006) (quoting <em>Kushell v. Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>385 Md. 563, 576-77, 870 A.2d 186, 193-94 (2005)) (citations omitted) (quotations omitted). The <em>Chow </em>Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">\u201c \u2018In some cases, the statutory text reveals ambiguity, and then the job of this Court is to resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, using all the resources and tools of statutory construction at our disposal. However, before judges may look to other sources for interpretation, first there must exist an ambiguity within the statute, i.e., two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute. Where the statutory language is free from such ambiguity, courts will neither look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent nor add to or delete words from the statute. Only when faced with ambiguity will courts consider both the literal or usual meaning of the words as well as their meaning in light of the objectives and purposes of the enactment. As our predecessors noted, \u201cWe cannot assume authority to read into the Act what the Legislature apparently deliberately left out. Judicial construction should only be resorted to when an ambiguity exists.\u201d Therefore, the strongly preferred norm of statutory interpretation is to effectuate the plain language of the statutory text.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">393 Md. at 444, 903 A.2d at 395 (quoting <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387-88, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003) (citations omitted)). We will apply these principles to the Open Meetings Act and to Maryland\u2019s Public Information Act in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>B. Open Meetings Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The openness of government was an issue of great import to at least one of this Country\u2019s founding fathers. John Adams, when distinguishing between the manner in which the public business of his ancestors was carried out and his hopes for the future of America, wrote that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">\u201cLiberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people, who have a right ... and a desire to know; but besides this, they have a right, an independent right, an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge, I mean of the characters and conduct of their rulers.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Maryland\u2019s first comprehensive legislation regarding open meetings came into being over 200 years later when, in 1977, the General Assembly enacted sections 7 through 15 of Article 76A of the Maryland Code. <em>Community and Labor United For Baltimore Charter Committee (C.L.U.B.) v. Baltimore City Board of Elections, </em>377 Md. 183, 193, 832 A.2d 804, 809 (2003) <em>(citing Wesley Chapel Bluemount Ass\u2019n v. Baltimore County, </em>347 Md. 125, 137-138, 699 A.2d 434, 440 (1997)). \u201c[T]he heart of the Act[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] is found in the public policy declarations of \u00a7 7, <em>ie., </em>that \u2018public business be performed in an open and public manner and that the citizens be advised of and aware of ... the <em>deliberations and decisions </em>that go into the making of public policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Carrollton v.

Then-Chief Judge Murphy, writing for the Court in <em>New Carrollton, </em>eloquently explained the policy behind the Open Meetings Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u201cWhile the Act does not afford the public any right to participate in the meetings, it does assure the public right to observe the deliberative process and the making of decisions by the public body at open meetings. In this regard, it is clear that <em>the Act applies, not only to final decisions made by the public body exercising legislative functions at a public meeting, but as well to all deliberations which precede the actual legislative act or decision. </em>... It is, therefore, <em>the deliberative and decision-making process in its entirety which must be conducted in meetings open to the public since every step of the process, including the final decision itself, constitutes the consideration or transaction of public business. </em>In this regard, the Supreme Court of Florida, in <em>Town of Palm Beach v. Gradison, </em>296 So.2d 473 (Fla.1974), construing that state\u2019s open meeting law, observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\">\u2018One purpose of the government in the sunshine law was to prevent at nonpublic meetings the crystallization of secret decisions to a point just short of ceremonial acceptance. Rarely could there be any purpose to a nonpublic premeeting conference except to conduct some part of the decisional process behind closed doors. <em>That statute should be construed so as to frustrate all evasive devices. </em>This can be accomplished only by embracing the collective inquiry and discussion stages with the terms of the statute, as long as such inquiry and discussion is conducted by any committee or other authority appointed and established by a governmental agency, and relates <em>to any matter on which foreseeable action will be taken.\u2019 </em>296 So.2d at 477.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><em>New Carrollton, </em>287 Md. at 72-73, 410 A.2d at 1078-79 (citations omitted). Judge Eldridge, more recently for this Court, stated: \u201cThe clear policy of the Open Meetings Act is to allow the general public to view the <em>entire </em>deliberative process.\u201d <em>C.L.U.B., </em>377 Md. at 194, 832 A.2d at 810 (emphasis added). Article 76A was recodified as \u00a7\u00a7 10-501-10-512 of the Open Meetings Act by Chapter 284 of the Acts of 1984 without any substantial changes. Therefore, the fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>policy of the Open Meetings Act is the same today as it was in 1977, that: \u201cit is <em>essential to the maintenance of a democratic society </em>that ... public business be performed in an open and public manner; and citizens be allowed to observe ... the <em>deliberations and decisions </em>that the making of public policy involves.\u201d \u00a7 10-501(a)(l)(ii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">We continue with the plain language of the relevant portions of the Open Meetings Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">\u201c(h) <em>Public body. </em>\u2014 (1) \u2018Public body\u2019 means an entity that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">(1) consists of at least 2 individuals; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">(ii) is created by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">1. the Maryland Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">2. a State statute;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">8. a county charter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">4. an ordinance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-12\">5. a rule, resolution, or bylaw;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-13\">6. an executive order of the Governor; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-14\">7. an executive order of the chief executive authority of a political subdivision of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-15\">(2) \u2018Public body\u2019 includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-16\">(i) any multimember board, commission, or committee appointed by the Governor or the chief executive authority of a political subdivision of the State, or appointed by an official who is subject to the policy direction of the Governor or chief executive authority of the political subdivision, if the entity includes in its membership at least 2 individuals not employed by the State or the political subdivision; ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALq\">\u00a7 10-502(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-17\">Petitioner argues that it is not a public body within the meaning of the Open Meetings Act because it is not an entity created by one of the provisions of \u00a7 10-502(h)(1). It urges us to read \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) as being merely illustrative of \u00a7 10-502(h)(1) because the word \u201cmeans\u201d is used in (h)(1) and the word \u201cincludes\u201d is used in (h)(2). Petitioner argues that the Legislature uses \u201cmeans\u201d to define and \u201cincludes\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>illustrate or give examples only of what it has already defined in \u00a7 10-502(h)(1). The BDC incongruously relies on Maryland Code (1957, 2005 Repl.Vol.), Article 1, \u00a7 30, for support: \u201cThe words \u2018includes\u2019 or \u2018including\u2019 mean, unless the context requires otherwise, includes or including by way of illustration <em>and not by way of limitation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Petitioner also cites to <em>Hackley v. </em>State, in which we quoted from the Maryland Style Manual for Statutory Law, Department of Legislative Services (Jan.1998) at 27: \u201c[Legislative drafters [are] to \u2018[u]se \u201cmeans\u201d if the definition is intended to be exhaustive\u2019 ... and to \u2018[u]se \u201cincludes\u201d if the definition is intended to be partial or illustrative\u2019....\u201d <em>Hackley, </em>389 Md. 387, 393, 885 A.2d 816, 820 (2005). In short, petitioner argues that \u00a7 10-502(h)(1) lists exclusively the threshold indicia of a public body for the purposes of the Open Meetings Act and \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) only illustrates or gives examples of those types of public bodies specified in \u00a7 10-502(h)(1). We disagree; rather, the two sections address alternative approaches. Section 10-502(h)(2) introduces a new concept and is not a subsidiary section to \u00a7 10-502(h)(1) because it introduces a different set of public bodies other than those described in \u00a7 10-502(h)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Respondent\u2019s position is consistent with our view. Initially, respondent asserts that the BDC is subject to \u00a7 10-502(h)(1) because it originally had three \u201chigh City officials\u201d on its governing body and because the BDC\u2019s website stated it was \u201cchartered\u201d by the City. Respondent also argues, persuasively, that when \u00a7 10-502(h)(l) and (2) are read together in context, the word \u201cincludes\u201d is not used to limit \u00a7 10-502(h)(1) because \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) introduces a different manner in which qualifying public bodies may be created that is separate and distinct from \u00a7 10-502(h)(1). Thus, respondent asserts, the context of the word \u201cincludes\u201d prevents it from being read only as illustrative of and limited to the provisions of \u00a7 10-502(h)(1). We agree. Had it been a subsidiary clause of \u00a7 10-502(h)(1) it would have been made subject to the prior section and normally would have been designated \u201c \u00a7 10-502(h)(1) ... <em>(iii).\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>For an entity to meet the definition of a public body, \u00a7 10-502(h)(1)(i) requires that it consist of at least two individuals. Section 10-502(h)(1)(ii)(1-7) imposes the additional requirement that the entity be created by Maryland\u2019s Constitution; a State statute; a county charter; an ordinance; a rule, resolution, or bylaw; an executive order of the Governor; or an executive order of the chief executive authority of a political subdivision of the State. Thus, \u00a7 10-502(h)(1)(i) and (ii) make the Open Meetings Act applicable to entities consisting of at least two individuals that are created by some form of constitutional act, legislative act, or executive order. The BDC\u2019s Board of Directors consists of more than two individuals, as required by \u00a7 10-502(h)(1)(i), but there is nothing in the record to show that the BDC was created by any of the specific acts or orders found in \u00a7 10-502(h)(1)(ii) (1-7). Therefore, in the absence of support in the record, the BDC cannot be placed within the class of entities that are \u201cpublic bodies\u201d solely under the provisions of \u00a7 10-502(h)(1)(i) and (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Section 10-502(h)(2)(i) additionally states, however, that a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\u201c(2) \u2018Public Body\u2019 includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">(i) <em>any multimember board, </em>commission, or committee <em>appointed by </em>the Governor or <em>the chief executive authority of a political subdivision of the State, </em>or appointed by an official who is subject to the policy direction of the Governor or chief executive authority of the political subdivision, <em>if the entity includes in its membership at least 2 individuals not employed by the </em>State or the <em>political subdivision; </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Section 10-502(h)(2)(i), as it pertains to the case at bar, makes multimember boards appointed by the chief executive authority of a political subdivision, which consist of at least two individuals not employed by the particular subdivision, subject to the Open Meetings Act. Thus, \u00a7 10-502(h)(2)(i) introduces a separate and distinct definition from the definition contained in \u00a7 10-502(h)(1) and the context requires that the word \u201cincludes\u201d not be read as illustrative, <em>by way of limitation, </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>the \u00a7 10-502(h)(1) methods by which a public body subject to the act is defined. Were we to find otherwise, we would be reading \u00a7 10 \u2014 502(h)(2)(i) and the distinct meaning it introduces, as superfluous or nugatory and we would not be harmonizing provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect. Such a reading would be inconsistent with the principles of statutory interpretation. Moreover, the parties do not dispute that the BDC\u2019s bylaws require it to be a multimember board, that its Board of Directors currently consists of at least two individuals not employed by Baltimore City,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that the Board is nominated or appointed by the Mayor of Baltimore City.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The City of Baltimore Development Corporation\u2019s Amended Articles of Incorporation provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">\u201c(1) The affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of a Board of Directors which shall exercise all corporate powers except as conferred on or reserved to the Members of the Corporation by law or the By-Laws of the Corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">\u201c(2) The Board of Directors shall consist of such numbers of persons as may be provided from time to time by the ByLaws, but not less than four (4) persons.

SIXTH, October 4, 1991. Section (1) gives the Board of Directors power over the activities of the Corporation. Section (2) provides that, in accordance with the corporation\u2019s bylaws, the Board of Directors will consist of a certain number of people who have certain qualifications. The bylaws, as amended on November 4, 1997,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> give the Mayor power of appointment or nomination to the Board, the power of removal over members of the Board, and the power to appoint directors to fill vacancies for the remainder of terms of vacating directors. The Mayor, to a large extent, can control the Board of Directors and the Board controls the BDC. Thus, through the nomination, removal, and appointment process, the Mayor controls the City of Baltimore Development Corporation and it is, in essence, a public body under the plain language of \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) and must comply prospectively with the provisions of the Open Meetings Act.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Although there is no ambiguity in the term \u201cincludes\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) and no interpretation is required, petitioner argues, in the alternative, that the legislative history of \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) demonstrates that the General Assembly never intended to apply the Open Meetings Act to entities like the BDC. Petitioner bases its argument on an Attorney General\u2019s letter discussing the interpretation of \u201cincludes\u201d (in the context of a failed amendment to the Open Meetings Act), two failed bills which would have expanded the definition of public body to expressly reach private corporations, and one failed bill which would have expanded the definition for the sole purpose of reaching the BDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">We note at the outset, that Attorney General opinions are entitled to consideration, but that they are not binding on this Court. <em>Dodds v. Shamer, </em>339 Md. 540, 556, 663 A.2d 1318, 1326 (1995). The proposed language of the suggested amendment to \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) that the Attorney General was asked to interpret for the purposes of the advisory letter was: \u201c \u2018PUBLIC BODY\u2019 INCLUDES THE MULTIMEMBER GOVERNING BODY OF ANY CORPORATION DIRECTLY SUPPORTED ENTIRELY BY PUBLIC FUNDS.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (quotations omitted). That language, however, was not included in the amendment. The language that was actually enacted read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\"><em>\u201cANY MULTIMEMBER BOARD, COMMISSION, OR COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR OR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY OF A POLITICAL SUBDIVISION OF THE STATE, IF THE ENTITY INCLUDES IN ITS MEMBERSHIP AT LEAST 2 INDI</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>VIDUALS NOT EMPLOYED BY THE STATE OR A POLITICAL SUBDIVISION OF THE STATE. </em>...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Chapter 655 of the Acts of 1991. The letter from the Attorney General is not relevant to the case at bar because the version of the bill that the Attorney General was asked to interpret was apparently rejected by the General Assembly when it enacted an entirely different version of the bill that included the language we here interpret.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Petitioner then argues that three proposed amendments to the definition of \u201cpublic body\u201d that were rejected by the General Assembly are evidence that it never intended \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) to apply to the BDC. The first two proposed bills were essentially the same. In 1998, Senate Bill 340 proposed an amendment to \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) that would make corporations whose bylaws required at least half of the governing body to be composed of public officers or public employees or the appointees of public officers or public employees subject to the Open Meetings Act. Senate Bill 608, introduced in 2000, would have only made corporations whose bylaws required the Board of Directors to be composed of at least half public appointees subject to the Open Meetings Act. Also in 2000, Senate Bill 241 attempted to amend \u00a7 10-502(h)(2) to specifically include the BDC.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>When addressing this precise issue with respect to Failed Senate Bill 340, the Court of Special Appeals said: \u201cAlthough it may be appropriate and useful to review a failed legislative effort in determining legislative intent, whether as part of the original legislative effort or subsequent amendments, legislative rejection is not an infallible indicator of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Andy\u2019s Ice Cream, Inc. v. City of Salisbury, </em>125 Md.App. 125, 154, 724 A.2d 717, 731 (1999). <em>See also, State v. Bell, </em>351 Md. 709, 721, 720 A.2d 311, 318 (1998). We have pointed out that this is because the General Assembly may well have concluded that the rejected amendment \u201cwarranted] further investigation\u201d before acting on it, <em>Automobile Trade Ass\u2019n v. Ins. Comm\u2019nr, </em>292 Md. 15, 24, 437 A.2d 199, 203 (1981), or decided not to enact the amendment for a myriad of other reasons. It may have felt that the entity was already covered by the Open Meetings Act and that a statute expressly so providing was superfluous. Thus, \u201cthe fact that a bill on a specific subject fails of passage in the General Assembly is a rather weak reed upon which to lean in ascertaining legislative intent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 24, 437 A.2d at 203, and we are not persuaded that the failure of the General Assembly to enact the above mentioned Bills is demonstrative of their intent that the BDC not be subject to the Open Meetings Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">In summary, the Legislature, as a matter of public policy, has determined that it is essential to the maintenance of a democratic society that, subject to certain well defined exceptions, the deliberations of a public body be open to the public which it serves. An entity that possesses as many public traits as does the BDC is a public body for the purposes of the Open Meetings Act. The table below represents a survey of the provisions of the Corporate Charter, the BDC contracts with the City, and the governing ordinance and is a powerful visual aid demonstrating the extent to which the BDC has been able to cloak the business of the Citizens of the City of Baltimore behind the veil of a supposedly private corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Purely Public Function Public and Private Function Purely Private Function</p>\n<p id=\"AVA\">Develop and implement long-range development strategies <em>for the City. </em>Coordinate development efforts between the public and private sector and <em>expedite the review of public approvals and other government services in the City.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Akn\">Undertake any appropriate activity to achieve the continued strong business climate, urban renewal, and development <em>throughout the City. </em>Provide in the furtherance of these declared purposes, financing, financial assistance, and financial advice, including but not limited to activities permitted under programs of the Small Business Administration and other economic development programs of the Federal, state, <em>or local governments.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqD\">Implement, oversee, and encourage public and private development and rehabilitation projects that <em>will increase the City\u2019s tax base. </em>Encourage cultural, entertainment, recreational, historic, and educational facilities that <em>will further the promotion of the benefits of living or visiting the City; to bring new spending power to the City\u2019s economy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ai78\">Enhance and improve the physical and cultural environment <em>of the City </em>through the creation of <em>public </em>open space, and <em>improved transportation systems. </em>Enhance and improve the image of the City as a place to live, work, and visit; and to encourage new residential initiatives in the City.</p>\n<p id=\"AOe\">Improve the economic health <em>of the City </em>through attraction of new businesses, retention of existing businesses, and the stimulation and encouragement of growth and expansion of commercial office uses, manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, research, and development.

The middle column indicates activities with both a public and a private connotation. As far as we have discerned, from the record before us, there are no purely private functions of the BDC for the purposes of the Open Meetings Act. As such, it is consistent with the intent of the Open Meetings Act that the deliberative process of the BDC, to include all deliberations preceding the final decisions made by the Mayor or the City Council, must be open to the public to the same extent as would any proceeding of the Mayor or City Council of Baltimore City. This is because every step of the process comprises the consideration or transaction of public business. Thus, consistent with the precedent established by the Court in the opinion written by then-Chief Judge Murphy in <em>New Carroll-ton, supra, </em>we have construed the statute so as to frustrate all evasive devices relating to any public matter upon which foreseeable public action will be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">C.

Thus, the dispositive issue is whether the BDC is an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d of Baltimore City.

Moreover, holding that the BDC is an instrumentality of the City is consistent with our interpretation of the General Assembly\u2019s intent when it enacted the MPIA: \u201c[I]t is well established that \u2018 \u201cthe provisions of the [MPIA] reflect the legislative intent that citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of their government.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Caffrey v.

Therefore, finding that the MPIA is applicable to the BDC is consistent with the stated purpose and the intent of the statute; the public should have broad access to information concerning the operation of governmental instrumentalities especially when the instrumentality\u2019s operations may involve charting the course and laying the foundation leading to the involuntary, albeit legal, taking of constitutionally protected private property even for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The ordinary and popular meaning of the plain language of the statute does not require that an entity be established by a statute for it to be subject to the provisions of the MPIA. The statute only requires that the entity be a \u201cunit or instrumentality\u201d of the City for its provisions to apply.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Instrumentality is defined as \u201cthe quality or state of being instrumental\u201d and instrumental is defined as \u201cserving as a means, agent, or tool.\u201d <em>Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>607 (10th ed.1998). Instrumentality is also defined as: \u201c1. A thing used to achieve an end or purpose. 2. A means or agency through which a function of another entity is accomplished, such as a branch of a governing body.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>814 (8th ed.2004). As the table above indicates, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the BDC was formed to plan and implement long range development strategies throughout the City of Baltimore in behalf of the City of Baltimore; to implement, oversee, and encourage development that will increase the City\u2019s tax base; to provide jobs in the City; to enhance and improve the physical and cultural environment of the City; to improve the economic health of the City; and to be responsible for Urban Renewal Plans, Planned Unit Developments, Industrial Retention Zones, and Free Enterprise Zones on behalf of the City. The BDC was clearly established, and is maintained, as an agent or tool of Baltimore City in order to accomplish the City\u2019s ends or purposes. Thus, the plain language of the statute, in its ordinary and popular meaning, makes the BDC, in essence, an instrumentality of the City and, therefore, the MPIA is applicable to the BDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Petitioner argues, in the alternative, that if we find ambiguity in \u00a7 10 \u2014 611(g)(1)(i), that <em>Moberly v. Herboldsheimer, </em>276 Md. 211, 345 A.2d 855 (1975) and <em>Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 464 A.2d 1068, require us to find that the determining factor in whether the BDC is subject to the MPIA is whether it was created by law. Although we perceive no ambiguity in \u00a7 10-611(g)(1)(i), we will address these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Petitioner misconstrues the holdings of <em>Moberly </em>and <em>Mezzanote. </em>There is no one factor we looked to in either of those cases to determine whether an entity is an instrumentality of the state. Instead, we examined all aspects of the relationship between the entity and the state or political subdivision. In <em>Moberly, </em>the Court was asked to determine whether a statutorily established corporation, known as the Board of Governors of the Memorial Hospital of Cumberland, was subject to the provisions of the MPIA. The <em>Moberly </em>Court found that a statutorily established corporation was subject to the MPIA based on all aspects of the interrelationship between it and the City of Cumberland. 276 Md. at 225, 345 A.2d at 862-63. In <em>Mezzanote, </em>the Court was asked to determine whether the statutorily created Maryland Insurance Guaranty (\u201cMIGA\u201d) was an instrumentality of the state for the purposes of the MPIA. The <em>Mezzanote </em>Court concluded that MIGA was sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ject to the provisions of MPIA only after: \u201c[EJxamining all aspects of the interrelationship between the State and MIGA, including the degree of control exercised by the State over MIGA\u2019s operation....\u201d 297 Md. at 39, 464 A.2d at 1074. Thus, the fact that the Memorial Hospital of Cumberland and MIGA were created by statute was <em>one factor, but not the only factor </em>in assessing the degree of control exercised by the State or political subdivision over that entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">With respect to the BDC, the following aspects of its relationship with the City make it an instrumentality of the City: The BDC\u2019s Board of Directors, to include the Chairman of the Board, are nominated or appointed by the Mayor of Baltimore; he has the power to remove members of the Board before their four year terms are up; the Mayor also has the power to fill vacancies; the City\u2019s Commissioner of the Department of Housing and Community Development and the City\u2019s Director of Finance are permanent members of the Board; the BDC receives a substantial portion of its budget from the City;<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the BDC has a tax exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code; pursuant to the City\u2019s contract with the BDC, if it should cease to exist, the City would control the disposition of the BDC\u2019s assets; BDC is also authorized to prepare and adopt Urban Renewal Plans, Planned Unit Developments, Industrial Retention Zones, and Free Enterprise Zones which are traditionally governmental functions.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>also note that the City Solicitor represented the BDC in this matter.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Thus, even though the BDC was not created by a legislative act, the factors listed above demonstrate that the BDC is subject to substantial control by the City because of how closely the two are intertwined. Therefore, even if the statute is ambiguous, which it is not, and the test applied in <em>Moberly </em>and <em>Mezzanote </em>was controlling \u2014 even under that test \u2014 the BDC is, in essence, an instrumentality of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">We hold that the trial court erred as a matter of law and that the City of Baltimore Development Corporation is, in essence, a public body for the purposes of the Open Meetings Act and that it is also an instrumentality of the City of Baltimore for the purposes of Maryland\u2019s Public Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE CIRCUIT COURT TO RENDER JUDGMENT CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

In the latter pages of Carmel Realty\u2019s brief, it urges us to declare that actions taken pursuant to the BDC\u2019s Board of Directors November 18, 2004 meeting are void because the BDC failed to comply with the relevant portions of the Open Meetings Act. We decline to do so because the issue is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">At the trial level, respondent asked the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to void the BDC\u2019s Board of Directors meeting on November 18, 2004, presumably under \u00a7 10-510(d)(4) of the Open Meetings Act. The trial court never addressed this issue because it granted the BDC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that the Open Meetings Act did not apply to the BDC. Carmel Realty placed the issue in the questions presented portion of its brief to the Court of Special Appeals and argued that the November 18, 2004 meeting should be voided. The intermediate appellate court, however, never addressed the issue in its unreported opinion. The precise issue of whether to void the meeting was not put directly before this Court in either the petition for writ of certiorari or the cross-petition for writ of certiorari. <em>See </em>Footnote 4, <em>supra. </em>We do note, however, that petitioner addresses it tangentially by urging us to remand issues that are not directly before us and that respondent urges us, in the latter pages of its brief, to void the meeting. In any event, the plain language of \u00a7 10-510(d)(4) prevents this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>from considering the issue because it has not been finally resolved at the trial level.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Section 10-510(d) provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">\"(d) <em>Authority of the court. </em>\u2014 A court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">\"(4) [I]f the court finds that a public body <em>willfully </em>failed to comply with \u00a7 10-505, \u00a7 10-506, \u00a7 10-507, or \u00a7 10-509(c) of this subtitle and that no other remedy is adequate, declare void the final action of the public body;....\" (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">Thus, under \u00a7 10-510(d)(4) of the Open Meetings Act, the decision of whether to void the action of a public body is <em>discretionary </em>upon a finding that the public body <em>\u201cwillfully </em>\" failed to comply with one of the relevant provisions of the Open Meetings Act. Generally, discretionary findings which are reviewed by this Court are done so to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Goodman v. Commercial Credit Corp., </em>364 Md. 483, 491-92, 773 A.2d 526, 532 (2001). As stated above, there was no finding by the trial court that, with respect to the November 18, 2004 meeting, the BDC <em>willfully </em>failed to comply with the relevant provisions of the Open Meetings Act. Thus, no discretion has been exercised by any court. The trial court's failure to address the issue resulted, not from an effort to avoid using its discretion, but instead, from its erroneous conclusion that the Open Meetings Act did not apply in the first instance. Thus, there is nothing on this issue for us to address in the posture of the case as it appears before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b336-12\">.
