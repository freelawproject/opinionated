Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>we must decide whether a defendant\u2019s guilty plea to burglary (count 13) of the multiple count indictment precludes expungement of the remaining charges, which were nol prossed by the State as part of a plea agreement. We hold that, consistent with the plain language of \u00a7 10-107, burglary and theft charges that stem from separate and distinct events, although the charges are contained within the same charging document, do not comprise a single unit for purposes of expungement. Charges arising, however, from the same incident, transaction, or set of facts as the count to which a criminal defendant pleads guilty comprise a single unit, and therefore may not be expunged. Thus, a guilty plea to one count of first degree burglary, contained within a multiple count charging document, does not preclude expungement of the other burglary and theft counts which were nol prossed, unless the other charges arise from the same incident, transaction, or set of facts to which the defendant pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">On November 12, 2005, at 2:15 a.m., a police officer working as security for the University Village Apartment Complex in Towson, Maryland, observed a man, later identified as Kevin Tremaine Stoddard (\u201cPetitioner\u201d), walking around inside apartment 2101, and then leaving the apartment by removing a window screen. The officer detained Petitioner, a Towson University student, and arrested him after learning that he did not have permission to be inside that apartment. After receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Petitioner admitted to entering apartment 2101 and confessed to a series of other burglaries as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Petitioner was charged with seven counts of first-degree burglary, two counts of fourth-degree burglary, seven counts of theft under $500, and one count of possession of drug paraphernalia. The State chose to consolidate all charges in a single, multiple-count indictment. All charges stemmed from Petitioner\u2019s involvement in a series of burglaries and related criminal offenses involving several individual apartments, located within the University Village Apartment Complex. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>crimes occurred over a period of more than two months. A summary of the counts are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">Counts 1 and 2: First degree burglary and theft under $500 involving 402 Campus View Dr., Apartment 2104 on October 9, 2004</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">Counts 3 and 4: First degree burglary and theft under $500 involving 402 Campus View Dr., Apartment 2310 on October 18 and 22, 2004</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">Counts 5 and 6: First degree burglary and theft under $500 involving 402 Campus View Dr., Apartment 2106 on October 18 and 22, 2004</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">Counts 7 and 8: First degree burglary and theft under $500 involving 412 Campus View Dr., Apartment 6102 on October 25, 2004</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\">Counts 9 and 10: First degree burglary and theft under $500 involving 402 Campus View Dr., Apartment 2211 on October 25, 2004</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\">Counts 11 and 12: First degree burglary and theft under $500 involving 402 Campus View Dr., Apartment 3308 on October 25, 2004</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-11\">Counts 13-15:First degree burglary, theft under $500, and possession of paraphernalia involving 402 Campus View Dr., Apartment 2101 on November 12, 2004</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-14\">Count 16: Fourth degree burglary involving 402 Campus View Dr., Apartment 2204 on November 4, 2004</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-16\">Count 17: Fourth degree burglary involving 402 Campus View Dr., Apartment 2204 on September 4, 2004</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-18\">On April 4, 2005, pursuant to a plea agreement, Petitioner pled guilty to count 13, charging first-degree burglary, in exchange for the State entering a nolle prosequi as to the remaining 16 counts. Counts 13-15 arose from the same incident, transaction, and set of facts. Those crimes allegedly occurred on November 12, 2004, and involved the burglary and theft of personal property from apartment 2101. The theft of personal property gave rise to the charge of possession of paraphernalia. The burglaries listed in the remaining counts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>which were nol prossed, all took place on different days and in different apartment units than did the burglary in count 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">On June 8, 2005, Petitioner was sentenced to four-years imprisonment with all but 90 days suspended and the last 30 days to be served on home detention. He also was placed on two-years probation, effective upon release, and was ordered to pay restitution to each of the burglary victims. In addition, Petitioner was ordered to abstain from alcohol, illegal drugs and abuse of prescription drugs, submit to random urinalysis, and to seek alcohol and drug treatment. The court also ordered that Petitioner have no contact with the victims, their property, or the University Village Apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">On September 1, 2005, Petitioner filed a Motion for Modification of Sentence, in which he requested that the trial court strike its judgment of guilty and enter probation before judgment. Subsequently, on October 24, 2005, Petitioner filed a Petition for Expungement, requesting that the court expunge counts 1-12 and 14-17. In his Petition for Expungement, Petitioner certified that he had not been convicted of any crime, other than a minor traffic violation, since the State nol prossed counts 1-12 and 14-17. On October 25, 2005, the State filed an Answer to the Motion for Modification of Sentence, requesting that Petitioner\u2019s motion be denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 9, 2005, the State filed an Answer to the Petition for Expungement.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The Circuit Court held a hearing on January 19, 2006. At that hearing, Petitioner conceded that counts 13-15 all arose from the same incident and that, because he pled guilty to count 13, counts 14 and 15 could not be expunged. The State argued that because all 17 of the counts constituted a single unit, Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea to count 13 prevented all of the counts from being expunged. The Circuit Court denied the Petition for Expungement. Petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 7, 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>while the case was pending in the intermediate appellate court, this Court issued a writ of certiorari on its own motion. <em>Stoddard v. State, </em>393 Md. 242, 900 A.2d 749 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The parties dispute whether, under \u00a7 10-107 of the Criminal Procedure Article, all of Petitioner\u2019s charges, when consolidated within a single charging document, constitute a unit, such that Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea to count 13 precludes the expungement of any of the remaining counts. Notably, because Petitioner pled guilty to count 13, that count cannot be expunged, and that issue is therefore not before this Court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-105(a) (limiting expungement for charges that resulted in a finding of guilt to a person who has been granted a full and unconditional pardon by the Governor and who was convicted of only one criminal act that was not a crime of violence). The expungement of counts 14 and 15 is also not at issue in this case because Petitioner conceded that because those counts arise out of the same incident as count 13 they all constitute a unit, preventing their expungement. Aside from this concession, Petitioner contends that the remaining counts do not constitute a single unit because the other burglaries are separate and distinct units. The State contends, however, that because all of the burglaries occurred in a limited time frame, in only two apartment buildings, all for the purpose of supporting Petitioner\u2019s drug habit, they constitute a unit within the meaning of \u00a7 10-107. This issue is therefore a matter of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Statutory Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"Ayr\">We recently summarized the rules of statutory interpretation in <em>Walzer v.

Laws, Chap. 260; <em>See also In the Matter of the Expungement of Records of Diane M., </em>317 Md. 652, 653, 566 A.2d 108 (1989). In the context of the statute, \u201c \u2018[ejxpungement\u2019 with respect to a court record or police record\u201d means \u201cremoval from public inspection.\u201d \u00a7 10-101(e). This removal can be achieved in one of three ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-12\">(1) by obliteration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>(2) by removal to a separate secure area to which persons who do not have a legitimate reason for access are denied access; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">(3) if access to a court record or police record can be obtained only by reference to another court record or police record, by the expungement of it or the part of it that provides access.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-6\"><em>Id. </em>One of the General Assembly\u2019s purposes in providing for an expungement procedure was to help protect individuals seeking employment or admission to an educational institution, by entitling them to expungement of unproven charges, so that those individuals could avoid being unfairly judged during their application processes. \u00a7 10-109.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To further this purpose, the General Assembly expressly prohibited potential employers and academic institutions from requiring applicants to disclose information about expunged criminal charges, sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>jeet to a heavy penalty for violation. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Section 10-105 provides the authority for expungement of criminal records, and outlines the situations in which a criminal defendant may petition for such expungement. Section 10-105, entitled \u201cExpungement of record after charge is filed,\u201d states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">(a) Petition for expungement.- \u2014 -A person who has been charged with the commission of a crime, including a violation of the Transportation Article for which a term of imprisonment may be imposed, may file a petition listing relevant facts for expungement of a police record, court record, or other record maintained by the State or a political subdivision of the State if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">(1) the person is acquitted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">(2) the charge is otherwise dismissed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">(3) a probation before judgment is entered, unless the person is charged with a violation of \u00a7 21-902 of the Transportation Article or Title 2, Subtitle 5 or \u00a7 3-211 of the Criminal Law Article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">(4) <em>a nolle prosequi or nolle prosequi with the requirement of drug or alcohol treatment is entered;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">(5) the court indefinitely postpones trial of a criminal charge by marking the criminal charge \u201cstet\u201d or stet with the requirement of drug or alcohol abuse treatment on the docket;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-12\">(6) the case is compromised under \u00a7 3-207 of the Criminal Law Article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-13\">(7) the charge was transferred to the juvenile court under \u00a7 4-202 of this article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-14\">(8) the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>(i) is convicted of only one criminal act, and that act is not a crime of violence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">(ii) is granted a full and unconditional pardon by the Governor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">Most relevant to our analysis in this case is \u00a7 10-107, entitled \u201cCharges arising from same incident, transaction, or set of facts,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">(a) Multiple charges as unit.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-11\">(1) In this subtitle, <em>if two or more charges, </em>other than one for a minor traffic violation, <em>arise from the same incident, transaction, or set of facts, they are considered to be a unit.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-12\">(2) A charge for a minor traffic violation that arises from the same incident, transaction, or set of facts as a charge in the unit is not a part of the unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-13\">(b) Effect on right to expungement.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-14\">(1) <em>If a person is not entitled to expungement of one charge in a unit, the person is not entitled to expungement of any other charge in the unit.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-15\">(2) The disposition of a charge for a minor traffic violation that arises from the same incident, transaction, or set of facts as a charge in the unit does not affect any right to expungement of a charge in the unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-16\">(Emphasis added.) To resolve the issue now before us, we must discern the General Assembly\u2019s meaning of the word \u201cunit,\u201d as used in \u00a7 10-107(a)(l), at the time that it enacted this statute. Specifically, we must determine whether several burglaries, committed on various days, in several apartments, against different victims, constitute a single unit within the contemplation of \u00a7 10-107, such that a guilty plea to one charge would preclude the expungement of the other charges under \u00a7 10-107(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-17\">The State\u2019s main argument rests on the premise that if Petitioner\u2019s burglary charges arise from the same incident, transaction, or set of facts, or were part of a continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>scheme, his guilty plea to count 13 precludes expungement of the rest of the charges because the charges then constitute one unit. The State first contends that the General Assembly\u2019s \u201cexpungement scheme\u201d was not designed to expunge charges that were consolidated with, or related to, the charge on which a guilty finding was made. According to the State, the term \u201cunit\u201d must be read broadly so that when a person is found guilty of one charge, he or she is not entitled to have expunged other charges that are consolidated with the charge on which he or she was found guilty. The State avers that the plain language of \u00a7 10-107 \u201ccompels the conclusion that if a petitioner is found guilty of one charge, and then seeks expungement of the other consolidated charges which have been dismissed, he is not entitled to expungement.\u201d The State finds additional support for this argument in the language of Maryland Rule 4-203(a), which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">Two or more offenses, whether felonies or misdemeanors or any combination thereof, may be charged in separate counts of the same charging document if the offenses charged are of the same or similar character or are based on the same act or transaction or on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The State also cites to <em>Cooksey v. State, </em>359 Md. 1, 752 A.2d 606 (2000), for the proposition that this Court recognized that a transaction is not limited to a single act, but may be in the nature of a continuing transaction involving more than one act. The State argues that we should therefore read the language of \u00a7 10-107 to preclude expungement when charges are part of a continuing scheme, in addition to when they constitute a single unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Petitioner contends that the face of the charging document demonstrates clearly that the crimes charged do not all stem from the same incident, transaction, or set of facts, but rather that each burglary constituted a separate unit within the contemplation of \u00a7 10-107. Petitioner argues that grouping charges in one indictment, in and of itself, does not mean that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the crimes charged amount to one unit. Further, Petitioner asserts that \u201ccontinuing scheme\u201d does not have the same meaning as \u201csame incident, transaction, or set of facts,\u201d and that \u00a7 10-107 does not preclude expungement of counts, to which a nolle prosequi has been entered, that are part of a continuing scheme. Petitioner concedes, for purposes of analysis of the issue, that the burglaries could possibly be considered a part of a continuing scheme. Petitioner asserts, however, that the Legislature did not use the phrase \u201ccontinuing scheme\u201d in enacting \u00a7 10-107, and that Maryland Rule 4-203 used disjunctively the phrases \u201csame act or transaction\u201d and \u201ctransactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan,\u201d demonstrating that the two phrases have different meanings. According to Petitioner, Rule 4-203(a)\u2019s use of the disjunctive also demonstrates that the State\u2019s decision to list all of the charges in the same indictment does not mean that all of the charges are part of one unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">To address these contentions, we begin our analysis with the language of \u00a7 10-107 to discern the Legislature\u2019s meaning of the word \u201cunit.\u201d <em>See Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 571-572. 911 A.2d. at 431-432 (citing <em>State Dept. of Assessments and Taxation, </em>348 Md. at 13, 702 A.2d at 696; <em>Montgomery County, </em>333 Md. at 523, 636 A.2d at 452). Section 10-107 states expressly that \u201cif two or more charges ... arise from the same incident, transaction, or set of facts, they are considered to be a unit.\u201d In examining the facts of this case, we reject the proposition that Petitioner\u2019s alleged burglaries, committed over a period of more than two months, and involving different apartments, constituted a single unit. In our view, each alleged burglary constituted a separate incident, transaction, and involved a different set of facts. In this respect, it is the Legislature\u2019s use of the words \u201cincident,\u201d \u201ctransaction,\u201d and the phrase \u201cset of facts,\u201d that are dispositive in our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">When interpreting a statute, the \u201cordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.\u201d <em>Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 572, 911 A.2d. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>432 (citations omitted). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cincident\u201d as \u201c[a] discrete occurrence or happening,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 777 (8th ed.1999), and \u201cdiscrete\u201d as \u201c[individual; separate; distinct.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 499 (8th ed.1999). By reading these two definitions together, it becomes clear that the General Assembly included the word \u201cdiscrete\u201d in its definition of \u201cincident\u201d because it intended an \u201cincident\u201d to be something that occurred at a specific point in time and not something that transpired over a period of time or lasted indefinitely. Each of Petitioner\u2019s alleged burglaries occurred at a specific point in time; each occurred on a single date. Moreover, those nine burglaries, as a whole, did not occur at a specific point in time; they occurred over a period of time lasting for more than two months. We therefore hold that the nine burglaries charged do not represent a single incident, within the clear meaning of \u00a7 10-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The meaning of the word \u201ctransaction\u201d is also unambiguous. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201ctransaction\u201d as either \u201c[t]he act or an instance of conducting business or other dealings ...,\u201d or \u201c[sjomething performed or carried out.... \u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1535 (8th ed.1999). Within the contemplation of this definition, we conclude that each of the alleged burglaries also represents a separate transaction. For each burglary, Petitioner performed a separate action and carried out a separate plan. There exists nothing in the record to suggest that Petitioner\u2019s plan was to burglarize the eight apartments over the course of two months on those specific dates, such that each burglary would represent a step within a single ongoing transaction. Instead, the burglaries each had a specific start time and end time and therefore represent individual transactions. We find guidance for this conclusion in our prior case law as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In <em>Cooksey, </em>359 Md. at 11, 752 A.2d at 611, we discussed that \u201ccriminal acts may combine to create one separately punishable offense ... when the acts are committed as part of a single incident or transaction.\u201d There, we stated that what was dispositive for the \u201c \u2018single transaction\u2019 theory\u201d was whether the offenses contained in the same charge were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>committed <em>\u201cat the same time, \u201d Id. </em>(discussing <em>State v. Warren, </em>77 Md. 121, 26 A. 500 (1893)), and therefore it did not matter that the theft involved the taking of several articles of property or that the crimes were committed against many different victims. In the present case, however, Petitioner acted alone and therefore could not have committed a burglary in more than one apartment at the same time. Because Petitioner is charged with committing each burglary at a different time, the burglaries do not constitute a single incident or transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Lastly, each burglary contained a different set of alleged facts. For example, in counts 1 and 2, Petitioner burglarized apartment 2104 on October 9, 2004, and stole a baggie of marijuana from Claire Hammond at that location. In counts 3 and 4, however, Petitioner burglarized apartment 2310 and stole money from Stephanie Yanke at that residence on October 18 and 22, 2004. In counts 9 and 10, Petitioner burglarized apartment 2211 on October 25, 2004, and, from that apartment, stole Ritalin pills from Claire Steinbraker. In counts 13-15, Petitioner burglarized apartment 2101 on November 12, 2004, and stole a glass pipe from Sherri Magaraci. While the State suggests that Petitioner may have committed all of the burglaries for the same purpose, to support his drug habit, the language of \u00a7 10-107 does not contain the word \u201cpurpose;\u201d it contains the phrase, \u201cset of facts.\u201d None of the burglaries had the same set of facts. While Petitioner allegedly visited some of the apartments more than once over the two-month period, and allegedly visited more than one apartment on certain dates, the facts as alleged differed, at least to some degree, for each burglary. Petitioner allegedly committed nine separate burglaries at eight different apartments on seven different days, over a period of time lasting more than two months. We therefore conclude that the burglaries contained different sets of facts. Because each of the burglaries charged in counts 1-12 and 16-17 constitutes an incident that was separate from that in counts 13-15, we hold that they did not comprise a single unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The State asserts that the Legislature intended to include continuous crimes in \u00a7 10-107, when it stated that if a person is not entitled to expungement of one charge in a unit, he or she is not entitled to expungement of any other charge in the unit. We conclude, however, that the Legislature clearly articulated, in \u00a7 10-107, that a unit consists only of charges that arise out of the same incident, transaction, or set of facts. We therefore reject the State\u2019s claim that the Legislature intended for a continuing scheme to also constitute a unit for purposes of expungement because nowhere in that provision does the Legislature mention the phrase \u201ccontinuing scheme\u201d or use any language to imply such a meaning. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201ccontinuing\u201d as \u201c[ujninterrupted; persisting.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 339 (8th ed.1999). If the Legislature intended to limit expungement of charges in cases where the charges were part of a continuing scheme, then it certainly could have included such language. Instead, it included language to the contrary, because, as explained above, an \u201cincident\u201d means a separate, distinct occurrence. The Legislature even chose to title \u00a7 10-107 \u201cCharges arising from the same incident, transaction, or set of facts,\u201d which provides additional support for this conclusion. \u201c \u2018We cannot assume authority to read into the [Statute] what the Legislature apparently deliberately left out. Judicial construction should only be resorted to when an ambiguity exists. Therefore, the strongly preferred norm of statutory interpretation is to effectuate the plain language of the statutory text.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chow, </em>393 Md. at 444, 903 A.2d at 395 (citations omitted). Because the Legislature spoke of a unit only as charges arising from the same incident, transaction, or set of facts and made no mention of a continuous scheme, we will not read such an assumption into the language of the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>The language of \u00a7 10-107 is clear and its meaning unambiguous, such that we need not, and should not, look beyond that provision. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. at 261, 647 A.2d at 1206-07. Nonetheless, we will address the parties\u2019 contentions that Maryland Rule 4-203(a) provides support for their views. Maryland Rule 4-203(a) provides guidance for the State as to the manner in which offenses should be joined in a charging document. That Rule provides that the State can choose to charge two or more offenses in separate counts of the same charging document \u201cif the offenses charged are of the same or similar character or are based on the same act or transaction or on two or more acts or transactions connected together <em>or </em>constituting parts of a common scheme or plan\u201d (emphasis added). We again agree with Petitioner and conclude that Maryland Rule 4-203(a) is written in the disjunctive, and therefore distinguishes between charges arising out of the same act or transaction and charges that are part of a continuing scheme. We do not agree with the State that the language of Rule 4-203(a) somehow demonstrates that the Legislature intended for a unit and continuing scheme to be synonymous or to suggest that because of this Rule, we must construe broadly the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cunit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The State argues that Petitioner does not, and cannot, contend that the charges against him were not properly joined into a single charging document. The State contends that the burglaries were properly consolidated and that they also constituted a unit that arose from the same incident, transaction, or set of facts. To support this contention, the State asserts that all of the burglaries occurred within two months, in only two apartment buildings, that Petitioner took from each burglarized apartment either drugs, drug paraphernalia or money to support his drug addition, and that he confessed to the burglaries. We reject this contention because Maryland Rule 4-203(a) provides that the State may list all of the counts in one indictment if the counts were \u201cof the same or similar character.\u201d Permission to consolidate offenses of the same or similar character does not necessarily satisfy the definition of \u201cunit\u201d for purposes of expungement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>We also are not persuaded by the State\u2019s argument that Maryland Rule 4-203(a) provides the State with the authority to determine whether the charges comprise a unit, simply based on how the State chooses to organize the charges-together in one indictment, or separately. Petitioner asserts that if we read \u00a7 10-107 to mean that all charges contained in one indictment constitute one unit, then we would be allowing the State to affect whether a defendant would be entitled to an expungement simply by changing the grouping of counts, and charging under one indictment when it would be just as permissible to charge under more than one charging document. Petitioner contends that giving the State such power would abrogate the principles of \u00a7 10-107 and Maryland Rule 4-203(a) and would usurp the legislative power. We agree with Petitioner on this point. Whether the State should have consolidated all of the charges in one indictment is neither an issue before this Court nor is it relevant to our analysis. Whether the State chose to list the charges separately or consolidate them in one indictment does not change our analysis. If the charges do not comprise a unit, then a guilty plea to one count does not preclude expungement of the other counts, regardless of how the State chose to organize the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">In addition, the State argues that because we recognized in <em>Cooksey, </em>359 Md. 1, 752 A.2d 606, that a transaction is not limited to a single act, but may be in the nature of a continuing transaction involving more than one act, we should read the language of \u00a7 10-107 to preclude expungement when charges are part of a continuing scheme. As we already mentioned, the principles of statutory interpretation direct us to end our inquiry with the clear language of the statute when the statute is not ambiguous. <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. MVA, </em>346 Md. 437, 445, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997). In any event, this case is distinguishable from <em>Cooksey </em>for three reasons. Thus, <em>Cooksey </em>is not dispositive to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">First, <em>Cooksey </em>dealt specifically with sexual child abuse and other related sexual offenses, not burglary offenses. Second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number><em>Cooksey </em>did not involve the criminal expungement law. Furthermore, <em>Cooksey </em>focused on whether the State could bundle a number of single-act offenses into the same <em>count. </em>To the contrary, this case hinges on whether the State\u2019s inclusion of numerous burglary and theft counts in one <em>indictment, </em>means that a guilty plea to one count precludes expungement of the other counts. The State did not try to bundle all of the burglary and theft charges and the one possession of paraphernalia charge into one count; the State separated each of Petitioner\u2019s alleged offenses into individual counts. <em>Cooksey </em>neither addressed nor resolved the problem at issue in this case. We therefore reject the State\u2019s argument that <em>Cooksey </em>provides guidance to us on this point because it does not discuss whether numerous counts of burglary could constitute a single transaction and did not involve expungement of charges from a criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Lastly, the State suggests that because Petitioner pled guilty to count 13, his record has already been marred by a criminal conviction for purposes of employment and applying for admission to academic institutions, so that he no longer needs to have the remaining 14 counts expunged. On these grounds, the State contends that the purpose of \u00a7 10-109 is rendered nugatory by Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea to count 13. We do not agree. While Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea to count 13 may have already \u201cmarred\u201d his record, we do not believe that the purpose of \u00a7 10-105, \u00a7 10-107, or \u00a7 10-109 is as the State suggests. Nowhere in the context of these provisions does the Legislature provide that once an individual has a criminal record, he is no longer entitled to have expunged any other criminal charges because his record is \u201cmarred\u201d for purposes of employment or applying for admission to an educational institution. Instead, the clear language of \u00a7 10-107 demonstrates that Petitioner is still entitled to have expunged the remaining 14 counts, from his record, so that those additional charges will not affect negatively his job search or application for admission to an educational institution in the future. It is obvious that a record with 17 criminal counts will be more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>detrimental to a person\u2019s job search or application to an academic institution than a record with 3 criminal counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We conclude that the Circuit Court was incorrect to reject Petitioner\u2019s request for expungement of counts 1-12 and 16-17 and was correct to reject Petitioner\u2019s request for expungement of counts 14 and 15. Because the burglary charges were separate incidents, transactions, or involved different facts, they constitute nine separate units. Based on the plain language of \u00a7 10-107, it is clear that the General Assembly intended that a unit be comprised only of charges that arise from the same incident, transaction, or set of facts, and not a continuous scheme. When the charges do not comprise a single unit, a guilty plea to one of the counts precludes expungement only of those counts contained in the same unit, and does not preclude expungement of the counts contained in any other units.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.
