These decisions are instructive in that they delineate general analytical contours for determining whether a governmental action concerning a type of land use decision amounts to a \u201czoning action\u201d and thus is eligible for judicial review in accordance with Title 7, Chapter 200 of the Maryland Rules. These precedents, however, leave some portion of <em>tabula rasa </em>open on the narrow question presented by this case, given the somewhat unique character of zoning processes in Baltimore City and the particular facts of the controversy before us. We must decide here whether an amendment of a previously approved planned unit development (\u201cPUD\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> granted to Canton Crossing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>LLC, by the Mayor and City Council, via City Ordinance 04-873, amounted to a \u201czoning action\u201d under Md.Code, Art. 66B, \u00a7 2.09(a)(1)(h), thus bestowing upon the Circuit Court for Baltimore City jurisdiction to consider on their merits neighboring landowners\u2019 petitions for judicial review of that amendment approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The operative facts in this case are largely undisputed. On 21 June 2001, the City Council passed, and the Mayor signed into law, Ordinance 01-192 granting Appellee, Canton Crossing, LLC, <em>inter alia, </em>an industrial PUD and approving a development plan for a 67 and one-half acre<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> parcel of land in the Canton area of Baltimore City. The property previously was placed solely within a Euclidian<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 3 Industrial District, which is \u201cdesigned for industrial, manufacturing, and related activities generally known and described as \u2018heavy industry.\u2019 \u201d Baltimore, Md., Zoning Code \u00a7 7-401. A PUD was necessary to accommodate the various residential and commercial uses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>not permitted ordinarily in the M-3 zone, proposed in Canton Crossing\u2019s development plan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The PUD, thereafter, was amended by City ordinances on three subsequent occasions as a result of changes in the development plan initiated by Canton Crossing. The first amendment occurred on 1 July 2002, via Ordinance 02-369, permitting Canton Crossing to \u201cincrease parking and square footage use on each parcel [designated for development within the 67 acres encompassed by the development plan], to increase the size of the proposed hotel, and to change the location of certain proposed structures.\u201d The second amendment, approved on 22 December 2003 by Ordinance 03-641, allowed an \u201cincrease [in] the number of hotel rooms permitted, to change the location of certain proposed structures, and to modify the uses permitted and off-street parking requirements.\u201d The last amendment, the one at issue in this case, approved by Ordinance 04-873 on 2 December 2004, authorized an \u201cincrease [in] the number of residential dwelling units permitted and [a] modif[ieation] [of] the uses and buildings permitted and their locations and size.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">It was upon the approval of this last amendment that Appellant here, Maryland Overpak Corporation, filed on 28 December 2004 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City its petition for judicial review. The petition alleged that Maryland Overpak was aggrieved by the PUD amendment approval because it interfered with Appellant\u2019s leasehold interest in and use of Danville Avenue as a staging area for its operations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Within two weeks of Maryland Overpak filing its petition, two other landowners adjoining the PUD, South Highland Avenue LLC and Canton Railroad Company, joined Appellant in praying for judicial review of Ordinance 04-873. Neither of these latter entities, however, are parties to the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Maryland Overpak and the other abutting land owners believed that the City\u2019s action in approving the amendment to the PUD encroached on their interest in the roadway. Specifically, Maryland Overpak and South Highland Avenue LLC each pled in their one paragraph petitions that they maintain a leasehold interest in Danville Avenue as well as in property abutting the PUD which would be adversely affected by the approved PUD. Canton Railroad Company, for its part, averred in its petition that it \u201cowns and operates\u201d Danville Avenue and that the ordinance constituted a violation of the Railroad\u2019s procedural and substantive due process rights, as well as interstate commerce clause principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The City Council filed a Motion to Dismiss Appeal and Request for Hearing, which was joined by Canton Crossing, LLC. Both argued that judicial review of the latest amendment to the PUD, under Art. 66B, \u00a7 2.09, was not proper and that the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction over the case. After a hearing on the motion, the Circuit Court dismissed the petitions on 16 March 2005. The motions judge relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>MBC Realty </em>in reasoning that the PUD granted to Canton Crossing did not qualify as a \u201czoning action\u201d under Art. 66B, \u00a7 2.09(a)(1)(ii) because it did not amount to a reclassification of the zoning district of the subject property. Maryland Overpak filed a timely appeal in the Court of Special Appeals. We, acting on our initiative, issued a <em>writ of certiorari </em>before the intermediate appellate court could consider the matter. 389 Md. 398, 885 A.2d 823 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Baltimore City is governed by a unique procedure and body of law in many respects regarding its zoning procedures. The potential for uniqueness is facilitated not merely because of the statutory grant under Art. 66B, <em>Boitnott v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>356 Md. 226, 238-39, 738 A.2d 881, 888 (1999) (\u201c[A]rt. 66B, \u00a7 2.01(a) provides the general authority for the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore to adopt zoning regulations as necessary .... \u201d), but also because of the general principle that zoning is an exercise of governmental authority that generally falls squarely within the province of the political subdivisions of the State. <em>Superior Outdoor Signs, Inc. v. Eller Media Co., </em>150 Md.App. 479, 494, 822 A.2d 478, 506 (2003) (citing Art. 23A, \u00a7 2(b)(36)(ii)) (\u201cIt is fundamental that zoning concerns the regulation of land use; and it is the policy of this State that such regulation will occur at the local level.\u201d); <em>see also Mayor &amp; Council of Rockville v. Rylyns Enters., Inc., </em>372 Md. 514, 542, 814 A.2d 469, 486 (2002).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Each jurisdiction in the State owes its zoning authority to delegations found in various provisions of the Maryland Code. We observed in <em>Rylyns </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>[tjracing the entire panoply of related enabling statutes in Maryland is a tad complex. The provisions empowering municipal corporations in Maryland are contained in Maryland Code (1957, 1998 RepLVol.), Article 23A, and with regard to home rule powers specifically, Art. 23A, \u00a7 9. Similar provisions detailing the powers for non-charter counties are found in Maryland Code (1957, 1998 RepLVol., 2002 Supp.), Article 25. Further complicating the matter, the authority of the counties of Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s are controlled by Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl. Vol., 2002 Supp.), Article 28. The land use provisions of Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.), Article 66B pertain primarily to Art. 23A municipalities and Art. 25 non-charter counties, although certain provisions apply to Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Art. 25A charter counties, as well as to Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties, Art. 66B, \u00a7\u00a7 1.02 and 7.03, and also to the City of Baltimore, Art. 66B, \u00a7\u00a7 2.01-2.13 and 14.02.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">372 Md. at 528, 814 A.2d at 476-77. Of course, in this case we are concerned only with Article 66B, which provides for judicial review of \u201czoning actions\u201d taken by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore. Md.Code, Art. 66B, \u00a7 2.09(a)(1)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Baltimore City, in Title 9 of the Baltimore City Zoning Code, has developed a scheme for evaluating, approving, and administering PUDs. The process of obtaining a PUD is initiated by a mandatory conference between the developer and the Planning Commission to discuss the scope and nature of the PUD. Baltimore, Md., Zoning Code \u00a7 9-105(a). The developer is required to create a detailed development plan, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9-105(b), which must include, at a minimum: a map indicating accurate boundary lines and the project area in relation to surrounding properties; the placement of roadways and parking facilities; the use, size, and location of existing and proposed buildings and landscaping; architectural drawings of proposed structures; the location of existing and proposed sewer and water facilities; the existing storm drain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>age pattern along with proposed drainage system; the location of recreation and open spaces; statistical data on size, density, and proposed number of residential units; a copy of property owners\u2019 association documents and protective covenants; and a detailed time schedule for start and completion of the PUD. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-107. The application is then submitted to the Council in the form of a proposed ordinance (a bill, in legislative vernacular) for approval of the development plan. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Once a bill proposing a PUD has been submitted to the Council, it must be reviewed by the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals, the Planning Commission, and any other agencies deemed relevant by the President of the City Council. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 9-111, 16-301. These reviewing entities apply a multitude of governing standards that essentially ensure that the proposed PUD will conform with the surrounding area in terms of contemplated development; topography; value of surrounding areas; availability of light, air, open space, and street access; and risks of public and health hazards. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-112. If the Council is satisfied with the development plan and reports from the reviewing agencies, it may approve the PUD in the form of an ordinance. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-113. Upon approval, the approved PUD is designated on official zoning maps \u201cfor informational and reference purposes\u201d and a copy of the development plan is kept on file by the Zoning Administrator. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-116. Frequently, the approval expressed in the ordinance contains conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The PUD designation, acting as an overlay for a specific parcel or assemblage of properties, is placed on top of the underlying zone or zones, in the present case a Euclidian zone. The underlying zone remains and is retained on the official Zoning Map for the City even after the PUD is approved. With the exception of minor changes to the interior features of buildings and the time schedule of completing the PUD, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9-118(c), (d), amendments to an approved PUD are achieved only through an application process as in the case of a new PUD application. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-118(a). Because the development plan and its authorizing ordinance serve as a binding agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>ment between the developer and the City for the development of the affected property, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9-117, deviation from that plan or the requirements of Title 9 may result in revocation of the PUD.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-119(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">There exist additional standards for Industrial PUDs, such as the one at issue <em>sub judice. </em>The first set of standards concern the effects of: noise; vibration; smoke and particulate matter; toxic matter; odorous matter; and glare. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 9-216; 12-102. There are also additional sections of Title 9 governing the permissible uses and acreage required for Industrial PUDs. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-501 <em>et seq. </em>Notably, an Industrial PUD may carry out the uses permitted in the underlying zoning district, as well as whatever conditional uses that are designated for that district as specified in the development plan. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-502. The provisions of Title 3, which set out the generally applicable zoning rules for use and bulk, also govern Industrial PUDs. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Just as Baltimore City has a distinct scheme for PUDs, it so too has one for conditional uses,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> a concept that deserves a proper introduction. The conditional use, which is not to be confused with conditional zoning, <em>see Rylyns, </em>372 Md. 514, 541 n. 16, 814 A.2d 469, 485 n. 16, is a zoning mechanism which provides a greater degree of flexibility to land owners and developers who wish to utilize their property in ways that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>ordinarily and inherently would conflict with the zoning district in which their property is placed. <em>See Rylyns, </em>372 Md. at 541-43, 814 A.2d at 485-86. The universe of allowable conditional uses for a given zoning district is designated by the legislative body at the time it establishes in the text of the zoning regulations the various zoning classifications and uses permitted in that zoning district. <em>Rylyns, </em>372 Md. at 541, 814 A.2d at 485. If a land owner wishes to establish a conditional use he, she, or it must petition the relevant local governmental body, which, in turn, makes a determination of the acceptability of the proposed use, weighing, among other things, its putative unique adverse effects on the surrounding community and zoning district. <em>Mossburg v. Montgomery County, </em>107 Md.App. 1, 5-6, 666 A.2d 1253, 1257 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The regulations governing the consideration of conditional uses in Baltimore City is found in Title 14 of the Baltimore City Zoning Code. The Zoning Code provides that the Mayor and City Council may approve a request for a conditional use by ordinance and, additionally, may impose conditions on its approval. \u00a7\u00a7 14-102, 103. Bills that would create conditional uses by ordinance must satisfy the requirements of Title 16. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 14-208; 16-101(b)(2). These requirements mandate that the conditional use applicant present to the City Council and the public a statement of intent with respect to the property, which must be posted on the property in question in a specified manner and for a specified time. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 16-202, 203. The bill is then referred to the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals and the Planning Commission and also may be referred to other relevant agencies. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 16-301. Following a bill\u2019s second reading, it is subject to a public hearing before the committee to which the bill was originally referred with 15 days prior notice thereof. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 16-401, 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The intersecting standards and characteristics of conditional uses and PUDs in the Baltimore City zoning regulations informs the conclusion that, by analogy, a PUD partakes more of the characteristics of a conditional use than any other zoning construct or mechanism recognized in Baltimore City. One particularly telling similarity is that PUDs in the City are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>first evaluated under the very same \u201cgoverning standards\u201d applied to conditional uses. Only after that are additional criteria considered. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-112(a). Also, the zoning regulations state that changes to a PUD seeking a use that is designated already by regulation as a possible conditional use for the underlying zoning district does not require a new application, but are reviewed under a more deferential process. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-118(b). A similar provision elsewhere in Title 9 of the zoning regulations provides that an Industrial PUD may carry out the uses permitted in the underlying industrial district classification, as well as whatever conditional uses are designated for that district. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-502. Although the Baltimore City zoning regulations undeniably set PUDs and conditional uses apart as distinct branches of the land use array, <em>see id. </em>tits. 9, 14, the regulations consistently employ the conditional use as a means of both understanding and administering the PUD.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Also, as we have discussed previously, PUD proposals arise as a result of an individual owner or developer petitioning the City to provide for uses not yet permitted \u201cas of right\u201d in the underlying district. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-105. The hallmarks examined for their approval generally are compatibility with a Master Plan, conformance to regulatory criteria, and an examination of potential deleterious effects vis-a-vis adjacent property and uses. Proposed conditional uses call for a similar analysis, but are designated by the text of the zoning regulations, and require an individual to seek permission to use his or her parcel in accord with a particular conditional use. <em>Rylyns, </em>372 Md. at 541, 814 A.2d at 485. A PUD allows for additional uses on a property not provided for by the permitted or conditional uses designated in that underlying district, but which are adjudged, on a case-by-case basis, not to be incompatible or deleterious at a given location and within the contemplation generally of the applicable Master Plan (or other planning document) and the general purposes of the underlying zone, much like a conditional use.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Implicit in the grant of authority to jurisdictions in the State to adopt their own particular zoning regulations consistent with that statutory grant is the reality that each jurisdiction likely will vary, to some degree, one from another, in its zoning regulations. Nonetheless, no matter how a local regulation is couched, an act constituting a \u201czoning action\u201d for those jurisdictions governed by Art. 66B is subject to judicial review. Until the Court of Special Appeals filed its recent opinion in <em>Armstrong III, </em>the prevailing rule was that <em>only </em>zoning reclassifications constituted \u201czoning actions\u201d under \u00a7 2.09(a)(1)(ii). <em>Compare Armstrong III, </em>169 Md.App. at 674, 677-78, 906 A.2d at 426, 428 (\u201c[T]he final question before reaching a conclusion, is whether \u2018zoning action\u2019 is limited to reclassifications. We conclude it is not ____\u201d), <em>with MBC Realty, </em>160 Md.App. at 387, 389, 864 A.2d at 224, 225 (including reclassifications within \u201czoning action,\u201d but excluding comprehensive zonings, comprehensive rezonings, text amendments to zoning ordinances, and conditional uses). Because, as previously discussed, conditional uses and PUDs in Baltimore share strong ties, we consider the reasoning and holding in <em>Armstrong III </em>before proceeding with our analysis in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">In <em>Armstrong III, </em>the Court of Special Appeals retreated from its broad holding in <em>MBC Realty </em>that a conditional use granted in Baltimore City was not a zoning reclassification, and thus not a \u201czoning action\u201d eligible for judicial review under \u00a7 2.09. 169 Md.App. at 677-78, 906 A.2d at 428. The court also modified its approach to ascertaining the scope of review under \u00a7 2.09,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> by first inquiring as to whether the governmental action in question was legislative or quasi-judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>cial<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in nature. 169 Md.App. at 666-73, 906 A.2d at 422-25. The intermediate appellate court noted that legislative actions are subjected to a more limited review by the courts than are quasi-judicial actions, 169 Md.App. at 666, 906 A.2d at 422 (citing <em>Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. v. Linchester Sand, &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 224, 334 A.2d 514, 523 (1975) (indicating that the scope of review regarding legislative actions is whether the body was acting within its legal authority)), thus leaving only quasi-judicial actions subject to \u00a7 2.09 review. <em>See </em>169 Md.App. at 666, 906 A.2d at 422 (\u201c[T]he first question we must resolve is whether ... the City Council was acting in a quasi-judicial, or administrative capacity, rather than in a legislative one.\u201d); <em>see also Gisriel v. Ocean City Bd. of Supervisors of Elections, </em>345 Md. 477, 490 n. 12, 693 A.2d 757, 763 n. 12 (1997) (\u201cLegislative or quasi-legislative decisions of local legislative bodies or administrative agencies are, of course, not subject to ordinary judicial review; instead, they are subject to very limited review by the courts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The outcome of the analysis of whether a given act is quasi-judicial in nature is guided by two criteria: (1) the act or decision is reached on individual, as opposed to general, grounds, and scrutinizes a single property, 169 Md.App. at 666-69, 906 A.2d at 422-23; and (2) there is a deliberative fact-finding process with testimony and the weighing of evidence. 169 Md.App. at 668-71, 906 A.2d at 423-24. The <em>Armstrong III </em>court emphasized the fact-finding process as the most weighty criterion, <em>id. </em>at 668-69, 906 A.2d at 423 (quoting <em>Montgomery County v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc., </em>280 Md. 686, 712, 376 A.2d 483, 497 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The <em>Armstrong III </em>court also relied on our discussion in <em>Mayor and Council of Rockville v. Woodmont Country Club </em>regarding the Rockville City Council\u2019s quasi-judicial process in considering the amount to be levied for a special assessment, 348 Md. 572, 585, 705 A.2d 301, 307 (1998), in concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the parking lot ordinance at issue in <em>Armstrong III </em>was also the product of quasi-judicial processes. 169 Md.App. at 668-71, 906 A.2d at 423-24. In <em>Woodmont Country Club, </em>the City of Rockville had constructed a planned road named Wooten Parkway, together with a water main. 348 Md. at 576, 705 A.2d at 303. The country club, along whose property part of the road and water main project ran, challenged the benefit assessment amount to be levied against it by the City for the construction project and requested on three occasions, all to no avail, that the City produce for cross-examination the appraisers who had generated the figures used by the City in determining the amount. <em>Woodmont Country Club, </em>348 Md. at 579, 705 A.2d at 304. At the hearing before the City Council for the proposed assessments, Woodmont presented its own witnesses: a traffic consultant, a land planner, and a land appraiser; all who disputed the City\u2019s assessment. <em>Woodmont Country Club, </em>348 Md. at 580, 705 A.2d at 304. Subsequent to the hearing, the City Attorney had its appraisers evaluate the appraisal offered by Woodmont at the hearing and sent correspondence to the City in defense of the assessment proposed by the City. <em>Id. </em>With the City\u2019s permission, Woodmont responded to the new information presented by the City Attorney. <em>Id. </em>Despite the country club\u2019s efforts, the assessments were levied as proposed. Woodmont ultimately appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which reversed the trial court on the rationale that Woodmont was entitled to an opportunity to cross-examine the City appraisers. <em>Woodmont Country Club, </em>348 Md. at 580-81, 705 A.2d at 304-05. In affirming the intermediate appellate court\u2019s judgment, we found that, because the City Council had <em>\u201ch[eld] a hearing, receiv[edj written and oral testimony, and considered] evidence to determine the specific amount of special benefit to a particular piece of property\u201d </em>being assessed by the City, the Council had, in those acts, performed in a quasi-judicial capacity, thereby entitling Woodmont to an opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Woodmont Country Club, </em>348 Md. at 585, 582, 705 A.2d at 307, 305 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The <em>Armstrong III </em>court drew a favorable comparison between the fact-finding process in <em>Woodmont Country Club </em>and that which occurred in the hearing before the Land Use and Planning Committee of the Baltimore City Council in the conditional use case. 169 Md.App. at 670, 906 A.2d at 424. The court found that the testimony of several concerned community members, the questions of several Committee members directed to the developer regarding the parking lot\u2019s economic impact, and the Council\u2019s consideration of several \u201cfact-intensive,\u201d site-specific factors distinguished the proceedings as quasi-judicial in nature, similar to those in <em>Woodmont Country Club. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Once the proceeding was determined to be quasi-judicial in nature, the court looked next to whether the action or decision complained of was a \u201czoning action\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 2.09. In this inquiry, the court examined precisely what decision or act by the governmental entity is the subject of the petition for judicial review. <em>Id. </em>at 677-78, 906 A.2d at 428. This step was necessary, in the court\u2019s view, to distinguish between cases where the thrust of the attack is directed at a legislative act not fitting within the term of \u201czoning action\u201d and cases where the thrust of the attack is directed at a quasi-judicial act imputing a \u201czoning action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, <em>Armstrong III </em>concluded that a piecemeal application, initiated by the property owner for a specific conditional use for a specific property, is a \u201czoning action,\u201d while zoning text amendments or comprehensive rezonings initiated by government are not. <em>Id. </em>at 673-74, 906 A.2d at 425-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The approach taken in <em>Armstrong III </em>reflects an analysis recognized in our zoning law precedent. In <em>Stephans II, </em>we opined that the word \u201caction\u201d in the phrase \u201czoning action\u201d was meant to be understood more in the sense of an adversarial proceeding involving a controversy between two or more parties, rather than a legislative action such as a comprehensive zoning plan or a text amendment to a zoning ordinance or regulation. 286 Md. at 390, 408 A.2d at 1019. The essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>point of this observation may be understood to distinguish an act by a legislative body that focuses on an individual property or assemblage of properties requiring particularized findings as to the circumstances of that property (or assemblage of properties) from acts that primarily have broader, community-wide implications which encompass considerations affecting an entire planning area or zoning district. Thus, when a legislative body considers a comprehensive area zoning or rezoning, the focus of its deliberations is not on a single parcel of land in a district or planning area, but rather on the entire district or area because it is the characteristics of the entire district that will inform the body\u2019s ultimate decision. By the same token, when a governmental body or agency undertakes the consideration of a proposal for a conditional use or a PUD, the body or agency necessarily concentrates its review and analysis on the parcel in question and the consequences of the proposed use of that parcel relative to the area more immediately surrounding the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In this way, the potentially \u201cadversarial\u201d type proceeding alluded to in <em>Stephans II </em>partakes of the characteristics previously discussed as indicative of a quasi-judicial, fact-finding process: the reception and weighing of facts to arrive at a conclusion, expressed as findings required by regulatory criteria, as to a specific land use proposal, initiated by the property owner or its representative, for a specific property or assemblage of properties.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The appellation of \u201cquasi-judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>cial,\u201d however, when assigned to governmental processes and acts, is not talismanic for declaration of a \u201czoning action,\u201d obviating the need for further inquiry into whether the act in question is eligible for statutory judicial review. Rather, it simply denotes certain processes involved in an \u201caction\u201d as understood in Art. 66B, \u00a7 2.09(a)(1)(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Although many relevant appellate cases refer to quasi-judicial decisions derived from pure administrative agencies, see Consumer <em>Prot. Div. v. Morgan, </em>387 Md. 125, 160, 874 A.2d 919, 939 (2005), fundamentally legislative bodies, such as the Baltimore City Council, similarly may act in a quasi-judicial capacity. <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., </em>358 Md. 166, 175, 747 A.2d 647, 652 (2000). The principal characteristic of a quasi-judicial proceeding is that of fact-finding by the undertaking body, even if the relevant facts are undisputed. <em>Bucktail, LLC v. County Council of Talbot County, </em>352 Md. 530, 543, 723 A.2d 440, 446 (1999); <em>Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County v. Global Express Money Orders, Inc., </em>168 Md.App. 339, 345, 896 A.2d 432, 435 (2006). A determination of whether a particular governmental body is conducting a quasi-judicial inquiry must address \u201cthe nature of the particular act in which [the body] is engaged.\u201d <em>Woodmont Country Club, </em>348 Md. at 585, 705 A.2d at 307. In the land use and zoning context, the essential questions to be asked are: what property or properties are being examined, for what reason, and at whose behest? As we have previously noted, proceedings or acts that scrutinize individual parcels or assemblages for the consideration of property-specific proposed uses, at the owner\u2019s or developer\u2019s initiative, ordinarily suggest a quasi-judicial process or act.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The case law of this State provides many exemplars of what have been found to be quasi-judicial proceedings. In general terms, we have said that quasi-judicial proceedings and acts are carried out largely by the exercise of discretion by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>governmental body. <em>City of Bowie v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>384 Md. 413, 440, 863 A.2d 976, 991 (2004). That discretion is exercised through the holding of hearings by the body, <em>Union Investors, Inc. v. Montgomery County, </em>244 Md. 585, 588, 224 A.2d 453, 454 (1966), which then is tasked with \u201crendering findings of fact and making conclusions of law....\u201d <em>Chestnut Real Estate P\u2019ship v. Huber, </em>148 Md.App. 190, 199, 811 A.2d 389, 394 (2002). The mode of fact-finding and particular formalities observed in the process can vary depending on the nature of the matter being considered by the hearing body. <em>See Hyson v. Montgomery County Council, </em>242 Md. 55, 67, 217 A.2d 578, 586 (1966) (holding that at least some right to cross-examination exists in Montgomery County zoning reclassification public hearings). <em>But see Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc., </em>280 Md. at 713, 376 A.2d at 498 (holding that no right to cross-examination exists for sectional map amendments involving comprehensive rezoning in Montgomery County, a legislative in nature process). <em>See also Gorin v. Board of Co. Comm\u2019rs for Anne Arundel County, </em>244 Md. 106, 110, 223 A.2d 237, 239 (1966) (\u201cWhile proceedings before an administrative board are informal and the strict rules of evidence do not apply, when the board is functioning in an adversary proceeding, the fundamentals applicable to the decision of adjudicative facts by any tribunal must be preserved.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">We note that the fact-finding process for piecemeal land use and zoning matters usually entails at least the holding of a hearing, the receipt of factual and opinion testimony and forms of documentary evidence, and a particularized conclusion as to the development proposal for the parcel in question. <em>See Woodmont Country Club, </em>348 Md. at 585, 705 A.2d at 307; <em>see also Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n. v. Friendship Heights, </em>57 Md.App. 69, 82, 468 A.2d 1353, 1359 (1984) (\u201cWhere ... the administrative tribunal is under a duty to consider evidence and apply law to the facts as found, thereby exercising some discretion, the function is quasi-judicial.\u201d). It is primarily the emphasis that the hearing places on a particular property and the unique considerations of its proposed development that tender to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>render it quasi-judicial in nature. This emphasis is only natural. \u201cZoning matters ... depend upon the unique facts and circumstances of a particular location and must be analyzed individually.\u201d <em>Red Roof Inns, Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>96 Md.App. 219, 227-28, 624 A.2d 1281, 1285 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In <em>Woodmont Country Club, </em>we referred on multiple occasions to the focusing of a proceeding on an individualized parcel of land as important in finding that the process was a quasi-judicial one. 348 Md. 572, 583-84, 705 A.2d 301, 306. The <em>Woodmont Country Club </em>Court also noted its opinion in <em>Hyson, </em>where we found that the Montgomery County Council, in \u201cconsidering and determining [ ] adjudicative facts concerning particular parties [in a zoning reclassification matter], [ ] necessarily was performing a quasi-judicial function, even though its final action, in granting or denying the reclassification which was required to be based upon its findings of adjudicative facts, was quasi-legislative in character.\u201d 242 Md. at 65, 217 A.2d at 584, <em>cited in Woodmont Country Club, </em>348 Md. at 584, 705 A.2d at 306-07. We later clarified in <em>Bucktail </em>that it is not a hearing\u2019s mere focus on one parcel that is dispositive of its quasi-judicial nature, but rather that the matter taken up at the hearing is disposed of based on the unique characteristics that inhere to that parcel when considering the proposed use. 352 Md. at 545, 723 A.2d at 447 (\u201cThis determination is not based on whether the zoning decision adversely affects an individual piece of property, but whether the decision itself is made on <em>individual or general grounds.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Yet another of our cases demonstrates the relationship between an individualized determination and a quasi-judicial process or act. <em>Mossburg v. Montgomery County, </em>decided in 1993, involved a petition for a special exception (conditional use) to build a solid waste transfer station in Montgomery County. The County Board of Appeals denied the application for the exception after a hearing at which extensive testimony was offered by concerned citizens opposed to it. 329 Md. at 496-98, 620 A.2d at 887-88. We held, in part, that the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>of Appeals\u2019s proceeding was quasi-judicial in the sense that it evaluated \u201c[a]n application for a special exception involving] a particular applicant\u2019s request for administrative authorization to engage in a <em>specific activity at a specific location.\u201d Mossburg, </em>329 Md. at 506, 620 A.2d at 892 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">It is only by looking to the particular circumstances of an affected parcel and its immediate environs that a body can make the necessary findings and conclusions called for by statute, ordinance, or regulation. These site-specific findings of fact are necessary not only to inform properly the interested parties of the grounds for the body\u2019s decision, <em>Mehrling v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>371 Md. 40, 64, 806 A.2d 662, 676 (2002) (citing <em>Blue Bird Cab Co. v. Md. Dep\u2019t of Employment Sec., </em>251 Md. 458, 466, 248 A.2d 331, 335 (1968)) (noting that \u201ca fundamental requirement of the due process of law in a quasi-judicial proceeding is the right of the parties to be apprised of the facts relied upon by the tribunal in its decision.\u201d), but also to provide a basis upon which judicial review may be rendered. <em>Pattey v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs for Worcester County, </em>271 Md. 352, 359-60, 317 A.2d 142, 146 (1974) (restraining judicial review of a legislative body\u2019s zoning decision to the record); <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County v. Ziegler, </em>244 Md. 224, 229, 223 A.2d 255, 257 (1966) (\u201c[I]t is clear that without a record of the facts on which the zoning authority acted or a statement of the reasons for its action, the reviewing court could not properly perform the duty it had of determining whether the action of the zoning authority was arbitrary or capricious.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The Baltimore City Council\u2019s consideration of the PUD amendment proposal advanced by Canton Crossing, which later became the subject of Ordinance 04-873, was evaluated on both individual and general grounds. It is clear from the record that the Council\u2019s decisions to grant both Canton Crossing\u2019s original request to designate its 67 and one-half acre plot of land as an Industrial PUD and each of the three subsequent substantive amendments to the approved PUD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>were made upon grounds focused on a development plan for that plot of land only, and thus was considered on an individualized basis. This property alone was singled out for proposed amendment of its zoning, rather than the entire zoning district or planning area in which it is located. This individualized action was precisely the kind of change, focusing on the particulars involved with a specific property and its unique circumstances, contemplated by our previous cases as quasi-judicial in nature. <em>See Bucktail, </em>352 Md. at 545, 723 A.2d at 447; <em>Woodmont Country Club, </em>348 Md. at 583-84, 705 A.2d at 306; <em>Mossburg, </em>329 Md. at 506, 620 A.2d at 892; <em>Hyson, </em>242 Md. at 65, 217 A.2d at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">We turn to the quality of the proceeding employed to examine the PUD amendment proposal. The Maryland Code and the Baltimore City Zoning Code both set forth a requirement that some form of hearing be held in conjunction with zoning acts carried out by the City Council. Md.Code, Art. 66B, \u00a7\u00a7 2.05(d), 2.04(b) (providing for public hearings designed to grant \u201cparties in interest and citizens [ ] an opportunity to be heard.\u201d); Baltimore, Md., Zoning Code \u00a7\u00a7 16-402(a)(1); 16-101(d)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (mandating that a committee of the Council considering a bill that would change the zoning classification of a property, create a conditional use, or grant a PUD permit interested parties and the public an \u201copportunity to be heard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Both codes also require certain findings of fact be made and governing standards be applied to those facts. The Maryland Code generally requires the Council<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to make findings of fact regarding the zoning proposal that include: population changes, availability of public facilities, present and future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>transportation patterns, compatibility with existing and proposed development for the area, the recommendations of the Planning Commission and the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals, and the relation of the act to the City\u2019s plan. Md. Code Art. 66B, \u00a7 2.05(a)(2). The Baltimore City Zoning Code is much more specific in the findings and criteria applicable to the grant of a PUD proposal. In addition to the standards set for the grant of a conditional use, Baltimore, Md., Zoning Code \u00a7 14-205(a) (listing 14 separate criteria), a PUD is subject to scrutiny on ten additional points of consideration respecting the physical features of the land, health and safety of residents, as well as use and bulk regulations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>bill that called for the amendment of Canton Crossing\u2019s development plan was subject to analysis in reports by the City Solicitor, Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals, Planning Commission, Department of Housing and Community Development, Department of Public Works, Fire Department, Parking Authority Board, and Transportation Department, which served as the source for many of the conditions attached ultimately to approval of the amendment. Following that, the Land Use and Planning Committee of the City Council scheduled and held a duly advertised public hearing on the bill on 3 November 2004, which was reported as favorable with amendments by the Committee. At that audio-taped hearing, the Committee heard testimony from the developer and members of the public regarding a number of topics concerning the PUD and its putative effects on the community. The Hearing Notes indicate that the focus of the hearing was on the potential problems of increased noise, traffic, encroachment into the industrial district, and obstruction of water views from a nearby park. Canton Crossing and the City also apparently agreed to negotiate the massing for a cruise ship terminal should one be approved by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">It should also be noted that concurrent with this hearing and referral process, the Council examined, and ultimately approved, the development plan, which is required to address thirteen separate considerations affecting the site of the proposed PUD or any substantive amendment to an approved PUD. Baltimore, Md., Zoning Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-107, 9-110; <em>see also supra </em>at 28-29, 909 A.2d at 242. The gravamen of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>standards and the inquiry surrounding them is a detailed and thorough examination of the unique circumstances of a specific PUD proposal for a specific parcel, including the potential for adverse impacts on adjacent properties. This process of receiving evidence and creating a record upon which the City Council then must rely in deciding the ultimate question of whether the development plan, or amended plan, should be granted is quite analogous to the quasi-judicial processes analyzed in <em>Woodmont Country Club </em>and <em>Mossburg. </em>In both of those cases, as was done here, findings of fact were made based on reports from governmental agencies and departments and a public hearing, wherefrom the final governmental decision-maker drew its findings as to the pending matter affecting a particular piece of property. <em>City of Bowie, </em>384 Md. at 440, 863 A.2d at 991. We are satisfied that the process for the approval of PUDs, and substantive amendments thereto, in Baltimore City is of sufficient quasi-judicial character, rather than legislative in nature, to examine the ultimate question of whether the Council\u2019s approval of the PUD amendment embodied by Ordinance 04-873 qualifies as a \u201czoning action\u201d and therefore is subject to a petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">To understand the scope of \u00a7 2.09(a)(1)(ii) and its key phrase \u201czoning action,\u201dwe remind ourselves of what was said in <em>Stephans II. </em>The crucial legislative history of \u00a7 2.09 and <em>Stephans II </em>are well explicated in <em>MBC Realty:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">Article 66B was enacted in 1933. The statute provided for judicial review only from decisions by a Board and then only on writ of certiorari. <em>Board of County Commissioners of Carroll County v. Stephans, </em>286 Md. 384, 391, 408 A.2d 1017 (1979). In 1962, the statute was amended to provide for judicial review of a decision by a Board, without the certiorari requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 392, 408 A.2d 1017.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">Consequently, after the 1962 amendment, there was a statutory right of judicial review, as an administrative appeal, from a decision by a Board. There was no such right with respect to a decision by the local legislative body. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>With respect to decisions by a legislative body, a party had to file an action invoking the general jurisdiction of a court, arguing whatever theories were available under separation of powers principles, essentially that the legislation was unconstitutional or ultra vires. \u201cThe test of invalidity of a zoning ordinance is whether it is arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory, and has no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">In 1970, \u00a7\u00a7 2.09 and 4.08<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> were amended to permit an administrative appeal from \u201ca reclassification by the local legislative body,\u201d in addition to an administrative appeal from a decision by a Board. <em>Stephans, </em>286 Md. at 392, 408 A.2d 1017. The right of review was pursuant to chapter 1100, subtitle B of the Maryland Rules. <em>Id. </em>(forerunner to title 7, chapter 200). The amendment was recommended by the Maryland Planning and Zoning Law Study Commission. The Commission explained,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">This section is unchanged except for the inclusion of an appeal process from reclassification decisions of the local legislative body. It can be argued that under the present system appeals from reclassification decisions may be launched in equity at any time.

Whether, in light of its new analytical approach advanced in <em>Armstrong III, </em>the Court of Special Appeals would reach the same result today as it did in <em>MBC Realty, </em>at least as to the ordinance granting the specific conditional use, seems doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">A closer review of the legislative history behind \u00a7 2.09 than was undertaken in <em>Stephans II, </em>a disciplined application of the principles of statutory construction, and certain relevant policy considerations counsel us to gainsay here <em>Stephans II\u2019s </em>narrow interpretation of the phrase \u201czoning action.\u201d We start, as our well-established rules of statutory construction direct us, with the plain language of the statute where the \u201cordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.\u201d <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 576, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005) (citing <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484, 487 (2004)).

In general terms, the term \u201czoning\u201d is \u201cused to describe the process of setting aside disconnected tracts of land varying in shape and dimensions, and dedicating them to particular uses designed in some degree to serve the interests of the whole territory affected by the plan.\u201d <em>Stephans II, </em>286 Md. at 388-89, 408 A.2d at 1019 (quoting <em>Applestein v.

In as much as the types of zoning mechanisms principally relied on in 1979 and earlier to effect land development were largely Euclidean in nature, that this understanding prevailed at that time is understandable. Our decision in <em>Rylyns, </em>however, provides a somewhat more inclusive explanation of the nature of zoning, taking into account more modern and flexible types of zoning tools, and which distinguishes the more short-term regulation of land from the forward-looking concept known as planning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">Zoning, in theory, is the process whereby the comprehensive plan is put into effect. The local legislative body that makes zoning decisions divides districts within the locality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>into zones, and the legislative body defines, <em>inter alia, </em>the height, building size, lot size, population density, location, and use of buildings that are permissible in the particular zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">372 Md. at 529-30 &amp; n. 5, 814 A.2d at 477-78 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The more difficult inquiry is divining the meaning of \u201caction\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 2.09(a)(l)(ii). As previously discussed, the <em>Stephans II </em>Court viewed this term in its \u201clegal sense\u201d as indicative of an adversarial proceeding wherein opposing parties settle a controversy in some form of tribunal. 286 Md. at 390, 408 A.2d at 1019. We suggest here that such a conception of \u201caction\u201d is too cramped. The plain meaning of the term should be considered in its ordinary, popular understanding in the English language, rather than in a strictly \u201clegal sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, we view \u201caction\u201d in a slightly broader sense than <em>Stephans II </em>did; one that embodies a less technical meaning tied exclusively to legal jargon. One respected dictionary extant at the time the General Assembly amended \u00a7 2.09(a)(1)(h) to replace \u201creclassification\u201d with \u201czoning action,\u201d first defines \u201caction\u201d as a \u201cdeliberative or authorized procedure.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 21 (1966). It, and another dictionary contemporaneous with the adoption of the statute in question,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> then provide more generic definitions which allude to action as the act of doing something or performing a deed. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[A] thing done; deed\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 26 (5th ed. 1979) (\u201c[Cjonduct; behavior; something done; the condition of acting ... \u201d). More recent dictionaries have concurred in this more general understanding of the word \u201caction.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 21 (8th ed. 1999) (\u201c[T]he process <em>of doing </em>something; conduct or behavior; an act or thing done; act....\u201d); The Compact Oxford English Dictionary 15 (2d ed. 1991) (\u201c[A] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>doing; performance\u201d); Webster\u2019s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary 20 (2d ed. 1983) (\u201c[T]he doing of something; ... an act or thing done\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Taken together, these more commonly held understandings of the constituent parts of the phrase \u201czoning action\u201d point to a meaning that has a broader sense than merely a \u201creclassification.\u201d Instead, we view \u201czoning action\u201d in \u00a7 2.09 as any act by the Mayor and City Council that (1) decides the use of a specific parcel or assemblage of parcels of land, (2) was initiated by an individual application by a property owner or its representative, (3) was based on fact-finding (from a record containing evidence, usually both pro and <em>con) </em>adduced through governmental agency analysis of the proposal and through a public hearing, and (4) either creates or modifies substantively the governing zoning classification or defines the permissible uses, building and lot sizes, population density, topographical and physical features, and other characteristics of a specific parcel or assemblage of parcels of land by exercising some discretionary judgment after the consideration of the unique circumstances of the affected parcels and buildings.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This framework further explains why amendments to the text of zoning regulations, comprehensive zonings, and other acts that are legislative in nature do not qualify for judicial review under \u00a7 2.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Because of the more commonly held understanding of the term \u201czoning action\u201d adopted in this opinion, we must re-visit the conclusion reached by the <em>Stephans II </em>Court that the General Assembly\u2019s change of the language of \u00a7 2.09 from \u201creclassification\u201d to \u201czoning action\u201d was merely stylistic. 286 Md. at 396, 408 A.2d at 1022-23. The <em>Stephans II </em>Court inferred from the fact that the two main purposes of the 1975 enactment delineated in the title of the act arguably did not mention or concern the change from \u201creclassification\u201d to \u201czoning action\u201d that the change in language must have been one of the purely stylistic changes alluded to generally in the title. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Modern cases look beyond the facial statements in Revisor\u2019s notes or inferential reasoning concluding that changes in statutory language were merely stylistic. Those cases apply plain meaning analysis to determine if the change, nonetheless, effected a clearly substantive change. <em>Md. Div. of Labor and Indus. v. Triangle Gen\u2019l Contractors, </em>366 Md. 407, 419-20, 784 A.2d 534, 541 (2001) (holding the addition of certain language to be substantive despite numerous legislative references to changes occurring in a re-codification as being purely stylistic); <em>Abramson v. Montgomery County, </em>328 Md. 721, 737, 616 A.2d 894, 901-02 (1992) (finding that, contrary to the Revisor\u2019s note, the substitution of \u201cperson\u201d for \u201cparty\u201d worked a substantive change in determining whether a governmental entity is considered a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement for an appeal to Tax Court); <em>In re Taylor, </em>312 Md. 58, 68-70, 537 A.2d 1179, 1184-85 (1988) (concluding that the deletion of certain language from the tools-of-the-trade bankruptcy exemption statute, although as a result of a recodification, must have been substantive although such changes during recodification are presumed to be stylistic); <em>Bd. of Supervisors of Elections of Baltimore City v. Weiss, </em>217 Md. 133, 138, 141 A.2d 734, 737 (1958) (finding a substantive change in language because the law was under five years of study and could not reasonably have unintended changes); <em>see also Mid-Atlantic Power Supply </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>Ass\u2019n v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>361 Md. 196, 760 A.2d 1087 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Thus, even if we were to accept the \u201clogical inference\u201d made by the <em>Stephans II </em>Court that the change from \u201creclassification\u201d to \u201czoning action,\u201d in fact, was intended facially as a stylistic change, the inquiry does not end if the change in fact or law worked a substantive change. Thus, our application of the plain meaning rule here resolves differently than <em>Stephans II </em>the meaning of \u201czoning action.\u201d <em>Arundel Corp. v. Marie, </em>383 Md. 489, 502, 860 A.2d 886, 894 (2004) (\u201cIf there is no ambiguity in that language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends; we do not need to resort to the various, and sometimes inconsistent, external rules of construction, for \u2018the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002))); <em>Triangle Gen\u2019l Contractors, </em>366 Md. at 423, 784 A.2d at 543 (\u201cWhen a statute\u2019s language is clear and unambiguous, however, we need look no further for some hidden legislative intent.\u201d (quoting <em>Abramson, </em>328 Md. at 736, 616 A.2d at 901)); <em>Tidewater/Havre de Grace, Inc. v.

Our reading of \u201czoning action\u201d does not produce any absurdities or defeat the purpose of the 1975 statute. <em>See Tidewater/Havre de Grace, Inc., </em>337 Md. at 345, 653 A.2d at 472. Rather, it gives effect to the law by providing judicial review of specific reclassifications, which was the case prior to the language change, in addition to other acts by the City Council affecting the zoning of individual parcels of property. Moreover, the grant of authority in the 1975 law to the City Council to \u201cprovide for appeal to the Baltimore City Court of any matter arising under the planning and zoning laws of the City of Baltimore,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> is not rendered mere surplusage by our broader <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>reading of \u201czoning action.\u201d <em>Moore v.

A quasi-judicial proceeding in the zoning context is found where, at a minimum, there is a fact-finding process that entails the holding of a hearing, the receipt of factual and opinion testimony and/or forms of documentary evidence, and a particularized conclusion, based upon delineated statutory standards, for the unique development proposal for the specific parcel or assemblage of land in question. Second, if the governmental act in question involves a quasi-judicial process, the inquiry moves to the question of whether it qualifies as a \u201czoning action.\u201d Where the City Council exercises its discretion in deciding the permissible uses and other characteristics of a specific parcel or assemblage of land upon a deliberation of the unique circumstances of the affected land and its surrounding environs, a \u201czoning action\u201d is the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">In the case at hand, Ordinance 04-873 was enacted as the result of a quasi-judicial process. It approved the \u201cincrease [of] the number of residential dwelling units permitted and [modified] the uses and buildings permitted and their locations and size.\u201d <em>See op., supra </em>at 24, 909 A.2d at 239-40. The prevailing purpose of the Ordinance, then, was to define the permissible uses, if not also to modify to some degree the zoning classification, of the specific parcel. The amendment sought by the property owner proposed \u201cto increase the number of residential dwelling units from 100 to 504; to decrease the amount of office space from 1.7 million to 1.5 million square feet; to decrease the amount of retail space from 450,000 to 150,000 square feet; and to increase the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>amount of restaurant space from 50,000 to 120,000 square feet.\u201d <em>Id. </em>&amp; n. 8. The City Council\u2019s deliberative consideration, after receiving evidence at a required hearing, and approval of these specific uses for this specific parcel after making required statutory findings falls within the realm of a \u201czoning action.\u201d We, therefore, hold that Maryland Overpak was entitled to seek judicial review of the adoption of Ordinance 04-873 as a \u201czoning action\u201d under \u00a7 2.09(a)(1)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Because our holding is that Ordinance 04-873 granting an amendment to a PUD qualifies as a \u201czoning action\u201d capable of judicial scrutiny in a petition for judicial review process, we need not consider Appellant\u2019s argument that its proceeding brought in the Circuit Court was proper if viewed as a legal modality of judicial process other than a petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-13\">.

A PUD is a relatively modem zoning concept created to provide a degree of flexibility in uses and design not available under strict Euclidian zoning. Essentially, a PUD, when approved by a governmental body, grants a variety of uses within a development that would otherwise not be permitted under the pre-existing or, in the case of Baltimore City's zoning regulations, underlying Euclidian zoning of the pertinent parcel or assemblage of land. A distinguishing feature of PUDs is the incorporation of a form of site planning requirement at its inception and/or in the latter stages of the overall approval process, if that process is multi-tiered.
