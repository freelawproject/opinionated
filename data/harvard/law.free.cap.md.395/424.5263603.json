The parcel had been part of a 1390-acre tract of land which a developer, Rose of Annapolis Limited Partnership, intended to develop \u201cas a mixed-use community known as South River Colony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In 1988, the developer Rose of Annapolis entered into a \u201cDevelopment Agreement and Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions\u201d with each of several community associations representing \u201ccitizens who reside in the general vicinity of the Property.\u201d The respondent London Towne Property Owners Association, Inc., was one of these associations entering a Development Agreement and Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions with the developer. Under a heading entitled \u201cDwelling Units and Land Use,\u201d the Agreement provided, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1f\">\u201ce. The portion of the Property consisting of approximately six (6) acres and being located in the southeast quadrant of the Maryland Route 214/Maryland Route 2 intersection <em>shall be undeveloped, except for educational facilities in conjunction with the Anne Arundel County Board of </em>Education.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>In June 2002, the subject six-acre parcel of land was sold to the petitioner SDC 214, LLC (hereafter referred to as SDC), for $306,000.00. Also in June 2002, SDC entered into a lease agreement with Sojourner-Douglas College, Inc., under which SDC was to construct and lease to the College an \u201cEducational Center\u201d on the six-acre parcel. The lease agreement provided that the land and building \u201cshall be used for higher education and related activities\u201d by the College, and that the College\u2019s \u201cuse of the Premises is subject to the covenants and special exception conditions to educational uses in conjunction with Anne Arundel County Board of Education.\u201d The term of the lease was fifteen years, commencing thirty days after the educational facility was constructed, with options to extend the term beyond the fifteen years. The lease agreement also gave the College options to purchase the property either upon completion of the building or during the first five years of the initial term of the lease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The primary campus of Sojourner-Douglas College is in Baltimore City, although the College also has facilities in Anne Arundel, Prince George\u2019s, Dorchester, and Wicomico Counties. In addition, the College has a campus in the Bahamas. The College offers several four-year bachelor\u2019s degree programs and a master\u2019s degree program. The programs are primarily aimed at adult students who work during the day, and, therefore, most of the courses are given in the evening. The College\u2019s Anne Arundel County facility, located in the City of Annapolis, had become overcrowded. The purchase and lease of the subject six-acre parcel was specifically intended to alleviate this overcrowding problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Shortly after SDC\u2019s purchase of the six-acre parcel and the lease to the College, SDC by letter dated July 9, 2002, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>informed the London Towne Association of the plan \u201cto construct an educational facility for Sojourner-Douglas College on the [six-acre] site,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he proposed use is in conjunction with and has been approved by the Anne Arundel County Board of Education.\u201d Although the President of the London Towne Association acknowledged in writing the receipt of the letter, the Association did not comment on the proposed facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In November and December 2002, SDC applied to Anne Arundel County for a building permit and a \u201cZoning Certificate of Use\u201d with regard to the six-acre parcel and the planned educational facility. Subsequently, both applications were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">On September 8, 2003, the College and the Anne Arundel County Public School System entered into a contract for the parties to \u201cwork collaboratively to enhance the educational experiences of students from both institutions\u201d and to \u201ccooperate\u201d with regard to several matters. The contract was signed by an official of the College and by the Anne Arundel County Superintendent of Schools.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the contract, among other things, the College agreed, both at its Annapolis campus and at the planned facility to be constructed on the six-acre parcel, to provide tutoring and other assistance for suspended or expelled public school students, to make space available at both campuses for the Public School System\u2019s \u201cAlternate Education Programs\u201d and \u201cstudent academic intervention programs,\u201d to \u201cprovide access to textbooks and other educational materials for students in teacher training programs,\u201d and to make College facilities available to the Public School System. The Anne Arundel County Public School System, <em>inter alia, </em>agreed to \u201cprovide opportunities in its schools for [College] student teachers to get field experience,\u201d and to \u201cselect and refer [public school] students for participation in [College] educational programs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>During 2003, some opposition to the planned educational facility arose in some of the communities in the general vicinity of the proposed facility. On October 14, 2003, the London Towne Property Owners Association and John Yannone, a resident property owner in the South River Colony community, filed in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County a complaint for a declaratory judgment and an injunction. SDC was named as the only defendant. The complaint asserted that the proposed building and use of the six-acre parcel was prohibited by the restrictive covenant stating that the parcel \u201cshall be undeveloped, except for educational facilities in conjunction with the Anne Arundel County Board of Education.\u201d The complaint alleged that, although the \u201cBoard of Education may utilize some of the facilities to be erected on the site,\u201d the \u201cprimary use of the Property shall be college educational programs operated by a private entity independent of the Anne Arundel County Board of Education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">After the filing of an answer and some discovery, the case was tried before the Circuit Court on May 21, 2004. An officer of the London Towne Property Owners Association and the plaintiff John Yannone testified on behalf of the plaintiffs. Dr. Charlestein Fairley, an official of the College, and Earl P. Schubert, Jr., the owner of SDC, testified on behalf of the defendant, and numerous exhibits were introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The only testimony directly relating to the relationship between the College and the Anne Arundel County Public School System was by Dr. Fairley, the Director of the College\u2019s Anne Arundel County facilities. After pointing out that the College located in Anne Arundel County in 1993, and after describing the College\u2019s general nature and programs, Dr. Fairley testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\u201cQ. * * * What relationship or is there an existing relationship with the Anne Arundel County public school systems between the college \u2014 or a relationship between the college and the school system?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u201cA. Yes. There is both a formal and informal relationship. We, from the very beginning in 1993, established a relationship in conjunction with the Board of Education. Our early childhood education majors do their practice teaching in the Anne Arundel County public schools. The Anne Arundel public schoolteachers serve as cooperating or mentoring teachers. We have a person on staff currently, Dr. Eleanor Harris, who is a retired Anne Arundel County administrator and principal, who supervises this process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">\u201cWe also collaborate with the Board of Education on proposal development. We serve as a resource for them, and they for us. We\u2019ve opened our facility to the Board of Education to be used. They have come over and examined and looked at the kind of facilities that we have. Because we hold classes from 6:00 until 10:00 in the evening, our classroom space is open. So, we\u2019ve made that available to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">\u201cWe also provide speakers for them, when requested. We provide resources, and they to us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">\u201cQ. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">\u201cA. Some of it \u2014 well, many of the teachers teach in our general education program. And we\u2019ve also provided help to some of their staff without college degrees obtain a college degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\u201cQ. Dr. Fairley, with regard to student teaching, is that a formalized program?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">\u201cA. Yes. Yes, it is a formalized program. It is \u2014 we have a manual. We have job descriptions for the cooperating teachers. We have job descriptions for our supervising teacher. We have goals and objectives that students are to attain during this process. It\u2019s all spelled out. We pay a small fee to the cooperating teacher for having our students in the classroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>\u201cQ. * * * Now there are employees of the public school system who are seeking advanced degrees or seeking degrees through your program. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u201cA. Yes. We\u2019ve always had them, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">\u201cQ. And are there members of the public school staff who teach at Sojourner Douglas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">\u201cQ. Now prior to entering into this lease, did you make an attempt to formalize a relationship with the county public school system?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">\u201cA. Yes, we did. We worked out a memorandum of understanding, which took under consideration the activities that we were engaged in together.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Dr. Fairley went on to point out that the provision of services and facilities to the Anne Arundel County Public School System, at the six-acre Edgewater location, would commence \u201c[w]hen the new building is constructed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">Thereafter, the Circuit Court filed an order denying the plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief and filed a written declaratory judgment. The Circuit Court held that there was no violation of the restrictive covenant, as the proposed building constituted an educational facility and that it was \u201cin conjunction with the Anne Arundel County Board of Education.\u201d The Circuit Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-12\">\u201cBased on Dr. Fairley\u2019s testimony, it is undoubtedly clear that the College and the Board of Education have a longstanding relationship of working together to educate individuals in Anne Arundel County. In light of their relationship, this Court concludes that the College has been working \u2018in conjunction with\u2019 the Board of Education, as that phrase is used in Section l(A)(i)(C) of South River Colony\u2019s Declaration of Covenants, in the establishment of its new educational facility upon the South River Colony Property. Therefore, this Court concludes that the Defendant\u2019s proposed use of the South River Colony Property does conform with South River Colony\u2019s Declaration of Covenants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>The plaintiffs noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. They also requested the Circuit Court to issue a temporary injunction so that construction of the facility on the six-acre parcel would not commence pending appellate proceedings. The Circuit Court denied the request for an injunction pending appeal. The plaintiffs neither challenged this denial in the Court of Special Appeals nor sought from the appellate court an injunction pending appeal. Consequently, construction of the facility began, and the parties have informed us that construction has been completed, that the facility is being used by the College, and that a public charter school, chartered and funded by the Anne Arundel County Board of Education, is located in the building. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1978, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 9-101 through 9-110 of the Education Article, relating to the \u201cMaryland Public Charter School Program.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court and remanded the case to the Circuit Court \u201cfor the entry of orders consistent with this [the Court of Special Appeals\u2019] opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>acknowledging that both Dr. Fairley\u2019s testimony and the September 2003 contract between the College and the Anne Arundel County Public School System \u201cdescribe[ ] a general working relationship between the College and the Board [of Education],\u201d the Court of Special Appeals determined that this relationship was not \u201csufficient to bring the proposed South River [Colony] development within the use permitted by the covenant.\u201d The intermediate appellate court was of the view that, to satisfy the condition in the restrictive covenant, the Anne Arundel County Board of Education was required to have been involved in the planning, design or construction of the physical facilities. The appellate court thus noted that the September 2003 contract between the College and the Board of Education \u201cis clearly directed at the development and maintenance of worthwhile educational programs, not at the development of physical facilities.\u201d In its conclusion, the Court of Special Appeals emphasized \u201cthat the Board [of Education] took no part in the site plan or layout <em>of </em>the property....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">SDC filed a petition for a writ of certiorari which this Court granted. <em>SDC v. London Towne, </em>390 Md. 90, 887 A.2d 655 (2005). The respondents did not file a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Several recent opinions of this Court have discussed the principles controlling the interpretation and application of restrictive covenants. <em>See, e.g., Lowden v. Bosley, </em>395 Md. 58, 909 A.2d 261, 2006 WL 2946064 (2006); <em>Miller v. Bay City Property Owners Association, </em>393 Md. 620, 903 A.2d 938 (2006); <em>Roper v. Camuso, </em>376 Md. 240, 829 A.2d 589 (2003); <em>Stansbury v. Jones, </em>372 Md. 172, 202-203, 812 A.2d 312, 330 (2002); <em>County Commissioners v. St. Charles, </em>366 Md. 426, 784 A.2d 545 (2001); <em>Belleview v. Rugby hall, </em>321 Md. 152, 157, 582 A.2d 493, 495 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Where the language of the instrument containing a restrictive covenant is unambiguous, a court should simply give effect to that language \u201cunless prevented from doing so by public policy or some established principle of law.\u201d <em>Miller v. Bay City Property Owners Association, supra, </em>393 Md. at 637, 903 A.2d at 948 (internal quotation marks omitted). If, however, the language of the instrument is ambiguous, current Maryland law requires a court to apply \u201ca reasonably strict construction when construing covenants.\u201d <em>County Commissioners v. St. Charles, supra, </em>366 Md. at 447, 784 A.2d at 557. The \u201creasonably strict construction\u201d rule has been explained as follows <em>(Belleview v. Rugby Hall, supra, </em>321 Md. at 157-158, 582 A.2d at 495):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">\u201cIf the meaning of the instrument is not clear from its terms, \u2018the circumstances surrounding the execution of the instrument should be considered in arriving at the intention of the parties, and the apparent meaning and object of their stipulations should be gathered from all possible sources.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">\u201cIf an ambiguity is present, and if that ambiguity is not clearly resolved by resort to extrinsic evidence, the general rule in favor of the unrestricted use of property will prevail and the ambiguity in a restriction will be resolved against the party seeking its enforcement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Moreover, like contractual provisions generally, restrictive covenants should be interpreted reasonably and should not be given interpretations leading to unreasonable results. <em>Miller v. Bay City Property Owners Association, supra, </em>393 Md. at 636, 903 A.2d at 947 (pointing out that restrictive covenants are now interpreted under a \u201c \u2018reasonableness rule\u2019\u201d); <em>County Commissioners v. St. Charles, supra, </em>366 Md. at 447, 784 A.2d at 557 (same); <em>Martin v. Weinberg, </em>205 Md. 519, 527, 109 A.2d 576, 579 (1954) (restrictive covenants should be given \u201ca fair and reasonable construction\u201d). <em>See also, e.g., Fister v. Allstate, </em>366 Md. 201, 219, 783 A.2d 194, 205 (2001) (Courts \u201cavoid interpreting contract language ... in a manner that is void of a commonsensical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>perspective\u201d); <em>Forbes v. Harleysville Mutual, </em>322 Md. 689, 704-705, 589 A.2d 944, 951 (1991) (One party\u2019s interpretation of a contract \u201cwould be a particularly unreasonable construction\u201d leading to results inconsistent with public policy); <em>Canaras v. Lift Truck Services, </em>272 Md. 337, 357, 322 A.2d 866, 877 (1974) (\u201cAn interpretation which makes a contract fair and reasonable will be preferred to one which leads to either a harsh or unreasonable result\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In the present case, neither side has taken the position that the restrictive covenant is ambiguous. Furthermore, neither side at the trial before the Circuit Court presented any extrinsic evidence relating to the intent underlying the restrictive covenant when the original developer and the community associations entered into the 1988 agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">SDC contends that the September 2003 contract between the College and the Anne Arundel County Board of Education, as well as the present use of the educational facility by the Board of Education, \u201cclearly\u201d satisfies the \u201cexcept\u201d clause in the restrictive covenant, and that nothing more is required by the language \u201cin conjunction with the Anne Arundel County Board of Education.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s brief at 10). SDC argues that the Court of Special Appeals, by \u201cfocusing on the planning and construction of the proposed facility,\u201d has inserted words into and has rewritten the restrictive covenant. <em>(Ibid.). </em>SDC points out that, under the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 construction of the covenant, \u201cthe Board of Education would be prohibited from using the property as a public school facility, even in a case where the Board had purchased the property and occupied and used it exclusively.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 11). Although arguing that the restrictive covenant is clear, SDC alternatively submits that, if the covenant were ambiguous, SDC should nevertheless prevail under the \u201creasonably strict construction\u201d principle because no extrinsic evidence regarding the intent of the covenant was presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The London Towne Property Owners Association, relying on the word \u201cDevelopment\u201d in the title of the 1988 Agreement, and the phrase \u201cshall be undeveloped\u201d in the restrictive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>covenant, argues that the \u201cexcept\u201d clause in the covenant must be interpreted to mean \u201cunless the owner, in conjunction with the Anne Arundel County Board of Education, <em>developed </em>educational facilities.\u201d (Respondents\u2019 brief at 11-12, emphasis added). The words \u201cdevelopment\u201d or \u201cdevelop,\u201d according to the London Towne Association, mean \u201c \u2018the act of converting a tract of land into an area suitable for residential or business uses\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018the conversion of raw land into an area suitable for residential or business uses.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting selective dictionary definitions). The London Towne Association maintains that, since the Board of Education played no role in planning and design discussions for the physical facility or the construction of the facility, the Court of Special Appeals correctly held that there was no compliance with the restrictive covenant. <em>(Id. </em>at 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">We agree with SDC\u2019s argument. The plain language of the restrictive covenant does not require that the Anne Arundel County Board of Education must have been involved in the planning, design or construction of the building. The agreement to use the educational facility, or after construction the actual use of the facility, in conjunction with the Board of Education, fully satisfies the clause in the restrictive covenant setting forth the exception. The trial court\u2019s findings of fact, that the educational facility was \u201cin conjunction with\u201d the Board of Education, are well-supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In the context of the restrictive covenant in the 1988 Agreement, the general requirement that the six-acre parcel be \u201cundeveloped\u201d simply indicates that there should be no structures such as residences, commercial buildings, other buildings, etc., on the parcel. The exception is for an educational facility \u201cin conjunction with\u201d the Board of Education. The presence of an educational facility on the parcel falls within this exception as long as there is involvement by the Board of Education, regardless of whether the facility was \u201cplanned\u201d in conjunction with the Board of Education, or \u201cdesigned\u201d in conjunction with the Board, or \u201cconstructed\u201d in conjunction with the Board, or to be \u201cused\u201d in conjunction with the Board. Under the language of the covenant, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>educational facility used by both the College and the Anne Arundel County Public School System is an \u201ceducational facilit[y] in conjunction with the Anne Arundel County Board of Education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The London Towne Association and the Court of Special Appeals would insert in the \u201cexcept\u201d clause of the restrictive covenant the word \u201cdeveloped,\u201d and they would define the word \u201cdeveloped\u201d to mean the planning, design or construction of the building. Nevertheless, \u201cit is not the province of this Court to supply a missing\u201d word or phrase in a restrictive covenant, <em>Sowers v. Holy Nativity Church, </em>149 Md. 434, 442, 131 A. 785, 788 (1926). <em>See also Markey v. Wolf, </em>92 Md.App. 137, 152, 607 A.2d 82, 90 (1992). Moreover, there is no more reason to insert the narrowly defined word \u201cdeveloped\u201d in the restrictive covenant\u2019s clause than there is to insert the word \u201cused.\u201d In fact, the heading of that section of the 1988 Agreement, which includes the restrictive covenant, contains the words \u201cLand Use\u201d but does not contain the word \u201cdevelop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In addition, even if the word \u201cdeveloped\u201d were inserted into the key language of the restrictive covenant, there is no good reason for confining its meaning to the planning, design or construction of the physical facility. A perusal of dictionary definitions discloses that the term \u201cdevelop\u201d has various meanings and connotations, depending upon the context. <em>See, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged, </em>at 618 (1981). The Court of Special Appeals at one point in its opinion seemed to recognize this when it stated that the September 2003 contract between the College and the Board of Education \u201cis clearly directed at the <em>development </em>and maintenance of worthwhile educational programs, not at the <em>development </em>of physical facilities.\u201d (Emphasis added). If the restrictive covenant had said \u201ceducational facilities <em>developed </em>in conjunction with the\u201d Board of Education, the language could reasonably have referred to various educational programs. An \u201ceducational facility\u201d is more than simply bricks, mortar, and the other physical attributes of a building.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Furthermore, as pointed out by SDC, the interpretation of the restrictive covenant by the London Towne Association and the Court of Special Appeals could lead to unreasonable consequences. Suppose, for example, that upon completion of the educational facility on the six-acre parcel, the College had decided against using the facility, but the Board of Education had decided that the facility would be appropriate for and needed for a public school, and the Board had purchased the property from SDC to use as a public school. Under the Association\u2019s and the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 interpretation, the Board of Education\u2019s use of the property for a public school would violate the restrictive covenant because the Board had not been involved in the planning design, or construction of the physical facility.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Also, if the London Towne Association\u2019s request to demolish the existing facility were granted by the Circuit Court, SDC could re-build on the six-acre parcel the identical facility for use by the College, as long as SDC consulted with the Board of Education with respect to the planning, design, and construction of the new facility. Such an interpretation of the covenant does not comport with common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">It is undisputed that the facility on the six-acre parcel is an \u201ceducational\u201d facility. It is also undisputed that, pursuant to contract, the Anne Arundel County Board of Education has agreed to use the facility and is in fact using the facility. Consequently, the facility complies with the requirement that it shall be \u201cin conjunction with the Anne Arundel County Board of Education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY.

The parties have also informed us that the individual plaintiff, John Yannone, who had been a resident of the Smith River Colony community, has sold his home and has moved away from the area. Accordingly, the only plaintiff with standing to continue the challenge to the development of the six-acre parcel appears to be the London Towne Property Owners Association which was a party to the 1988 Agreement.
