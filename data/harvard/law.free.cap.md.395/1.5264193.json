On August 18, 2005, the Respondent, Alphonzo J. Butler, was personally served with process issued by the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The Respondent filed his answer to the charges contained in the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action on September 2, 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">\u201cOn December 15, 2005, the Court entered a Scheduling Order, which provided that all written discovery responses were due by January 6, 2006, that all discovery were to conclude on or before January 17, 2006, that all motions were to be filed on or before February 3, 2006, and set trial for March 9, 2006.

The Respondent failed to appear for his deposition and failed to respond to Petitioner\u2019s telephone messages and letters requesting to reschedule his deposition. Accordingly, on February 3, 2006, Petitioner filed a Motion for Sanctions against Respondent, which was granted in part by the Court on March 14, 2006.

Butler (hereinafter \u2018the Respondent\u2019) was originally admitted to the Bar of the Court of Appeals of Maryland on December 17, 1996. The Respondent maintained a law office in Silver Spring, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">\u201cOn May 9, 2002, the Respondent opened an escrow account, titled \u2018Alphonzo J. Butler, LLC, Attorney Trust Account\u2019, Account No. 970069156, (hereinafter \u2018Attorney Trust Account\u2019) with Allfirst Bank, which subsequently merged with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (hereinafter \u2018M &amp; T Bank\u2019). On or about May 10, 2004, the Respondent received $675 from his client Seymour Clarke to pay a child support obligation owed to Mr. Clarke\u2019s ex-wife, Jo-Ann Clarke. On May 12, 2004, the Respondent deposited the $675 from Mr. Clarke to his Attorney Trust Account. After the deposit was made, the Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account had a balance of $1,307.13.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">\u201cOn or about May 13, 2004, the Respondent issued from his Attorney Trust Account, on behalf of his client, Mr. Clarke, Check No.2037 made payable to Jo-Ann Clarke in the amount of $675. Check No.2037 was not presented to the bank for payment until June 17, 2004, at which time the Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account had only a balance of $62.13. At the time Ms. Clarke presented Check No.2037 of $675 for payment, Respondent had insufficient funds in his Attorney Trust Account to cover the amount of the check. M <em>&amp; </em>T Bank, nevertheless, honored the check, resulting in an overdraft on Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account and a negative balance of \u2014 $612.87.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">\u201cOn or about June 25, 2004, Bar Counsel received written notification dated June 18, 2004 from M &amp; T Bank of the overdraft on Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account. On June 29, 2004, Bar Counsel sent a letter to Respondent requesting his written response to the June 18, 2004 overdraft notice from M &amp; T Bank of his Attorney Trust Account, including copies of his client ledger cards, deposit slips, canceled checks, and monthly bank statements of his escrow account from the period beginning January 2004 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>June 2004. The Respondent sent his written response dated July 22, 2004 claiming that the overdraft was an \u2018unintentional bookkeeping error\u2019 and a \u2018mistake.\u2019 The Respondent further claimed that he was planning to \u2018shut down\u2019 his solo private practice as he had recently accepted an offer and would be working as an Assistant Public Defender in August 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-4\">\u201cThen, or about July 9, 2004, Bar Counsel received a second written notification from M &amp; T Bank dated July 7, 2004 of an overdraft on Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account as a result of presentment for payment in the amount of $10.71 by \u2018Global Pay Global STL.\u2019 M &amp; T Bank honored the check, but it caused an overdraft on Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account. As a result of the second overdraft, Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account had a negative balance of $-623.58. On or about July 15, 2004, Bar Counsel received a third written notification from M &amp; T Bank dated July 8, 2004 of an overdraft on Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account as a result of presentment for payment by \u2018American Express Collection\u2019 in the amount of $5.00. M &amp; T Bank again honored the check, but it caused an overdraft on Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account, resulting in a negative balance of $-628.58. On July 15, 2004, Bar Counsel sent another letter to Respondent requesting his written response to the overdraft notices from M &amp; T Bank of his Attorney Trust Account. The Respondent did not respond to that letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">\u201cOn or about October 13, 2004, Bar Counsel received yet a fourth written notification from M <em>&amp; </em>T Bank dated October 5, 2004 of an overdraft on Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account as a result of presentment for payment in the amount of $5.00 by \u2018American Express Collection\u2019. M &amp; T Bank honored the check, resulting in an overdraft on Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account and a negative balance of $-643.58. On October 14, 2004, the office of Bar Counsel sent a letter to Respondent requesting his written response and explanation to the multiple overdraft notices from M <em>&amp; </em>T Bank of his Attorney Trust Account and additional bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>records of his escrow account. The Respondent did not respond to that letter. Additional letters were sent to the Respondent by the office of Bar Counsel requesting for his written response to the various overdraft notices and for additional information. The Respondent did not respond at all to those letters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-4\">\u201cConsequently, the Petitioner subpoenaed relevant bank records, including copies of monthly bank statements, canceled checks, and deposit slips, of Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account. The records showed that from the period beginning January 2004 and November 2004, the Respondent used his Attorney Trust Account for personal and business matters. For instance, Respondent made payments to Pepeo and Verizon from his Attorney Trust Account. Furthermore, automatic monthly debits were made from Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account for payment to \u2018Global pay Global STL\u2019 and \u2018American Express Collection.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">\n<em>\u201cConclusions of Law</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">\u201cThis Court concludes that the Respondent, after depositing client funds in his Attorney Trust Account on behalf of his client Seymour Clarke to pay for child support obligation owed to Mr. Clarke\u2019s ex-wife, Jo-Ann Clarke, failed to properly hold said funds in escrow, thereby violating Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct (MRPC) 1.15(a). After the Respondent deposited $675 into his Attorney Trust Account, he knowingly withdrew monies from the account and reduced the balance below the amount to which Ms. Clarke was entitled and used said client monies for his personal purpose, thereby violating MRPC 8.4(a), (b), and (c), Maryland Rule 16-609 and Md. Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 10-306 and 10-606. The Respondent never replenished his Attorney Trust Account of the improperly withdrawn funds and never repaid M &amp; T Bank for honoring the multiple overdrafts on his account. The Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account maintained a negative balance. The Respondent further used his Attorney Trust Account to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>personal and business debts, thereby violating Maryland Rule 16-607.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-4\">\u201cThe Respondent violated MRPC 8.1(b) when he knowingly and repeatedly failed to respond to lawful demands for information from the office of Bar Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">\u201cTaken in its totality, the Respondent\u2019s conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice and therefore violated MRPC 8.4(d).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">(Alteration added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Recently in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Lee, </em>393 Md. 546, 558, 903 A.2d 895 (2006) we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">The Court of Appeals exercises original jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings. This Court has the ultimate authority to decide whether a lawyer has violated the professional rules. We accept a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless we determine that they are clearly erroneous. As to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, our consideration is essentially <em>de novo, </em>even where default orders and judgments have been entered at the hearing level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">Either party may file post-hearing written exceptions to the findings and conclusions of the hearing judge. Maryland Rule 16-758.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(2) provides: (2) Findings of fact. (A) If no exceptions are filed. If no exceptions are field [sic], the Court may treat the findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions, in any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>(B) If exceptions are filed. If exceptions are filed, the Court of Appeals shall determine whether the findings of fact have been proven by the requisite standard of proof set out in Rule 16-757(b). The Court may confine its review to the findings of fact challenged by the exceptions. The Court shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\">Thus, if no exceptions are filed timely, we accept the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact as established for the purposes of determining the appropriate sanction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Neither Petitioner nor Respondent filed exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Therefore, as discussed <em>supra, </em>for the purposes of determining the appropriate sanction, we accept Judge Rupp\u2019s findings of fact as established. Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a), 8.1(b), 8.4(a), (b), (c), (d), Maryland Rules 16-607 and 16-609, and \u00a7\u00a7 10-306 and 10-606 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code. Based upon our independent review of the record, and for the reasons set forth below, we agree with the conclusions of law and hold that Bar Counsel presented clear and convincing evidence of Respondent\u2019s wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">We turn, then, to the appropriate sanction. The primary objective of this Court, in matters of attorney discipline, is \u201cto protect the public, promote general and specific deterrence, and maintain the integrity of the legal profession.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Roberts, </em>394 Md. 137, 904 A.2d 557 (2006); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Clark, </em>363 Md. 169, 184, 767 A.2d 865, 873 (2001) (\u201cThe appropriate sanction depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including consideration of any mitigating factors.\u201d). Petitioner recommends that we impose the sanction of disbarment. Respondent has failed to make any recommendation. We adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s recommendation and impose the sanction of disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. DiCicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 802 A.2d 1014 (2002), the hearing judge determined that DiCicco violated MRPC 1.15(a) by failing to hold the property of his clients or third persons separate from his own, occasionally using his escrow account \u201cas if it also served as his personal bank account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675-76, 802 A.2d at 1021-22 (footnote omitted). This Court agreed with the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Respondent\u2019s usage of his escrow account as a personal bank account constituted a violation of MRPC 1.15(a). In the instant case, Respondent used his Attorney Trust Account for personal and business matters, making payments to Pepeo, Verizon, Global pay Global STL, and American Express Collection. Here, we find, as we did in <em>DiCicco, </em>that Respondent\u2019s conduct frustrated the purpose of MRPC 1.15(a) and in so doing violated the rule.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Similarly, in using his Attorney Trust Account to pay personal and business debts, Respondent violated Md. Rule 16-607, requiring that \u201c[t]he portion [... of funds] belonging to the attorney [...] shall be withdrawn promptly when the attorney [...] becomes entitled to the funds ...,\u201d and Rule 16-609 prohibiting an attorney from \u201cpledging] any funds required by these Rules to be deposited in an attorney trust account....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In the present case, Respondent withdrew client funds from his Attorney Trust Account, to which he was in no way entitled, in violation of Maryland Rule 16-607 and 16-609. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Herman, </em>380 Md. 378, 844 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>A.2d 1181 (2004) (holding that it was a violation of Maryland Rules 16-607 and 16-609 for an attorney to borrow money in the form of a home equity loan, and to then deposit the borrowed money into his trust account in order to pay the amount owed to his client). Mr. Clarke had a child support obligation, requiring that he make a payment to his ex-wife, Ms. Clarke. Mr. Clarke entrusted Respondent with the payment amount, directing Respondent to make the payment to Ms. Clarke on his behalf. In turn, Respondent deposited the funds into his Attorney Trust Account. Respondent then issued a check to Ms. Clarke, but failed to maintain the funds in his Attorney Trust Account until the check cleared. Accordingly, Respondent violated \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code when he used client funds for a purpose other than that for which the money was entrusted to him. In violating \u00a7 10-306, Respondent also violated \u00a7 10-606(b) which provides, \u201c[a] person who willfully violates any provision of Subtitle 3, Part I of this title [...], is guilty of a misdemeanor.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Moreover, MRPC 8.4(a) provides that \u201c[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to [... ] violate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct....\u201d Because we determine that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a), we conclude that Respondent\u2019s conduct also violated MRPC 8.4(a). MRPC 8.4(b) prohibits a lawyer from \u201ccommit[ting] a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness.... \u201d We hold that when Respondent deposited client funds in his trust account, and intentionally failed to maintain those funds in his account, he committed a criminal act in violation of MRPC 8.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 741 A.2d 1143 (1999), we held that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a), (b), and (c) and BOP \u00a7 10-306 and thus found that Respondent was dishonest within the meaning of MRPC 8.4(c). MRPC 8.4(c) prohibits an attorney from \u201cengaging] in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.\u201d In <em>Sheridan, </em>Respondent, after receiving two settlement checks, deposited the checks in his escrow account but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>failed to keep the collected funds separate, later withdrawing them and applying the money for his own professional and personal use. <em>Id. </em>at 18, 741 A.2d at 1153. We noted that \u201cRespondent exhibited a lack of probity, integrity and straightforwardness in his conduct regarding his client and [...] his actions were dishonest____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 741 A.2d at 1156-57. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we conclude, similarly, that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a) and \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. As noted <em>supra, </em>Respondent used client funds to pay personal and business debts. Accordingly, we find, as we did in <em>Sheridan, </em>that Respondent\u2019s actions were dishonest and in violation of MRPC 8.4(c)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">In addition, MRPC 8.1(b) requires that a lawyer, in connection with a disciplinary matter, must not \u201cknowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority....\u201d Bar Counsel sent numerous requests to Respondent requesting that he supply information necessary to its investigation. Bar Counsel sent requests to Respondent dated July 15, 2004 and October 14, 2004, to which he never responded. Respondent had an affirmative duty to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information, yet failed to do so, in clear violation of MRPC 8.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Cherry-Mahoi, </em>we said: \u201cThis Court [... ] has found conduct constituting the misappropriation of client or third party funds to be \u2018prejudicial to the administration of justice\u2019 in violation of Rule 8.4(d).\u201d 388 Md. 124, 159, 879 A.2d 58, 80 (2005). We noted that MRPC 8.4(d) is violated when an attorney\u2019s conduct \u201cnegatively impacts [... ] the public\u2019s image or the perception of the courts or the legal profession....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 879 A.2d at 80 (citation omitted). Because we find that Respondent\u2019s conduct constituted an intentional misappropriation of client funds, his conduct also violated MRPC 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Respondent violated numerous provisions of the MRPC, the Maryland Rules, and the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code. The most egregious violation committed by the Respondent was the intentional misappropriation of funds. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Williams, </em>335 Md. 458, 644 A.2d 490 (1994). We have held that the \u201c[mjisappropriation of funds by an attorney is an act infected with deceit and dishonesty and ordinarily will result in disbarment in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 406, 773 A.2d 463, 480 (2001) (citation omitted); <em>see also Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sabghir, </em>350 Md. 67, 84, 710 A.2d 926, 934 (1998).

Unlike the instant case, in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. DiCicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 802 A.2d 1014 (2002), we held that there was no intentional misappropriation of client funds. In <em>DiCicco, </em>because there was an \"absence of fraudulent intent and [\u2022..] lack of evidence that any client suffered financial loss resulting from Respondent's misconduct[ ]\" we indefinitely suspended DiCicco with the right to seek reinstatement after 90 days. <em>Id. </em>at 688, 802 A.2d at 1028. In the instant case, unlike <em>DiCicco, </em>Respondent intentionally misappropriated client funds. Therefore, indefinite suspension is an inappropriate sanction. Because Respondent intentionally misappropriated client funds, we impose, instead, the sanction of disbarment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b42-7\">. In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>Respondent was indefinitely suspended from the practice of law after having been found to have violated Rules 1.15(a), (b), and(c), and Rule 8.4(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct and Business Occupations and Professions Article \u00a7 10-306. In <em>Sheridan, </em>we found \"mitigating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction than disbarment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 741 A.2d at 1161. Sheridan acknowledged that his conduct was, at times, unethical. Furthermore, we found it significant that the hearing judge \"found that Respondent did not act intentionally when he violated his ethical duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By contrast, in the instant case, we are not presented with any mitigating circumstances nor are we led to believe that Respondent unintentionally violated his ethical duties. Therefore, although we find, as we did in <em>Sheridan, </em>that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a), Business Occupations Article \u00a7 10-306, and MRPC 8.4(c), the appropriate sanction is not indefinite suspension, rather, disbarment is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b43-5\">. Respondent neither attended the hearing before Judge Rupp concerning this matter nor the proceedings in this Court. In addition, Respondent failed to file exceptions to the hearing judge's findings of fact and conclusions of law, or Petitioner\u2019s recommendation for disbarment. Assistant Bar Counsel reports to the Court that she spoke with Respondent the day before oral argument. During the course of the conversation, Respondent indicated that he would attend oral argument but would orally request a postponement of the oral argument because he intended to obtain representation in this matter. Respondent's intended counsel, however, required that he obtain a postponement before agreeing to represent him. Also, Respondent indicated to Assistant Bar Counsel that he had been sick in May and June, walked into the emergency room at the end of May and was not discharged until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>end of June. Further, he said that he was, at some point, in the ICU and diagnosed with diabetes. On the day of oral argument, this Court received notification via facsimile that Respondent was being treated in the Emergency Department at Washington Adventist Hospital. The facsimile was written on \"Washington Adventist Hospital Emergency Department\u201d letterhead and signed by a registered nurse. It failed, however, to indicate Respondent\u2019s condition or diagnosis, or any other reason for this Court to find that this matter should not proceed as scheduled for oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
