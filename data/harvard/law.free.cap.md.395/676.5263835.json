Respondent and Ms. Frisby signed a contingent fee retainer agreement on or about September 25, 2001. At the time she retained Respondent, Ms. Frisby gave Respondent her original medical bills and documents relating to her automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\u201cIn 2001, Respondent sent letters to Ms. Frisby\u2019s medical care providers requesting Ms. Frisby\u2019s medical records. On or about January 9, 2002, Respondent sent a letter to the opposing party\u2019s insurance company, State Farm Insurance Company, with copies of Ms. Frisby\u2019s medical records and bills, requesting to discuss settlement. After January 2002, Respondent ceased communication with Ms. Frisby. Respondent did not return Ms. Frisby\u2019s phone calls to his office or his cellular phone. Upon the request of Ms. Frisby, meetings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>were scheduled between Respondent and Ms. Frisby. Respondent cancelled or failed to appear for these appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">\u201cIn March 2003, Ms. Frisby went to James L. Rhodes, Esquire, Respondent\u2019s former law partner, to assist her in obtaining her file. On March 31, 2003, Mr. Rhodes sent a letter to Respondent requesting the return of Ms. Frisby\u2019s file. However, Respondent did not respond to that letter. Accordingly, on or about May 21, 2003, Mr. Rhodes sent another letter to Respondent, via certified mail, requesting the return of Ms. Frisby\u2019s file. On or about June 6, 2003, Respondent sent a letter to Mr. Rhodes refusing to return Ms. Frisby her file until she paid him $2000, which he claimed was an \u2018earned fee in the event of termination before the completion of the representation.\u2019 Ms. Frisby requested that Respondent provide her with his statement of services and accounting for his claim of $2000 in fees. Respondent, however, did not respond to her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">\u201cOn November 13, 2003, Ms. Frisby discharged Respondent and retained a new attorney, Phillip L. Potts. Esquire, who also requested that Respondent return Ms. Frisby\u2019s file. Respondent still did not return Ms. Frisby\u2019s original documents. Approximately four (4) months later, on or about March 9, 2004, Respondent filed a one page complaint in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City on behalf of Ms. Frisby. The complaint was hand-written on a form Statement of Claim. Respondent did not advise Ms. Frisby or her new attorney that he filed a complaint on her behalf. The complaint was filed after Ms. Frisby filed a grievance complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland. No other action was taken after Respondent filed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">\u201cOther than writing the letters to the medical care providers and the insurance company, Respondent performed no other work on behalf of Ms. Frisby during the time he was retained by her. Although Respondent filed a complaint in court on behalf of Ms. Frisby, he did so several months after Ms. Frisby discharged him and he failed to advise her that he had done so. During the time he was retained by Ms. Frisby, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Respondent failed to communicate with her regarding the status of her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">\u201cOn May 16, 2003, Bar Counsel sent a letter to Respondent requesting copies of his file for Ms. Frisby. On or about May 29, 2003, Respondent sent a letter to Bar Counsel stating that he would not release his file of Ms. Frisby to Bar Counsel until he received an executed release by Ms. Frisby, and to direct any further communication to his attorney, Jill P. Carter, Esquire. On June 26, 2003, Deputy Bar Counsel sent Respondent\u2019s purported attorney, Ms. Carter, the requested executed authorization of Ms Frisby permitting the release of her file. Ms. Carter later advised Assistant Bar Counsel Marianne J. Lee, that she was not representing Respondent. On October 14, 2003 and November 3, 2003, Assistant Bar Counsel Lee sent letters to Respondent, again requesting copies of his client file of Ms. Frisby. Respondent did not respond to those letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">\n<em>\u201cComplaint of Wanda Owens</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">\u201cIn September 2000, Respondent was retained by Wanda Owens (hereinafter \u2018Ms. Owens\u2019) to represent her in a personal injury claim. Ms. Owens was injured in September 2000, after a fall at Lexington Market in Baltimore, Maryland. Respondent agreed to handle Ms. Owens\u2019 matter on a contingent fee basis. The terms of the contingent fee agreement were not communicated to Ms. Owens in writing. However, Respondent advised Ms. Owens that he would file suit on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">\u201cDuring the course of the representation, Ms. Owens tried to communicate with Respondent. Ms. Owens called Respondent on several occasions, often leaving messages asking Respondent to contact her. However, many of her phone calls went unreturned. From approximately September 2001 until September 2003, Respondent took no action on behalf of Ms. Owens with respect to her claim. Accordingly, on or about September 4, 2003, Ms. Owens sent a letter to Respondent discharging him and requesting that he surrender her papers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>to her, so that she could retain a new attorney. Respondent did not return Ms. Owens\u2019 papers to her. On September 8, 2003, or four (4) days after being terminated by Ms. Owens, Respondent filed a Complaint in the District Court of Maryland on behalf of Ms. Owens against the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City, Andy\u2019s Steaks and Subs, Cajun Joe\u2019s Take Out, and Berger\u2019s Food. Respondent presented a check drawn from his business account, in the amount of $20, to the Clerk of the District Court of Maryland, for the filing fee. However, the check was returned for insufficient funds. The court clerk notified Respondent of his returned check, but he did not present a new check to the District Court of Maryland for payment of the filing fee until November 3, 2003, two (2) months after the initial filing of the Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">On or about September 10, 2003, the District Court of Maryland sent a Memorandum notifying Respondent that the writs of summons could not be issued until he provided to the court clerk the names of the officers, resident agents or persons authorized to accept service for the named defendants in the Owens Complaint.

Despite repeated requests, Respondent failed to provide copies of his client file of Ms. Owens to the Office of Bar Counsel. On October 14, 2003 and November 25, 2003, Assistant Bar Counsel Lee sent letters to Respondent requesting copies of his file of Ms. Owens. On or about December 15, 2003, Respondent sent a letter to Ms. Lee stating that he would provide her with \u2018all requested information prior to the Christmas holiday.\u2019 However, Respondent did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">s-c <em>% </em>sfc</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">\n<em>\u201cComplaint of Star J.

Respondent agreed to handle Ms. Branch\u2019s matter for a flat fee of $5,000, plus a ten percent (10%) contingency fee of any monies collected from settlement or trial. Respondent and Ms. Branch executed the retainer agreement on April 24, 2002. Ms. Branch paid Respondent $3,000 on March 11, 2002. She paid the remaining balance of the $5,000 flat fee, in installments, by May 28, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">\u201cOn September 23, 2002, Respondent filed a Complaint for housing discrimination in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on behalf of Ms. Branch against Bren Brook Apartments and its management company, Equity Management, Inc. On February 21, 2003, the Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint. On March 11, 2003, the Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment. On March 28, 2003, Respondent filed a Response to Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment; however, the response was insufficient and did not comply with the Maryland Rules. Respondent\u2019s one-page Response was approximately three sentences long and contained a completely different caption than that of Ms. Branch\u2019s case, naming the Defendants as \u2018General Motors.\u2019 Respondent also failed to attach an affidavit in response to Defendants\u2019 allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">\u201cA hearing on Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment and Plaintiff s Response was set for August 7, 2003.

On or about August 6, 2003, Respondent allegedly prepared a Request for Postponement of the August 7, 2003 hearing, but he did not file it with the Court. Moreover, Respondent did not advise Ms. Branch of the August 7, 2003 hearing. Furthermore, Respondent did not advise Ms. Branch that he would not appear at the August 7, 2003 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">\u201cOn August 7, 2003, The Honorable Patrick Cavanaugh granted Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Motion for Summary Judgment. Respondent did not advise Ms. Branch that the Court granted the motions. On September 8, 2008, Respondent filed an Interlocutory Appeal in the Court of Special Appeals. However, Respondent failed to file a Prehearing Information Report, as required by Maryland Rule 8-205. On November 3, 2003, the Court of Special Appeals dismissed the appeal filed by Respondent for failure to file an Information Report. Respondent did not advise Ms. Branch that the Court of Special Appeals dismissed her appeal. Respondent took no other action on behalf of Ms. Branch after the dismissal of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">\u201cRespondent essentially abandoned Ms. Branch in her civil matter. After retaining Respondent, Ms. Branch tried to communicate with him, via telephone; however, Respondent failed to answer or return her calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">\u201cDuring Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, Respondent failed to respond to requests for information from the Office of Bar Counsel.

After receipt of the $3,500, Respondent took no action on behalf of Mr. Gresham and did not keep his client informed about the status of his representation. Respondent also did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>not respond to inquiries made by Mr. and Mrs. Gresham. Based upon Respondent\u2019s failure to provide services of any value and to pursue any action advancing the client\u2019s interests, the fees accepted and retained by Respondent were unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">\u201cAlthough Respondent stopped all work on Mr. Gresham\u2019s matter, he did not take steps to protect Mr. Gresham\u2019s interest, such as giving reasonable notice that the representation was terminated and refunding any advance payment of fee that had not been earned.

Respondent agreed to represent Ms. Hawkins on a contingent fee basis. Respondent and Ms. Hawkins signed the contingent retainer agreement on April 30, 2003. After their meeting on April 30, 2003, Respondent referred Ms. Hawkins to medical care providers for treatment of her injuries incurred during the automobile accident and advised her that he would recover payment of her medical bills on her behalf. When Ms. Hawkins informed Respondent of her medical bills, Respondent advised her that he was working on her matter. Respondent, however, had performed no work on behalf of Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Hawkins. Moreover, Respondent did not respond to inquiries made by Ms. Hawkins regarding the status of her matter. Respondent failed to return Ms. Hawkins\u2019 telephone calls and messages to his office and cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">\u201cAfter Ms. Hawkins filed a complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission, Respondent called Ms. Hawkins and told her that he was no longer her lawyer and that he was going to sue her for $200,000 for defamation. Although Respondent stopped all work on Ms. Hawkins\u2019 case and gave notice terminating his representation of Ms. Hawkins, he did not take steps to protect Ms. Hawkins\u2019 interests, including surrendering papers to which Ms. Hawkins was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">\n<em>\u201cComplaint of Ernestine E. Easy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">\u201cIn February 2004, Ernestine E. Easy (hereinafter \u2018Ms. Easy\u2019) retained Respondent to represent Shakia Rouzer (hereinafter \u2018Ms. Rouzer\u2019) in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City on charges of first and second-degree assault, destruction of property, use of deadly weapon, and burglary in the first degree. The charges arose from a domestic dispute with Ms. Rouzer\u2019s child\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">\u201cThe initial contact to employ Respondent was made by Ms. Rouzer\u2019s great aunt, Ernestine E. Easy (hereinafter \u2018Ms. Easy\u2019) and Ms. Rouzer\u2019s mother, Angela Lacruze (hereinafter \u2018Ms. Lacruze\u2019). Respondent agreed to represent Ms. Rouzer in her criminal matter in District Court for the fee of $1,500. Respondent and Ms. Lacruze signed the retainer agreement on or about February 25, 2004. Ms. Easy paid Respondent a sum of $400 on February 25, 2004. In addition, Ms. Lacruze paid Respondent $1500 on that same date. Combined, the payments made by Ms. Easy and Ms. Lacruze exceeded the $1,500 provided in the retainer agreement for the District Court representation of Ms. Rouzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">\u201cMs. Rouzer\u2019s preliminary hearing was scheduled for March 23, 2004. However, Respondent did not enter his appearance on behalf of Ms. Rouzer. Moreover, on March 23, 2004, Respondent failed to appear for the preliminary hearing. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>a result of Respondent\u2019s failure to enter his appearance on behalf of Ms. Rouzer, an Assistant Public Defender was assigned to represent Ms. Rouzer on the day of the hearing. During the preliminary hearing, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney entered a nolle prosequi on the charges of first degree assault and burglary in first degree, and placed the remaining charges on the stet docket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Based on these findings of fact, the hearing court concluded that the respondent violated each of the Rules of Professional Conduct with which he was charged. Thus, in each of the cases, the court found a violation of Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d), and 8.4(d). With respect to the Rule 1.3 violations, the hearing court\u2019s conclusion followed from the respondent\u2019s having, \u201cafter being engaged to provide legal services to Ms. Frisby, failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in providing legal services for which he had been engaged.\u201d The Rule 1.4 violations were premised on the respondent\u2019s failure to keep his clients reasonably informed as to the status of their matters and to respond to inquiries regarding the status of their cases \u201cto the extent reasonably necessary to permit [them] to make informed decisions regarding the representation,\u201d as, for example, in the case of Wanda Owens, \u201cby not explaining that he had filed a complaint on her behalf after she discharged him and that he had failed to perfect service on the defendants.\u201d That, upon being terminated, the respondent did not take steps in any of the cases to protect the interests of his clients constituted the basis for finding the 1.16 violations. The hearing court concluded, from the totality of the respondent\u2019s conduct in each case, that the administration of justice was prejudiced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In Frisby, Owens, Branch, Gresham and Washington, the hearing court, in addition, concluded that the respondent committed a violation of Rule 8.1(b). That conclusion followed from the factual findings in those cases that the respondent failed to respond to the lawful demands for information made by Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>There were more violations found. In Frisby, the hearing court concluded that, by not abiding by the client\u2019s decisions concerning her objectives and by not consulting her as to the approach to be taken, the respondent also violated Rule 1.2, while in Branch, the additional violation found was Rule 1.1, the hearing court determining that the respondent\u2019s representation was not competent, and in Gresham, Washington and Easy, it was a Rule 1.5(a) violation. The latter violation was, as characterized by the hearing court, \u201cthat Respondent did not render services of any value, Respondent collected and has retained an unreasonable legal fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Finally, in Hawkins and Easy, the hearing court determined that the respondent engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation, in violation of Rule 8.4(c). In Hawkins, the dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation consisted of the respondent\u2019s \u201cinform[ing] Ms. Hawkins that he was still working on her personal injury matter, when, in fact, he had not done any work on her case.\u201d In Easy, it was two-fold, first by misrepresenting to Bar Counsel the \u201csole\u201d reason for the dismissal of Ms. Rouzer\u2019s case and then by failing to pay the civil default judgment entered against him in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Neither the petitioner nor the respondent took exceptions to the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. As indicated, the respondent did not appear for the hearing on the default judgment. He did, however, appear at oral argument before us and seek to challenge the findings and conclusions, which he neither challenged below nor to which he filed exceptions in this Court. As we did at argument, we decline to consider the respondent\u2019s belated challenges.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The petitioner filed <em>Petitioner\u2019s Recommendation For Sanction, </em>in which it seeks the respondent\u2019s disbarment. Although the respondent appeared at oral argument, he did not file any pleading; he simply asked for a postponement and, that request having been denied, sought to avoid disbarment or significant sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">In support of its disbarment recommendation, the petitioner emphasizes the number of cases in which the respondent was found to have violated Rules of Professional Conduct, the nature of the conduct those violations reflect \u2014 implicating competence, diligence, client relations, the quality of the legal process, and personal honesty and integrity \u2014 and the fact that the respondent, in nearly every case did not cooperate with Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation. It also relies on <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. 277, 793 A.2d 535 (2002). In that case, the respondent was found to have committed multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Responsibility, including, as in this case, Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(a) 1.16(d), 8.1(b) and 8.4(c) and (d), arising out of six separate complaints. The respondent was disbarred, despite having no prior disciplinary history. Our sanction decision was influenced, and dictated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>by \u201cthe volume and severity of the complaints against the respondent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293, 793 A.2d at 545. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGk\">\u201cRespondent has engaged in a pattern of conduct that only the most severe sanction of disbarment mil provide the protection to the public that this procedure is supposed to provide. Respondent\u2019s lack of diligence, his lack of preparation, his failure to communicate with his clients, his charging of unreasonable fees, his failure to account for and return monies, his misrepresentations, and his failure to comply with Bar Counsel\u2019s requests all lead us to the most severe sanction of disbarment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">What we said in <em>Wallace </em>is applicable largely to the facts of the case <em>sub judice. </em>In seven separate complaints, the respondent has been found: to have acted with a lack of diligence in handling his clients\u2019 matters; to have failed to communicate with his clients or respond to their inquiries; not to have acted to protect his clients\u2019 interest, upon the termination of his services; and to have acted, and performed his representational responsibilities, in a manner prejudicial to the administration of justice. In five of the eases, the respondent was found, in addition, to have failed to comply with Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information. In two of the cases, the respondent was found to have charged an unreasonable fee and to have engaged in dishonest, fraudulent and deceitful conduct, making misrepresentations to his clients. And there is no mitigating evidence or circumstances evident in this record. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. West, </em>378 Md. 395, 416, 836 A.2d 588, 600 (2003) (noting that \u201c[t]he primary distinction between <em>Wallace </em>and the instant case is the lack of mitigating factors in the former case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Accordingly, as in <em>Wallace </em>and, consistent with the petitioner\u2019s recommendation, the \u201cmost severe sanction of disbarment,\u201d 368 Md. at 293, 793 A.2d at 545, is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PUR<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>SUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761(c), FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST PATRICK J.

Rather than a response to the Petition, the respondent moved to dismiss the Petition. The hearing court denied that motion. Subsequently, the petitioner made a motion for an Order of Default, which the hearing court granted, the respondent, apparently having failed to respond to the motion, in addition to having failed to file a response. The respondent did move to vacate the order of default; however, he failed to appear at the hearing scheduled to address that motion. He also failed to appear at the subsequently scheduled default hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\">. The respondent asked for a postponement. When that request was denied, he asked for the opportunity to file a post hearing memorandum. That request was granted, it being understood that the effect or weight to be given to the respondent\u2019s filing would be determined by what was filed and its relevance. The respondent filed a Motion for Appropriate Relief. In that Motion, he alleges that, because he never received the hearing court\u2019s findings and conclusions, when Rule 16-757 requires that they be prepared and filed in the record and mailed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>each party, there has been a violation of Rule 16-757. He asks, therefore, that he not be sanctioned before he has had the opportunity to review the findings and conclusions and file exceptions, if appropriate. Alternatively, he urges the remand of this case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings. In its response, the petitioner prays that the Motion be denied. It maintains, first, that the respondent \"had ample notice of the fact that the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law were filed and many opportunities to review same.\u201d Second, the petitioner points out the respondent, who represented himself, is charged with the responsibility of keeping himself apprised of his case and if he does not do so, he has only himself to blame. Finally, the petitioner contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">\"As clearly indicated in the record, the respondent appears to have a habit of making excuses, such as claiming that he failed to receive notice, of seeking postponements at the last minute and/or misrepresenting facts to the court to compensate for his failures. The Respondent's conduct in this case perfectly exemplifies his misconduct in his representation of numerous clients and his continual disregard of his legal obligations to his clients and the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The respondent's Motion for Appropriate Relief is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
