Pursuant to Md.Code (2001, 2005 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 11-701 (f) and 11-704 of the Criminal Procedure Article,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he was required upon his release to register with his supervising authority as a sexually violent offender, and pursuant to \u00a7 11-705(d), to send written notice to the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services within seven days of any change in residences. He was convicted in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County of violating \u00a7 11-721 (a) by knowingly failing to notify the State of his change in residences as required by \u00a7 11-705(d). The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, holding that even though he was \u201chomeless,\u201d he knowingly failed to provide the written notice as required under \u00a7 11-705(d). <em>Jeandell v. State, </em>165 Md.App. 26, 41-42, 884 A.2d 739, 748 (2005). We disagree and shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The outcome in this case is dictated by our recent decision in <em>Twine v. State, </em>395 Md. 539, 910 A.2d 1132 (2006), in which we held that the statute in its current iteration did not to apply to a person who is in fact homeless because it is not possible to comply with the statutory requirements. In <em>Twine, </em>we reversed a conviction under \u00a7 11-721 (a) for the knowing failure to provide the written notice required by \u00a7 11-705(d). <em>Twine, </em>at 555, 910 A.2d 1141. Twine waived a jury and proceeded to trial before the court on a not guilty plea, agreed statement of facts, under which the parties stipulated that Twine was \u201chomeless\u201d and \u201cwas staying wherever he could.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543-45, 910 A.2d at 1134-35. Interpreting the sex offender statute, we held that a registrant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>a \u201cresidence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 ll-705(d) only if the registrant \u201chas a fixed location at which the registrant is living, and to which the registrant intends to return upon leaving it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554, 910 A.2d at 1140. Applying this interpretation, we then held that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilt, because the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that Twine \u201cchanged residences\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 11 \u2014 705(d). <em>Id. </em>at 558-55, 910 A.2d at 1140-41. We concluded that because the record indicated that Twine was homeless and \u201cstaying wherever he could,\u201d he had not acquired a residence within the contemplation of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 555, 910 A.2d at 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Petitioner was tried in a bench trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on the charge of knowingly failing to report a change in residences required by \u00a7 11 \u2014 705(d) in violation of \u00a7 ll-721(a). At the close of the State\u2019s evidence, petitioner moved for a judgment of acquittal, and to dismiss the charges. Petitioner\u2019s counsel argued that petitioner could not \u201ccomply with the statute as written\u201d because he was homeless, and because the sex offender registration statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to homeless defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The court denied the motion for a judgment of acquittal, and the following exchange took place between the court and petitioner\u2019s trial counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, which is the standard the Court must use, at this point, the Court will deny your motion and does the defense rest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I think for purposes of preserving the record, that in light of the statements that [the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney] said [suggesting that Jeandell may have acquired a residence and simply not reported it], I think that I would put Mr. Jeandell\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">THE COURT: Well, you can do that if you want to, but I find the facts as they have been testified to, that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Jeandell notified the authorities that he didn\u2019t have a place to go. And that what happened subsequently, a year after that notification was given, he still doesn\u2019t have a place to go, and he\u2019s arrested and subsequently prosecuted and he\u2019s here before the Court. That\u2019s on the record. I don\u2019t \u2014 and the State\u2019s argument is that he didn\u2019t notify them pursuant to the statute. <em>So, this is really more of a legal question than it is a factual question.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It is, Your Honor. But is Your Honor accepting that he did not, in fact, have a place to live? I mean, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">THE COURT: That\u2019s the evidence. That\u2019s what\u2019s before this Court. The man was homeless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Then, Your Honor, I am not putting any additional evidence on. We would rest, as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">I would renew my motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">The trial court found as a fact that \u201cthe man was homeless.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court stated that \u201cI find the facts as they have been testified to, that Mr. Jeandell notified the authorities that he didn\u2019t have a place to go. And that what happened subsequently, a year after that notification was given, he still doesn\u2019t have a place to go ...\u201d Because the Circuit Court found as a fact, and we are bound by that finding, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>petitioner was \u201chomeless\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have a place to go,\u201d he did not have a \u201cresidence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 11-705(d). <em>See Twine, </em>at 558-55, 910 A.2d at 1140-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. <em>Jeandell v. State, </em>165 Md.App. at 41-42, 884 A.2d at 748. We granted Jeandell\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Jeandell v. State, </em>390 Md. 500, 889 A.2d 418 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the evidence was sufficient to support petitioner\u2019s conviction, reasoning that \u201c[although Jeandell argues he did not have a new residence to register, \u00a7 ll-705(d) and \u00a7 11-721 required Jeandell to provide written notification to the Department that a change had occurred, regardless of whether he had settled into a new fixed place of residence.\u201d <em>Jeandell, </em>165 Md.App. at 41, 884 A.2d at 747. This conclusion was based on the court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cresidence\u201d as used in \u00a7 11-705(d) as meaning \u201cthe place where one actually lives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 884 A.2d at 744. The court also concluded that because he had filed change of residence notices previously, there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to find that petitioner was aware of the statutory requirements and that he knowingly failed to comply with them. <em>Id. </em>at 41-42, 884 A.2d at 747-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">We hold that the Court of Special Appeals erred in finding that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt because it applied an incorrect interpretation of \u201cresidence\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 ll-705(d). The term \u201cresidence\u201d connotes more than simply a \u201cliving location.\u201d <em>See Twine, </em>at 553-54, 910 A.2d at 1140. If \u201cresidence\u201d were simply a \u201cliving location,\u201d as the Court of Special Appeals found, a homeless registrant might have to notify the Department of a change in residences at least every seven days, if not more frequently, with the prospect that the new residence listed in each notice may be out of date and therefore inaccurate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such a result is inconsistent with the framework of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>It is clear that the trial court concluded that petitioner was \u201chomeless\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t have a place to go.\u201d Consequently, following the reasoning and holding of <em>Twine, </em>no rational trier of fact could conclude that petitioner had a \u201cresidence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 11-705(d). <em>See Twine, </em>at 555, 910 A.2d at 1141. Accordingly, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilt because the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that petitioner \u201cchanged residences\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 11-705.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY. COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY MONTGOMERY COUNTY.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-7\">. All subsequent section references herein shall be to the Criminal Procedure Article, Md.Code (2001, 2005 Cum.Supp.), unless otherwise indicated. After briefing and oral argument in the instant case, the General Assembly enacted changes to the sex offender registration scheme. <em>See </em>2006 1st Spec. Sess. Md. Laws, Chap. 4 (hereafter \u201cChap. 4\u201d). Although Chap. 4 changed some of the sections of the statute implicated by the issue <em>sub judice, </em>none of these changes altered any portion of the statute essential to our holding today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-9\">. In light of our holding, we do not reach the issue of whether the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to homeless offenders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b587-10\">. The trial court apparently had a discussion off the record with counsel and the defendant, as evidenced by the following statement made by the court on the record after the luncheon recess:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-11\">\u201cWell, obviously, because of the discussion that the Court had with the lawyers and with the defendant himself prior to the lunch break, this is an issue that the Court has been wrestling with because of the cumbersomeness of the statute and the reporting requirements that had to be made in this particular case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">Because the discussion was off the record, this Court is left in the dark as to what may have been said with respect to any facts bearing on petitioner\u2019s living condition and as to the basis for the finding of \u201chomelessness.\u201d If the discussion played any part in the court\u2019s decision, the conversation should have been on the record. Moreover, if the trial court found, as it appears that it did, that Jeandell was in fact homeless and had no place to go, the court should have granted the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b588-8\">. The Department is required to take certain actions each time a registrant changes residences. <em>See </em>\u00a7 11 \u2014 710(a)(1) (requiring notifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>tion of designated federal officials); \u00a7 11-710(a)(2)(f) (requiring notification of local state law officials); \u00a7 ll-710(a)(2)(ii) (requiring notification of out of state law officials); \u00a7 11-710(b) (requiring notification of campus police). The statute imposes mandatory duties upon state law enforcement officials and county school systems each time they receive notice of certain registrants' residences. <em>See </em>\u00a7 11 \u2014 709(b)(1) (requiring local law enforcement officials to notify county superintendents of a child sex offender\u2019s registration); \u00a7 1 l-709(b)(2) (requiring county superintendents to notify local principals of a child sex offender's registration). It would be impractical to require these actions to occur on a near daily basis. All duties related to a registrant's residence must be accomplished within five days of notice of a change in residences. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11-709 and 11-710. If a registrant moved on a daily basis, the information disseminated by the Department would always be stale.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
