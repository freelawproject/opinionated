The papers presented by the petitioner on this application show <em>\u201c </em>that he is a prisoner confined in the county jail of the city and county of blew York on execution issued out of the supreme court against the person of your petitioner for false and fraudulent pretenses in the purchase of goods, wares and merchandise.\u201d Consequently he is not entitled to his discharge. His proceedings not being just and fair, as defined, by the foregoing act, no relief can be granted to him. In <em>The Matter of Brady (reported in </em>8 <em>Hun, </em>437) the supreme court of this department at general term, March, 1876, in overruling the order of justice Donohue, discharging a prisoner in proceedings like the present, where it was shown that no part of any former estate or property of the prisoner was in the hands of any person, fraudulently or otherwise, except what passed to his assignee1 in insolvency, nevertheless held that the nature of the debts and the acts for which the judgment were obtained, if his acts were not just and fair, precluded him from applying for the benefit of the act, holding that the necessity of all the prisoners\u2019 proceedings being just and fair, applied not to the proceedings upon which the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>cation was made alone, but to those matters in the suit in which the judgment was obtained. This decision was affirmed in the court of appeals <em>(See </em>ante, 128).</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-5\">II. The act in question was created solely for the benefit of poor but unfortunate debtors, and not for the relief of the fraudulent debtor <em>(Matter of Watson, </em>2 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>429 ; <em>Gaul </em>agt. <em>Clark, </em>1 <em>N. Y. W. D., </em>209 ; <em>In re Walter Brady, </em>8 <em>Hun, 37; Matter of Pie, </em>10 <em>Abb. P. R., </em>409 ; <em>People </em>agt. <em>White, </em>14 <em>How. P. R., </em>429). In <em>The Case of Watson </em>(2 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>429), this court held as follows: \u201c The proceedings of 2 Revised Statutes, 31, which forbids a discharge if the debtor has fraudulently disposed of his property, or in case his proceedings have not been just and fair, contain no limitations as to time; and it is immaterial whether a fraud upon his creditors is perpetrated before the imprisonment in execution or intermediate the arrest and execution.\u201d And again, in <em>The Matter of Pie (supra), </em>the supreme court in this department laid down the rule : \u201cAh insolvent is not entitled to his discharge from an indebtedness which arose from his embezzlement of money and evidence of debt, which came to the possession of the prisoner, as a clerk, in the course of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-6\">III. The petitioner has before, under the same statute, applied to a justice of the supreme court of this state for his discharge, and on that application issue was duly joined, a trial had, and after, a full hearing the application was denied upon the merits, an order duly entered and served, from which no appeal has been taken, and no application made to open those proceedings or to amend the same. The doctrine of <em>res adjudieata </em>applies. The petitioner should have either moved to open these proceedings, or have appealed from the order so entered. He was entitled to such an appeal by the Laws of 1854, chapter 270, page 592 <em>(Matter of Livingston, </em>34 <em>N. Y., </em>557). <em>Certiorari </em>will remove to the supreme court for examination and review (2 <em>R. S., </em>49, 50; <em>and Laws of </em>1874, <em>chap. </em>280, <em>sec. </em>17; <em>Gardner </em>agt. <em>Commissioners, </em>10 <em>How. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>Pr. R., </em>181; <em>People ex rel. Louis </em>agt. <em>J. F. Daly, </em>4 <em>Hun, </em>641; <em>Morewood </em>agt. <em>Hollister, </em>6 <em>N. Y., </em>309). The principle of <em>res adjudioata </em>applies in cases like the present one <em>(Demorest </em>agt. <em>Day, </em>32 <em>N. Y., </em>281; <em>White </em>agt. <em>Coatsworth, </em>6 <em>N. Y., </em>137; <em>Yonkers and N. Y. F. I. Co. </em>agt. <em>Bishop, </em>1 <em>Daly, </em>449 ; <em>Powers </em>agt. <em>Witty, </em>42 <em>How. P. R., </em>352; <em>People ex rel. Lockwood </em>agt. <em>Akin, </em>4 <em>Hill, </em>606). In <em>Brown </em>agt. <em>Mayer, </em>in court of appeals <em>(13th June, </em>1876, <em>reported in Weekly Digest of September </em>11, 1876, <em>vol. </em>3, <em>No. </em>5, <em>p. </em>119), held that the date of <em>res adjudioata </em>applies not only to judgments, but to all judicial proceedings, whether made.in actions or summary or special proceedings, or by a judicial officer in matters properly submitted to their determination. <em>Matter of Rosenberg </em>(10 <em>Abb. </em>[N. <em>S.], </em>450), <em>Matter of Thomas </em>(10 <em>Abb. P. [N. </em>S.], 114), are cases in point. If the debtor can make a second application, after being defeated in the first, there can be no limit to the applications, and the creditor may better abandon his claim\" at once than think of opposing a discharge. Per Bronson, J., in <em>People </em>agt. <em>Allen </em>(4 <em>Hill, </em>608). In <em>The Matter of Andrew L. Roberts, </em>just decided by the general term of the supreme\" court of this department (10 <em>Hun, </em>253), the court has expressly decided that an application like the present one is, after the decision of justice Donohue, <em>res adjudioata. </em>The case of Roberts is in all respects identical with the one now before this court. Affirmed in court of \u25a0appeals <em>(See ante, </em>199).</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-5\">IV. The copy petition of the applicant is defective in not having attached thereto the usual sheriff\u2019s certificate of imprisonment. This is a defect going to the jurisdiction of these proceedings, and as these proceedings are purely statutory, they must be strictly followed, and if any defect occurs therein, it cannot be cured by amendment. <em>Quaere : </em>Can this court review and reverse an order of the sppreme court made in reference to a judgment of the latter court ? Certainly not. For the foregoing reasons the present application should be denied, with costs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>Peter Mitchell, </em>counsel for applicant, argued that the law should he construed according to the intent of the law-making power; that it had been the policy of the law-making power in all civilized countries to reduce the penalties for crimes, and to legislate in favor of the liberty of the citizen. He cited the casa of <em>The Royal Commission, </em>in 1836, which reduced the then thirty-six death penalties' to six, and since that time they have been reduced to two, and in this state the legislature intended to abolish imprisonment for debt, and had so modified previous laws that an application can now be made by an imprisoned debtor as often as he desires; that if it were not so, and if the debtor had no money and no friends to come forward to pay the judgment,-and his application were denied, he would have to remain in prison during his natural life, if the doctrine of <em>res adjudicata </em>applied, and claiming that the court of appeals had substantially reversed the opinion of the general term in the <em>Roberts Case, </em>which had sustained the <em>res adjudicata </em>theory.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b441-5\">Van Hoesen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AcF\">The decision of the general term of the supreme court <em>In the Matter of Andrew I. Roberts, </em>though not of binding authority in this court, is entitled to so much weight and consideration that I shall follow it and govern my action by it. Where there are in one city three courts of con\"current jurisdiction, good order requires that they shall so conduct their affairs that no one of them shall interrupt or weaken the force of the proceedings and adjudications of either the others. If counsel has discovered new evidence, which establishes the innocence of his client, let him apply to the court which formerly adjudged his client to be guilty of fraud, and he may there obtain leave to present his new proofs. Unless counsel expects the court of common pleas to reverse, modify or make void the decision of the supreme court, I can perceive no reason for making this application to the common pleas instead of applying to the supreme court for leave to renew in that court his former application.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
