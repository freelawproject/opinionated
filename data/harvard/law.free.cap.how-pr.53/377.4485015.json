The assignee, by the assignment, <em>accepted and agreed to perform certain trusts, </em>and the creditors, as they have a right to, demand now, an account of his stewardship. <em>Perhaps, </em>upon an accounting being had, the court will allow the assignee to prove' that he delivered over the assigned estate to the assignor, with the approval of the United States court, but as yet there is no evidence that he did, nor would it be proper until his account was being examined. But the creditors, by virtue of the assignment and its acceptance by the assignee, acquired certain <em>vested rights </em>in the assigned estate, of which they cannot be divested by the action of the United States court in the proceedings stated. They could only have been divested of these rights either by a bill in equity, or by their consent in the resolution of the creditors accepting the composition that .the assigned estate should be returned to the assignor; no evidence of either is offered, nor were such the facts. There is nothing to talk about; the creditors are entitled to an accounting; and the fact stated in the <em>assignor\u2019s </em>affidavit, that the petitioning creditors presented their claims and proofs of claims before the register in bankruptcy, and appeared during the examination and proceeding before the register, does not affect our position, nor would it even although it was charged that we proved our claim (which would be materially different to the statement made), nor if we <em>participated </em>in the proceedings before the register, instead of \u201c <em>appeared during the examination \u201d (Re Rosenberg, </em>2 <em>Bank. Reg., </em>81; <em>Re Robinson, 2 Nat. Bank Reg., </em>108). The creditors are clearly entitled to have an account rendered by this assignee of what property came into his hands under the assignment in question, and what he did with it, and upon that account being rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>by him will arise the question whether or not he is liable to the unsatisfied creditors of the assignor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b385-5\">Dated New York, <em>March </em>1, 1877.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b385-6\">At the close of the arguments, Larremore, <em>J., </em>made the following order:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Upon reading and filing the petition of Robert W.
