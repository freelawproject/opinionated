The invoice contained <em>\u2014First, </em>an item of 250 dozen finest ginger-ale at a specified value; and, <em>second, </em>250 dozen bottles at a specified value. The appraiser drew a red ink line embracing both items, and opposite this line wrote: \u201cGinger-ale, 20%. \u201d The collector thereupon exacted a duty of 20 per cent, upon the aggregate value of both ale and bottles. Due protest and appeal were made against the exaction of so much of this duty as was imposed upon the value of the bottles.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-14\">' <em>Frank P. Prichard, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-15\">The act of March 3, 1883, contains the following clause: \u201cGinger-ale or ginger-beer twenty per centum <em>ad valorem, </em>but no separate or additional duty shall be collected on bottles or jugs containing the same.\u201d This clearly exempts the bottles from any duty as bottles, and if they be considered as coverings of the goods they are also exempt by the provisions of the same act that the value of the usual and necessary coverings shall not be estimated in ascertaining dutiable value.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>To tlie contention of the government that tlie use of the words \u201cseparate or additional\u201d imply that the bottles are subject to duty as part of their contents there are two answers: <em>First, </em>a tax cannot be imposed by negative -words, and a provision that no separate duty shall be imposed is no warrant for imposing a duty as part of the ginger-ale; and, <em>second, </em>tlie words \u201cseparate and additional\u201d had been used in previous statutes to designate the duty imposed on bottles and were used in tlie present act simply to identify the duty which was removed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-4\"><em>John K. Valentine, </em>U. S. Atty., for defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-5\">The use of the words \u201cseparate or additional\u201d imply that there is a duty on the bottles not separate or additional, viz., a duty as part of the imported article which is a bottle of ginger-ale. Bottled ginger-ale derives its chief value from its bottled condition. It is the duty of tlie appraiser therefore to appraise its value in a bottled condition, and this is the meaning of the appraisement made by him.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-16\"> Reported by C.

Tlie ginger-ale was assessed and the duty exacted also on the bottles. Under the view of the law taken by the court, the duty was illegally exacted. The collector had no authority to require the importer to pay it. The importer, however, was bound to pay it, and having paid it, the only recourse he can have Is to sue to recover it back. He has done so; a,nd this suit is for the recovery of the duty on 250 dozen of bottles containing ginger-ale,\u2019 which, as I have already said, was illegally exacted by the collector, and this amount the plaintiff is entitled to recover. Your verdict will, therefore, be for the plaintiff for the amount of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
