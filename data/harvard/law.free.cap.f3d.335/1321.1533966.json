In December 2001, police officers observed Singh entering a vehicle that had been reported stolen. The vehicle also displayed a license plate number that was not registered to Singh. When the police stopped him, Singh refused to sign a citation for the improper license plate and he was arrested. During the vehicle impound inventory that followed the arrest, the police discovered eight United States passports, twenty-three birth certificates, sixty-six domestic driver\u2019s licenses, one international driver\u2019s license, two military identification cards, and two United States government identification cards inside the car. Of these documents, only the international driver\u2019s license, eighteen of the domestic driver\u2019s licenses, and one of the military identification cards contained Singh\u2019s likeness. Additionally, the police found numerous documents that supported these false identifications (including credit cards, video store membership cards, frequent flyer club cards, and telephone calling cards), as well as numerous photocopies of passport applications and approximately 100 photocopies of Virginia driver\u2019s licenses. Singh subsequently pleaded guilty to three counts: (1) possessing with the intent to unlawfully use or transfer five or more false identification documents, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(3); (2) possessing false identification documents with the intent to defraud the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(4); and (3) possessing a fraudulent passport, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a).</p>\n<p id=\"Aue\">The district court sentenced Singh under USSG \u00a7 2L2.1. United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 2L2.1 (Nov. 2002). Singh\u2019s base offense level of eleven, USSG \u00a7 2L2.1(a), was increased by nine levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2) because his offense involved 100 or more documents or passports, and it was increased by two more levels under USSG \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(4)(A) because he had a prior conviction for a felony immigration and naturalization offense. The court also assessed a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 and imposed a $5,000 fine. The court sentenced Singh to serve concurrent sentences of 36, 36, and 60 months in prison on the three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"ABGP\">On appeal, Singh raises four issues related to the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, but only one issue warrants discussion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Singh con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>tends that the driver\u2019s licenses, military identification cards, and United States government identification cards are not \u201cdocuments\u201d within the meaning of that term in \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2); thus, they should not have been counted when the court increased his offense level. If Singh is correct, his offense involved 31 documents (eight passports and 23 birth certificates), not 100 or more documents, and only a six-level increase was warranted under \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and we review its application of the law to those facts de novo. <em>United States v. Cover, </em>199 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2000). The ques: tion presented in this appeal is whether, given the circumstances of this case, the district court erred when it counted the domestic driver\u2019s licenses, military identification cards and United States government identification cards as \u201cdocuments\u201d pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2). We conclude that the district court did not err.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-10\">Section 2L2.1(b)(2) states \u201c[i]f the offense involved six or more documents or passports, increase as follows .... \u201d and then presents a two-column table that equates the \u201cNumber of Documents/Passports\u201d to the appropriate \u201cIncrease in Level.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2). But \u00a7 2L2.1 does not define \u201cdocuments.\u201d Additionally, \u201cdocuments\u201d is not defined in the application notes that accompany \u00a7 2L2.1. Because \u201cdocuments\u201d is not explicitly defined in the Sentencing Guidelines, we must interpret the term and, with respect to that undertaking, Singh and the Government offer competing definitions of \u201cdocuments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-11\">Singh contends that \u201cdocuments\u201d in \u00a7 2L2.1 refers to only those documents that relate to naturalization, citizenship, or legal resident status. To support this contention, Singh points to a portion of the title of \u00a7 2L2.1 \u2014 \u201cTrafficking in a Docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>ment Relating to Naturalization, Citizenship, or Legal Resident Status.\u201d <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2L2.1. Singh argues that the title of this section necessarily limits the type of documents that can be counted towards the offense level increase in \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2). Furthermore, Singh argues that the documents at issue in this case\u2014domestic driver\u2019s licenses, military identification cards, and United States government identification cards\u2014are not documents \u201crelating to naturalization, citizenship, or legal resident status\u201d and therefore should not have been counted.</p>\n<p id=\"AA5S\">In response, the Government suggests that the definition of \u201cdocuments\u201d is broader than just those documents that relate to naturalization, citizenship, or legal resident status. The Government\u2019s argument relies on the language of \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2), which instructs that \u201c[i]f <em>the offense involved </em>six or more documents or passports,\u201d the defendant\u2019s offense level should be increased according to the guideline table. USSG \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2) (emphasis added). The language of this section, the Government contends, requires the sentencing court to consider the offense of conviction, because the documents that should be counted are those that were \u201cinvolved\u201d in the offense. In this case, Singh pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(3) and (a)(4),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which criminalize a variety of fraudulent activities in connection with \u201cidentification documents.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(3), (a)(4). Under \u00a7 1028, an \u201cidentification document\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6s\">a document made or issued by or under the authority of the United States Government, a State, political subdivision of a State, a foreign government, political subdivision of a foreign government, an international governmental or an international quasi-governmental organization which, when completed with information concerning a particular individual, is of a type intended or commonly accepted for the purpose of identification of individuals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxKq\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1028(d)(2). The Government contends that the domestic driver\u2019s licenses, military identification cards, and United States government identification cards are \u201cidentification documents\u201d under \u00a7 1028, and therefore Singh\u2019s offense \u201cinvolved\u201d all of these documents and it was proper to count them for the purposes of \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"AlX\">We agree with the Government. The language of \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2) is clear: the sentencing court is directed to count any documents or passports that are \u201cinvolved\u201d in the offense. Singh violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a), and he does not argue that domestic driver\u2019s licenses, military identification cards, or United States government identification cards he outside \u00a7 1028\u2019s broad definition of \u201cidentification documents.\u201d Singh\u2019s offense \u201cinvolved\u201d these documents, so the district court acted properly when it counted them for the purposes of \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2). Because the language of \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2) clearly resolves this issue, we reject Singh\u2019s reliance upon the title of \u00a7 2L2.1 to support his restrictive definition of \u201cdocuments.\u201d As we have noted before, \u201cThe Court will not look to the title of a guideline to explain what is quite clear in its text.\u201d <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1353 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"A7m\">It appears that no other court of appeals has been called upon to squarely address the question presented in this appeal, but the Seventh Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>United States v. Castellanos, </em>165 F.3d 1129 (7th Cir.1999), strongly supports our eonclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>sion. Castellanos produced counterfeit identification documents by typing biographical information onto blank counterfeit resident alien cards and Social Security cards. When he was apprehended, he was carrying 192 blank resident alien cards and 24 blank Social Security cards. He was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(5), but he contended on appeal that the district court erred when it counted the blank documents under \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2) to increase his offense level. The Seventh Circuit disagreed. To determine whether the blank documents should have been counted, the Seventh Circuit referred to the definition of \u201cidentification documents\u201d in \u00a7 1028. Because that definition includes documents that, when completed with information concerning a particular individual, are commonly accepted for identification \u2014 such as blank resident alien cards and Social Security cards \u2014 the Seventh Circuit concluded that the blank cards found in Castellanos\u2019s possession were \u201cidentification documents\u201d under \u00a7 1028. The Seventh Circuit went on to conclude that these documents were properly counted under \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1343-5\">We therefore conclude ... that Congress intended blank, incomplete identification documents to come within the statutory definition of \u201cidentification document\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1028(d)(1). We therefore agree with the district court\u2019s determination that all of Mr. Castellanos\u2019 documents, whether completed or blank, ... could count for sentencing enhancement purposes under \u00a7 2L2.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1343-6\"><em>Castellanos, </em>165 F.3d at 1132. By focusing its analysis on the definition of an \u201cidentification document\u201d in \u00a7 1028, and not on whether the blank resident alien cards and Social Security cards \u201crelated to naturalization, citizenship, or legal resident status,\u201d the Seventh Circuit implicitly recognized in <em>Castellanos </em>that a court must consider what documents were involved in the offense of conviction to determine what documents should be counted under \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-9\">In conclusion, we hold that the term \u201cdocuments\u201d in \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2) is not limited by the \u201crelating to naturalization, citizenship, or legal resident status\u201d phrase contained in the title of \u00a7 2L2.1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, the language of \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2) instructs a sentencing court to count any documents that were \u201cinvolved\u201d in the offense, and this inquiry naturally requires the sentencing court to consider the offense of conviction. Singh was convicted for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a), which relates to \u201cidentification documents,\u201d and he does not dispute that the domestic driver\u2019s licenses, military identification cards, or United States government identification cards found in the car are \u201cidentification documents\u201d under \u00a7 1028. Thus, it was proper for the district court to count these documents under \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2), and the court\u2019s conclusion that Singh\u2019s offense involved 100 or more documents or passports is correct. Accordingly, Singh\u2019s sentences are</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AbY\">. Singh argues that the district court erred when it applied USSG \u00a7 2L2.1 (\"Trafficking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>in a Document Relating to Naturalization, Citizenship, or Legal Resident Status, or a United States Passport\u201d) instead of USSG \u00a7 2L2.2 (\"Fraudulently Acquiring Documents Relating to Naturalization, Citizenship, or Legal Resident Status for Own Use\u201d). The district court applied \u00a7 2L2.1 based on its factual finding that Singh was trafficking in identification documents. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, <em>United States v. Cover, </em>199 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2000), and we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Singh was engaged in trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"AdDz\">Second, Singh argues that the court erred when it assessed an obstruction-of-justice enhancement. We review a district court\u2019s finding that a defendant obstructed justice for clear error, <em>United States v. Poirier, </em>321 F.3d 1024, 1035 (11th Cir.2003), and we conclude that the district court did not clearly err.</p>\n<p id=\"AlC\">Third, Singh contends that the court erred when it imposed a $5,000 fine because the Government failed to prove that Singh had the ability to pay the fine. But the burden was on Singh to prove his inability to pay, <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>160 F.3d 661, 665 (11th Cir.1998), and we review the district court's conclusion regarding the defendant\u2019s ability to pay for clear error, <em>United States v. Garrison, </em>133 F.3d 831, 850 n. 32 (11th Cir.1998). The district court did not clearly err in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1341-13\">. Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2L2.1 (b)(2), if the offense involved between six and 24 documents or passports, the offense level is increased by three; if the offense involved between 25 and 99 documents or passports, the offense level is increased by six; and if the offense involved 100 or more documents or passports, the offense level is increased by nine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1341-16\">. Singh also contends that the international driver\u2019s license should not be counted for the purposes of \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2). Because we conclude that the domestic driver\u2019s licenses, the military identification cards, and the United States government identification cards were properly counted \u2014 and, as a consequence, Singh\u2019s offense involved at least 101 documents or passports \u2014 we need not decide whether the international driver's license also should have been counted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AhC\">. Singh also pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(1), which criminalizes fraud and misuse of a fraudulent passport. Singh concedes, however, that the eight fraudulent passports found in his possession must be counted under \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1343-7\">. We should not be understood to suggest that driver's licenses, military identification cards or United States government identification cards are not \"related to naturalization, citizenship, or legal resident status.\u201d We merely conclude that such an inquiry is not relevant when the court must determine which documents should be counted under \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
