For the reasons that follow, we will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-19\">In 1997, Scheib filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The petition was converted to Chapter 7 and in 1998, the Bankruptcy Court granted a motion by Mellon Bank, N.A. (now The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A.) for relief from the automatic stay to pursue foreclosure of Scheib\u2019s property in state court. Scheib received a discharge releasing her from her dischargeable debts and her bankruptcy case was closed on October 14, 1998. Scheib was evicted from the property that was the subject of the state foreclosure action in 1999. Scheib has since filed, without success, numerous actions in state and federal court seeking to challenge the foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-20\">In 2013, Scheib filed a motion in Bankruptcy Court to reopen her case. Although the motion is far from clear, Scheib appears to allege that she paid her mortgage in full and that Mellon Bank committed fraud in the foreclosure action and the bankruptcy proceeding. After a hearing, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that the motion was untimely and that Scheib\u2019s challenge to the foreclosure was barred by res judicata and the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doe-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>trine.' The Bankruptcy Court also found that Scheib\u2019s filing sought to improperly extend its jurisdiction. The Bankruptcy Court noted that Scheib had been advised in 2000 in an attempted adversary proceeding against Mellon Bank that she must pursue issues related to the sale of the property in state court. The Bankruptcy Court also denied Scheib\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Scheib appealed to the District Court, which held that the Bankruptcy Court thoroughly and appropriately addressed the motion to reopen. The District Court also denied Scheib\u2019s motion to quash the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision denying her <em>in forma pawperis </em>status on appeal. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(d)' and 1291. We apply the same standard as the District Court and review the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo, </em>its factual findings for clear error, and its decision whether to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Lazy Days\u2019 RV Center Inc., </em>724 F.3d 418, 421 (3d Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">We agree with the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s conclusion that Scheib\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely filed. Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9024 incorporates, with certain exceptions, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60, which sets forth the grounds for relief from a final judgment and the time requirements for filing a motion. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9024; Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b),(c). There is ho question that Scheib\u2019s motion to reopen, filed more than fourteen years after her bankruptcy case was closed, was not filed within a reasonable time as required by Rule 60(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">We also agree with the Bankruptcy Court that Scheib\u2019s motion to reopen improperly sought to invoke the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s jurisdiction over issues related to the foreclosure of her property, which should have been raised in state court. As recognized by the Bankruptcy Court, a bankruptcy case may be reopened \u201cto administer assets, to accord the debtor relief, or for other cause.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 350(b). We have stated that bankruptcy courts should determine whether proceedings are pending in state court and which forum\u2014 state court or bankruptcy court \u2014 is most appropriate to adjudicate issues raised by a motion to reopen. <em>Lazy Days, </em>724 F.3d at 423. For example, a motion to reopen to determine the scope of the automatic stay would be properly before the bankruptcy court because the bankruptcy court is well suited to interpret its own order. <em>See id- </em>In contrast, Scheib seeks to undo the foreclosure and sale of her property long ago. She filed her motion after pursuing relief in state court without success. Even though the state court foreclosure action is no longer pending, the Bankruptcy Court is not, under the circumstances of this case, the appropriate forum to seek relief. The Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">Finally, to the extent Scheib seeks to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion to quash, we agree with the District Court that the basis of the motion is unclear. To the extent Scheib sought to challenge the denial of her request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal to District Court, she provided no basis to disturb the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s ruling that her appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Accordingly, we will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1037-21\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1037-22\">. <em>Rooker v.
