When, as here, the debtor has no assets, no viable claims or causes of action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>and no other money-making prospects, Chapter 7 bankruptcy cannot serve even this limited function. Under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(a), \u201ccause\u201d to dismiss exists when bankruptcy cannot benefit outside creditors or the debtor and the process serves only to delay the prosecution of a lawsuit against the debtor. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Cypress Financial Trading Company, L.P. is a limited partnership consisting of one general partner, EFO GP Interests, Inc., and one limited partner, JBJ Lending Company. Its sole function was to invest in Petters Company, Inc. (\u201cPCI\u201d). Over several years, Cypress received approximately $11.4 million from its investments, approximately $500,000 of which was profit. In 2008, federal law enforcement swarmed PCI\u2019s corporate headquarters. \u2022It turns out that PCI was a large Ponzi scheme and Cypress\u2019s $500,000 \u201cprofit\u201d was in fact transferred from less fortunate investors. PCI subsequently filed bankruptcy in Minnesota. In October 2010, PCI\u2019s Chapter 11 trustee sued Cypress to avoid and recover the $11.4 million in transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">For the next two years, Cypress and PCI\u2019s trustee litigated the avoidance action in federal bankruptcy court in Minnesota. Then on December 4, 2012, Cypress filed this Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. According to Cypress, it has not had any assets since early or middle 2008. And, according to the Chapter 7 trustee, Cypress has no viable claims or causes of action. Cypress listed only two creditors: the PCI trustee and an entity related to its'general partner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">Three months after the bankruptcy petition, Cypress\u2019s trustee filed a \u201cReport of No Distribution,\u201d certifying that Cypress has no assets or claims of any kind and requesting that the case be closed. PCI\u2019s trustee then moved to dismiss Cypress\u2019s bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(a). The bankruptcy court denied the motion, reasoning that because \u201cChapter 7 is of some utility to any defunct business to [wjrap up whatever is left in the company,\u201d and there was no bad faith on Cypress\u2019s part, there is no \u201ccause\u201d to dismiss the case under \u00a7 707(a). On appeal, the district court reversed. In its view, because Chapter 7 provides Cypress no benefit and harms its only non-insider creditor, the bankruptcy court abused its discretion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">\u201cWe review the decision of a district court, sitting as an appellate court, by applying the same standards of review to the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law as applied by the district court.\u201d <em>In re Gerhardt, </em>348 F.3d 89, 91 (5th Cir.2003) (citing <em>In re Jack/Wade Drilling, Inc., </em>258 F.3d 385, 387 (5th Cir. 2001)). Accordingly, we review a bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. Id. </em>(citing <em>Williams v. IBEW Local 520 (In re </em>Williams), 337 F.3d 504, 508 (5th Cir.2003)). We review the ultimate decision to grant or deny a motion under \u00a7 707(a) for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Atlas Supply Corp., </em>857 F.2d 1061, 1063 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-11\">In this appeal, Cypress contends that bad faith is not \u201ccause\u201d to dismiss a Chap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ter 7 bankruptcy ease under \u00a7 707(a) and invites us to choose sides in a.circuit split on that issue. Although the relevant law strongly suggests that \u201ccause\u201d includes bad faith, <em>see In re Piazza, </em>719 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir.2013), we need not so hold to resolve this case. When a bankruptcy serves no purpose, results in no benefit for its creditors or the debtor, and only delays litigation already pending against the debt- or, there is \u201ccause\u201d to dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">Under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(a), the bankruptcy court \u201cmay dismiss a case under [Chapter 7] ... for cause.\u201d Section 707 does not define \u201ccause,\u201d but instead provides a list of examples, like the debtor\u2019s unreasonable delay of the proceedings, failure to pay required fees, or untimely filing qf schedules and financial statements. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(a)(1)-(3). The examples, however, are illustrative, not exhaustive. \u201cCause\u201d is a broad concept, designed to \u201cafford flexibility to the bankruptcy courts.\u201d <em>In re Little Creek Dev. Co., </em>779 F.2d 1068, 1072 (5th Cir.1986). This flexibility derives from bankruptcy\u2019s equitable roots. <em>Id. </em>True to equity\u2019s flexibility, we have instructed courts to \u201cweigh the benefits and prejudices\u201d of dismissal \u2014 to the debtor, creditors, and the bankruptcy system\u2014 when deciding a \u00a7 707(a) motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1073; <em>Atlas Supply Corp., </em>857 F.2d at 1063-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">The equities of this case undoubtedly favor dismissal. This bankruptcy (and subsequent appeals) imposed cost and delay, with absolutely no resulting benefit to Cypress or its creditors. Under Chapter 7, a debtor can hope for a permanent discharge of its debts;. bankruptcy exists to grant a fresh start to the \u201chonest, but unfortunate\u201d debtor. <em>Grogan v. Garner, </em>498 U.S. 279, 286-87, 111 S.Ct. 654, 112 L.Ed.2d 755 (1991). There is no hope of discharge or a fresh start here, because a discharge is unavailable to corporate debtors in Chapter 7 cases. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(1). Nevertheless, a corporate Chapter 7 (and the resulting automatic stay) may allow breathing space for a neutral third party to marshal assets for orderly distribution to creditors. But again, there is no hope of that here. Everyone agrees there are no assets to marshal or liquidate, and applicable statutes of limitations bar any preference or fraudulent transfer actions that might lead to additional assets. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(b)(4)(B) (on\u00e9-year statute of limitations for insider preference actions); \u00a7 548(a)(1) (two-year statute of limitations for fraudulent transfer actions); \u00a7 544(b)(1) &amp; Tex. Bus. &amp; Com.Code \u00a7 24.010(a) (four-year statute of limitations for fraudulent transfer actions under Texas law). Without any conceivable benefit to the debtor or creditors, a bankruptcy loses its <em>raison d\u2019etre. </em>Dismissal was compelled here because besides conferring no benefit on Cypress or on the only two creditors, this case served unreasonably and unjustifiably to delay the PCI Trustee\u2019s suit. With no benefit conferred but considerable harm inflicted by Cypress\u2019s Chapter 7 case, the district court properly concluded that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in not finding \u201ccause\u201d to dismiss under \u00a7 707(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">Even if we were to agree with Cypress that the bankruptcy court had no \u201ccause\u201d to dismiss the case, its victory is pyrrhic. If we held that the bankruptcy court properly denied the \u00a7 707(a) motion, we would reverse the district court judgment, and the district court would probably remand the case to the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court would then promptly close the case as the Chapter 7 trustee originally requested, lifting the automatic stay. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(c)(2)(A). Once the stay is lifted, the Minnesota avoidance litigation could resume. Cypress will have gained more time to avoid the avoidance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>litigation, but it must ultimately face the music.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Cypress\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1042-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
