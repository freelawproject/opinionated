Drummond argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds and when it applied a 16-level sentencing enhancement based on the finding that Drummond was previously convicted of an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-15\">In considering the district court\u2019s determination that Drummond\u2019s speedy trial rights were not violated, we review factual findings for clear error and conclusions of law <em>de novo. United States v. Taylor, </em>487 U.S. 326, 337, 108 S.Ct. 2413, 101 L.Ed.2d 297 (1988). We review the applicability of the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) aggravated felony enhancement <em>de novo. United States v. Fuentes-Barahona, </em>111 F.3d 651, 652 (9th Cir.1997). Issues of constitutional law are subject to plenary review. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>809 F.2d 1514, 1517 (11th Cir.1987). Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-16\">Drummond is a native and citizen of Jamaica who was deported from the United States on September 24, 1998. On December 11, 1998, he attempted to reenter the United States by presenting a revoked resident alien card at the Miami International Airport. He was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) at that time and transported to the Krome Detention Center in Miami, Florida. Almost two months later, on February 4, 1999, a criminal complaint was filed and a warrant issued for Drum-mond\u2019s arrest on charges of illegal reentry into the country after deportation. Drummond was then indicted on February 9,1999, on a single charge of attempted reentry into the United States following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>Drummond filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the United States had violated his speedy trial rights under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8161, <em>et seq., </em>by not indicting him within thirty days of his arrest and detention by INS officials. The United States did not oppose the motion, and the district court dismissed the indictment on August 3, 1999.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The United States re-indicted Drummond on the identical charge nine days later, and he filed a second motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds. The district court denied the motion, finding that his arrest by immigration officials was an administrative or civil detention that did not implicate the Speedy Trial Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-4\">After a bench trial, Drummond was convicted of violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). At his sentencing, the district court imposed a 16-level enhancement on Drum-mond\u2019s offense level based on a finding that a prior conviction in New York state court for menacing qualified as an aggravated felony as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Drummond appeals both the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss indictment on speedy trial grounds and the 16-level sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">Drummond argues on appeal that the district court\u2019s determination that his detention at Krome was an \u201cadministrative hold\u201d that did not trigger the running of the speedy trial clock was contrary to the law. Under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161, <em>et seq., </em>federal authorities must indict an incarcerated individual within 30 days of his arrest in connection with the offenses specified in the indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> More than 30 days elapsed from the time Drummond was initially detained to the time he was indicted. Drummond contends that because he was arrested and detained by INS officials for the identical reason for which he was later indicted, i.e., for illegally re-entering the United States after deportation, the thirty-day requirement in the Speedy Trial Act runs from the date of his INS arrest and detention. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-8\">We recently considered and rejected similar arguments in <em>United States v. Noel, </em>231 F.3d 833 (11th Cir.2000). In <em>Noel, </em>the defendanVappellant was taken into custody by the INS after illegally reentering the United States following deportation. More than thirty days elapsed from the time of his initial detention before a federal grand jury returned an indictment against the defendant charging him with illegally reentering the country in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). The defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds, arguing that he was \u201carrested\u201d for speedy trial purposes on the date he was detained by the INS. The district court rejected his argument and we affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-9\">In rejecting the defendant\u2019s arguments, we determined as a matter of first impression in this Circuit that INS detentions preceding deportation are civil in nature and do not trigger rights under the Speedy Trial Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As such, the time period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>for the Speedy Trial Act begins to run only \u201cafter an individual is \u2018accused,\u2019 either by an arrest and charge or by an indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the defendant in <em>Noel </em>had not been charged with violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) at the time of his INS detention, the detention itself did not trigger the running of the Speedy Trial Act. <em>Id. (citing United States v. Reme, </em>738 F.2d 1156, 1162 (11th Cir.1984)(although defendant was detained by INS on October 21, the Speedy Trial Act was not triggered until the following July when defendant was served with a warrant issued pursuant to the indictment)). <em>See also United States v. Cepeda-Luna, </em>989 F.2d 353, 355-56 (9th Cir.1993)(Speedy Trial Act\u2019s 30-day requirement does not apply when initial detention was civil in nature and federal criminal charges were not filed at the time of the INS detention).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">Similarly, in the instant case, Drummond was not charged with violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2) at the time of his initial detention by the INS. Rather, INS officials took him into custody to await deportation proceedings. Because the detention was civil in nature and federal criminal charges were not filed at that time, we cannot apply the 30-day requirement of the Speedy Trial Act from the moment Drummond was civilly arrested on December 11, 1998. It was only after Drummond was arrested in connection with the criminal charge for which he was actually indicted that the time limits of the Speedy Trial Act were triggered. Accordingly, there is no violation of the Speedy Trial Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">We have recognized a limited exception to the rule that INS detentions are civil in nature and do not trigger the Speedy Trial Act. While routine INS detentions incident to deportation will not trigger the Speedy Trial Act, a contrary result may be warranted when deportations are used by the government as \u201cmere ruses to detain a defendant for lat\u00e9r criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Noel, </em>231 F.3d at 836; <em>Cepedar-Luna, </em>989 F.2d at 357. To invoke this exception, however, we have placed the burden on the detainee to establish that the \u201cprimary or exclusive purpose of the civil detention was to hold him for future prosecution.\u201d <em>See Noel, </em>231 F.3d at 836. Drummond has produced no evidence in this action to demonstrate that his civil detention was a ruse to hold him for later prosecution or that the detention served any purpose other than to facilitate his deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-8\">We turn now to Drummond\u2019s argument that the district court erred by applying a 16-level enhancement to his offense level based on the court\u2019s finding that Drum-mond was previously convicted of an aggravated felony. Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) of the Sentencing Guidelines allows for a 16-level enhancement when a defendant who unlawfully enter's the United States has previously been deported after being convicted of an aggravated felony. The application notes for this provision adopt the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d provided at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43), which includes \u201ccrime of violence ... for which the term of imprisonment [sic] at least one year.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-9\">According to the PSI, Drummond had a prior conviction in a New York state court for menacing, a Class A misdemeanor with a maximum of one year\u2019s imprisonment under New York law, for which he was actually sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Based on his prior conviction for menacing, the district court enhanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>Drummond\u2019s base offense level in accordance with 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"Afz\">Although Drummond argues that it is unclear whether his prior conviction for menacing falls within the statutory definition of aggravated felony, i.e., a crime of violence for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year, we have little trouble in so concluding. \u201cCrimes of violence\u201d include offenses that have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property or another. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. A person is guilty of menacing under New York law when he intentionally places or attempts to place another in fear of physical injury, serious injury, or death by displaying a deadly weapon or instrument. N.Y. Stat. \u00a7 120.14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The undisputed facts underlying Drummond\u2019s menacing conviction are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhoM\">On May 28,1997, the defendant attempted to throw his wife off a second floor balcony. On May 29, 1997, the defendant again threatened to do harm to his wife and children. According to the police report, on July 9, 1997, the defendant held a firearm to his girlfriend\u2019s head and threatened to kill her and the kids if she opened the door and called police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alv\">We are convinced that Drummond\u2019s prior conviction for menacing clearly satisfies the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d component of the definition of aggravated felony. Moreover, we have held that for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), the length of the sentence actually imposed determines whether crimes of violence constitute aggravated felonies. <em>United States v. Maldonado-Ramirez, </em>216 F.3d 940, 944 (11th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Guzman-Bera, </em>216 F.3d 1019, 1020 (11th Cir.2000). Because Drummond was sentenced to a year imprisonment, the New York conviction for menacing qualified as an aggravated felony, and the district court did not err in applying the 16-level sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"Ard\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1347-6\">.Although the Order dismissing the indictment against Drummond did not specifically state whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice, it appears that the indictment was dismissed based on the government's agreement that it be dismissed without prejudice. The Order of dismissal provided that the government had \"no objection to the court granting the motion without prejudice.\u201d Moreover, the district court, in its subsequent Order denying Drummond\u2019s motion to dismiss the second indictment, stated that the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(1) weighed in favor of a finding that the first indictment was dismissed without prejudice. Drummond has not challenged this finding on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1347-11\">. The Act provides in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-12\">Any ... indictment charging an individual with the commission of an offense shall be filed within thirty days from the date on which such individual was arrested or served with a summons in connection with such charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1347-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1347-14\">. The language of the Speedy Trial Act also compels the conclusion that its provisions were not intended to apply to INS detentions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>The text of the statute specifically provides that the Act\u2019s 30-day requirement applies to indictments issued in connection with the offense for which a defendant was arrested. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(b). The Act further defines \"offense\u201d as any federal criminal offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(b). An arrest and detention pursuant to a deportation proceeding is not an arrest for a federal criminal offense; rather it is a purely civil action to determine eligibility to remain in this country, even though the act of entering and remaining unlawfully in this country is itself a federal offense. <em>INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1038, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AYIM\">.
