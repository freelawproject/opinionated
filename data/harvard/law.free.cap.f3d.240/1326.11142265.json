Because we determine that the parties did not explicitly consent to have a magistrate judge conduct the trial proceedings, we dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-7\">The relevant facts are straightforward. On October 13, 1998, McNab filed this action seeking recovery for breach of a Vessel Construction Contract. The clerk of the district court sent each party\u2019s counsel a document entitled \u201cNotice of Assignment to United States Magistrate Judge for Trial\u201d (the \u201cNotice\u201d), which informed the parties that their case had been assigned to a magistrate judge \u201cfor all purposes including trial.\u201d The Notice further stated that the magistrate judge\u2019s authority to preside over the case derived from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), and that the parties had a right to have the case reassigned to a district court judge for trial and final disposition. The Notice instructed that if the parties wished to have the case reassigned, they were required to return a form attached to the Notice to the Clerk of Court within thirty days. If they did not request such reassignment, the Notice indicated that the parties would \u201cbe deemed to have consented to the trial and disposition of [the] case by the assigned United States Magistrate Judge.\u201d The record does not reflect that either party returned the request for reassignment to the clerk, and the case proceeded with the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-8\">On October 27, 1999, the magistrate judge entered an order denying J &amp; J Marine\u2019s motion for summary judgment and for partial summary judgment, and on November 8 and 9, 1999, the magistrate judge presided over a jury trial. On November 12, 1999, the magistrate judge entered judgment in favor of McNab in the amount of $90,000, and an additional $74,578.88 at 6% interest, based on the jury\u2019s verdict. On December 14, 1999, the magistrate judge entered an order denying J &amp; J Marine\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for a new trial, which J &amp; J Marine challenges in this appeal. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-10\">On February 14, 2000, we issued the following jurisdictional question to the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-11\">Whether the parties consented to the magistrate judge rendering a final and appealable decision in this action? <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 636(b) &amp; 1291; <em>Barnett v. General Elec. Capital Corp., </em>147 F.3d 1321, 1322-23 (11th Cir.1998); <em>General Trading Inc. v. Yale Materials Handling Corp., </em>119 F.3d 1485, 1494-96 (11th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>523 U.S. 1055, 118 S.Ct. 1380, 140 L.Ed.2d 526 (1998); <em>Hall v. Sharpe, </em>812 F.2d 644, 646-47 (11th Cir.1987).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1339-12\">In response, J &amp; J Marine argues that both parties gave sufficient consent by failing to object to the authority of a magistrate judge. J &amp; J Marine asserts that although the consent does not appear \u201cexpressly on the record,\u201d the parties waived any constitutional right to have an Article III judge preside over the case by failing to execute the written request for reassignment of the case to an Article III judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-13\">This Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction is limited to final decisions of the district courts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. An exception set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), however, permits a magistrate judge, upon special designation by the district court <em>and the consent of all of the parties, </em>to conduct any or all proceedings in a civil matter and enter a final judgment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1). Where a judgment has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>so entered by a magistrate judge, \u00a7 636(c)(3) permits a direct appeal to the appropriate United States court of appeals in the same manner as an appeal would be taken from the judgment entered by the district court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(3). However, if the parties did not consent to the magistrate judge\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, an appellate court lacks jurisdiction over an appeal from a final judgment entered by the magistrate judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(3); <em>Barnett v. General Elec. Capital Corp., </em>147 F.3d 1321, 1322 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998). Because of its direct impact on our appellate jurisdiction, we consider <em>sua sponte </em>whether the parties consented to the magistrate judge\u2019s jurisdiction to enter final judgment in this case. <em>See Rembert v. Apfel, </em>213 F.3d 1331, 1333-34 (11th Cir.2000) (examining the Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>even though neither party raised the issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">Basic procedure governing the consent and assignment process is set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(2). The clerk of court, at the time an action is filed, must notify the parties of the \u201cavailability\u201d of a magistrate judge to exercise jurisdiction, and \u201c[t]he decision of the parties shall be communicated to the clerk of court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(2). Subsection (c)(2) further provides that the local rules of the court \u201cshall include procedures to protect the voluntariness of the parties\u2019 consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have consistently required that a party\u2019s consent to a magistrate judge\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1) must be explicit, voluntary, clear, and unambiguous. <em>See e.g., Barnett, </em>147 F.3d at 1322; <em>Hall v. Sharpe, </em>812 F.2d 644, 647 (11th Cir.1987). Such consent cannot be inferred from the conduct of the parties, as urged by J &amp; J Marine in its response to our jurisdictional question. <em>See Hall, </em>812 F.2d at 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">More importantly, in the recent decision of <em>Rembert, </em>we expressly addressed the very procedure at issue in this case\u2014 the procedure followed by the Southern District of Alabama that purports to allow parties to consent to a magistrate judge\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction by failing to object within thirty days of receiving notice that a case has been assigned to a magistrate judge. In <em>Rembert, </em>we expressly found the Southern District of Alabama\u2019s \u201cconsent through inaction\u201d notice to be invalid and insufficient to establish the \u201cexpress\u201d and \u201con the record\u201d consent statutorily required to empower a magistrate judge to act. <em>See Rembert, </em>213 F.3d, at 1334-35.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1340-7\">As in <em>Rembert, </em>it is undisputed that the parties in this case did not explicitly consent to a trial before a magistrate judge. Plainly, the magistrate judge lacked jurisdiction to issue a final disposition in this case, and the orders issued by the magistrate judge were thus not final and appeal-able. As a result, we lack jurisdiction to entertain this appeal and dismiss it accordingly. <em>See Rembert, </em>213 F.3d at 1335; <em>Barnett, </em>147 F.3d at 1322 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-8\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">. We note that <em>Rembert </em>issued on June 5, 2000, which was after the parties filed this appeal and answered our jurisdictional question. We are bound by <em>Rembert, </em>absent an intervening decision of the Supreme Court or a decision of an en banc majority of this Court. <em>See, e.g., Flowers v. United States, </em>764 F.2d 759, 761 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
