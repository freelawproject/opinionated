Mikkilineni appeals from the order of the United States Court of Federal Claims that dismissed his complaint without prejudice for failure to comply with Rule 81(d)(8) of the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims. <em>Talasila, Inc. v. United States, </em>No. 97-439 C (Fed.Cl. Aug. 17, 2000) (order) <em>(\u201cTalasila\u201d). </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-17\">Plaintiffs Talasila, Inc. and M.R. Mikkili-neni filed a complaint against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims on June 24, 1997. The complaint alleged that the United States had improperly terminated for default a contract with Talasila and sought in excess of one million dollars in damages. At the time the complaint was filed, plaintiffs were represented by an attorney, James P. Ross. On April 15, 1999, Mr. Ross moved to withdraw as the attorney for plaintiffs. The court granted the motion on April 19, 1999, and gave plaintiffs until June 18, 1999 to notify the court how they wished to proceed with the matter. <em>Talasila, Inc. v. United States, </em>No. 97-439 C (Fed.Cl. Apr. 19, 1999) (order). The court informed plaintiffs that its rules require a corporate litigant to be represented by counsel, and that Talasila would have to obtain new representation in order to proceed with its suit. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-18\">On May 5, 1999, James R. Cooney filed a notice of appearance on behalf of plaintiffs. Mr. Cooney, however, was not admitted to practice before the Court of Federal Claims. <em>Talasila, Inc. v. United States, </em>No. 97-439 C (Fed.Cl. May 8, 2000) (order). Accordingly, on May 8, 2000, the court ordered Talasila to obtain the representation of competent counsel, either by engaging new counsel or by having Mr. Cooney seek admission to the Court of Federal Claims bar. <em>Id. </em>In response, plaintiffs stated that Talasila, a Texas corporation, had been dissolved in August of 1997, and argued that Mikkilineni was the real party-in-interest in the case. Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>tiffs asserted that, as the sole shareholder of a dissolved corporation, Mikkilineni should be permitted to proceed without representation before the court. The court rejected this argument, and again ordered Talasila to secure representation. When plaintiffs failed to comply with this order, the court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint without prejudice on August 17, 2000. <em>Talasila, </em>slip op. at 2. On August 29, 2000, plaintiffs requested reconsideration of the dismissal order. The court denied the request on September 5, 2000. <em>Talasila, Inc. v. United States, </em>No. 97-439 C (Fed.Cl. Sep. 5, 2000) (order). Mikkili-neni appeals from the dismissal of the complaint. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether the Court of Federal Claims must permit Mikkilineni to appear <em>pro se </em>in order to assert the claim of the dissolved corporation of which he is the only successor-in-interest. This is a question of law which we review <em>de novo. See H.B. Mac, Inc. v. United States, </em>153 F.3d 1338, 1343 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">The authority of the Court of Federal Claims to promulgate rules of practice and procedure before the court is derived from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2503, which provides that \u201c[t]he proceedings of the Court of Federal Claims shall be in accordance with such rules of practice and procedure ... as the Court of Federal Claims may prescribe.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2503 (1994). The relevant portion of the rule at issue here, Rule 81(d)(8) of the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-7\">An individual may represent oneself or a member of one\u2019s immediate family as a party before the court. Any other party, however, must be represented by an attorney who is admitted to practice in this court. A corporation may only be represented by counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">Fed.Cl.R. 81(d)(8). This rule reflects the law \u201cthat a corporation may appear in the federal courts only through licensed counsel.\u201d <em>Rowland v. Cal. Men\u2019s Colony, Unit II Men\u2019s Advisory Council, </em>506 U.S. 194, 201-02, 113 S.Ct. 716, 121 L.Ed.2d 656 (1993) (noting that this law has been in effect \u201cfor the better part of two centuries\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-10\">Pursuant to Rule 81(d)(8), Talasila must be represented by counsel in order to pursue its claim against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See, e.g., Midstar, Inc. v. United States, </em>33 Fed.Cl. 669, 671 (1995), <em>Sermor, Inc. v. United States, </em>13 Cl.Ct. 1, 7 (1987); <em>Finast Metal Prods., Inc. v. United States, </em>12 Cl.Ct. 759 (1987). \u201cThe court is not free to waive this rule, even in cases of severe financial hardship.\u201d <em>Finast, </em>12 Cl.Ct. at 762 (citing <em>Richdel, Inc. v. Sunspool Corp., </em>699 F.2d 1366 (Fed. Cir.1983) (interpreting the ana-lagous rule of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-11\">The fact that Talasila is now a dissolved corporation and that Mikkilineni, as sole shareholder of the dissolved corporation, is the sole successor-in-interest to the corporation\u2019s assets, does not affect the applicability of Rule 81(d)(8). As noted by the Court of Federal Claims, under Texas law, \u201c[a] dissolved corporation shall continue in its corporate existence for a period of three years from the date of dissolution, for the ... purpose[ of] prosecuting ... in its corporate name any action or proceeding by ... the dissolved corporation.\u201d Tex. Bus. Corp. Act. Ann. art. 7.12(A) (West 2000). \u201cIf an action or proceeding on an existing claim by ... a dissolved corporation is brought before the expiration of the three-year period following the date of dissolution ... the dissolved corporation shall continue to survive ... for purposes of that action or proceeding until all judgments, orders, and decrees therein have been fully executed....\u201d <em>Id. </em>art 7.12(D). Thus, Texas law requires that the present action, which relates to the rights of the corporation and which was brought prior to the corporation\u2019s dissolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>tion, be maintained by the corporation, Talasila, not by Mikk\u00f1ineni.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">Mikldlineni cites several cases for the proposition that, under Texas law, he is entitled to maintain this suit in his own name, and, therefore, to appear <em>pro se </em>before the Court of Federal Claims. At the outset, we note that these cases, issued by Texas state courts, do not control the issue of whether a corporation appearing in the Court of Federal Claims must be represented by an attorney. In any event, these cases do not support Mikkilineni\u2019s position. <em>Burkbunett Refining Co. v. Ilseng, </em>116 Tex. 366, 292 S.W. 179 (1927), addresses the prior version of the Texas statute pertaining to dissolved corporations. That statute did not contain the express provision, found in the current statute, that a dissolved corporation continues in its corporate existence for the purpose of prosecuting actions in its corporate name. <em>See id. </em>at 181; Tex. Bus. Corp. Act. Ann. art 7.12(A). In <em>Vouras v. 3525 Turtle Creek, Inc., </em>369 S.W.2d 819, 821 (Tex.Civ.App.1963), the court determined that a dissolved corporation was the proper plaintiff in the suit because Tex. Bus. Corp. Act. Ann. art. 7.12 provides that the officers and directors of a corporation can maintain judicial proceedings in the name of the corporation if the suit is instituted within three years of the dissolution. Thus, that case supports the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 determination that \u201c \u2018Texas law provides a three-year window in which a voluntarily dissolved corporation must prosecute actions in the corporation\u2019s name.\u2019 \u201d <em>Talasila, </em>slip op. at 2 (quoting <em>Talasila, Inc. v. United States, </em>No. 97-439 C, slip op. at 2 (Fed.Cl. June 6, 2000) (order)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">Finally, Mikkilineni states that he cannot afford to hire an attorney for the third time, and he points to <em>U.S. Polycon Corp. v. United States, </em>43 Fed.Cl. 11 (1999), as a case in which a corporation was allowed to maintain an action in the Court of Federal Claims while represented by its sole shareholder. In <em>Polycon, </em>a judge of the Court of Federal Claims, different from the judge in this case, granted the motion of a corporate plaintiff to be allowed to be represented by its sole shareholder. <em>Id. </em>at 15. The court recognized that, \u201c[Unquestionably, the long-standing, virtually universal general rule concerning appearances on behalf [of] corporate entities is that corporations must be represented by counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. The court chose to make an exception to that rule, however, because the corporation\u2019s sole shareholder alleged that the cost of hiring counsel would make the litigation prohibitive. The court also noted that the action being asserted by the corporation was one that the sole shareholder could have brought if he had chosen to do business as a sole proprietorship. <em>Id. </em>at 15. We decline to follow the reasoning of <em>Polycon. </em>The requirement of Rule 81(d)(8) that a corporation be represented by an attorney in the Court of Federal Claims is clear and unqualified, and the plain language of the rule does not contemplate exceptions: \u201cA corporation may only be represented by counsel.\u201d Fed.CLR. 81(d)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Court of Federal Claims is</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-11\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-12\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
