The court also considered the petition filed June 23,1986 by the Legislative Council Law Revision Committee requesting the amendment of SCR 70.36 to include a provision withholding a circuit judge\u2019s salary if the certifications filed pursuant to the rule disclose that there are matters awaiting decision beyond the time periods established by the rule. The court determines that the petition for the inclusion of a salary withholding provision in the rule should be denied and that amendments to the rule suggested by the director of state courts at the public hearing, namely, that the certification under the rule be made by certificate rather than by affidavit and that notice of an extension of time to comply with the rule obtained by a circuit judge be given to the director of state courts by the circuit judge rather than by the chief judge of the judicial administrative district, be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\">The adoption of SCR 70.36 occurred in the context of a judicial disciplinary proceeding concerning, in part, a judge\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the statute, sec. 757.025, Stats.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prohibiting a judge of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>court of record from receiving or being allowed to draw any salary unless the judge first executes an affidavit stating that no matter submitted in final form to the court for decision remains undecided for more than 90 days. <em>In Matter of Complaint Against Grady, </em>118 Wis. 2d 762, 348 N.W.2d 559 (1984). The court held the statute an unconstitutional interference with the judicial branch of government and adopted a court rule establishing substantially the same requirements as those of the statute, with the exception of the salary withholding provision. The petition of the Legislative Council Law Revision Committee sought the restoration of the salary withholding provision by inclusion in the court\u2019s rule.</p>\n<p id=\"AvI\">The court determines that a salary withholding provision is unnecessary. The rule requiring the certification of the status of pending cases specifies the following remedial measures which may result from a judge\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">\"(a) Change of the judge\u2019s assignment, pursuant to SCR 70.19(3)(a),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\"(b) Referral of the matter by the director of state courts to the supreme court for the initiation of contempt proceedirigs,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-3\">\"(c) Referral of the matter by the director of state courts to the judicial commission for investigation of possible misconduct.\u201d SCR 70.36(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">As specified, these measures are remedial, intended to provide assistance to a judge who, because of the number of cases pending or other factors beyond the judge\u2019s control, is unable to comply with the time periods established by the rule; they also serve to discipline appropriately a judge who, though able to do so, fails to comply with the rule. With respect to the latter, the Comment to SCR 70.36 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">\"In addition to possibly constituting judicial misconduct under sec. 757.81(4), Stats., a judge\u2019s failure to comply with this rule may constitute contempt of the supreme court and result in the court\u2019s imposing a fine for noncompliance. See, <em>In re Hon. Charles E. Kading, </em>74 Wis. 2d 405 (1976).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In light of the availability of these remedial measures, the imposition of which is discretionary with the court as circumstances may warrant, the addition of the proposed salary withholding provision, which would apply to every failure of a judge to comply with the time periods and certification requirements of the rule without regard to the cause thereof, is neither necessary nor desirable. Salary withholding would be a purely punitive sanction, applied indiscriminately, unresponsive to the problems the rule is designed to remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">In his presentation at the public hearing, the director of state courts requested that SCR 70.36 be amended to provide that the reporting of the status of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>pending cases be made by certificate of the judge rather than by affidavit. The principal reason given for that requested amendment is that a judge filing an affidavit containing incorrect information would be liable to prosecution for false swearing, a result in no way related to the purpose of the rule. The director of state courts also requested that the rule be amended to provide that the circuit judge, not the chief judge of the judicial administrative district, be responsible for notifying the office of the director of state courts of extensions of the time periods obtained under the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The court finds the amendments proposed by the director of state courts appropriate to the purposes of the rule and adopts them. With respect to the use of a certificate rather than an affidavit to report the status of pending cases, the purpose of the rule is to promote the efficient conduct of the judicial business of the circuit court. It requires circuit judges to review periodically the cases pending before them and to decide them expeditiously. It is an administrative, not a disciplinary, rule. The use of a certificate for reporting pending case status is no less effective than an affidavit to accomplish the administrative objectives of the rule; the use of an affidavit adds merely an additional punitive sanction. The proposed amendment concerning notice of an extension of time under the rule will serve to expedite the reporting procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">An order will issue the date hereof effectuating the court\u2019s determinations set forth herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-4\">SCR 70.36 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\"Judges\u2019 certification of status of pending cases.
