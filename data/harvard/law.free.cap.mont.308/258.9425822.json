We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Did the District Court err in modifying child support when no finding was made that the prior order was unconscionable?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b63 Kelly raises four other issues on appeal which we do not address. We do not address two of these issues-\u201cdid the District Court err in awarding attorney fees and costs to respondent\u201d and \u201cdid the District Court err in ordering appellant to repay child support to respondent\u2019-because our resolution of the first issue requires the District Court to readdress these issues on remand. We do not address the other two issues-\u201cdid the District Court violate the appellant\u2019s civil and constitutional rights when it ordered that respondent would have parenting time with the children every Sunday\u201d and \u201cwas the length of time between trial and judgment prejudicial\u2019-because these issues were not preserved for appeal. The general rule is that issues not raised before the trial court and new legal theories are not considered by this Court on appeal because it is unfair to fault the trial court on an issue it was never given an opportunity to consider. <em>Unified Indus., Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15 (citing <em>Day v. Payne </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 273, 276, 929 P.2d 864, 866). The trial court did not have an opportunity to consider these last two issues, so we will not address them on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b64 The parties to this action divorced on May 5,1993. The Decree of Dissolution amended and incorporated the terms of a previous Marital Settlement Agreement (Agreement) entered into by the parties when they initially separated. This Agreement documented the parties\u2019 understanding regarding the coordination of the care and support of their two children. The Agreement provided for joint custody with Kelly having physical custody during the school year and Karl having physical custody during the summer. The Agreement also provided that Karl would have custody of the children every Sunday and every Wednesday, every other Saturday, and all holidays except Christmas. The Agreement further provided that this arrangement would be reversed during the summer. The Agreement also provided for a $360 per month support payment by Karl to Kelly, which was later amended to $400 per month by agreement of the parties in the Decree of Dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\u00b65 Subsequent to this Agreement, Karl remarried. As a result of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>new marriage, Karl added the three children from his new wife\u2019s first marriage to his household for six months out of the year. Also subsequent to this Agreement, Kelly and Karl both received significant pay raises in their respective career positions. Finally, Kelly and Karl did not stick to the specific terms of the Agreement regarding custody, but rather, Karl\u2019s total amount of time with the two children increased. This increase arose because Kelly allowed Karl to either pick the children up earlier (Friday night rather than Saturday morning), or similarly keep the children later (Monday morning rather than Sunday night or Thursday morning rather than Wednesday night), in conjunction with his regularly scheduled custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b66 On December 14, 1995, Karl filed a petition to modify the Agreement\u2019s terms regarding the child support obligation and custodial plan. In addition to the above changes in personal circumstances, Karl asserted that the original child support amount was incorrectly calculated under Montana\u2019s child support guidelines. Karl argued that he spent more than 110 days per year with the children, which is the minimum amount of time required under the guidelines in order for this factor to be considered in adjusting proper child support. Karl further asserted that the initial calculation was incorrect because it failed to factor in the amount of time he spent with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b67 After a hearing on the matter, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (Order) which incorporated many of the proposed findings submitted by Karl.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Order modified both the child support amount paid by Karl and the custody arrangements between the two parties. Kelly now appeals various aspects of this Order. Further details are included in the discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u00b68 In cases involving modification of child support, we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Pearson, </em>1998 MT 236, \u00b6 29, 291 Mont. 101, \u00b6 29, 965 P.2d 268, \u00b6 29 (citing In <em>re Marriage of Widhalm </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 97, 100, 926 P.2d 748, 750). Atrial court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo </em>to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law was correct. <em>Pearson, </em>\u00b6 29. However, \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, provides that a previous decree containing support provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>may be modified only upon changed circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the existing terms unconscionable. These determinations are discretionary, so a district court\u2019s ultimate decision on modification of child support is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Jarussi, </em>1998 MT 272, \u00b6 7, 291 Mont. 371, \u00b6 7, 968 P.2d 720, \u00b6 7. Determinations of unconscionability are made on a case-by-case assessment. <em>In re Marriage of Brown </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 269, 272, 940 P.2d 122, 123. Finally, the burden of demonstrating both substantial and continuing change, and unconscionable terms, is on the moving party. <em>In re Marriage of Callahan </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 465, 469, 762 P.2d 205, 208; <em>In re Marriage of Barnard, </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 103, 106, 870 P.2d 91, 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b69 Did the District Court Err in Modifying Child Support When No Finding Was Made That the Prior Order Was Unconscionable?</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b610 In this case, Kelly asserts that the District Court erred because it did not specifically find that the prior Agreement was unconscionable in light of the changed circumstances. Kelly notes that the word unconscionable does not appear in the court\u2019s Order. Karl asserts that alternative wording in the District Court\u2019s Order indicates that the court properly found unconscionable conditions before altering the previous child support Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b611  We have previously addressed this specific issue in a closely analogous case, <em>Jarussi. Jarussi, </em>\u00b6 6. Section 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, requires that modification may only be made \u201cupon a showing of changed circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the terms unconscionable.\u201d In <em>Jarussi, </em>we held that under \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, the finding of substantial and continuing change is separate from the finding of unconscionability. <em>Jarussi, </em>\u00b6 7. We further held that a trial court must find both criteria met before modifying a previous child support order. <em>Jarussi, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\u00b612 In that case, the trial court did not make any findings regarding unconscionability. Rather, the trial court found, \u201cthe circumstances to be sufficiently changed to allow modification.\u201d <em>Jarussi, </em>\u00b6 8. The trial court followed this statement with findings that demonstrated a substantial and continuing change. However, we held that this was insufficient because the court did not then find, whether the changes were unconscionable. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">While [the trial court] need not couch its findings in the express \u201cunconscionable\u201d language of the statute, it must make findings by which we may determine it addressed the ... unconscionability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><em>Jarussi, </em>\u00b6 11. We held that the \u201ccircumstances ... sufficiently changed to allow modification\u201d language was inadequate to meet this requirement because it did not address unconscionability. <em>Jarussi, </em>\u00b6 12. <em>See also Gall v. Gall </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 17, 20, 608 P.2d 496, 498 (although wife remarried and court had ample evidence of parties\u2019 relative incomes, case remanded because no finding of unconscionability made); <em>Pearson, </em>\u00b6 41 (finding of changed circumstances separate from finding of unconscionability).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b613 When courts have properly addressed the issue of unconscionability, we have upheld findings that the situation between the parties made the existing terms unconscionable and findings that the situation between the parties did not make the existing terms unconscionable. In the <em>case Rome v. Rome </em>(1981), 190 Mont. 495, 498, 621 P.2d 1090, 1092, we upheld the trial court findings that the change in circumstances of the father, including remarriage and change in income, were voluntary changes and did not render the existing terms of child support automatically unconscionable. In contrast, we have upheld findings where the trial court found the relative difference between the parties\u2019 incomes created an unconscionable situation. <em>See In re Marriage of Thane </em>(1989), 238 Mont. 349, 353, 777 P.2d 881, 884 (parties \u201crequired to contribute to the support of the children in proportion to their ability\u201d even though they share joint custody); <em>In re Support of Rockman </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 498, 501, 705 P.2d 590, 591-92 (situation unconscionable when mother\u2019s income increased, father\u2019s income decreased).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b614 In this case, the condition of and situation between the parties is analogous to cases both where unconscionability was found and cases in which it was not found. Further, the language of the District Court findings here is similar to the language in <em>Jarussi. </em>Here, the District Court generally found the facts as outlined above that constitute the substantial and continuing changes in circumstances. The Court then made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">As practiced by the parents, the original child support calculation appears to have been improperly calculated, resulting in an excessive award of child support to the mother.... This factor goes to the weight of the need to reconsider child support in this Cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">It is apparent from any calculation of child support under the guidelines, that the father was entitled to an adjustment in the amount of child support. The mother requested that the amount of child support not be changed, but provided no legal basis for the Court not recognizing the changes in circumstances and the need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>to adjust the amount of child support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The District Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">A substantial and continuing change in circumstances has occurred, requiring that the child support be recalculated in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">These excerpts are the only portions of the court\u2019s Order that are relevant to unconscionability. Like <em>Jarussi, </em>these excerpts indicate the court simply found substantial and continuing changes automatically led to unconscionability, but did not separately consider unconscionability, as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b615 Further, the District Court, in stating \u201c[Kelly] requested that the amount of child support not be changed, but provided no legal basis for the Court,\u201d incorrectly placed the burden on Kelly to prove that the previous Agreement should not be changed, rather than placing the burden on Karl to demonstrate the situation made the existing terms unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u00b616 Karl essentially asserts that the court\u2019s language indicates the initial mistake in child support calculations that failed to account for the amount of time he spends with the children is per se unconscionable. Karl cites \u00a7 40-4-204, MCA, which requires that modifications be made in accordance with the child support guidelines and also provides that child support calculated under the guidelines has a presumption of reasonableness. However, the initial Agreement which incorrectly calculated child support reads: \u201cWe agree that our respective contributions should be made in consideration of the statutory child support guidelines, as is evidenced by the worksheets attached hereto.\u201d These worksheets indicate $369.40 per month owed child support, and Karl agreed to pay $360, later changed to $400. Further, the Agreement also indicates that \u201cnone of its provisions shall be subject to alteration, amendment, or modification ... [except] upon a showing in court of changed circumstances sufficient to render any term or terms hereof unconscionable.\u201d Karl himself conceded he had no \u201cqualms\u201d about the amount he paid in child support before he sought to modify the Agreement. Further, \u00a7 40-5-209, MCA, indicates that the guidelines are used to determine a \u201cminimum\u201d amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u00b617  Therefore, because the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions are too brief and conclusory to demonstrate that the District Court considered the unconscionability requirement of \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA, and because the Agreement between the parties also requires a finding of unconscionability, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to address the separate issue of unconscionability. We remand to the District Court for rehearing on this issue. In making this holding, we do not intend our decision to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>construed as a comment on whether the circumstances are unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b618 As guidance for the District Court on remand, we note that the parties to this action have focused on the fact that the child support guidelines, and the resultant child support found owing, directly relate to the amount of time spent with each parent. However, it is not proper to alter custody based on how much child support will result. Such an approach is not in the best interest of the children, which is the overriding policy that guides all such actions. Further, Kelly did not properly appeal the custody findings previously determined by the District Court. Therefore, if the District Court finds on remand that the changed circumstances in this case are unconscionable, any decision on modification of child support must keep in mind the best interests of the children. <em>Pearson, </em>\u00b6 29; <em>see </em>\u00a7 40-4-204, MCA; \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA; and \u00a7 40-4-234, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b619 Because the District Court did not make findings regarding unconscionability as required under \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, we reverse and remand for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b620 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b292-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\"> We note here that Kelly states in her opening brief that she submitted proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decree on September 19,1996. However, these proposed findings do not appear in the District Court\u2019s record submitted on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
