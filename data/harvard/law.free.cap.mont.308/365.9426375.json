We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u00b62 The following issue is raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in reversing the Board of Personnel Appeals\u2019 final order determining that the State Personnel Division incorrectly classified Child Support Investigators?</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A4h\">\u00b64 By way of background, the State of Montana utilizes a job classification system known as Benchmark Factoring Method (BFM). There are applications, principles and steps for properly applying the BFM. In accordance with the BFM, state employee positions are analyzed with respect to seven compensable factors: complexity; working conditions; knowledge, skills and abilities; management and supervision of others; supervision received; scope and effect of actions and decisions; and personal contacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">\u00b65. There is a numerical hierarchy (point system) assigned to each of the seven factors. Each numerical level has descriptive language. A trained classifier reviews the job duties of a particular position and selects the lowest level in which the full intent of the language captures the job duties. Once a factor level is determined, verification of the selected level is accomplished by comparing the position at issue with benchmark positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">\u00b66 The points assigned to each factor level are added. Depending on the number of points assigned, a position is allocated to a particular pay grade. The higher the number of points, the higher the grade. The higher the grade, the higher the employee\u2019s salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">\u00b67 The complexity factor measures the difficulty and nature of the tasks, steps and processes or methods, and the difficulty of mental processes, \u201cnecessary to identify what needs to be done\u201d in a position. It also measures the originality, problem solving, resourcefulness and conceptualization required to complete assigned tasks. When determining the complexity level, the predominant duty rule applies, and only the work performed 50 percent or more of the time may be considered. In those instances where no duty is performed 50 percent or more of the time, the predominant work is defined as those tasks or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>duties comprising at least 50 percent of the time at or above the complexity level assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b68 Here, Child Support Investigators (Investigators) employed by the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) filed a group classification appeal with the Montana Board of Personnel Appeals (Board). The State Personnel Division (Division) reviewed the Investigators\u2019 duties and issued a response to the appeal in which the Division maintained the Investigators at a Level 5 complexity classification factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b69 The Board\u2019s hearing officer conducted a contested case hearing. The sole issue presented at the hearing was whether the Investigators\u2019 duties warrant a complexity level of 5 or 6 under the BFM. At the hearing, the Division claimed that the Investigators\u2019 duties were properly classified at complexity Level 5. The Investigators, however, contended that their duties were more complex than the Division acknowledged, and they insisted that an increase to complexity Level 6 was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b610 The hearing officer issued findings of fact, conclusions of law and a recommended order maintaining the Investigators at complexity Level 5. In the hearing officer\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 1, he found that the Investigators each managed between 450 to 500 cases in which their basic major work responsibilities included determining paternity, determining financial and insurance needs and responsibilities and case tracking. He found that 80 percent of the Investigators\u2019 work activities involved case monitoring-or making sure that payments are made, insurance is current, and that family circumstances are static or adjustments are made for changes of circumstances. He further found that although the Investigators process each case with sufficient investigation and documentation to satisfy the requirements of a possible administrative hearing, less than 5 percent of the Investigators\u2019 duties involved actual hearing participation. In a separate finding, the hearing officer stated that the Investigators\u2019 Position Description documented in great detail the Investigators\u2019 major duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u00b611 Furthermore, in his findings, the hearing officer relied upon the hearing testimony of Art Swanson (Swanson), a Personnel Specialist for DPHHS, the testimony of Shannon Kirby (Kirby), a former Personnel Classification Specialist with the Department of Administration, who interviewed eight Investigators, and the Classification Manual\u2019s descriptive language for complexity Levels 5 and 6 in determining that the Investigators\u2019 \u201ccase work is fact driven, not concept driven.\u201d Accordingly, the hearing officer concluded that the Division properly applied the BFM and correctly classified the Investigators at complexity Level 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>\u00b612 The Investigators appealed the hearing officer\u2019s findings, conclusions and recommended order to the Board. The Board issued a final order in which it rejected, among other findings, most of the hearing officer\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 1. Additionally, the Board included findings regarding: the Investigators\u2019 participation on policy and procedure committees; their Level 6 knowledge, skills and abilities factor level; the testimony of Linda Dixon (Dixon), a former Personnel Classification Specialist with the Department of Administration; the testimony of former Administrative Law Judge John Koch; and the testimony of Bureau Chief Dennis Shober and Regional Supervisor Larry Racicot. The Board concluded that the Division improperly applied the BFM and incorrectly classified the Investigators. The Board further concluded that the proper complexity level for the Investigators was Level 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\">\u00b613 In response, the Division filed a petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s final order in the District Court. The court reviewed the administrative record and the parties\u2019 briefs and conducted a hearing. The court concluded that, with one exception, all of the hearing officer\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b614 The exception was the hearing officer\u2019s finding that 80 percent of the Investigators\u2019 case load involved monitoring. The court stated that 80 percent of the cases were in \u201cenforcement\u201d status, and that monitoring was one of the duties involved in enforcement. The court concluded the only language the Board properly deleted in Finding of Fact No. 1 was the word \u201cmonitoring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b615 Regarding the Board\u2019s added findings, the District Court noted that only the Investigators\u2019 predominant duties are considered in assessing the proper complexity level. The court concluded that the Board\u2019s new findings, including references to Dixon\u2019s testimony and the Investigators\u2019 committee involvement, reflected the Board\u2019s consideration of non-predominant duties. As to Dixon, the court stated, \u201c[t]he Board simply chose to accept the contradictory opinion of one witness over other witnesses whose testimony was adopted by the hearing examiner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b616 The District Court concluded that the hearing officer correctly applied the BFM, and he properly concluded that the Investigators\u2019 complexity level was 5. It ordered the Board to adopt the hearing officer\u2019s findings, conclusions and recommended order as modified by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u00b617 At this time, the Investigators appeal the District Court\u2019s decision. The Board has filed a brief as Amicus Curiae in support of the Investigators\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b618 In reviewing an administrative agency\u2019s findings of fact, the standard of judicial review for the District Court and this Court is whether the findings are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence in the whole record. Section 2-4-704(2)(a)(v), MCA; <em>State Personnel Division v. Board of Personnel Appeals </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 507, 511, 844 P.2d 68, 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b619  To determine if the district court\u2019s findings regarding an agency decision are clearly erroneous, this Court applies the following three-part test: (1) the record will be reviewed to see if the findings are supported by substantial evidence; (2) if the findings are supported by substantial evidence, it will be determined whether the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence; and (3) if substantial evidence exists and the effect of evidence has not been misapprehended, the Supreme Court may still decide that a finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, a review of the record leaves the court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Weitz v. Montana Dept. of Natural Resources and Conservation </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 130, 133-34, 943 P.2d 990, 992. Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. It consists of more that a mere scintilla of evidence but may be less than a preponderance. <em>Strom v. Logan, </em>2001 MT 30, \u00b6 23, 304 Mont. 176, \u00b6 23, 18 P.3d 1024, \u00b6 23 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b620  An agency\u2019s conclusions of law will be upheld if the agency\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State Personnel Division, </em>255 Mont. at 511, 844 P.2d at 71(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\u00b621 Did the District Court err in reversing the Board of Personnel Appeals\u2019 final order determining that the State Personnel Division incorrectly classified Child Support Investigators?</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\u00b622 We break this issue into three parts: (1) Did the District Court err in concluding that the Board improperly rejected a portion of the hearing officer\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 1; (2) Did the District Court err in determining that the Board\u2019s modified findings failed to reflect the Investigators\u2019 predominant duties under the predominant duty rule; and (3) Did the District Court fail to accord the Board proper deference in reviewing its conclusion of law that the State Personnel Division incorrectly classified Child Support Investigators?</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">\u00b623 (1) Did the District Court err in concluding that the Board improperly rejected a portion of the hearing officer\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 1?</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">\u00b624 In the District Court, the Division contended that the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>improperly rejected a number of the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact. The District Court, with one modification to Finding of Fact No. 1, agreed and ordered the Board to adopt the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact as modified. On appeal, the Investigators and Amicus claim that the District Court erred in ordering the Board to adopt the hearing officer\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 1 because it is not based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">\u00b625  An agency in its final order may not reject or modify the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact unless it first determines from a review of the complete record and states with particularity in the order that the findings of fact were not based upon competent substantial evidence. Section 2-4-621(3), MCA. Whether substantial evidence supports a finding of fact is a question of law. <em>Moran v. Shotgun Willies, Inc. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 47, 51, 889 P.2d 1185, 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b626 The purpose of \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA, is to prevent a reviewing body from substituting its judgment for that of the factfinder. <em>Dept. of Social and Rehabilitation Services v. Shodair Hospital </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 155, 160, 902 P.2d 21, 24. Section 2-4-704(2)(a)(vi), MCA, authorizes a reviewing court to reverse a Board\u2019s decision if it was \u201carbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion^]\u201d A rejection of a hearing officer\u2019s findings in violation of \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA, constitutes an abuse of discretion under \u00a7 2-4-704(2)(a)(vi), MCA. <em>Shodair Hospital, </em>273 Mont. at 160, 902 P.2d at 24 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b627 The hearing officer\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">The Appellants each manage 450 to 500 cases. Their basic major work responsibilities for each case include determining paternity, determining financial and insurance needs and responsibilities of each parent, and case tracking. The Appellants process each case with sufficient investigation and documentation to satisfy the requirements of a possible administrative hearing. Less than <em>5% of </em>the Appellants\u2019 responsibilities involved actual hearing participation. Eighty percent of the Appellants\u2019 work activities involve case monitoring. This activity requires the Appellants to make sure that payments are made, that insurance is current, that family circumstances are static or that adjustments are made for change of circumstance, i.e. more or less income, majority of a child, additional children, marriage, change of health insurer and so on. Once a case is assigned to an investigator he or she monitors the case from the date a child is bom and covered until the date of the child\u2019s majority. An investigator must make many phone calls and track the case on his or her computer. The Appellants regularly conduct fact investigation and attempt dispute resolution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u00b628 In its final order, the Board stated that \u201c[a] portion of Finding of Fact No. 1 is not supported by substantial evidence, in that the most accurate initial outline of the Appellants\u2019 duties is found in their Position Description (Exhibit J-28).\u201d The Board then deleted the following portions of Finding of Fact No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">The Appellants each manage 450 to 500 cases. Their basic major work responsibilities for each case include determining paternity, determining financial and insurance needs and responsibilities of each parent, and case tracking. The Appellants process each case with sufficient investigation and documentation to satisfy the requirements of a possible administrative hearing. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">Eighty percent of the Appellants\u2019 work activities involve case monitoring. This activity requires the Appellants to make sure that payments are made, that insurance is current, that family circumstances are static or that adjustments are made for change of circumstance, i.e. more or less income, majority of a child, additional children, marriage, change of health insurer and so on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acl\">\u00b629 With respect to the first three deleted sentences, the District Court concluded that substantial evidence supported the statements. Upon reviewing the whole record, we hold that this portion of Finding of Fact No. 1 was supported by substantial evidence, and the District Court properly concluded that the Board rejected it in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b630 The Board\u2019s deletion of the next statement that \u201c[e]ighty percent of the Appellants\u2019 work activities involve case monitoring,\u201d is at the heart of this appeal. The District Court held the hearing officer erred in making this finding. The court stated that 80 percent of the Investigators\u2019 cases were in enforcement status, and that monitoring is one of their enforcement duties. The court further stated that the hearing officer appropriately described the Investigators\u2019 enforcement activities. The court concluded that \u201cthe only language properly deleted by the Board was the word \u2018monitoring\u2019 in reference to the description of what constituted 80 percent of the investigators\u2019 duties. The Board erred in deleting the remainder of the language in Finding No. 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b631 The Board and Amicus claim that both the hearing officer and the District Court erred in concluding that Investigators spend 80 percent of their time \u201cmonitoring\u201d or \u201cenforcing\u201d cases. They surmise that the hearing officer and court misconstrued Investigator Carla Rister\u2019s hearing testimony that 80 percent of an Investigators\u2019 caseload must be in \u201cenforcement status\u201d to mean that the Investigators spend 80 percent of their time monitoring and enforcing cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\u00b632 The Investigators point to Investigator Debra Edsall\u2019s testimony that she monitors cases only one hour per week. The Investigators insist \u201c[t]he fact that child support orders have been established in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>approximately 80% of [the Investigators\u2019] cases does not mean that investigators spend 80% of their time working on those cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\">\u00b633 In response, the Division argues that the hearing officer, in referring to \u201cmonitoring\u201d rather than \u201cenforcement,\u201d merely made a one word, de minimis error, and that the District Court properly corrected this error. The Division refers to the Investigators\u2019 testimony explaining that they monitor cases at the enforcement level to ensure that payments are made or that parents are in compliance with support orders. However, the Division fails to address how much time Investigators spend actually monitoring or enforcing cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b634  We conclude that the Board properly rejected this portion of Finding of Fact No. 1. There exists no substantial evidence in the record to support the hearing officer\u2019s finding that 80 percent of the Investigators\u2019 work involves case monitoring. Nor is there substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s corrected version that 80 percent of the Investigators\u2019 work activities involve case enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"APk\">\u00b635 Rather, the record indicates that 80 percent of an Investigators\u2019 caseload is in enforcement <em>status. </em>According to witness testimony, this means that support and medical orders have issued and the Investigators then take actions to enforce the orders if parents are not in compliance or modify the orders if necessary. Investigator Debra Edsall testified that investigators spend only one hour per week, or approximately 2.5 percent of their time, monitoring cases in enforcement status to determine whether parents are in compliance with support and medical orders. This testimony is consistent with the Investigators\u2019 Position Description. It includes case monitoring as one of several enforcement duties which comprise only 25 percent of the Investigators\u2019 time. The Position Description indicates the Investigators spend 73 percent of their time performing establishment duties necessary to locate parents, establish paternity and establish child and medical support orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b636 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in concluding that the Board improperly rejected the portion of the hearing officer\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 1 stating that 80 percent of the Investigators\u2019 work activities involve case monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b637 (2) Did the District Court err in determining that the Board\u2019s modified findings failed to reflect the Investigators\u2019 predominant duties under the predominant duty rule?</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u00b638 In its final order, the Board adopted several of the Investigators\u2019 proposed findings of fact that the hearing officer did not accept. The Board concluded that the hearing officer\u2019s failure to include the findings, which were supported by substantial evidence, left the Board with the definite and firm conviction that the hearing officer made a mistake. These additional findings included the Investigators\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>committee participation and development of new policies and procedures and their Level 6 knowledge, skills and abilities factor level. The Board also made the following Finding of Fact Nos. 11 and 12 regarding Linda Dixon\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">Dixon also testified that the Appellants\u2019 predominant duties merit a factor level 6 for complexity because they involve the interpretation and application of a complex set of statutes', case law, regulations, policies and procedures in the performance of complex and diverse professional assignments ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">Dixon farther testified that the diversity of the work, combined with the Appellants\u2019 creativity, innovation, developmental work in terms of applying the guidelines and participating in committees that constantly revise how child support casework is done, together with the fact that case law is always changing, creates a level of complexity that removes the standard or routine nature of the work that is more typically described by Level 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Auy\">\u00b639 The Board\u2019s added Finding of Fact No. 13 summarized former Administrative Law Judge John Koch\u2019s testimony that the child support guidelines that the Investigators utilized were \u201camong the most complex in the nation and that the Appellants\u2019 level of legal knowledge of child support issues exceeds that of the attorneys who appeared before him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b640 The Board also added Finding of Fact No. 14 detailing an interview between Bureau Chief Dennis Shober and Regional Supervisor Larry Racicot regarding child support investigator duties. In sum, they stated that Investigators are involved in policy and procedure development, complex hearing issues, deciphering court decisions and manuals, resolving difficult, complex and sensitive problems, a \u201chuge\u201d variety of issues and case law activities, and advanced accounting systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\u00b641 Finally, the Board added Finding of Fact No. 15 stating that both Linda Dixon and Investigator Debra Edsall testified that the Investigators perform all of the duties Dennis Shober and Larry Racicot described. It further stated that \u201c[d]uring her testimony, Shannon Kirby did not contest these statements or any other assertion of fact made by the Appellants\u2019 witnesses regarding the Appellants\u2019job duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\u00b642 While the Board added these findings, it left intact the hearing officer\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 6 reflecting the testimony of Art Swanson, a Personnel Specialist for DPHHS, who identified complexity Level 5 as appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">Work involves the application of principles and practices of child support enforcement to determine financial responsibility, prepare written findings, and monitor cases in the investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>of alleged support violations for a specific region of the state. Actions consist of intellectual analysis which involves interpreting and enforcing state and federal child support laws, reviewing and evaluating case files and determining the validity of information and the extent of alleged child support violation. Information is received in the form of records, documents, interviews, and affidavits and is handled by examining, planing [sic] and conducting investigations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-3\">\u00b643 The Board also left intact the hearing officer\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 7 summarizing Shannon Kirby\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">Shannon Kirby, a former Personnel Classification Specialist with the Department of Administration is the author of the Step II Classification Response (Exhibit J-35). Kirby interviewed eight employees in the Child Support Enforcement Division and reviewed the Appellants\u2019 position description. She concluded the complexity level 5 is appropriate for the Appellants. Kirby also compared the Appellants\u2019 5 complexity designation to two benchmark positions, Child Support Investigator, grade 13 and Child Support Regional Supervisor, grade 16. This comparison supported her conclusion that the Appellants are properly rated at level 5 complexity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b644 In determining whether the Board properly modified the hearing officer\u2019s findings, the District Court was required to review the hearing officer\u2019s findings and determine whether they were based on competent substantial evidence under \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA. If the court determined that the findings were supported, it was required to then determine whether the Board\u2019s modification of the findings was characterized by an abuse of discretion under \u00a7 2-4-704(2)(a)(vi), MCA. <em>Moran, </em>270 Mont. at 51-52, 889 P.2d at 1187-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b645 Here, the District Court concluded that the hearing officer\u2019s findings, as corrected by the court, were supported by substantial evidence in the record. The court did not expressly conclude that the Board abused its discretion in modifying the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact. However, it criticized the modified findings, stating in part that Dixon\u2019s testimony, unlike that of Swanson and Kirby, included consideration of non-predominant duties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">It should be noted that only the predominant duties are to be considered in assessing the complexity factor under the Benchmark Factoring Method.... From the record, there appears to be little dispute as to what the investigators\u2019 predominant duties are. While Dixon\u2019s opinion rested on the entire scope of the investigators\u2019 duties, the hearing examiner focused on the predominant aspects of the job. The Board subsequently made new findings reflecting its consideration of non-predominant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>duties in concluding that the complexity factor should be increased to level 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u00b646 The Investigators claim that the District Court erred in concluding that Dixon\u2019s testimony was not based on the Investigators\u2019 predominant duties under the predominant duty rule. They state while the Board included references to several job duties which, independently, are not predominant, this does not mean that the Board did not consider, collectively, the Investigators\u2019 predominant duties. In addition, the Investigators note that the hearing officer and the District Court did not focus on the predominant aspects of their job when finding that they spend 80 percent of their time monitoring or enforcing cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u00b647 Similarly, the Amicus contends that since the Investigators do not have one single duty that constitutes 50 percent or more of their work, the Board appropriately developed all of the facts regarding the \u201cmyriad\u201d of duties the Investigators perform before determining their complexity level.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\u00b648 In contrast, the Division maintains that the District Court\u2019s assessment of Dixon\u2019s testimony and the hearing officer\u2019s focus on the Investigators\u2019 predominant duties was a reliable reflection of the record as a whole. The Division admits that no one duty is predominant, but it argues that Kirby, rather than Dixon, properly identified the most difficult body of work that the Investigators perform at least 50 percent of the time. The Division criticizes Dixon\u2019s qualifications and claims she lacked familiarity with the Investigators\u2019 current position. It also questions her reliance on the \u201cmore advanced\u201d Investigator Team Leader position description in forming an opinion regarding the Investigators\u2019 duties. The Divisi\u00f3n states \u201c[Dixon\u2019s] testimony had far less foundation and credibility then [sic] Ms. Kirby\u2019s,\u201d and \u201c[t]he Hearing Officer appropriately gave the greatest weight to Ms. Kirby\u2019s credentials and hands on, in depth analysis and conclusions.\u201d Finally, according to the Division, the Board \u201cjumped to\u201d its own findings of fact without articulating why the hearing officer\u2019s findings were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"AfY\">\u00b649 At the outset, we address the Division\u2019s criticism of Dixon\u2019s qualifications. The fatal flaw in the Division\u2019s argument is that there is no indication that the hearing officer found that Dixon was not qualified or mistakenly considered irrelevant materials when coming to her conclusions. Nor is there any indication that the hearing officer gave the greatest weight to Kirby\u2019s credentials, analysis and conclusions. Only the Division has made these statements. As the Division notes, the hearing officer heard the witnesses\u2019 testimony \u201cfirst hand\u201d and could judge the credibility of the witnesses. We conclude that if Dixon\u2019s credibility and expertise were not issues for the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>officer, they are not issues for our consideration now.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\">\u00b650 Turning to the question of predominant duties, we must determine whether the Board\u2019s modification of the hearing officer\u2019s findings was characterized by an abuse of discretion. We conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b651 According to the State Classification Manual, portions of which were admitted as a joint exhibit at the hearing, the predominant duty rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">The factors Complexity, Supervision Received, and Scope and Effect and Personal Contacts are applied to the work performed 50 percent of the time or more. In those instances where no duty is performed 50 percent or more of the time, the predominant work is defined as those tasks or duties comprising at least 50 percent of the time at or above the complexity level assigned. The predominant duties must be fully equivalent to the overall intent of the factor-level description in order to receive the rating. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\u00b652 Here, all of the parties agree that the Investigators perform no one duty 50 percent of the time or more. As such, the hearing officer and the Board were required to consider those tasks or duties comprising at least 50 percent of the Investigators\u2019 time at or above the complexity level assigned. The Investigators\u2019 Position Description reveals that the Investigators spend 73 percent of their time establishing child support and medical support orders. Included in these establishment duties are researching, preparing and conducting cases for administrative hearings. Additionally, Dixon testified that the Investigators are actively involved in committees which address policy and procedure changes, such as computer committees, accounting committees and administrative hearing committees. Investigator Rister testified she has participated on medical support enforcement committees and that, in her office, Investigators were required to participate in at least one to two committees per year if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\u00b653 Dixon and Rister also testified that committee and hearing duties were not duties that the Investigators performed 50 percent of the time or more. In fact, it was established that hearing work, in particular, comprised approximately 5 percent of the Investigators\u2019 establishment duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\u00b654  Nevertheless, even if these duties comprise a small percentage of the Investigators\u2019 establishment duties, they are part of the establishment duties that the Investigators perform over 50 percent of the time. Consequently, we conclude that the Board was correct in its conviction that a mistake was committed due to the hearing officer\u2019s omission of the Investigators\u2019 proposed findings. Furthermore, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>conclude that the District Court erred in determining that the Board\u2019s modified findings failed to reflect the Investigators\u2019 predominant duties under the predominant duty rule. We hold that, in accordance with \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA, the Board in its final order properly modified the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact after determining from a review of the complete record and stating with particularity that the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact, as a whole, were not based upon competent substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b655 (3) Did the District Court fail to accord the Board proper deference in reviewing its conclusion of law that the State Personnel Division incorrectly classified Child Support Investigators?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b656 The Investigators contend that, in contrast to the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact, the Board was not required to defer to the hearing officer\u2019s conclusions of law or interpretations of administrative rules pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA. They argue this is particularly true in this case since the hearing officer arrived at his legal conclusion assigning the Investigators a complexity level of 5 based on the \u201cwrong set of job duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b657 The Investigators claim that, on the other hand, the District Court was required to defer to the Board\u2019s legal conclusions. They argue that the Board is the final administrative authority on employee classification appeals under \u00a7\u00a7 2-18-203, 2-18-1011, and 2-18-1012, MCA. Citing <em>In re Grievance of Brady, </em>1999 MT 153, 295 Mont. 75, 983 P.2d 292, the Investigators contend that because it is the Board\u2019s legal responsibility to ensure that state employees are properly classified in accordance with the BFM, the District Court should have deferred to its interpretation of the applicable administrative rules and practices in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u00b658 In particular, the Investigators claim that Swanson\u2019s, Dixon\u2019s and Kirby\u2019s opinions regarding whether the Investigators\u2019 complexity level is 5 or 6 involve a dispute of law rather than fact, and, as such, the Board could accept or reject their opinions without deference to the hearing officer. They fault the District Court for applying a finding of fact standard of review to the opinions of the expert witnesses and, as a result, failing to defer to the Board\u2019s interpretation of the applicable rules governing the classification of employee positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\u00b659 The Amicus agrees. It states that the expert witness opinions regarding the proper complexity level \u201cclearly address a conclusion of law, [and] cannot be argued to preclude Board consideration of the ultimate issue on the grounds that to do so would violate the review standard for a finding of fact. Such an action would improperly transfer authority to decide the ultimate issue from the Court to the expert witness.\u201d The Amicus also maintains that since the Board did not owe any deference to the hearing officer\u2019s conclusions of law, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>could invalidate them under \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\">\u00b660 The Division disagrees. It contends that the District Court did not owe deference to the Board\u2019s interpretation of the BFM rules, regulations and practices because the Board does not promulgate them-the Division does under \u00a7 2-18-202, MCA. As such, the Division insists that the District Court should have deferred to its interpretation of its own rules. It further states that under <em>Matter of Mead, </em>235 Mont. at 213-14, 766 P.2d at 1303, the Board was required to uphold the Division\u2019s decision if it found that the Division properly followed its rules, regulations and practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b661 We have previously addressed the district court\u2019s role in reviewing administrative decisions when it does not hear live testimony. In Weber <em>v. Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Board </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 239, 245, 890 P.2d 1296, 1299-1300, we stated that we do not review the district court to determine if substantial credible evidence supports its decision. Rather, we review the district court\u2019s decision to determine whether it properly applied the correct standard of review to the administrative decision-here, the Board\u2019s decision. That is, did the District Court determine whether the Board\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous and was the Board\u2019s interpretation of the law correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b662  The interpretation of an administrative rule and an agency\u2019s policy is a question of law. <em>Easy v. State of Montana Dept. of Natural Resources and Conservation </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 306, 308-09, 752 P.2d 746, 748 (citations omitted); <em>Brady, </em>\u00b6 22. In its final order, an agency may reject or modify a hearing officer\u2019s conclusion of law and interpretation of administrative rules in the proposal for decision. Section 2-4-621(3), MCA. In other words, the Board in this case was not bound by the hearing officer\u2019s conclusions of law or its interpretation of the BFM rules and practices. <em>Brady, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b663  However, the District Court was bound by the Board\u2019s conclusions of law and interpretation of administrative rules if they were correct. In determining whether an agency correctly interpreted its own rules, procedures and policies, we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">The agency\u2019s interpretation of its rule is afforded great weight, and the court should defer to that interpretation unless it is \u201cplainly inconsistent\u201d with the spirit of the rule. The agency\u2019s interpretation of the rule will be sustained so long as it lies within the range of reasonable interpretation permitted by the wording.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ams\"><em>Brady, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>Easy, </em>231 Mont. at 309, 752 P.2d at 748 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\u00b664 Regarding employment classification cases in particular, we have recognized that the Department of Administration is responsible for developing guidelines for classification. <em>Matter of Mead, </em>235 Mont. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>216, 766 P.2d at 1305. The Board in a classification appeal is limited, under \u00a7 2-18-203(2), MCA, and <em>Matter of Mead, </em>to determining whether a position is properly classified. If the Board determines that the position is improperly classified, and the employee is, therefore, aggrieved, the Board can resolve the grievance under \u00a7 2-18-1012, MCA, by ordering the Division to reclassify the position. <em>State Personnel Division, </em>255 Mont. at 513, 844 P.2d at 72. Such a determination necessitates an examination of the classification process utilized by the Division. <em>Matter of Mead, </em>235 Mont. at 214, 766 P.2d at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b665 Simply stated, the Board, as the final administrative authority in the state employee classification process, must review and interpret the applicable rules promulgated by the Department of Administration. Indeed, the Board could not fulfill its duty to determine whether employees were properly classified if it did not interpret the BFM rules, regulations and practices. However, while the Board is free to reject its hearing officer\u2019s conclusions of law and interpretations regarding the BFM, the District Court may not reject the Board\u2019s conclusions and interpretations unless they are incorrect. \u00b666 Here, the sole issue presented to the hearing officer was whether the Investigators\u2019 duties warranted a Level 5 or 6 complexity level. The Board reviewed the hearing officer\u2019s interpretation and application of the Level 5 and Level 6 BFM Classification Manual descriptions. Largely summarized, these definitions provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\"><em>Level 5: </em>Application of professional principles and practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">Adapting policies, precedents and practices to specific situations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">Standard, practical, or recurring professional assignments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">Advanced or novel technical assignments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\"><em>Level 6: </em>Advanced application of professional principles and practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">Complex and/or diverse professional assignments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-12\">Advanced or innovative technical assignments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-13\">Practical management issues and applications with a limited range of management activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">\u00b667 On the basis of his findings regarding the Investigators\u2019 duties, Kirby and Swanson\u2019s testimony, as well as the complete Level 5 and 6 classification descriptions, the hearing officer concluded that complexity Level 5 was appropriate for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-15\">The Appellants\u2019 work duties and responsibilities, according to their position description and testimony, show that 80% of their work duties involve case monitoring. The work involves conflicting information, analysis and interpretation of interrelationships. The Appellants develop individual case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>solutions. The case work is fact driven, not concept driven. The Appellants apply policy and procedure to fact situations. The difference between level 5 and level 6, as they apply to the Appellants, is the application of procedure to facts, level 5, and not the interpretation or development of policy, level 6. The duties identified in the Appellants\u2019 position description and the Exhibit J-29 affidavit are complexity level 5. This conclusion is based upon the basic difference between level 5 and 6 which is fact driven in level 5 work versus theory development and application in level 6 work. The Appellants are properly assigned a level 5 for work complexity. The Department of Administration properly applied the classification methodology and reached the appropriate conclusion for complexity level assignment for the Appellants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">\u00b668 The Board reviewed the record and the Division\u2019s actions to determine if it properly classified the Investigators at a Level 5 complexity factor. Upon reviewing the Division\u2019s findings of fact and conclusion of law, the Board concluded that the Division improperly applied the classification methodology and incorrectly classified the Investigators in violation of \u00a7 2-18-202, MCA. The Board then concluded that the Investigators\u2019 complexity level was Level 6. Upon thorough review of the whole record, we determine that this conclusion was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b669 First, according to the BFM rules, the Division was required to interpret and apply the predominant duty rule when determining whether the Investigators\u2019 complexity level was 5 or 6. Here, the hearing officer concluded that \u201c[t]he [Investigators\u2019] work duties and responsibilities, according to their position description and testimony, show that 80% of their work duties involve case monitoring.\u201d As we discussed above, the Board appropriately concluded that the hearing officer erroneously found that the Investigators\u2019 predominant duty was case monitoring. Any conclusion flowing from this finding was suspect. As a result, the Board appropriately modified the hearing officer\u2019s findings to reflect all of the Investigators\u2019 duties under the predominant duty rule, and, based on the modified findings, proceeded to determine whether the hearing officer correctly concluded that complexity Level 5 was appropriate. This was entirely reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b670 Second, contrary to the District Court\u2019s opinion, the Board did not improperly rely upon Linda Dixon\u2019s testimony in concluding that the Investigators\u2019 predominant duties merit a Level 6 complexity factor level. The District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">The Board relied on Linda Dixon\u2019s testimony, which contradicted that of Kirby and Swanson in her opinion as to the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>complexity level. The Board simply chose to accept the contradictory opinion of one witness over other witnesses whose testimony was adopted by the hearing examiner. As previously stated, the Board may reverse the hearing examiner\u2019s findings of fact only if those findings are not supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b671 In this case, the record reveals no real dispute among the experts as to what the Investigators\u2019 predominant duties entailed. Rather, their dispute involved whether these duties warranted a complexity level of 5 or 6 under the BFM. The determination of whether a Level 5 or 6 complexity level is appropriate is a question of law-not a finding of fact. Therefore, the standard of review for a conclusion of law was applicable to the Board\u2019s conclusions as to the Investigators\u2019 complexity level, and the District Court erred by imposing particularity and substantial evidence requirements on the Board\u2019s conclusions of law. Pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA, the Board was free to reach a different conclusion than the hearing officer on the ultimate issue in this case without implicating a finding of fact standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b672 Finally, the Board\u2019s interpretation of the BFM rules, regulations and practices was plainly consistent with the spirit of the rules and reasonable. After considering all of the findings of fact as modified, as well as Kirby and Swanson\u2019s testimony, the BFM and the complexity level descriptions, the Board concluded that the Investigators\u2019 predominant work duties and responsibilities, according to their position description and testimony, involved the interpretation of ambiguous case law, statutes, and guidelines. It determined that they deal with complex and constantly changing regulations, policies and procedures, and they exercise considerable discretion in assessing and resolving sensitive problems in the areas of paternity and order establishment and enforcement. The Board also concluded the Investigators participate in the development and implementation of new policies and procedures and achieve a thorough knowledge of the principles and practices of their field as well as diverse fields such as legal procedure, investigative and mediation theory, dispute resolution techniques, negotiation and problem solving methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b673  In conclusion, the Board reasonably interpreted the applicable classification rules and correctly concluded that the Division improperly classified the Investigators in violation of \u00a7 2-18-202, MCA. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in reversing the Board\u2019s final order. The District Court is reversed, and the Board\u2019s final order is reinstated in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b410-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, COTTER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
