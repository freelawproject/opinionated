H. Oftedal and Sons, Inc. (Oftedal) brought this action in the First Judicial District, Lewis and Clark County, seeking an upward revision of the contract sum on a federal-aid highway project, because of an error in its submitted bid. Oftedal initially sought relief from the Montana Transportation Commission (Commission) by requesting either the withdrawal of the bid or an upward revision to reflect the amount of the error. After the Commission\u2019s denial of Oftedal\u2019s request, Oftedal sought equitable relief from the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 28-2-1611, et seq., MCA. The parties agreed that no issues of material fact existed and that the matter would be appropriate for summary judgment upon presentation of stipulated facts and documents. The parties submitted cross-motions for summary judgment, and on September 25, 2000, the District Court entered its order denying summary judgment to Oftedal and granting summary judgment to the State. Oftedal subsequently filed a Rule 59, M.R.Civ.P., Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment, and on November 29, 2000, the District Court denied Oftedal\u2019s motion. On appeal, Oftedal requests this Court to reverse the decision of the District Court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>order the District Court to effect an upward revision of the executed contract to reflect the amount of Oftedal\u2019s error, and to order specific enforcement of the contract as so revised.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b62 We reverse the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the State and denial of summary judgment to Oftedal.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b63 Pursuant to authority granted in \u00a7 60-2-111, MCA, the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT) advertised for sealed bids for federal-aid highway project No. PLH-STPS-CT314-l(13)32-Northem Cheyenne Border-North (project). MDT prepared all forms for the proposal, which the stipulated documents refer to as the Bid Package. The Bid Package informed each bidder that the successful bidder would have to pay a portion of the total contract amount to the Tribal Employment Rights Office of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, an assessment known as a \u201cTERO\u201d tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\u00b64 On August 19, 1999, Oftedal and two other bidders, in response to the invitation for bids, submitted sealed bids for the project to MDT. Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 18-1-201 and -202, MCA, MDT must, as a condition precedent to considering such bids, require that each bidder submit bid security in the amount of 10 percent of the bid price as an indemnity against the bidder\u2019s failure or refusal to enter into any written contract that may be awarded upon or following the acceptance of the bid. Oftedal complied by furnishing an appropriate corporate bid bond. On August 19, 1999, the bids were opened and publicly read. A representative of Oftedal was present and heard the total dollar amount of each submitted bid, as well as MDT\u2019s own estimate for the project. Oftedal\u2019s bid was in the amount of $7,818,265.98, which was $1,419,207.00 (15 percent) lower than MDT\u2019s engineer\u2019s estimate of construction costs of the project, $1,277,882.00 lower than the second lowest bidder, and $1,545,749.00 less than the third bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">\u00b65 After the bid opening, Oftedal\u2019s officers and employees, including its estimator, Cameron Lundby, suspected mistakes. Lundby reviewed the bid but could find no error and so advised management, which relied upon his review. Lundby, immediately following the August 19 bid opening, had numerous other company duties and obligations as well as personal family concerns which required that he be absent from the state from August 24 through August 31, 1999. During this same time, Lundby was also the project manager for two major Wyoming highway reconstruction projects, was procuring work at an Idaho mine, procuring trucking work on a federal highway project in Yellowstone Park, and preparing a bid for a complex project for the Bonneville <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Power Administration. Lundby was the only Oftedal employee who had worked on this bid and was capable of reviewing the bid for errors.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqy\">\u00b66 On September 1, 1999, the Commission met and voted to award the project to Oftedal. As of that date, Oftedal had not advised MDT or the Commission of any problems with its bid, and neither had MDT contacted Oftedal about the bid since the bid opening. On that same day, MDT mailed a written notice to Oftedal that it had been awarded the project, which included four copies of the contract for the project, as well as written explanation of the insurance and bonding requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b67 After Oftedal received notice of the award, Lundby began converting the bid to a computerized project budget, and during this process discovered the following bidding errors, as indicated in the parties\u2019 stipulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">1. The select surfacing item was bid as an embankment item instead of a gravel item. The bid work sheets, true copies of which have at all times been in the possession of the MDT, disclose that Oftedal did not include any money in the bid for a pug mill operation, the necessary compaction equipment, or the hauling and compaction of additional material equal to the moisture added at the pug mill. Oftedal\u2019s additional cost for this work is $483,000;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">2. Oftedal omitted the <em>3% </em>TERO tax to be paid to the Northern Cheyenne Tribe for work on the Reservation. The cost of this tax is $234,500;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">3. Oftedal\u2019s estimator did not save the cost entered for crushing the cover material grade4A which resulted in the estimating software reverting to the cost of zero. The cost of this crushing is $44,500; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">4. Oftedal\u2019s estimator did not update the price of diesel fuel for this estimate which resulted in underestimating this cost by $.17 per gallon. This fuel cost would be $27,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">If Oftedal had not made these errors, the bid would have been in the siun of $8,607,265.98, $789,000 higher than the actual bid. If the contract amount was revised upward to reflect Oftedal\u2019s errors, Oftedal\u2019s revised bid would still be the low bid for this project by $428,625.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">\u00b68 Immediately upon discovery of these errors on September 2, 1999, Lundby called MDT\u2019s Chief Engineer at its Billings office, Myron Wilson, to inform him of the errors and, in his absence, left him a message. Wilson returned Lundby\u2019s call on September 3, 1999, and referred Lundby to Craig Favero, MDT\u2019s engineering project manager, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>to discuss alternative construction methods to mitigate Oftedal\u2019s mistakes. MDT\u2019s engineers could not determine any construction method to mitigate Oftedal\u2019s mistakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b69 On September 7, 1999, Lundby discussed the mistakes and opinions of MDT\u2019s engineers with Oftedal\u2019s president, Bill Oftedal, and comptroller, Ray James. Oftedal\u2019s officers concluded that their only option was to request withdrawal of the bid and directed Lundby to immediately write a letter to MDT requesting withdrawal. The letter was mailed and faxed to Favero that same day, and was forwarded to the Commission on September 9, 1999. On September 16, the Commission met and denied Oftedal\u2019s request to withdraw its bid, even though one of the commissioners noted that Oftedal\u2019s mistake would have appeared obvious when the bids were opened. The Commission then gave notice that Oftedal had twenty calendar days from the date of award to execute and return the contract or the Commission would require forfeiture of Oftedal\u2019s bid bond in the amount of $781,826.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b610 After the Commission\u2019s denial of Oftedal\u2019s request to withdraw its bid, Oftedal wrote MDT on September 20,1999, requesting an upward revision of its bid to reflect the mistakes. The letter further stated that, under the threat of forfeiting its substantial bid bond, Oftedal would have no choice but to sign the contract under protest with reservation of rights to litigate this matter should the Commission not grant the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b611 Oftedal again wrote MDT the next day, September 21, 1999, requesting that the Commission, in addition to considering an upward revision of the bid amount, reconsider Oftedal\u2019s previous request to withdraw its bid, based upon Paragraph F of MDT\u2019s bid proposal form, entitled REVISION OF BID, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">In submitting this bid, bidder agrees that it waives any right or ability to claim, request or receive any upward revision of this bid without the express written consent of the Department and in accordance with the standard specifications. If bidder discovers a material mistake in its bid (factual mistake, not judgmental), it understands and agrees that it may either perform the contract as originally bid, or else bidder understands and agrees that it may request the Transportation Commission for permission to withdraw its bid. It is agreed that the Commission will review the request to determine if a mistake occurred, was material and factual, and whether the bid should be allowed to be withdrawn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1\">\u00b612 The Commission met on September 22, 1999, and rejected Oftedal\u2019s request to rescind the award without forfeiture of the bid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>bond and award the project to the second low bidder, and further rejected Oftedal\u2019s request to modify and revise the contract sum upward to reflect the inadvertent mistakes, and enter a contract accordingly. Present at this meeting was chief counsel for MDT, who agreed that it was obvious that Oftedal had made a mistake and further, that Oftedal did not intend to make the mistake. Also present at the meeting was the Division Deputy Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) who informed the Commission that, if the Commission released Oftedal from its bid without forfeiting its bid bond, FHWA would not allow federal money to be used for any increased cost to MDT over and above Oftedal\u2019s original bid. This was a consideration in the Commission\u2019s denial of Oftedal\u2019s request. Oftedal then signed a contract, under protest, for the amount originally bid and initiated this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\n<em>ISSUE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b613 Whether the District Court erred in denying equitable relief to Oftedal pursuant to \u00a7 28-2-1611, et seq., MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b6 14 This Court reviews an order granting summary judgment <em>de </em>novo. <em>Oliver v. Stimson Lumber </em>Co., 1999 MT 328, \u00b6 21, 297 Mont. 336, \u00b6 21, 993 P.2d 11, \u00b6 21 (citations omitted). We review the facts presented to the district court to determine whether, based on Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., the prevailing party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Gentry v. Douglas Hereford Ranch, </em>1998 MT 182, \u00b6 23, 290 Mont. 126, \u00b6 23, 962 P.2d 1205, \u00b6 23 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">\u00b615 Section 28-2-1611, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">When written contract may be revised by court. When, through fraud or a mutual mistake of the parties or a mistake of one party while the other at the time knew or suspected, a written contract does not truly express the intention of the parties, it may be revised on the application of a party aggrieved so as to express that intention, so far as it can be done without prejudice to rights acquired by third persons in good faith and for value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">Section 28-2-409, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">What constitutes mistake of fact.

For the purpose of revising a contract, it must be presumed that all the parties thereto intended to make an equitable and conscientious agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Section 28-2-1613, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">Scope of court\u2019s inquiry. In revising a written instrument, the court may inquire what the instrument was intended to mean and what were intended to be its legal consequences and is not confined to the inquiry what the language of the instrument was intended to be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b616 As a preliminary matter, we note the State\u2019s argument that \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA, is generic, applying to contracts in general, but that the statute has no application to public works contracts. The State contends that the competitive bidding statutes in Title 60 are applicable here and determinative of the issues Oftedal has raised.</p>\n<p id=\"ARk\">\u00b617 We agree with the State that there is a difference between public works contracts and other contracts, and that public works contracts are let in accordance with Title 60. Competitive bidding statutes are primarily intended for the benefit of the public rather than for the benefit or enrichment of bidders, and consideration of advantages or disadvantages to bidders must be secondary to the general welfare of the public. <em>Baker v. State </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 235, 239, 707 P.2d 20, 23; <em>Stuewe v. Hindson </em>(1912), 44 Mont. 429, 437, 120 P. 485, 487. <em>Also see </em>64 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Public Works and Contracts </em>\u00a7 82 (1972) (statutes for letting of public contracts are enacted for the benefit of the public and should be carried out with the sole reference to the public interest, and accordingly the rights of bidders must always be held subordinate to that interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">\u00b618  However, that the competitive bidding statutes were established for the benefit of the public rather than to establish the rights of bidders does not necessarily exempt public contracts from fundamental contract analysis, or remedies at law or in equity provided by other statutes. Nothing in the competitive bidding statutes places public contracts somehow out of reach of the equitable relief provided by \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA, if a party otherwise qualifies for such relief under the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">\u00b619  Further, the public bidding statutes and contract modification statutes are not inherently inconsistent. \u201cIt is good statutory construction law that where one part of the law deals with a subject in general and comprehensive terms, while another part of it deals in a more minute and definite way, the two parts should be read together and, if possible, harmonized, with a view to giving effect to a consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>legislative policy.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Schuman v. Bestrom </em>(1985), 214 Mont. 410, 415, 693 P.2d 536, 538-39; <em>City of Butte v. Industrial Accident Board </em>(1916), 52 Mont. 75, 156 P. 130; <em>Stadler v. City of Helena </em>(1912), 46 Mont. 128, 127 P. 454. As \u00a7 28-2-1611, et seq., MCA, does not conflict with the public contracting process set forth in \u00a7 60-2-110, et seq., MCA, we conclude that \u00a7 28-2-1611, et seq., MCA, can be applied to public contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">A. Contract Formation</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b620 Oftedal argues that the District Court erred by concluding that Oftedal did not give timely notice of the mistakes prior to the award, as opposed to prior to the \u201cwritten contract,\u201d as referenced in \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA. The District Court found, even in light of the MDT commissioner\u2019s comment that Oftedal\u2019s mistakes would have appeared obvious at the bid opening, that the Commission was not aware of, nor should it have suspected, Offcedal\u2019s mistakes when it awarded the project. The District Court concluded, therefore, that MDT could not \u201cat that time, know or suspect\u201d that the contract did not truly express the intention of the parties, as required for relief under \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b621 Oftedal contends that it gave a timely, good faith notice of its mistakes immediately upon discovery, which was the day that the Notice of Award was received, and approximately twenty days prior to the deadline for executing a written contract. Oftedal argues that a contract was not formed by the Commission\u2019s award of the proj ect, and therefore, it gave timely notice of its mistake prior to the formation of the project contract, and thus, MDT did \u201cknow at the time\u201d of Oftedal\u2019s errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b622 The State replies that, for public contracts, a contract is created when the project is \u201cawarded\u201d rather than at the execution of the written instrument and that, for MDT to \u201cknow at the time\u201d as required by \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA, MDT was required to know of Oftedal\u2019s mistake prior to the award. The State contends that our decision in <em>Baker v. State, supra, </em>is controlling on the question of formation of public contracts. Thus, the State argues that, even if \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA, does apply to public contracts, the conditions required under that statute for judicial modification upon unilateral mistake have not been met, as MDT neither knew or suspected the mistake prior to the formation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">\u00b623 To support its contention, the State points to dicta in <em>Baker, </em>which states that \u201c[t]he advertisement for bids is not an offer which by acceptance constitutes a contract. It is merely an invitation to every bidder to make an offer, which the board may accept, and a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>result...\u201d <em>Baker, </em>218 Mont. at 239-40, 707 P.2d at 23 (citing <em>Stuewe, </em>44 Mont. at 436, 120 P. at 487). The State argues for a broad interpretation of <em>Baker, </em>contending that this language confirms that contracts are always formed at the award of the contract, the execution being merely a memorial of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b624 However, in <em>Baker </em>we did not squarely address the question of whether or what kind of contractual relationship is formed immediately <em>after </em>the award of the contract and <em>prior </em>to the execution of the written instrument. <em>Baker </em>merely demonstrates that an invitation for bids is not itself an offer, but merely an invitation to make an offer. <em>See also Peerless Food Products, Inc. v. State of Washington </em>(1992), 119 Wash.2d 584, 595, 835 P.2d 1012, 1017; 64 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Public Works and Contracts </em>\u00a7 53 (1972) (stating \u201c[t]he advertisement, being nothing more than a solicitation of bids or proposals for doing the work or furnishing the materials, does not of itself impose any contractual obligation\u201d). Thus, the holding in <em>Baker </em>does not support the State\u2019s argument that a binding contract is necessarily formed at the acceptance of a low bidder\u2019s bid. We are faced with that precise issue here, and must define the rights acquired by each party upon <em>award </em>to Oftedal of the project, as well as upon <em>execution </em>of the written instrument after the award, as the answer to these questions will be determinative of the applicability of \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b625 In support of its argument that no contract is formed prior to the execution of the written instrument, Oftedal notes two provisions under the project\u2019s Specifications and Contract Provisions (Specifications), provided in the Bid Package. First, Oftedal contends that the award is conditional based upon \u00a7 103.07 of the Specifications, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">EXECUTION AND APPROVAL OF CONTRACT. Return to the Department within 20 calendar days after receipt of the contract documents:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">A. The signed Contract;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">B. The contract bond;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">C. A copy of the insurance policy or a certificate of insurance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">D. A copy of the current special fuel users permit issued under 15-70-302 MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">A proposal will not be binding unless all the above requirements have been satisfied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-13\">Do not begin work before:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-14\">A. The Contract is executed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-15\">B. Contract bond is completed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>C. Evidence of the required insurance is provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\">The Contract, bond, and insurance are subject to legal approval after execution by the Contractor and Surety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b626 Second, Oftedal notes that \u00a7 103.04 of the Specifications allows the Commission to cancel the award of the contract at any time prior to the execution of the written instrument. Section 103.04 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A10\">CANCELLATION OF AWARD. The award of the Contract may be canceled at any time before the execution of the Contract by all parties without liability against the Department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b627 Based upon the above provisions, Oftedal contends that the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Offcedal\u2019s mistakes had to be discovered and the Commission notified prior to the award, rather than prior to the execution of the contract, is erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u00b628 The State, in further support of its argument that the contract was formed at the \u201caward\u201d rather than at the execution of the written instrument, cites to the District Court order of November 29, 2000, denying Oftedal\u2019s motion to alter or amend. The District Court noted that various requirements take effect immediately after the award by the Commission. First, Oftedal was required to return to the MDT within twenty days the signed contract pursuant to \u00a7 103.07 of the Specifications. Second, \u00a7 18-1-204(1), MCA, specifically requires that if the bidder refuses to enter into a written contract after the award, the bidder shall forfeit its bid security. For these reasons the District Court required Oftedal to prove that the Commission had knowledge of the mistake prior to the award rather than prior to signing the written contract to fall within the parameters of \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">\u00b629 It is a matter of some division in various state jurisdictions whether a public contract is formed at the time when the project is awarded, or whether the contract is formed only upon executing the written instrument. Often the determination is heavily fact dependent. As stated by the Supreme Court of Alaska in <em>State of Alaska v. Johnson </em>(Alaska 1989), 779 P.2d 778, \u201c[t]he numerous cases dealing with the awarding of public contracts do not establish a bright line rule as to how and when a public body accepts a bid and becomes bound. Much of the divergence in the case law is due to the varying statutes and bid invitations. The statutes and bid invitation documents constitute the primary guidelines for the parties and the court.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>779 P.2d at 780 (holding that the statutes, bid documents, and notification letter taken together, could not lead to the reasonable belief that the State had exhausted its discretion to reject the bid and re-let the contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\u00b630 In <em>Johnson v. City of Jordan </em>(Minn. App. 1984), 352 N.W.2d 500, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the Court of Appeals held that a contract was formed immediately at the award of the contract because no discretion remained in the city or its officials to withdraw after the award. The City of Jordan advertised for bids and included a written contract with the materials provided to potential bidders. Appellant Johnson was the low bidder and was awarded the contract. Soon thereafter, the city council rejected its first award and awarded the contract to the second low bidder. Johnson petitioned for a writ of mandamus, requesting that the District Court order the City of Jordan to execute the contract between itself and Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b631 The Court of Appeals found that the issue of whether a contract had been entered by the award was \u201csubject to the intent of the parties.\u201d <em>City of Jordan, </em>352 N.W.2d at 503. The Court held that the drafting of a written contract and its attachment to the proposal, thereby becoming part of the request for bids, was sufficient to indicate an intent to enter into such a formal contract, and constituted an objective manifestation of final acceptance by the City, finding \u201c[tjhere was no discretion remaining in the city or its officials to deny the contract....\u201d <em>City of Jordan, </em>352 N.W.2d at 503 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"A4k\">\u00b632 In so holding, the Court of Appeals recognized that a contract need not always form at the award, citing to <em>1 Williston on Contracts, </em>\u00a7 31 (3d ed. 1957):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">In the case of public contracts, the requirement of certain formalities by law or by the request for bids, <em>such as a written contract, </em>or the furnishing of a bond, often indicates that even after acceptance of the bid no contract is formed until the requisite formality has been complied with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-6\"><em>City of Jordan, </em>352 N.W.2d at 503 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u00b633 Further, the Court held that the requirement of a bid bond does not determine the issue, distinguishing bid bonds from performance bonds, and noting that the purpose of the bid bond \u201cis to guarantee the making of a contract by the successful bidder, and in case of his failure to do so, to indemnify the municipality for the damages and expenses sustained or incurred thereby....\u201d <em>City of Jordan, </em>352 N.W.2d at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">\u00b634 In <em>MacKinnon-Parker, Inc. v. Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 453, 616 N.E.2d 1204, appellant bidder argued that the Housing Authority\u2019s Notice of Contract Award constituted acceptance, and that a contract had been formed. The Notice stated: \u201cThis is to advise you that your proposal for the above referenced project has been accepted by this Authority and approved by HUD, Cleveland. We are preparing the necessary Construction Contract documents ... in order that they may be executed by your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>firm.\u201d <em>MacKinnon, </em>84 Ohio App.3d at 457, 616 N.E.2d at 1207.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b635 In holding that no contract was formed until the formal execution of the written instrument, the Court of Appeals relied on the requirement of Ohio\u2019s public bidding statute that a contract must be executed within sixty days after the bids are opened, and noted that the bid documents required the successful bidder, upon receiving the Notice of Contract Award, to deliver a contract \u201cin the prescribed form\u201d and to furnish a contract performance bond within ten days after the contract is presented for signature. <em>MacKinnon, </em>84 Ohio App.3d at 457, 616 N.E.2d at 1206. The Court further noted that the required bid bond was simply a guarantee that the successful bidder would later enter into a bona fide contract and provide a performance bond, or, upon the bidder\u2019s failure to do so, that the Housing Authority would be compensated for the damages caused by such failure. <em>MacKinnon, </em>84 Ohio App.3d at 456, 616 N.E.2d at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b636 In so holding, the Court of Appeals distinguished <em>Commissioners of Highland Cty. v. Rhoades </em>(1875), 26 Ohio St. 411, wherein the Ohio Supreme Court had held that a contract is formed upon acceptance and notice of acceptance of a bid, the only purpose of the later agreement being to evidence the contract entered into. This rule is not applicable, the Court stated, \u201cwhere it is understood that the acceptance of the bid and execution of a formal contract are both conditions to the formation of a contract between the parties.\u201d <em>MacKinnon, </em>84 Ohio App.3d at 455, 616 N.E.2d at 1205 (citing <em>Commissioners of Highland Cty. v.

Clyde </em>(1884), 41 Ohio St. 339, 340). \u201cThis two-part acceptance of the contract may be imposed by the invitation to accept the bids or by virtue of the fact that the party seeking the bid is authorized by statute to contract only under certain circumstances, i. <em>e., </em>by a formal written contract.\u201d <em>MacKinnon, </em>84 Ohio App.3d at 455, 616 N.E.2d at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b637 In the instant matter, a bid bond, or \u201cbidder\u2019s security,\u201d was required to be submitted by Oftedal pursuant to \u00a7 18-1-201(2), MCA, which provides that the public authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">shall require, as a condition precedent to considering any such bids, as evidence of good faith on the part of the bidder, and <em>as indemnity for the benefit of such public authority against the failure or refusal of any bidder to enter into any written contract </em>that may be awarded upon and following acceptance of bid... that any bid shall contain a written covenant of indemnity conditioned as herein prescribed and that the bid shall be accompanied by bid security of the nature herein specified for the performance of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>covenant. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b638 Section 18-1-202(2), MCA, requires that the bid bond be in the amount of 10 percent of the bid price, again to \u201cprotect and indemnify the public authority against the failure or refusal of the bidder <em>to enter into the contract...\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b639 Section 18-1-202(1)(a), MCA, provides in part that the advertisement for bids must distinctly specify that all contractors shall \u201cexpressly covenant in any bid that if the bidder is awarded the contract, the bidder will, within the time required as stated in the advertisement or solicitation, <em>enter into a formal contract </em>and give a good and sufficient <em>bond to secure the performance </em>of the terms and conditions of the contract.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b640 If, after the award, the successful bidder refuses to enter into and execute the contract, \u00a7 18-1-204, MCA, requires that \u201cany bidder whose bid is accepted and who shall thereafter refuse to enter into and execute the <em>proposed </em>contract,... as stated in the covenant in the bid and herein, shall absolutely forfeit such moneys or bank instruments to the public authority ...\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\u00b641 Included with the bid proposal documents, \u00a7 103.02 of the Specifications reserves the right of the Commission to reject all bid proposals accompanied with the return of all proposal guarantees (bid bonds). Section 103.04 of the Specifications further reserves the right of the Commission to cancel the award prior to execution of the contract: \u201cThe award of the Contract may be canceled at any time before the execution of the Contract by all parties without liability against the Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\u00b642 Section 103.05 of the Specifications provides that all bid bonds will eventually be returned, including the bid bond of the successful bidder, following receipt of a separate contract bond, securing the performance of the terms and conditions of the contract, and execution of the contract. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 18-1-205, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">\u00b643 Section 103'07 of the Specifications provides the successful bidder must, within twenty days after receipt of the contract documents following award of the project, provide MDT with the signed contract, a satisfactory contract performance bond and satisfactory evidence of the required insurance policy. If the successful bidder fails to provide the above in a satisfactory manner within the twenty days after the award, \u00a7 103.08 of the Specifications provides that the award may be canceled and the bid bond forfeited under the provisions of \u00a7 18-1-204, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">\u00b644 It is clear that Oftedal submitted the bid bond solely as an indemnity for the benefit of MDT against Oftedal\u2019s refusal to enter into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the written contract. Sections 18-1-201(2) and -202(2), MCA. The full amount of the bid bond was to be returned to Oftedal after the execution and approval of the contract by MDT, as there would no longer be a need to secure OftedaTs covenant to enter into a written contract. Section 103.05, Specifications. It is also clear that, immediately after the award and up to the time of the execution of the contract, MDT was not bound by the terms of the contract and retained discretion to withdraw the award of the contract at any time without liability. Sections 103.02 and 103.04, Specifications. This fact is commonly found to be critical in a court\u2019s review of the issue: see <em>State of Alaska v. Johnson, supra, </em>(no contract at award because state had not exhausted its discretion to reject the bid and rebid the contract), and <em>Johnson v. City of Jordan, supra, </em>(contract formed at award because city no longer retained discretion to reject the bid).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b645 In the instant case, based upon the above-referenced statutes and Contract Specifications, it is clear that conditional requirements must be met and a formal contract executed in order to bind MDT. Under these circumstances, <em>1 Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 4:10 (4th ed. 1990), is informative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">In the case of public contracts, certain additional formalities are often required by statute or by the request for bids under such statutes, such as the execution of a written contract, or the requirement that a satisfactory bond be furnished. In such cases, even after acceptance of the bid has occurred, <em>no contract is formed until the requisite formality has been complied with. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b646  We conclude, therefore, as a matter of law, that no contract for the performance of this federal highway project was formed by award of the project to Oftedal on September 1, 1999. Consequently, the District Court erred in concluding that Oftedal did not give timely notice of the mistakes prior to the award, because no such notice was necessary at that time to obtain relief pursuant to \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA. As no contract was formed prior to the execution of the written contract on September 22, 1999, there could be no requirement that MDT have knowledge of OftedaTs unilateral mistake prior to the award of the project on September 1, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">B. Reformation of Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u00b647  Reformation of a contract is an equitable remedy which allows a court to revise a contract to reflect the true intentions of the parties. <em>In re Marriage of Pfennigs, </em>1999 MT 250, \u00b6 31, 296 Mont. 242, \u00b6 31, 989 P.2d 327, \u00b6 31. The grounds for reformation of a contract in Montana are fraud, mutual mistake or unilateral mistake of which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>other party knew or suspected, which results in a contract that does not truly express the intention of the parties. Section 28-2-1611, MCA. A mistake is an unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact, past or present, material to the contract. Section 28-2-409, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b648 This Court has previously refused to allow reformation of contract where a party making a unilateral mistake entered into a contract while having actual knowledge of the mistake. <em>Goodman Realty, Inc., v. Monson </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 228, 883 P.2d 121. In <em>Goodman </em>we held that reformation \u201cbelongs to the aggrieved party who is laboring under a mistake known or suspected by the other party,\u201d as opposed to an aggrieved party who knew of the mistake prior to signing the contract while the other party had no knowledge. <em>Goodman, </em>267 Mont. at 232-33, 883 P.2d at 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b649 Neither situation exists in this case. Oftedal did not have knowledge of the mistake in the absence of knowledge by MDT, nor did MDT have knowledge of the mistake in the absence of knowledge by Oftedal. Rather, because both parties knew of Oftedal\u2019s unilateral mistake prior to the execution and formation of the contract, our holding in <em>Goodman </em>is inapplicable to the facts in the present situation. In the instant case it is clear that the mistakes in Oftedal\u2019s bid were unilateral on the part of Oftedal and that specifics of these mistakes were made known to MDT immediately after Oftedal discovered the mistakes and prior to execution of the written instrument-and therefore, in this case, prior to the formation of the contract. It is also clear from the parties\u2019 Stipulation of Facts, as well as from comments made at the Commissioners\u2019 meetings, the minutes for which are part of the stipulated documents, that Oftedal did not intend to make the mistakes in its bid. The Stipulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">As a direct result of Oftedal\u2019s mistakes, the bid was different than Oftedal might otherwise have intended the bid to be. If Oftedal had not made such mistakes, the bid would have been in the sum of $8,607,265.98, which revised contract sum would reflect Oftedal\u2019s original bid modified and revised upward to reflect the inadvertent omissions in the sum of $789,000.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b650 The State argues that Oftedal should be denied its requested relief on a number of additional grounds. First, the State argues that general principles of contract law provide that recision, not reformation, is the proper remedy for unilateral mistakes. Second, the, State argues that the errors in Offcedal\u2019s bid were the result of Oftedal\u2019s negligent business practices which prevented Oftedal from discovering the errors between the opening of the bids and the award of the contract, and as such, equity does not provide relief for those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>who have not been vigilant. Third, the State argues that the Commission\u2019s decision regarding to whom it will award public works contracts is not subject to judicial review absent a showing of bad faith, fraud or corruption, none of which has been shown by Oftedal. Fourth, the State contends that allowing a low bidder to raise its bid amount while still remaining the low bidder opens the door for much \u201cmischief and abuse\u201d by bidders and is tantamount to destroying the integrity of the public bidding process. Fifth, the State argues that Oftedal contracted to waive his right to an upward revision of the bid without the express written consent of MDT. Finally, the State argues that Montana\u2019s taxpayers will be prejudiced in the amount of any upward revision as the State will be required to fund the total amount of the upward revision as the FHWA will not participate with federal funding above Oftedal\u2019s original bid amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b651 We first address the State\u2019s objection to Oftedal\u2019s eligibility for contract reformation relief. While the State argues that reformation is inappropriate for -unilateral mistake, its position is not consistent with Montana law. As stated above, one ground for reformation of contract in Montana is unilateral mistake of which the other party knew or suspected, as clearly provided by \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b652  Contrary to the State\u2019s second argument, negligence of the party creating the mistake is not necessarily a bar to judicial reformation of a contract. As stated by the Supreme Court of Washington, \u201c[i]f negligence were a defense to a reformation claim, then reformation would almost never be available as a remedy because mistake is most frequently a basis for reformation, and negligence generally results from mistake.\u201d <em>Washington Mut. Savings Bank v. Hedreen </em>(1994), 125 Wash.2d 521, 531, 886 P.2d 1121, 1126. \u201cIt is not essential, therefore, that one seeking the aid of a court of equity to reform a contract show that he is wholly free from fault. Mere negligence not rising to the dignity of a violation of a positive legal duty, as negligence that is a mere inadvertence, does not preclude relief.\u201d <em>Hedreen, </em>125 Wash.2d at 530, 886 P.2d at 1126 <em>(citing Meyer v. Young </em>(1945), 23 Wash.2d 109, 113, 159 P.2d 908).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b653 <em>Hedreen </em>is consistent with Montana statute. Section 28-2-409, MCA, defines mistake in the contract context as one not caused by \u201cneglect of duty,\u201d yet \u201cconsisting in ... an unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact, past or present, material to the contract.\u201d This defines an error of \u201cmere inadvertence.\u201d <em>Hedreen, </em>125 Wash.2d at 530, 886 P.2d at 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b654  In the instant matter, the parties stipulated and recognized that Oftedal\u2019s mistakes were inadvertent, and the bid was not what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Oftedal intended it to be. Although some negligence may be inherent in Oftedal\u2019s mistakes, viewed in light of the parties\u2019 agreed assessment of the nature of the errors, Oftedal\u2019s mistakes cannot be said to preclude equitable relief under the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b655 Contrary to the State\u2019s third argument, judicial modification of the contract in this matter will not interfere with the discretion of the Commission to award public contracts to qualified bidders, based on its own determination. Oftedal did not appeal the decision of the Commission denying Oftedal\u2019s request to either rescind the award or to revise the contract sum upward. Oftedal signed the written contract, and then pursued the equitable remedy of reformation for its unintended mistakes in its bid that are now included as part of the contract. Nor does such relief jeopardize the public bidding process, as contended by the State in its fourth argument. Reformation of a written contract will be allowed only where a mistaken party so deserves under \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA, and a bidder attempting to circumvent the public bidding laws with intentionally low bids faces an uphill battle in attempting to demonstrate that it committed the kind of mistake constituting \u201can unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact, past or present, material to the contract\u201d that the State knew or suspected, and which resulted in a written contract that does not express the intention of the parties, as Oftedal has demonstrated here. Section 28-2-409, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b656 The State next argues that Oftedal waived any right to request or receive any upward revision of its bid. The bid proposal reads, \u201cIn submitting this bid, bidder agrees that it waives any right or ability to claim, request or receive any upward revision of this bid without the express written consent of the Department and in accordance with the standard specifications.\u201d Oftedal requested such relief, and the Commission, exercising its discretion, refused to give its consent to any upward revision. However, as stated, Oftedal did not appeal from this discretionary decision of the Commission, making such language irrelevant to Oftedal\u2019s requested modification pursuant to \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b657 Additionally, the State confuses reformation of bid with reformation of contract. Under the terms of the bid documents, the Commission retains discretion to either grant or deny a request for an upward revision of the bidder\u2019s <em>bid. </em>Once the contract is formed and both parties are bound, a request for a modification is a request to modify the <em>contract </em>and must be requested pursuant to \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA, which is applicable only where parties have entered into a written contract and some form of mistake is subsequently discovered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>or, as the situation exists here in the context of a public bid letting, where Oftedal discovered the mistakes and MDT knew of the mistakes prior to contract formation.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b658  Finally, the State argues that Montana\u2019s taxpayers will be prejudiced if an upward revision is allowed, as the State will be responsible to fund any amount of the contract over and above Oftedal\u2019s original bid amount. Oftedal argues that the State will not lose any money in the long run because the federal funds not able to be used on this project can be shifted to another federally funded project. This Court is without sufficient information to determine whether this is correct, but what is clear at this juncture is that the State will be responsible to pay any amount of the contract above Oftedal\u2019s original bid, if FHWA does not reconsider its decision not to participate. While this is unfortunate, it is also clear that absent an upward revision of the contract sum, the State will receive the benefit of $789,000 of work and material provided by Oftedal, and expended for the improvement of the highways for the benefit of the public, without any compensation returned to Oftedal. This Court is required pursuant to \u00a7 28-2-1612, MCA, for the purpose of revising a contract, to presume that all parties intended to make an equitable and conscientious agreement. This Court cannot presume that Oftedal intended to incur the hardship of supplying $789,000 of work and material to the State without compensation, and further, we cannot presume that the State harbored such intention, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b659 The decision of the District Court is reversed and remanded: Upon remand, the District Court is ordered to enter judgment in favor of Appellant E. H. Oftedal and Sons, Inc., revising the contract sum upward in the stipulated amount of $789,000, to a modified contract price of $8,607,265.98, and ordering the contract to be performed as so revised.</p>\n<judges id=\"b96-6\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b96-7\">JUSTICE COTTER,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">dissenting,</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\u00b660 I dissent. Not only does the majority\u2019s conclusion completely upset the public contract bidding process, it jettisons basic contract principles of offer and acceptance, and ignores the tenets of equitable relief. The ultimate effect of this Opinion is to impose a stricter obligation on MDT to find mistakes in a submitted bid than is imposed on the bidder himself; thus allowing a bidder to amend an offer, after it is accepted, even though he created the offer in haste, failed to use care in checking the details prior to submitting the offer, failed to effectively rule out suspicions that the figures were wrong, and then waited until the contract was accepted before fully reviewing the offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>for errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b661 Although the majority applies the standard for reviewing an order granting summary judgment, it ultimately grants relief by reforming Oftedal\u2019s contract. Clearly this is a case in equity. This Court has repeatedly held that equitable issues are a matter of discretion resting with the district court and will be sustained unless an abuse of discretion is shown. <em>Ruegsegger v. Welborn </em>(1989), 237 Mont 317, 321, 773 P.2d 305, 308 (citations omitted). The District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reform Oftedal\u2019s contract pursuant to \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA. Nor did the District Court err when it concluded a contract was formed between Oftedal and MDT upon acceptance of Oftedal\u2019s bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b662 In <em>Baker, </em>the Court stated that \u201c[i]t is a well founded principle of contract law that a contract does not exist prior to the acceptance of a bid by an agency.\u201d <em>Baker v. State, </em>218 Mont. 235, 238, 707 P.2d 20, 22. The majority rejects the Commission\u2019s reliance on <em>Baker </em>for the proposition that a binding contract is formed upon the acceptance of a low bidder\u2019s bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b663 However, this Court applied similar language in <em>Modern Machinery v. Flathead County </em>(1982), 202 Mont. 140, 656 P.2d 206, when it held that a written bid, issued in response to a call for bids to purchase a piece of equipment, amounted to an offer that ripened into a contract upon acceptance by the commissioners. <em>Modern Machinery, </em>202 Mont. at 146, 656 P.2d at 210. We stated: \u201ca written bid has consistently been construed as nothing more than an offer to perform labor or supply materials, and the offer does not ripen into a contract <em>until accepted by the offeree.\u201d Modern Machinery, </em>202 Mont. at 145, 656 P.2d at 209 (citing <em>Carriger v. Ballenger </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 479, 483-84, 628 P.2d 1106, 1108-1109) (emphasis added). In <em>Modern Machinery, </em>we concluded that a binding contract was formed between the comity and the manufacturer when the commissioners accepted the offered bid by seconding and recording a motion to accept the bid during a commissioners\u2019 meeting. <em>Modern Machinery, </em>202 Mont. at 146, 656 P.2d at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u00b664 The conclusion that a contract is formed upon acceptance of an offered bid follows time-honored Montana precedent. In <em>State v. Toole </em>(1901), 26 Mont. 22, 29, 66 P. 496, 499, this Court found that once the statutory prerequisites essential to a valid acceptance are complied with, and a contract is awarded, \u201cthere springs into existence vested rights, which the board cannot destroy or impair,\u201d and conditions may not be inserted into the formal written contract if they are \u201cnot consonant with the contract already made by virtue of the acceptance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>of the bid\u201d (the furnishing board\u2019s attempt to rescind a contract, which was formed upon the board\u2019s acceptance of plaintiffs offer, was void) (citation omitted). In <em>Stuewe v. Hindson </em>(1912), 44 Mont. 429, 436-37, 120 P. 485, 487, while holding there was no mandamus remedy available to an unsuccessful bidder, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">In general terms, it is said that a contract is consummated by an offer from one party and its acceptance by another. The advertisement for bids is not an offer which by acceptance constitutes a contract. It is merely an invitation to every bidder to make an offer, <em>which the board may accept, and a contract result, </em>but a party whose offer is not accepted cannot complain or invoke the aid of courts to compel the board to accept his offer (citation omitted). [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b665 The Commission\u2019s reliance on the language of <em>Baker, supra, </em>is not misplaced. There is a century of case law for the proposition that an offer, once accepted, ripens into a binding agreement. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the contract was not created until execution of the \u201cformal\u201d contract. Accordingly, I disagree that the contract should be revised, especially given that MDT had no knowledge of any errors at the time it accepted Oftedal\u2019s bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b666 The majority attempts to infer limits on liability based on the mere formality of executing a written contract. This reasoning is not only circular, it also underscores the fact there is no explicit specification prohibiting liability. The procedure of signing the \u201cformal\u201d contract was not a condition precedent to the contract\u2019s enforceability. Section 18-1-202(1), MCA, provides: \u201cThe advertisement, request, or solicitation for bids or offers must distinctly specify that all bidders, offerors, tenderers, or contractors shall: (a) whenever bids are solicited ... <em>expressly covenant </em>in any bid that if the bidder is awarded the contract, the bidder <em>will, </em>within the time required as stated in the advertisement or solicitation, enter into a formal contract and give a good and sufficient bond ...\u201d (emphasis added). In addition, bidders must also provide bid security, pursuant to \u00a7 18-1-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b667 From these statutes and Specifications in the Bid Package, the majority crafts a condition precedent to the creation of a contract between Oftedal and MDT. The majority relies on an excerpt from <em>Williston on Contracts </em>to support the proposition that these statutory requirements are intended as conditions precedent to the execution of the \u201cformal\u201d contract. However, the majority fails to refer to \u00a7 18-1-201(2), MCA, which describes the requirements for bidder\u2019s security, and states in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">[I]n all cases where a public authority or obligee is authorized by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>law to solicit bids ... such public authority shall require, as a <em>condition precedent to considering any such bids, </em>as evidence of good faith on the part of the bidder, and as indemnity for the benefit of such public authority against the failure or refusal of any bidder to enter into any written contract that may be awarded upon and following acceptance of bid ... that any bid shall contain a written covenant of indemnity conditioned as herein prescribed and that the bid shall be accompanied by bid security of the nature herein specified for the performance of such covenant. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">These safeguards are in place as conditions precedent to the public body considering the offer proposed by the bidder, not as conditions precedent to the formation of a binding agreement between the public authority and the successful bidder. Oftedal met these requirements when it promised in its bid proposal that it would sign the contract, and when it provided the required bid security. Based on these promises, MDT considered and ultimately accepted Oftedal\u2019s bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b668 Further, as stipulated by the parties, it is \u201ceach bidder\u2019s responsibility to submit its bid in accordance with the bid documents and its review of the scope of work, site of work, and the contract documents.\u201d When it signed the proposed bid, Oftedal agreed to subsection (F) of the Proposal: \u201cIn submitting this bid, bidder agrees that it waives any right or ability to claim, request or receive any upward revision of this bid without the express written consent of the Department and in accordance with the Standard Specifications.\u201d Oftedal also affirmed, pursuant to the Proposal, that it examined the site, proposal, standard specifications, supplemental specifications, and special provisions, and that it had sufficient time to prepare its bid. Oftedal assented \u201cto all provisions and requirements of the Contact, as defined in the Standard Specifications.\u201d Oftedal agreed it \u201cwould not submit this bid if it did not agree to each and every provision of the Contract.\u201d Oftedal, a seasoned bidder, clearly was aware of all the components and requirements of the agreement between the MDT and Oftedal; thus there was a meeting of the minds between the two parties. <em>See Chadwick v. Giberson </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 88, 92, 618 P.2d 1213, 1215 (\u201cthere must be mutual assent or a meeting of the minds on all essential elements or terms to form a binding contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b669 I would hold that a contract was formed upon the acceptance of Oftedal\u2019s submitted bid, or in the least I would hold that Oftedal should not be rewarded for its negligence in submitting the bid and failing to thoroughly review the figures when it suspected there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b670 Even if I were to agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the contract was formed upon execution of the written agreement, the statute the Court relies on, \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA, is permissive, and does not require revision by a court. All the errors at issue were attributable to only Oftedal, and specifically^ its employee, Lundby, in his preparation of the bid. In an attempt to explain the errors, Oftedal asserted that Lundby\u2019s workload was such that time did not allow complete review, and that due to company organization, Lundby was the only person who could review the bid. These are clearly business practice choices made by Oftedal, for which the State should not suffer given Oftedal\u2019s substantial errors. Moreover, Lundby admitted in a letter to the Department that the mistakes were due to \u201cpoor time management\u201d and were a \u201cdirect result of [him] not allowing [himself] adequate time to estimate the project.\u201d Clearly these mistakes were not due to ignorance or forgetfulness of facts, and thus did not meet the definition of mistake of fact as required under \u00a7 28-2-409, MCA. I agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that: \u201cOftedal chose to conduct business in a seemingly hectic atmosphere without the benefit of having a second person check the bid before it was submitted or other similar \u2018safety net.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b671 Oftedal should not reap the benefits of its errors, at the expense of the State of Montana. Section 28-2-1611, MCA, states that a court may revise a contract, \u201cso far as it can be done without prejudice to rights acquired by third persons in good faith and for value.\u201d A court is not mandated to revise a contract under \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA. A district court\u2019s decision to provide equitable relief is a matter of discretion which we will sustain absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>Ruegsegger, </em>237 Mont. at 321, 773 P.2d at 308. Abuse of discretion exists when \u201cthe trial court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Lee v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., </em>2001 MT 59, \u00b6 27, 304 Mont. 356, \u00b6 27, 22 P.3d 631, \u00b6 27 (citation omitted). Based on the magnitude and nature of Oftedal\u2019s errors, its failure to thoroughly review its bid even when mistakes were suspected, and the absence of any fault attributable to the State, the District Court clearly did not act \u201carbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b672 By allowing upward revision of the contract price, the majority also guts the bond forfeiture statute, \u00a7 18-1-204, MCA. Section 18-1-204, MCA, states in pertinent part: \u201c[A]ny bidder whose bid is accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>and who shall thereafter refuse to enter into and execute the proposed contract ... as stated in the covenant in the bid and herein, shall absolutely forfeit such moneys... to the public authority concerned and become immediately liable on the bid bond ....\u201d In light of the Court\u2019s holding, successful bidders who want to revise their bid are better <em>off </em>to sign a contract, and later seek relief through the district court, than accept loss of bond pursuant to \u00a7 18-1-204, MCA. The majority asserts that this decision does not jeopardize the public bidding process (See \u00b6 55 herein). I disagree. This decision has the effect of inviting a party to prolong the uncertainty in the bidding process, by by-passing an appeal of the decision of the Commission in favor of the pursuit of equitable relief from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b673 The clean hands doctrine provides that \u201c[pjarties must not expect relief in equity, unless they come into court with clean hands.\u201d <em>See Kauffman-Harmon v. Kauffman, </em>2001 MT 238, \u00b6 19, 307 Mont. 45, \u00b6 19, 36 P.3d 408, \u00b6 19 (citation omitted). Moreover, \u201c[n]o one can take advantage of his own wrong.\u201d Section 1-3-208, MCA. Accordingly, \u201cthis Court will not aid a party whose claim had its inception in the party\u2019s wrongdoing, whether the victim of the wrongdoing is the other party or a third party.\u201d <em>Kauffman-Harmon, </em>\u00b6 19 (citation omitted). \u201cEquity, of course, aids only those who have been vigilant, and will refuse relief to one who has been dilatory or wanting in diligence in prosecuting his cause of action.\u201d <em>Housing Authority of the City of Butte v. Murtha </em>(1943), 115 Mont. 405, 410, 144 P.2d 183, 185 (citation omitted). Further, courts must inquire carefully into purported mistakes in order to prevent collusion and fraud by the parties making the proposals and are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">justified in refusing relief when there is good cause for believing that some other reason than mere mistake is behind the bidder\u2019s unwillingness to perform the contract or his desire to withdraw from the bid. Eelief may be denied on the ground that it did not clearly appear that the mistake was one of material fact as distinguished from an unwise, hasty, or careless statement of prices intended to be bid. <em>If the mistake might have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence on the part of the bidder, he or she will be denied equitable relief.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">64 Am. Jur. 2d Public Works and Contracts \u00a7 83 (2001) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\u00b674 Had Oftedal exercised ordinary care and diligence, the mistakes would have been caught in the twelve days that passed between the bid opening and the award of the contract. Clearly Oftedal does not have clean hands in this matter \u2014 in fact, it was its own negligence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>created the situation from which we have now rescued Oftedal. Even if I were to agree that the contract between Oftedal and MDT was not created until execution of the formal contract, revision of such a contract is not mandatory under \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA. The State should not have to bear the burden of Oftedal\u2019s negligence. Oftedal\u2019s errors were not unconscious ignorance or the result of forgetfulness. Because Oftedal\u2019s hands were not clean, it is not entitled to equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"AW_\">\u00b675 The primary function of Montana\u2019s bidding statutes is to benefit the citizens. <em>Baker, </em>218 Mont. at 239, 707 P.2d at 23. \u201cCompetitive bidding statutes are primarily intended for the benefit of the public rather than for the benefit or enrichment of bidders, and consideration of advantages or disadvantages to bidders must be secondary to the general welfare of the public.\u201d 72 C.J.S. Public Contracts \u00a7 8 (1975). With this Opinion, we have placed the bidder\u2019s pecuniary interests ahead of the interests of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b676 I would conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion either in refusing to reform Oftedal\u2019s contract or in concluding that a contract was formed between Oftedal and MDT upon acceptance of Oftedal\u2019s bid. I would therefore affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
