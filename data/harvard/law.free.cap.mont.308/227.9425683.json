We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">\u00b62 Elliott raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Elliott\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Elliott\u2019s motion to dismiss when it concluded that whether the infant was born alive or was stillborn was a factual determination to be made by the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Elliott\u2019s motion for continuance?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing Garry Kerr to testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">\u00b67 5. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing Dr. Patrick Sauer to testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">\u00b68 6. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing the State to introduce into evidence and play at trial Elliott\u2019s tape recorded statement?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-17\">\u00b69 7. Was the burden shifted to Elliott to prove that the infant was stillborn in violation of Elliott\u2019s due process rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-18\">\u00b610 8. Was there sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict of deliberate homicide?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-19\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b257-20\">\u00b611 On June 10, 1998, Cheri Johnson, a friend of Pamela Elliott (Elliott), was told that Elliott was sick and needed to go to the doctor, but she would not. Johnson went to Elliott\u2019s house to check on her and found Elliott on the living room couch, covered with a bloody comforter. After Elliott assured Johnson that her father was coming in a few hours to take her to the doctor, Johnson left. Johnson returned a few hours later and called an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-21\">\u00b612 Elliott told the emergency medical technician (EMT) who responded to the call that she had been undergoing chemotherapy for Hodgkin\u2019s disease. When she arrived at the hospital, she also told the physician\u2019s assistant, Arley Irish, that she was undergoing chemotherapy. Elliott told Irish that she had been bleeding vaginally for three or four days. After examination revealed the presence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>placenta, Irish asked Elliott about a pregnancy and baby. Elliott denied being pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b613 Dr. Randall Rauh next examined Elliott and found her cervix dilated and placental tissue in the upper cervix. Rauh diagnosed a condition called \u201cplacenta accreta\u201d whereby the placenta had grown into the uterine wall. Because infection had set in, Rauh performed an emergency hysterectomy. Rauh concluded that Elliott had given birth within a week or so prior to her emergency admission to the hospital. Elliott continued to deny having had a baby. Because no child was accounted for, Rauh notified the Custer County Sheriffs office.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b614 The Sheriffs office began an investigation into the matter. Elliott was interviewed on June 22,1998. She again denied that she had been pregnant and denied having a baby. She admitted that she had made up the story about having cancer, and she attributed her water retention to taking weight loss pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b615 A search warrant was issued for Elliott\u2019s home on December 16, 1998, and Elliott was again interviewed by law enforcement officers. After being informed of her Miranda rights, Elliott initially maintained that she had not given birth to a baby. Later in the interview, she admitted having a baby in the bathroom of her house. She stated that she glanced once at the baby, then went back to bed. She returned some time later and put the baby in a bath towel and a plastic garbage bag. She then put it in a cupboard in her basement. This information was relayed to the officers conducting the search of Elliott\u2019s home, and the baby was found in that location. The body was wrapped in plastic bags and a towel. Blood stains were found in three areas of the master bedroom and closet, on the living room couch and on the mattress in the master bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b616 An autopsy of the baby was performed by Dr. Gary Dale, the State Medical Examiner. He found no placenta and a short umbilical stump that appeared to be cut. The soft tissues of the body had broken down and the body was partially decomposed. Dale also found fractures on both sides of the skull which he characterized as being the result of significant force and the most severe fractures he had seen in an infant or newborn. He stated that they were not the type of fractures suffered in the womb or during delivery. He further stated that if they had been inflicted on a newborn baby, they could cause death. Because of the decomposition and deterioration of the scalp, Dale could not determine whether there had been bleeding within the scalp or bruising of the scalp.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u00b617 Based on the presence of ossification centers for the femurs and tibias, Dale concluded that the baby was approximately 40 weeks of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>gestational age and that the baby was developmentally viable. But, because of the decomposition of the body, Dale was unable to determine whether the baby ever maintained life independent from its mother or whether the skull fractures were sustained in life. He stated at trial that the baby\u2019s death was not accidental or natural.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b618 Dr. Rauh reviewed Dr. Dale\u2019s report and testified at trial that the fractures documented in Dale\u2019s report were not consistent with fractures that, in his experience, occur during the vaginal delivery of a baby. He also testified that when a baby dies in the uterus, within twelve hours of death there is fluid accumulation in the brain, and the brain begins to liquify. If that occurs, the soft skull bones would move during delivery, but would not fracture.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b6 19 Garry Kerr, an osteologist and forensic anthropologist who assists Dr. Dale, also testified at trial. Kerr examined the skull bones of the baby to determine whether the injuries occurred \u201cin a normal fashion.\u201d Kerr found at least ten fractures of the skull bones, including fractures of both side (parietal) bones, the sphenoid at the base of the skull, and the left frontal bone.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b620 Kerr concluded that the force that caused the fractures was not of the type that occurs during the normal birthing process and that the fractures appeared consistent with fractures from trauma at or about the time of death, rather than prior to or after death. Kerr also testified that he saw no evidence of nutritional deprivation nor genetic disorders that he is familiar with which could have caused the fractures. Kerr could not say whether the baby was born alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b621 Dr. John Patrick Sauer, a pediatrician who regularly attends the birth and delivery of infants and has knowledge regarding neonatal and delivery issues, also testified at trial. He examined an x-ray from the autopsy and testified regarding the gestational age of the baby. He also testified about procedures that can be followed after the birth of a baby to ensure that the baby stays alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">\u00b622 On January 4, 1999, Pamela Elliott was charged by Information with the offense of deliberate homicide, a felony. Elliott filed a motion to dismiss the Information, claiming that the State had insufficient evidence to charge her. The District Court denied the motion. Elliott then filed a motion for continuance, claiming lack of time to secure an expert, in addition to other reasons. The District Court denied the motion and trial was held. The jury found Elliott guilty of deliberate homicide and the District Court sentenced Elliott to fifty years in Montana State Prison, with ten years suspended on conditions. Elliott <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b623 Did the District Court err in denying Elliott\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b624 Elliott argues that, because the State Medical Examiner was unable to establish a cause of the baby\u2019s death and unable to conclusively determine whether the baby was born alive, the Information w\u00e1s not supported by probable cause and the District Court erred in not granting the motion to dismiss. The State responds that the Information, read together with the affidavit, shows a probability that Elliott committed the acts charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b625 Section 46-11-201, MCA, governs the filing of an information and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">(1) The prosecutor may apply directly to the district court for permission to file an information against a named defendant....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">(2) An application must be by affidavit supported by evidence that the judge or chief justice may require. If it appears that there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed by the defendant, the judge or chief justice shall grant leave to file the information, otherwise the application is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">\u00b626  The sufficiency of charging documents is established by reading the information together with the affidavit in support of the motion for leave to file the information. <em>State v. Hamilton </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 496, 499, 830 P.2d 1264, 1267. An affidavit in support of a motion to file an information need not make out a prima facie case that a defendant committed an offense. A mere probability that she committed the offense is sufficient. <em>State v. Arrington </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 1, 6, 858 P.2d 343, 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">\u00b627 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss for an abuse of discretion. <em>Arrington, </em>260 Mont. at 7, 858 P.2d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">\u00b628 Here, the affidavit stated that: (1) Elliott was transported to the hospital, critically ill with severe blood loss and that emergency surgery was performed by Dr. Rauh; (2) the surgery indicated that Elliott had recently been pregnant with a near or full term baby and the placenta remained in the uterus; (3) Elliott denied having a baby; (4) Elliott told the EMT that she had Hodgkin\u2019s disease and was receiving chemotherapy; (5) Elliott\u2019s mother told the EMT that Elliott\u2019s condition was from complications of an abortion; (6) a search warrant was issued for Elliott\u2019s house; (7) Elliott finally admitted giving birth and directed the police officers to the location of the baby\u2019s remains; (8) an autopsy revealed that the baby was well into the third trimester <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>and was capable of viability; (9) the baby had severe skull fractures which could not have occurred during delivery and were likely not from an accident; (10) the umbilical cord was cut; and (11) the medical examiner could not determine whether the baby was stillborn.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b629 Pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA, \u201ca person commits the offense of deliberate homicide if: (a) the person purposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being.\u201d A human being is defined as \u201ca person who has been born and is alive.\u201d Section 45-2-101(28), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AkH\">\u00b630  Elliott argues that the State failed to prove that the baby was ever born alive, and, therefore, the Information should have been dismissed. However, to withstand a motion to dismiss, the State need only show a probability that the baby was born alive and that Elliott committed the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b631  We conclude that the affidavit sufficiently indicated a probability that Elliott committed the offense of deliberate homicide. The circumstances of the delivery of the baby, Elliott\u2019s hospitalization, her differing stories, the skull fractures suffered by the baby, and the concealment of the baby\u2019s body, all provide a basis to find probable cause for the charge. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Elliott\u2019s motion to dismiss the Information.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b632 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Elliott\u2019s motion to dismiss when it concluded that whether the infant was born alive or was stillborn was a factual determination to be made by the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b633 In its Order denying Elliott\u2019s motion to dismiss, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">The Defendant bases her Motion to Dismiss on her claim that because the State Medical Examiner has not provided an opinion as to whether \u201cBaby Girl Elliott\u201d was stillborn or survived extrauterine life, the State cannot succeed in its charge of deliberate homicide because deliberate homicide requires proof of the death of a human being....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">There is no doubt that the State has the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, each element of the offense of deliberate homicide to sustain a conviction in this matter. The State has indicated in its briefs and in its oral argument that it will present evidence on each and every element. Whether this evidence is sufficient for a jury to convict is a question only for that jury. It is inappropriate for the Court at this point to impose its views in territory that clearly belongs to the jury, that is, questions of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">\u00b634 On appeal, Elliott argues that \u201c[b]y allowing the State to proceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>to trial and allowing the jury to speculate as to whether or not \u2018Baby Girl Elliott\u2019 was born alive, the Court allowed the State to proceed without probable cause.\u201d We concluded above that there was probable cause for the Information, and the District Court correctly denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b635 Elliott also states that an element of an offense may not be presumed by proof of remaining elements. She argues that the State, in violation of her due process right, relied on the presence of the dead infant to presume that the infant at some point sustained life. Once again, Elliott focuses on one piece of evidence to the exclusion of the others. The circumstances of the baby\u2019s delivery, the skull fractures and the concealment of the baby\u2019s body are all evidence that the jury may have relied on in finding Elliott guilty of deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"AfQ\">\u00b636  When circumstantial evidence is susceptible to differing interpretations, it is within the province of the jury to determine which will prevail. <em>State v. Brady, </em>2000 MT 282, \u00b6 28, 302 Mont. 174, \u00b6 28, 13 P.3d 941, \u00b6 28 (citing <em>State v. Brodniak </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 212, 222, 718 P.2d 322, 329; <em>State v. Flack </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 181, 189, 860 P.2d 89, 94; <em>State v. Hall, </em>1999 MT 297, \u00b6 22, 297 Mont. 111, \u00b6 22, 991 P.2d 929, \u00b6 22).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b637 The factual issue of whether the baby was born alive is similar to other unresolved issues in a homicide case and is clearly a factual issue for the jury to decide. We conclude that the District Court correctly determined that whether the baby was born alive was a factual question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b638 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Elliott\u2019s motion for continuance?</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u00b639 On Friday, November 19, 1999, one of Elliott\u2019s co-counsel filed a motion to continue the trial set for December 6,1999. On the following Monday, the Court held a hearing on the motion. Although review of the Motion to Continue reveals that counsel stated she would be available for a hearing on the day that the hearing was held, counsel who drafted the motion later claimed she was unavailable, and, therefore, her co-counsel argued the motion. Elliott states in her brief that co-counsel was \u201cnot familiar with the issues or applicable law,\u201d thereby implying some prejudice to her in the \u201churriedly\u201d called hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\u00b640 Of several issues raised in the original motion, Elliott appeals the denial of the motion to continue based only on defense counsel\u2019s inability to secure an expert witness. Elliott argues that it was. error for the District Court to deny the motion and allow the trial to proceed without the defendant being able to obtain an expert witness when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>State offered the testimony of four expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b641 Section 46-13-202, MCA, governs motions for continuance and states, \u201cAll motions for continuance are addressed to the discretion of the trial court and shall be considered in the light of the diligence shown on the part of the movant. This section must be construed to the end that criminal cases are tried with due diligence consonant with the rights of the defendant and the prosecution to a speedy trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b642 \u201cBefore a motion for a continuance is granted, the movant must show that he has employed due diligence to procure that which he now requests additional time to procure.\u201d <em>State v. Walker </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 415, 418, 733 P.2d 352, 354. In <em>Walker, </em>the defendant filed a motion for continuance because of witness unavailability. This Court stated that Walker assumed a dual burden in requesting a continuance. \u201cFirst, he needed to show that he had reasonably searched for his witnesses. Second, he needed to show that his witnesses\u2019 testimony could have helped his defense.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>225 Mont. at 419, 733 P.2d at 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b643 In her motion to the District Court, Elliott stated that she had consulted a doctor in Glendive, Montana, about serving as an expert for the defense, but that she was informed on November 17,1999, that the doctor did not wish to serve as an expert or testify on her behalf. She stated that she did not believe she could proceed without an expert witness. She did not state whether she had contacted any other potential experts or how the expert testimony would have aided her defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b644 In denying the request, the court noted that the trial had previously been continued at defense\u2019s request, that no reason was given why the expert was reluctant to appear and testify, that the matter had been pending for almost a year, and that Elliott had ample opportunity to arrange for witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u00b645 The granting of a continuance by a district court is discretionary and not a matter of right with a defendant. <em>Walker, </em>225 Mont. at 419, 733 P.2d at 355. Absent a clear abuse of discretion, we will not disturb a district court\u2019s denial of a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">\u00b646 On appeal, Elliott argues that the District Court was \u201cmore concerned about preserving its schedule than fairness to the defendant.\u201d We disagree. In its Order, the District Court considered all the arguments Elliott raised, as well as the impact a continuance would have on the court\u2019s calender.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">\u00b647 We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Elliott\u2019s motion for continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">\u00b648 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing Garry Kerr to testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u00b649 Garry Kerr, an osteologist and forensic anthropologist, testified at trial for the State. He examined the baby\u2019s bones and testified that the force that caused the fractures was not consistent with the normal birthing process and that the fractures appeared consistent with fractures from trauma at or about the time of death, rather than prior to or after death. Kerr also testified that he saw no evidence of nutritional deprivation nor genetic disorders that he is familiar with, which could have caused the fractures.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b650 Elliott objected to Kerr\u2019s testimony at trial as irrelevant and cumulative. On appeal, she argues that Kerr\u2019s testimony was irrelevant because it was not included in the results of the post mortem examination issued by Dr. Dale. She directs this Court\u2019s attention to the United States Supreme Court statement in <em>Kumho Tire Company, Ltd. v. Carmichael </em>(1999), 526 U.S. 137, 147, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 1174, 143 L.Ed.2d 238, 249, that trial courts have a gatekeeping obligation to ensure that all scientific testimony is \u201cnot only relevant, but reliable.\u201d <em>Kumho Tire </em>is clearly not on point. <em>Kumho Tire </em>concerned the question of whether the <em>Daubert </em>factors applied only to \u201cscientific\u201d testimony or to all expert testimony. <em>Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. at 147, 119 S.Ct. at 1174, 143 L.Ed.2d at 249-50. Here, Kerr\u2019s testimony was scientific, and Elliott does not argue that it was unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b651 Relevant evidence is defined as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Rule 401, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b652 \u201cQuestions of admissibility of evidence are left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned absent a showing of abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Stuit </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 227, 230, 921 P.2d 866, 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b653 The fact that Kerr\u2019s findings were not included in the post-mortem report does not support a finding of irrelevancy. Kerr\u2019s testimony concerned the skull fractures and when they were sustained and, as such, was clearly relevant to the issues of whether the baby was born alive and whether Elliott purposely or knowingly caused the baby\u2019s death. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Kerr to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\u00b654 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing Dr. Patrick Sauer to testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">\u00b655 Dr. Sauer, a pediatrician, testified at trial regarding the gestational age of the baby. Elliott argues that Dr. Sauer\u2019s testimony should have been excluded as cumulative. She cites to Rule 403, M.R.Evid. for the proposition that \u201calthough relevant, evidence may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>be excluded if... [it is] needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Elliott does not cite to any authority for the proposition that a district court\u2019s decision to admit cumulative evidence is error, nor does she argue that the court here abused its discretion in some way by admitting Sauer\u2019s testimony. She simply states that the testimony was cumulative; therefore, it was error to admit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b656 Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires that appellant\u2019s argument \u201cshall contain the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and pages of the record relied on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b657 Based on Elliott\u2019s failure to specify, as required by Rule 23, M.R.App.P., how the District Court abused its discretion, we affirm the District Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b658 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing the State to introduce into evidence and play at trial Elliott\u2019s tape recorded statement?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u00b659 Elliott was interviewed on December 16 and 17,1998, by Custer County Undersheriff Don Neese and Montana Department of Justice Agent Gary Hatfield. The interviews were tape recorded and played at the trial. Elliott raises three arguments supporting her position that the admission and playing of the tapes at trial was error: (1) that although the State had provided the defense with copies and transcripts of the tapes, she had no notice that the State was planning on playing the tapes at trial; (2) that the tapes reflected only part of Elliott\u2019s admissions; and (3) that the tapes contained objectionable matters within the recordings.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\u00b660 In support of her claim of lack of notice, Elliott notes that she reserved the right to suppress admissions or confessions at the Omnibus Hearing, held on April 6, 1999, and that the court included a handwritten notation on the Order stating \u201cdesignate statement that will be used in case in chief at trial.\u201d Elliott implies that this imposed an affirmative duty on the State to notify her of its intention to play the tapes at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">\u00b661 Two months prior to the Omnibus Hearing, the State filed a notice that it would seek to introduce into evidence \u201cany or all statements that may have been made by the Defendant relating directly or indirectly to the allegations contained in the Information, including, but not limited to, statements given to investigators and to persons other than investigators, that may be construed to be either a confession or admission.\u201d Elliott concedes in her brief that she was provided copies of the tapes and transcripts of the tapes during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>discovery and that \u201c[ejvidence concerning the statements was certainly anticipated by Defense Counsel.\u201d The Omnibus Hearing Order clearly states that the defendant reserved her right to file a formal, written motion to suppress her admissions or confessions. Elliott had copies of the tapes and transcripts and yet did not file any motions to suppress all or part of the tapes. Her argument that she lacked notice in this regard is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b662 Upon request, the State is required to give notice and produce all possible items of evidence. Section 46-15-322, MCA. The State fulfilled its duty by providing the tapes and transcripts to Elliott. The notation on the Omnibus Hearing Order did not, and could not, relieve defense attorneys of their duty to file appropriate motions to exclude any of the State\u2019s evidence which they felt was objectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b663 Elliott relies on Rule 106, M.R.Evid., to support her argument that the tapes were inadmissible because they did not reflect a complete record of the conversation that Agent Hatfield had with Elliott. Elliott does not argue that only a portion of the tapes were played, but that the tapes themselves did not contain the entire interview. Elliott argues that \u201cfor a period of one hour and five minutes the interrogation of the defendant proceeded without the tape recorder being employed.\u201d At trial, Agent Hatfield testified concerning what occurred during the time the tape recorder was not operating.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b664 Rule 106, M.R.Evid., states that \u201cwhen part of [a] ... recorded statement or series thereof is introduced by a party: an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part of such item or series thereof which ought in fairness to be considered at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u00b665 \u201cThe completeness doctrine stems from the principle restricting the scope of cross-examination to matters testified to on direct examination. It broadens this principle by allowing an immediate introduction of the balance of portions of the same document, correspondence or conversation, where fairness so dictates.\u201d <em>State v. Castle </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 363, 374, 948 P.2d 688, 694. Rule 106 does not mandate inclusion of related evidence; it is allowed if it is needed to make the primary evidence understandable. <em>State v. Whitlow </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 430, 444, 949 P.2d 239, 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b666 In this case, the completeness doctrine allowed Elliott to cross-examine Agent Hatfield concerning parts of his conversation with her that were not recorded. In fact, Agent Hatfield testified on direct examination by the State as to what occurred during the break. Elliott did not cross-examine him concerning that or other conversations, and again, she cannot now fault the State for her own failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\u00b667 Elliott also objects to the playing of the tapes because of inadmissible matters contained within the recorded statements. She notes two of these statements on appeal: an offer to resolve the case through use of a specific criminal charge and reference to a statement by Elliott\u2019s mother that Elliott\u2019s condition on June 10, 1998, was the result of an abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b668 The State argues that these objections were not raised in the District Court and therefore should not be considered on appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b669 A lengthy discussion took place in chambers concerning Elliott\u2019s objections to the tapes being played. During that discussion, Elliott raised the issue of possible objectionable material within the tapes. The District Court directed Elliott to follow along with the transcript of the tapes and interpose objections at the appropriate time. There was also discussion directing the court reporter to begin transcribing if an objection was raised. In spite of these clear directions from the court, Elliott did not interpose any objections during the playing of the tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b670 \u201cFailure to make a timely objection during trial constitutes a waiver of the objection.\u201d Section 46-20-104(2), MCA. This Court will not hold a district court in error when it has not been given an opportunity to correct itself. <em>State v. Weeks </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 63, 85, 891 P.2d 477, 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b671 Again, Elliott had copies of the tapes and transcripts months before the trial. If there was objectionable material contained in the tapes, defense counsel had ample opportunity to either file a motion in limine or object at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b672 Finally, Elliott argues in her Reply brief that the State and District Court incorrectly relied on the best evidence rule in admitting the tapes. She states that the best evidence rule concerns the authenticity of the exhibit, not the substance of the conversation. She directs this Court to <em>United States v. Gonzales-Benitez </em>(9th Cir. 1976), 537 F.2d 1051, for this proposition. In <em>Gonzales-Benitez, </em>the prosecution did not offer tape recordings into evidence. Instead, testimony was permitted relating to conversations that had been recorded. On appeal, the defendant argued that the tapes themselves were the \u201cbest evidence\u201d of the conversations and therefore, the trial court erred in permitting the testimony. The Ninth Circuit noted that the \u201cappellants simply misconstrue the purpose and effect of the best evidence rule,\u201d and ultimately stated that the tape recordings, if intelligible, \u201cwould have been admissible as evidence of those conversations. But testimony by the participants was equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>admissible.\u201d <em>Gonzales-Benitez, </em>537 F.2d at 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b673 In this case, in response to Elliott\u2019s argument at trial that the tapes do not \u201creflect the true, best evidence,\u201d the District Court stated, \u201cthis is an admissible statement by an opposing party, and I believe it is the best evidence.\u201d The court also made clear to defense counsel that she could cross-examine Agent Hatfield concerning the making of the tapes as well as all material discussed on the tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b674 We agree with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Gonzales-Benitez </em>that the best evidence rule concerns the authenticity of the exhibit and not the substance of the conversation. Defense counsel does not argue that the tapes were not authentic copies and admitted during trial that they did not travel to Helena to authenticate the copies of the tapes, and also stated that they \u201chave been lax from a monetary standpoint of trying not to have undue expense to the taxpayers of this county,... probably at certain times to our client\u2019s detriment.\u201d Therefore, <em>Gonzales-Benitez </em>does not support their argument that the tapes were wrongly admitted. In fact, it confirms that in this case, the tapes were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b675 The tape recordings were correctly admitted. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the tape recordings to be played at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b676 Was the burden shifted to Elliott to prove that the infant was stillborn in violation of Elliott\u2019s due process rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\u00b677 Elliott contends that the State had no conclusive evidence, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the baby was born alive, \u201cand the closest the State could come would be to have the jury presume that there was a life and then to provide to the jury their theory that the life was terminated by the defendant.\u201d In arguing that this impermissibly shifted the burden to her to prove that the baby was stillborn, Elliott relies on <em>Sandstrom v. Montana </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39. The <em>Sandstrom </em>decision established that \u201ca jury instruction which shifts to the defendant the burden of proof on a requisite element of mental state violates due process.\u201d <em>State v. Luchau, </em>1999 MT 336, \u00b6 14,297 Mont. 415, \u00b6 14, 992 P.2d 840, \u00b6 14. Although Elliott concedes that the present case does not involve jury instructions, she still insists that there was an impermissible presumption that the baby was born alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">\u00b678 The State argues that it had the burden of proving all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt and that nothing changed or diminished the burden in this case. We agree. The question of whether the baby was born alive was a question of fact which the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and the jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>instructed as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b679 The jury heard evidence relating to the age of the placenta, the age of the baby, the skull fractures and Elliott\u2019s inconsistent stories about the birth. The jury was instructed that the State had the burden of proving Elliott\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that Elliott is presumed innocent. Instruction No. 10 stated that, \u201cto convict the Defendant of Deliberate Homicide, the State must prove the following elements: 1. That the defendant caused the death of Baby Girl Elliott, a human being; and 2. That the Defendant acted purposely or knowingly.\u201d Instruction No. 11 stated, \u201cA human being means a person who has been bom and is alive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b680 This case certainly presented a difficult and unusual fact finding mission for the jury. In most deliberate homicide cases, the factual issue of life is not before the jury. But it was here, and the jury was correctly instructed. There was no presumption of life. Both parties\u2019 closing arguments centered on this issue in particular. In the beginning of the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor stated, \u201cThe real point of contention is whether or not the Defendant purposely or knowingly caused that death, and in that context, whether she was born alive or not. That\u2019s the real crux of the issue. Was this baby bom alive or was she not?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b681  In her closing, Elliott emphasized this same issue, \u201cThis case is really not about death, it\u2019s about life. And that is whether or not the State of Montana can prove that this child was ever bom alive, which I think is a very basic threshold issue here today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b682 The State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the baby was born alive and the jury was correctly instructed as such.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Dr\">\u00b683 We hold that there was no burden shifting in this case and Elliott\u2019s due process rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u00b684 Was there sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict of deliberate homicide?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">\u00b685 Elliott bases her argument that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict of deliberate homicide on the fact that the State produced no witness who could say \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty\u2019 that the baby was bom alive. Once again, Elliott focuses on this one fact to the exclusion of all the other evidence brought forth at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">\u00b686  In determining the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court determines, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Richards </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 180, 184, 906 P.2d 222, 224. \u201cIt is within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the province of the finder of fact to weigh the evidence presented and determine the credibility of the witness; in the event of conflicting evidence on factual issues, the trier of fact determines which will prevail.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>1998 MT 289, \u00b6 41,291 Mont. 501, \u00b6 41,969 P.2d 925, \u00b6 41 (citations omitted). We review a jury verdict only to determine whether there was sufficient evidence, not to determine whether there was evidence to support a different verdict. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b687 As stated above, deliberate homicide requires that the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Elliott purposely or knowingly caused the death of a human being. Although there was no direct evidence that the baby was born alive, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. \u201cCircumstantial evidence alone is sufficient to obtain a conviction. Circumstantial evidence must only be of such a \u2018quality and quantity as to legally justify a jury in determining guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 and all the facts and circumstances must be considered collectively.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 43 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b688  Here, the testimony established that Elliott hid her pregnancy from her friends and co-workers, that she told a friend she had food poisoning in June before giving birth, that she delivered the baby in the bathroom of her home without calling for assistance before or after delivery, that she wrapped the baby in a towel and put her in garbage bags on the shelf in her basement, that even after undergoing an emergency hysterectomy Elliott continued to deny the pregnancy, and that when the baby was found it was of viable gestational age and had sustained multiple skull fractures.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b689 It was the jury\u2019s function to weigh all the evidence presented, to judge the credibility of witnesses and to decide the factual issue of whether the baby was born alive. We hold that there was sufficient evidence to support Elliott\u2019s conviction on the charge of deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b690 The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b270-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
