The Sportsmen\u2019s Groups request that this Court exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>supervisory control by ordering the Fifteenth Judicial District Court to permit them to intervene in an action challenging the enforcement of ballot Initiative 143. On December 18, 2001, the Court granted a stay of the District Court proceedings and ordered Respondent to respond to the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups\u2019 application. In its brief, Respondent contends that this case is not an extraordinary case warranting an exercise of supervisory control. However, Respondent, for the most part, fails to address the merits of intervention discussed at length in the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups\u2019 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\">\u00b62 Initiative 143 (1-143), which proposed a prohibition of the shooting of alternative livestock for a fee, was approved by Montana voters in November 2000. As a result, the legislature amended \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA, which now provides that an alternative livestock licensee \u201cmay not allow the shooting of game animals or alternative livestock... or of any exotic big game species for a fee or other remuneration on an alternative livestock facility.\u201d Alternative game farmers have challenged the statute in two judicial districts. The Sportsmen\u2019s Groups, which supported 1-143, moved to intervene in all of these proceedings. They were permitted to intervene in one action, are awaiting decisions in two others and were denied the opportunity to intervene in the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b63 The Sportsmen\u2019s Groups contend that a writ of supervisory control is appropriate because a direct appeal of the District Court\u2019s order of November 27, 2001, denying their motion to intervene would be a wholly inadequate remedy. They claim an appeal after final judgment will not protect the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups\u2019 right to defend 1-143 in the District Court, especially if the District Court consolidates the pending actions without their participation. Moreover, the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups argue that the issue presented is purely legal in nature, is of statewide significance and presents circumstances of an emergency nature since the court\u2019s order denying intervention may not be appealed until final judgment has been entered. Respondent, on the other hand, claims the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups must appeal the denial of their motion to intervene after entry of final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b64 We will assume supervisory control over a district court, as authorized by Article VII, Section 2(2) of the Montana Constitution and Rule 17(a), M.R.App.P., to control the course of litigation where the district corut is proceeding under a mistake of law, and in so doing is causing significant injustice, and where the remedy by appeal is inadequate. Our determination of whether supervisory control is appropriate is a case-by-case decision, based on the presence of extraordinary circumstances and a particular need to prevent an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>injustice from occurring. <em>Park v. Montana Sixth Jud. Dist. Court, </em>1998 MT 164, \u00b6 13, 289 Mont. 367, \u00b6 13, 961 P.2d 1267, \u00b6 13 (citing <em>Plumb v. Fourth Jud. Dist. Court </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 363, 368-69, 927 P.2d 1011, 1014-15; <em>State ex rel. Mazurek v. District Court </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 349, 352-53, 922 P.2d 474, 476-77).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b65  We have noted that while an order denying a motion to intervene is not separately appealable under Rule 1, M.R.App.P., the proper appeal from such an interlocutory order lies after entry of final judgment. <em>Custody of R.R.K. </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 191, 202, 859 P.2d 998, 1005; <em>Estate of Schwenke </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 127, 130-31, 827 P.2d 808, 810; <em>Continental Ins. Co. v. Bottomly </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 277, 279, 760 P.2d 73, 75. However, we have stated that supervisory control may be used to immediately review an interlocutory order where there is no remedy by appeal or other remedial procedure and where extraordinary circumstances are present. <em>Custody </em>of R.R.K., 260 Mont. at 202, 859 P.2d at 1005-06; <em>State ex rel. Palmer v. District Court </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 185, 187, 619 P.2d 1201, 1203. In addition, we have allowed supervisory control when an appeal from a final judgment would impose undue hardship on an applicant and be wholly inadequate as a remedy. <em>State ex rel. Great Falls Nat. Bank v. District Court </em>(1969), 154 Mont. 336, 340, 463 P.2d 326, 328. Finally, supervisory control may be used to prevent extended and needless litigation. <em>State ex rel. First Bank System v. District Court </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 77, 84-85, 782 P.2d 1260, 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b66 Having reviewed the briefs submitted in support of and in opposition to the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups\u2019 application, we conclude this is an extraordinary case and supervisory control is proper. The case presents the purely legal issue of whether the primary proponent of a ballot initiative has a legally protectable interest sufficient to allow it to intervene in a case challenging the resulting statute. This is an issue of both first impression and statewide importance. Additionally, and most importantly, appeal following final judgment in this case would come too late. It would not allow the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups the opportunity to participate in the defense of the initiative they actively supported. Furthermore, if the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups successfully appealed the denial of their motion to intervene after final judgment, extended and needless litigation would result. Under these circumstances, an appeal from final judgment is a wholly inadequate remedy, and supervisory control is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b67  Having determined that this is a proper case for supervisory control, we turn to the issue of whether intervention is appropriate in this case. Pursuant to Rule 24(a), M.R.Civ.P., application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>intervention as a matter of right must satisfy each of the following factors: (1) be timely; (2) show an interest in the subject matter of the action; (3) show that the protection of the interest may be impaired by the disposition of the action; and (4) show that the interest is not adequately represented by an existing party. <em>Estate of Schwenke, </em>252 Mont. at 131, 827 P.2d at 811. Montana\u2019s rule is essentially identical to the federal rule which is interpreted liberally. <em>Sagebrush Rebellion, Inc. v. Watt </em>(9th Cir. 1983), 713 F.2d 525, 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\">\u00b68 At the outset, the Court notes that the first factor to consider in determining whether intervention is proper, timeliness, is conceded here. Thus, the Court focuses its attention on the remaining three factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b69  Regarding the second factor, the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups must show an interest in the subject matter of the action. A mere claim of interest is insufficient to support intervention as of right under Rule 24(a)(2), M.R.Civ.P. A district court must determine whether the party seeking intervention has made a prima facie showing of a \u201c \u2018direct, substantial, legally protectable interest in the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>DeVoe v. State </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 356, 363, 935 P.2d 256, 260 (citing <em>Aniballi v. Aniballi </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 384, 386-87, 842 P.2d 342, 343-44 (citation omitted)). Such a determination is a conclusion of law which we will review to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>DeVoe, </em>281 Mont. at 363, 935 P.2d at 260 (citations omitted). \u00b610 Here, the District Court held that the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups did not have a legally protectable interest in either the property (alternative livestock) or the lawful business transactions between two alternative livestock owners. It also found that because the legal validity of 1-143 is not at issue, the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups do not have a cognizable interest in the litigation. The District Court vehemently rejected the notion that the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups have any interest in the sale and slaughter of alternative livestock and opined that \u201c[ajgriculture has always been and will always be our State\u2019s number one industry, and we should not forget it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b611 The Sportsmen\u2019s Groups, however, claim they have a legally protectable interest in the validity and enforceability of 1-143 because their members, as Montana citizens, are the beneficiaries of the State\u2019s obligations as trustee for the management and protection of game animals. They note that although Montana law has not addressed, intervention by ballot supporters, the Ninth Circuit has approved of such intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u00b612  On this issue, the Ninth Circuit has stated that \u201c[a] public interest group is entitled as a matter of right to intervene in an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>challenging the legality of a measure it has supported.\u201d <em>Idaho Farm Bureau Federation v. Babbit </em>(9th Cir. 1995), 58 F.3d 1392, 1397 (citing <em>Sagebrush Rebellion, </em>713 F.2d at 527). <em>See also Michigan State AFL-CIO v. Miller </em>(6th Cir. 1997), 103 F.3d 1240, 1245-47; <em>Coalition of Arizona /New Mexico Counties for Stable Economic Growth v. Department of Interior </em>(10th Cir. 1996), 100 F.3d 837, 842. We find the Ninth Circuit precedent persuasive. In this case, the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups were the authors, sponsors, active supporters and defenders of 1-143. Accordingly, we conclude that the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups have a direct, substantial, legally protectable interest in the instant action challenging the interpretation of 1-143, and, as such, they are entitled to intervene as a matter of right. We hold that the District Court incorrectly held that the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups did not have an interest in this litigation sufficient to support intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u00b613  With regard to the third factor, the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups must show that the protection of their interest may be impaired by the disposition of the action. The District Court did not address this factor, having concluded that the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups had no legally protectable interest in the litigation. Based on our analysis above, we hold that the District Court erred in so concluding. An adverse decision in this suit would impair the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups\u2019 interest in the management and protection of Montana\u2019s game animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b614 Finally, the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups must show that their interest is not adequately represented by an existing party-namely, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP). The requirement of inadequacy of representation is satisfied if an applicant shows that representation of its interests \u201cmay be\u201d inadequate and the burden of making this showing is minimal. <em>Sagebrush Rebellion, </em>713 F.2d at 528 (citing <em>Trbovich v. United Mine Workers of America </em>(1972), 404 U.S. 528, 538 n. 10, 92 S.Ct. 630, 636 n. 10, 30 L.Ed.2d 686, 694 n. 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b615 The District Court held that the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups failed to allege or demonstrate that FWP will not zealously defend the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups\u2019 position in this case. It further stated that no party is in a better position to defend the interpretation of 1-143 than the Attorney General on behalf of the FWP. Similarly, Respondent argues that the Attorney General has appeared and vigorously defended the FWP\u2019s interpretation of the statute which is identical to that of the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u00b616 The Sportsmen\u2019s Groups claim that while they support the efforts of the FWP to date, they want to ensure that their interests are vigorously represented at all times-especially since the Director of the FWP is a political appointee and considering the ongoing political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>controversy surrounding the game farm issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\">\u00b617  We conclude that the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups who actively drafted and supported 1-143 may be in the best position to defend their interpretation of the resulting legislation. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in holding that the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups are adequately represented by the FWP.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b618 THEREFORE IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b619 1. The Sportsmen\u2019s Groups\u2019 application for a writ of supervisory control is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u00b620 2. The stay issued by this Court on December 18, 2001, is lifted, and the Fifteenth Judicial District Court shall permit the Sportsmen\u2019s Groups to intervene in the matter of <em>Spoklie v.
