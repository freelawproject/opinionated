The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he did not wish to proceed at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"Aey\">Based on the fact that Mr. Anciaux was just recently appointed to represent Mr. Brown before the Sentence Review Board, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that this hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>shall be continued to the May 2001 meeting at the Montana State Prison, thus allowing Mr. Anciaux additional time to prepare.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A21\">DATED this 27th day of February, 2001.</decisiondate>\n<otherdate id=\"b460-4\">Done in open Court this 9th day of February, 2001.</otherdate>\n<judges id=\"b460-6\">Chairman, Hon.
