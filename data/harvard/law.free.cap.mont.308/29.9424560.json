The District Court\u2019s order precluded Kilmers from recovering Medcenter\u2019s alleged pro rata share of attorney fees from a settlement fund subject to Medcenter\u2019s hen. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">\u00b62 We restate the sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">Does our opinion in <em>Sisters of Charity v. Nichols </em>preclude application of the common fund doctrine to the case at bar?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">\u00b63 On April 1, 1999, Martin Kilmer was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Keltz Hall on a North Dakota highway. Hall lost control of the vehicle and Martin suffered severe injuries as a result of the single vehicle accident. Martin received medical attention from Medcenter, a North Dakota hospital. Despite Medcenter\u2019s efforts, Martin\u2019s injuries rendered him a quadriplegic. Medcenter perfected a hospital lien in North Dakota and Montana for the value of its services, approximately $309,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">\u00b64 Hall possessed no vehicle, homeowners\u2019, or farm and ranch insurance coverage. However, Hall\u2019s father Wallace, co-owner of the vehicle Hall was operating, did have a motor vehicle insurance policy through Mountain West Farm Bureau (Mountain West). This policy had a maximum limit of $500,000 with an additional $30,000 in no-fault coverage. The policy contained a step-down provision which limited Mountain West\u2019s liability to $25,000 per person for passengers other than the named insured or a relative of the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">\u00b65 Initially, Mountain West claimed Kilmers were entitled to only $25,000 under Wallace\u2019s policy pursuant to the step-down provision. However, after negotiating with Kilmers\u2019 attorney, Mountain West agreed to proffer the policy limits of $530,000. On October 29, 1999, Mountain West filed a complaint for interpleader naming the above captioned parties and subsequently tendered $530,000 to the District Court. Medcenter cross-claimed against Kilmers seeking satisfaction of its lien. Kilmers cross-claimed against Medcenter seeking reduction in Medcenter\u2019s recovery for a pro rata portion of their attorney fees incurred in negotiating Mountain West\u2019s $530,000 tender. Upon stipulation of the parties, the District Court subsequently dismissed Defendants Wallace Hall, Glenna Hall, and Keltz Hall from the action.</p>\n<p id=\"AEt\">\u00b66 On December 29, 1999, Medcenter moved for partial summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>judgment, arguing it was not liable for a pro rata portion of Kilmers\u2019 attorney fees. Following a June 13, 2000, hearing, the District Court concluded that the facts existing herein are indistinguishable from those in <em>Sisters of Charity v. Nichols </em>(1971), 157 Mont. 106, 483 P.2d 279. Concluding that <em>Nichols </em>is still controlling law in Montana, the District Court granted Medcenter\u2019s motion and entered judgment for Medcenter. Kilmers appeal the District Court\u2019s summary judgment ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b67 Our standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is de novo. <em>Motarie v. Northern Mont. Joint Refuse Disposal Dist. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156. We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment to determine whether it was correctly decided pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., which provides that summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Motarie, </em>274 Mont. at 242, 907 P.2d at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b68 Here, the parties do not present disputed factual issues on appeal. Thus, our role is to determine, as did the District Court, whether Medcenter is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In essence, we need only determine whether the District Court\u2019s conclusion regarding the applicability of this Court\u2019s case law is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">\u00b69 Does our opinion in <em>Sisters of Charity v. Nichols </em>preclude application of the common fund doctrine to the case at bar?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">\u00b610 Section 71-3-1114(l)(b), MCA (1999), provides that a hospital has a lien for the value of services rendered on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">(i) any claim or cause of action that the injured person or the injured person\u2019s estate or successors may have for injury, disease, or death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\">(ii) any judgment that the injured person or the estate or successors may obtain for injury, disease, or death; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-12\">(iii) all money paid in satisfaction of the judgment or in settlement of the claim or cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">Both parties agree that pursuant to \u00a7 71-3-1114(1)(b), MCA (1999), Medcenter has a valid lien for the medical services rendered to Martin Kilmer immediately following his accident. However, \u00a7 71-3-1114, MCA (1999), is silent on the issue of attorney fee apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-14\">\u00b611 In the 2001 session, the Montana Legislature amended \u00a7 71-3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>1114, MCA, to address a hospital\u2019s pro rata liability for an injured person\u2019s attorney fees. Section 71-3-1114(3), MCA, now states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">A ... hospital ... claiming a lien under this part is not liable for attorney fees and costs incurred by the injured person, the injured person\u2019s estate or successors, or a beneficiary in connection with obtaining payments or benefits subject to a ben under this part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASi\">The statute contains no express retroactive appbcation provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b612 Pursuant to \u00a7 1-2-201, MCA, every statute adopted after January 1, 1981, takes effect on the first day of October following its passage and approval unless the enacting legislation prescribes otherwise. As \u00a7 71-3-1114, MCA (2001), contains no express effective date prescription, both parties agree it has an October 1, 2001, effective date. Further, no Montana law is retroactive unless the statute expressly so declares. Section 1-2-109, MCA. Since \u00a7 71-3-1114, MCA (2001), contains no retroactive provision and all of the relevant events pertaining to Kilmers\u2019 claim occurred prior to October 1, 2001, \u00a7 71-3-1114, MCA (1999), applies to the case at bar. However, as previously stated, \u00a7 71-3-1114, MCA (1999), contains no attorney fee apportionment provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b613  Montana follows the general American rule that a party in a civil action is not entitled to attorney fees absent a specific contractual or statutory provision. <em>School Trust v. State ex rel. Bd. of Com\u2019rs, </em>1999 MT 263, \u00b6 62, 296 Mont. 402, \u00b6 62, 989 P.2d 800, \u00b6 62. However, we have recognized equitable exceptions to the American rule. <em>See, e.g., Foy v. Anderson </em>(1978), 176 Mont. 507, 511, 580 P.2d 114, 117, and <em>Holmstrom Land Co. v. Hunter </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 43, 48-49, 595 P.2d 360, 363 (affirming award of attorney fees on equitable grounds despite absence of specific contractual or statutory grant); <em>Goodover v. Lindey\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 430, 447, 843 P.2d 765, 775 (recognizing hmited equitable exception to general rule when party is \u201cforced into a frivolous lawsuit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u00b614  One of the recognized equitable exceptions to the American rule is the common fund doctrine. Generally, this doctrine authorizes the spread of fees among those individuals benefitting from the btigation which created the common fond. <em>See Morris B. Chapman &amp; Assocs., Ltd. v. Kitzman </em>(Ill. 2000), 739 N.E.2d 1263, 1271. In <em>Means v. Montana Power Co. </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 395, 403, 625 P.2d 32, 37, this Court adopted the common fund doctrine, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">The \u201ccommon fund\u201d concept provides that when a party through active btigation creates, reserves or increases a fund, others sharing in the fund must bear a portion of the btigation costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>including reasonable attorney fees. The doctrine is employed to spread the cost of litigation among all beneficiaries so that the active beneficiary is not forced to bear the burden alone and the \u201cstranger\u201d (i.e., passive) beneficiaries do not receive their benefits at no cost to themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The doctrine entitles the party who created the fund to reimbursement of his or her reasonable attorney fees from the common fund. <em>Murer v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 210, 223, 942 P.2d 69, 76. Our decisions in <em>Means </em>and <em>Murer </em>outline the three elements necessary to establish a common fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b615  First, one party must create, reserve, or increase a common fund. This party is typically referred to as the active beneficiary. The fund must be an existing, identifiable monetary fund or benefit to which all of the beneficiaries maintain an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b6 16 Second, the active beneficiary must incur legal fees in establishing the common fund. Medcenter insists the active beneficiary must initiate \u201cactive litigation\u201d to satisfy this element. Since Kilmers did not bring suit against Mountain West to establish the fund, Medcenter argues Kilmers failed to satisfy the active litigation requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\u00b617 Medcenter derived this active litigation language from our decisions in <em>Means </em>and <em>Murer. </em>However, in <em>Murer, </em>the language preceding the \u201cactive litigation\u201d reference appears to dispel Medcenter\u2019s argument. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">The United States Supreme Court created the common fund doctrine in <em>Trustees v. Greenough </em>(1881), 105 U.S. 527, 15 Otto 527, 26 L.Ed. 1157, and has subsequently applied that doctrine in numerous other cases (citations omitted). These common fund doctrine cases provide that when a party has an interest in a fund in common with others and incurs legal fees in order to establish, preserve, increase, or collect that fund, then that party is entitled to reimbursement of his or her reasonable attorney fees from the proceeds of the fund itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Murer, 283 Mont. at 222, 942 P.2d at 76. The cases cited in <em>Murer </em>merely illustrate the need to <em>incur </em>legal fees in pursuit of the common fund rather than engage in \u201cactive litigation.\u201d In <em>Means </em>and <em>Murer, </em>the active litigation was simply the expense-incurring mechanism employed by the parties to establish the common fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">\u00b618 Third, and finally, the common fund must benefit ascertainable, non-participating beneficiaries. In <em>Means, </em>we referred to nonparticipating beneficiaries as inactive or passive beneficiaries and defined them as those who fail to retain counsel, or those who retain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>counsel who fails to participate in the labors creating the common fund. <em>Means, </em>191 Mont. at 404, 625 P.2d at 37. Further, to the extent there are inequities in contribution of participating counsel, the court may intervene to allocate fees accordingly. <em>See Means, </em>191 Mont. at 404, 625 P.2d at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b619 Nevertheless, Medcenter argues, and the District Court agreed, that our decision in <em>Nichols </em>precludes application of the common fund doctrine to the case at bar. In <em>Nichols, </em>the defendant (Nichols) incurred approximately $2000 in medical expenses after being hit by an automobile. Nichols hired an attorney who filed a personal injury claim against the driver and negotiated a settlement for $5000. Meanwhile, the hospital perfected a lien for the medical services it provided to Nichols. Nichols\u2019 attorney attempted to deduct one-third of the hospital\u2019s $2000 hen, claiming the hospital was liable for a pro rata portion of Nichols\u2019 attorney fees incurred in procuring the settlement. Nichols sought to remit the remaining two-thirds to the hospital in full satisfaction of the hospital\u2019s lien. The hospital filed suit seeking, among other things, judgment against Nichols for the full amount of the hospital bill. The district court entered judgment for the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b620 On appeal, Nichols proffered two theories in support of her attorney fee apportionment position. First, Nichols claimed that an implied contract existed between the hospital and her attorneys for their services and compensation. This Court dismissed the implied contract argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">The fact that an incidental benefit was also received by the hospital from her attorneys\u2019 services in the form of settlement proceeds from which its bill could be paid does not, in itself, create an implied contract by the hospital to pay her attorneys for their services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\"><em>Nichols, </em>157 Mont. at 111-12, 483 P.2d at 283. Second, Nichols argued the hospital was obligated to pay a pro rata share of the attorney fees much like a subrogated insurer is obligated to share attorney fees and costs with its insured in recovering against a third party. We rejected this subrogation analogy based on the inherently different positions occupied by a subrogated insurance company and a hospital lien holder. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">The obligation of the subrogated insurer to share in the costs of recovery from a third party wrongdoer arises because the insurer occupies the position of the insured with coextensive rights and liabilities and no creditor-debtor relationship between them. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>here, unlike that situation, the hospital\u2019s claim and lien is based upon a debt owed the hospital by its patient in whose shoes it does not stand for any purpose, the debt being owed to it by its patient irrespective of the patient\u2019s rights against a third party wrongdoer. Because the substitution principle does not apply here, no obligation arises on the part of the hospital to share in the costs of recovery against a third party, and the attempted analogy fails.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><em>Nichols, </em>157 Mont. at 112-13, 483 P.2d at 283. Therefore, we affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b621  Here, Medcenter analogizes Kilmers\u2019 common fund argument to those arguments posited in <em>Nichols. </em>Medcenter insists <em>Nichols </em>is dispositive to the case at bar. However, in <em>Nichols, </em>this Court addressed only those implied contract and subrogation issues advanced by the parties. As neither party raised the common fund issue in <em>Nichols, </em>this Court had no reason to, and did not, analyze the issues in <em>Nichols </em>in the context of the common fund doctrine. Kilmers acknowledge that <em>Nichols </em>would bar an apportionment claim brought on an implied contract or subrogation theory. However, Kilmers insist the common fund doctrine presents entirely different legal issues. We agree. Therefore, we hold that <em>Nichols </em>does not preclude application of the common fund doctrine to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b622 Finally, at oral argument, Medcenter argued that the legislative hearings held in contemplation of \u00a7 71-3-1114, MCA (2001), evince a clear legislative intent to prohibit our application of the common fund doctrine to the medical services arena. Medcenter suggests that we should impute the 2001 legislative intent to \u00a7 71-3-1114, MCA (1999). To support this proposition Medcenter cites <em>Fergus Motor Co. v. Sorenson </em>(1925), 73 Mont. 122, 235 P. 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b623 In <em>Fergus, </em>this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">If it can be gathered from a subsequent statute in pari materia what meaning the Legislature attached to the words of a former statute, they will amount to a legislative declaration of its meaning, and will govern the construction of the first statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASV\"><em>Fergus, </em>73 Mont. at 132, 235 P. at 425. Historically, in pari materia statutes were statutes consistent with one another that referred to the same subject matter. <em>See In re Clark\u2019s Estate </em>(1937), 105 Mont. 401, 409, 74 P.2d 401, 405. Statutes in pari materia should be construed together and effect given to both if it is possible to do so. <em>Register Life Ins. Co. v. Kenniston </em>(1935), 99 Mont. 191, 197, 43 P.2d 251, 254. Presumably, Medcenter believes the 2001 and 1999 statutes are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>consistent with one another. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b624 The two statutes do address the same subject matter and are consistent with one another <em>except </em>for one provision-the attorney fee provision at issue here. The legislative intent embodied in the 2001 statute fails to inform us of the \u201cmeaning the Legislature attached to the words of [the] former statute,\u201d because the 1999 statute does not address attorney fee apportionment. The statutes are not consistent with regard to a medical service provider\u2019s liability for an injured party\u2019s attorney fees. Therefore, Medcenter\u2019s in pari materia argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b625  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the District Court erred as a matter of law in relying on <em>Nichols </em>to grant Medcenter\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. As the issue on appeal focused primarily on <em>Nichols\u2019 </em>application to this case, the parties did not present arguments on whether Kilmers can satisfy those elements of the common fund doctrine discussed herein. Therefore, we decline to rule on the doctrine\u2019s application to the case at bar as the dissent suggests we should. Instead, and as requested by Kilmers, we reverse and remand to allow Kilmers to present arguments in the District Court for the application of the common fund doctrine in this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b65-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b65-7\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"A5c\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\u00b626 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision in this matter, believing it to be an inadequate response to the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">\u00b627 The Appellants raise the issue of whether equities require application of the common fond doctrine to a hospital lien holder. The Court, however, chooses to address only the question of whether the holding in <em>Nichols </em>precludes application of the common fund doctrine. Finding it does not, the Court, rather than resolving the issue raised on appeal, remands the case to the District Court for another try.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">\u00b628 I do not disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that <em>Nichols, </em>by itself, does not preclude application of the common fund doctrine. <em>Nichols </em>predates <em>Means, </em>and the doctrine was neither argued nor discussed therein. However, the Court further holds that <em>Nichols </em>is wholly irrelevant to further consideration of the issue, and cannot be relied on as authority. The Court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-11\">Kilmers insist the common fund doctrine presents entirely different legal issues. We agree. Therefore, we hold that <em>Nichols </em>does not preclude application of the common fund doctrine to the case at bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, <em>we hold that the District Court erred as a matter of law in relying on Nichols </em>to grant Medcenter\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. As requested by Kilmers, we reverse and remand to allow Kilmers to present arguments in the District Court for the application of the common fund doctrine in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b6\u00b6 21, 25 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b629 The Court errs in holding that <em>Nichols </em>is irrelevant. Contrary to the Court\u2019s statement, the common fund doctrine does not present entirely different issues. The Court cites to both <em>Means </em>and <em>Murer </em>for authority, but fails to discuss the entirety of those holdings. In both cases, this Court held that the common fund doctrine is \u201crooted in the equitable concept[ ] of quasi-contract <em>..\u2019\u2019 Murer, </em>283 Mont. at 222, 942 P.2d at 76. Contract principles are thus an indispensable consideration in determining the applicability of the common fund doctrine -just as they were in <em>Nichols, </em>where this Court found that there was no implied contract which compelled sharing of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Nichols, </em>while not necessarily controlling, is nonetheless analogical authority. However, the Court, by erasing <em>Nichols</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>removes our case law\u2019s most significant discussion of contract principles related to the attorney-hospital conflict at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u00b630 It is this Court\u2019s duty to determine the parameters of the common fund doctrine when asserted against a statutory hospital lien. It should do so, either expanding the rule of <em>Nichols, </em>or distinguishing <em>Nichols, </em>in accordance with its determination. Here, the Court removes one piece from the puzzle box, and then sends the puzzle to the District Court to put together. Because all facts relevant to the issue are of record, and nothing is to be gained by remanding the case back to the District Court for a second try, I would decide the issue raised by Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\u00b631 In response to this dissent, the Court offers that the parties did not present arguments regarding the common fund doctrine. That is not correct. The solitary issue presented in Kilmers\u2019 brief was whether the doctrine applied. Their summary of argument stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">It is Kilmers\u2019 position that the underlying facts make the present case an appropriate case to apply the common fund doctrine, spreading the costs of litigation among those who benefitted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>it. In addition, it is Kilmers\u2019 position that <em>Nichols </em>is not applicable in the present case because it is legally and factually distinguishable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Further, the relief requested in their briefs conclusion was for this Court to find that the common fund doctrine was applicable, and to vacate the judgment in favor of MedCenter. Kilmers then asked that the matter be remanded only for the trial court to calculate MedCenter\u2019s pro rata share of fees and costs. In response to Kilmers\u2019 presentation of this issue, MedCenter\u2019s brief argued against application of the doctrine for some 16 pages in its brief. I would reach the merits of the issue raised.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-9\"> The Court does not state that <em>Nichols </em>is overruled, only that <em>Nichols </em>cannot be relied upon when the common fund doctrine is asserted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
