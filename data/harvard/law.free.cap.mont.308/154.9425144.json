After serving his time at MSP, he began his ten-year suspended sentence in December 1992. In May 1998, he committed felony theft and was sentenced to five years with the Montana Department of Corrections. As a result of this felony, Blister's ten-year suspended sentence for sexual assault was revoked and replaced with another ten-year suspended sentence conditioned upon compliance with twenty-six specifically defined sentencing conditions. Brister contends that many of these conditions were not, nor could have been, included in his original sexual assault sentence, and must be stricken. However, he does not provide this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Court with his original conditions of probation. Brister appeals the imposition of the new conditions, claiming they are in violation of his constitutional protections from double jeopardy and ex post facto laws. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b62 The following is a restatement of the issues.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">1. Did Brister waive his objections by failing to contemporaneously object when the sentence was pronounced and did he file a timely appeal from the District Court\u2019s sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">2. Did the District Court\u2019s sentence violate Brister\u2019s constitutional protections against double jeopardy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">3. Did the District Court err in imposing new conditions upon a continuation of Brister\u2019s suspended sentence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">\u00b63 On July 12, 1984, Brister was sentenced to the MSP for twenty years, ten years suspended, for the felony crime of sexual assault, after being found guilty of sexually assaulting two of his young nieces. He was released and began his ten-year suspended sentence in December 1992. Under his original sentence, he was subject to the rules and regulations of the Adult Probation and Parole Field Services Office during his entire suspension period. Brister signed the set of rules applicable to his suspended sentence on December 22, 1992, but did not provide a copy of these rules to the District Court or this Court for the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">\u00b64 On May 22, 1998, Brister was charged with felony theft by the Missoula County Sheriffs Department and on June 4, 1998, was placed in the Missoula County Jail on a $10,000.00 bond. According to Brister\u2019s voluntary interview with a detective for the Sheriffs Department, Brister, while under the influence of alcohol and drugs, stole numerous firearms and ammunition, among other items, from a neighbor for the purpose of selling them. Upon sobering up, however, he reconsidered this moneymaking venture and disposed of the guns and ammunition at various locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">\u00b65 Brister entered into a plea agreement with the Montana Department of Corrections (DOC) under which he would serve five years for felony theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">\u00b66 This felony theft was committed before Brister\u2019s ten-year suspended sentence for sexual assault had run and, during its commission, Brister violated various conditions of his probation. On June 12,1998, Brister\u2019s probation and parole officer prepared a Report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>of Violation in which he listed three probation/parole violations: 1) failing to comply with all applicable laws; 2) drinking alcohol, and 3) testing positive for marijuana use.,</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b67' On June 18, 1998, a Cascade County Deputy Attorney filed a Petition for Revocation of Brister\u2019s ten-year suspended sentence based upon Brister\u2019s felony theft charge and admissions and Brister\u2019s parole officer\u2019s Report of Violation. The Petition requested that the District Court issue a warrant for Brister\u2019s arrest on probation/parole violations. A bench warrant was issued on June 18, 1998, by District Judge Marge Johnson, of the Montana Eighth Judicial Court, Cascade County, in conjunction with an Order revoking Brister\u2019s suspended sentence. At Brister\u2019s first Answer Hearing on September 30, 1998, Brister answered \u201cNot True\u201d to the parole violation charges but subsequently reappeared on October 20, 1998, and changed his answers to \u201cTrue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b68 While awaiting a Disposition Hearing for the probation/parole violations, Brister underwent a sexual offender evaluation as required under \u00a7 46-18-111, MCA (1983). This evaluation was performed on April 1, 1999, the report of which was relied upon by the District Court judge at Brister\u2019s Disposition Hearing on July 21, 1999. At the Hearing, Judge Johnson orally pronounced sentence. She revoked Brister\u2019s ten-year suspended sentence but reimposed another ten-year suspended sentence to rim consecutively to the five-year felony theft sentence. This new ten-year suspended sentence was conditioned upon Brister complying with twenty-six specific conditions. These conditions included, <em>inter alia, </em>that Brister pay various costs and fees, such as victim counseling and restitution, supervision, confinement, workers compensation, victim witness, felony charges, and court information technology fees. (Conditions 10-13 and 22-24 respectively.) Additionally, in the interests of community safety, Judge Johnson imposed several restrictions on Brister\u2019s access to children by prohibiting him from 1) living within three blocks of a school (Condition 18); 2) working or being around children, including his own four year old son and his three stepsons, without supervision by someone specially trained to supervise sexual offenders (Conditions 19 and 21); and 3) being placed in a position of authority over children (Condition 20). Brister was also designated a level II sexual offender and required to register as a sexual offender with law enforcement communities. (Condition 27). Brister did not object to any of these conditions at the time they were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u00b69 Brister filed an Objection, under \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA (1999) (now repealed), to the District Court\u2019s Sentence on September 21, 1999. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>his objection, Brister claimed that the conditions imposing the payment of fees (Conditions 10-13 and 22-24), those designed to limit his access to children (Conditions 18-21) and the condition requiring that he register as a sex offender with the State (Condition 27) were not included in his original suspended sentence. He further argued that several of the additional conditions could not have been included in his original sentence because the statutory authority for them had not yet been adopted. Brister maintained that the additional conditions were violations of the protections against double jeopardy and ex post facto laws. He requested that the District Court correct his sentence by removing the additional conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b610 In its Response to Brister\u2019s objection, the State made no mention of Brister\u2019s ex post facto claim but responded only to the double jeopardy claim, indicating that it was \u201cunable to address [Brister\u2019s] argument on this point until such time as it is presented at a hearing before the Court.\u201d The State then requested a hearing on the matter. A hearing was never set and the Court did not issue any further order on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b611 Brister filed his notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s \u201cdenial of [his] Motion to Correct Sentence\u201d on January 4, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b612  We generally review a district court\u2019s decision to revoke a suspended sentence to determine whether the court abused its discretion and whether the court\u2019s decision was supported by a preponderance of the evidence in favor of the State. <em>State v. Shockley, </em>2001 MT 180, \u00b6 8, 306 Mont. 196, \u00b6 8, 31 P.3d 350, \u00b6 8 (citing <em>State v. Nelson, </em>1998 MT 227, \u00b6 16, 291 Mont. 15, \u00b6 16, 966 P.2d 133, \u00b6 16). Where the issue is whether a court followed statutory requirements applicable to revocation of a suspended sentence, however, the question raised is a matter of law, and our review is plenary. <em>Shockley, </em>\u00b6 8. We decide the case <em>sub judice </em>pursuant to this latter standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">\u00b613 The State raises the following timeliness issues: Did Brister waive his objections by failing to contemporaneously object when the sentence was pronounced, and did he file a timely appeal from the District Court\u2019s sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">\u00b614 The State argues that because Brister failed to object to the conditions of his current suspended sentence during his sentencing hearing, Brister\u2019s present objections are untimely and, therefore, waived. The State cites \u00a7 46-20-104(2), MCA, which states that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>\u201c[flailure to make a timely objection during trial constitutes a waiver of the objection\u201d unless certain exceptions, not applicable to this case, apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b615 This Court has stated on numerous occasions that a defendant must raise an objection in a timely manner or the objection is waived and this Court will not hear it on appeal. <em>See, e.g., State v. Baker, </em>2000 MT 307, \u00b6 30, 302 Mont. 408, \u00b6 30, 15 P.3d 379, \u00b6 30; <em>State v. Harris, </em>1999 MT 115, \u00b6 11, 294 Mont. 397, \u00b6 11, 983 P.2d 881, \u00b6 11. Additionally, we have repeatedly stated that an important purpose of contemporaneous objections is to give the trial judge the first opportunity to correct any error. <em>See State v. Tucker, </em>2000 MT 255, 301 Mont. 466, 10 P.3d 832; <em>State v. Clausell, </em>2001 MT 62, 305 Mont. 1, 22 P.3d 1111; <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 915 P.2d 208 (overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817); <em>State v. Weinberger </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 278, 665 P.2d 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b616  Notwithstanding the wisdom of this rule, this Court has established a narrow but important exception. In <em>State v. Lenihan </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997, we held that \u201cthe better rule [is] to allow an appellate court to review any sentence imposed in a criminal case, if it is alleged that such sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates, even if no objection is made at the time of sentencing.\u201d <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000. Thus, even if a defendant fails to contemporaneously object at sentencing, we will accept jurisdiction of an appeal that has been timely filed which alleges that a sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b617 The <em>Lenihan </em>rule should not be confused with the \u201cplain error\u201d rule, under which this Court may, in exceptional cases, discretionarily review a claimed error which affects fundamental constitutional rights where failing to review the claim may result in \u201ca manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of fundamental fairness of the proceedings or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>1999 MT 115, \u00b6 12, 294 Mont. 397, \u00b6 12, 983 P.2d 881, \u00b6 12. The <em>Lenihan </em>rule is much narrower than the \u201cplain error\u201d doctrine, as it deals specifically with post-trial sentencing rather than the fundamental fairness of a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u00b618 <em>Lenihan </em>aside, we are also faced here with the application of \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA (1999) (now repealed). Section 46-18-117, MCA (1999), authorized the district court to correct an erroneous sentence or disposition at any time and to correct a \u201csentence imposed in an illegal manner within 120 days after the sentence is imposed or after remand from an appellate court.\u201d While Brister did not voice any objection at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>his sentencing hearing, he nonetheless provided the District Court with an opportunity to correct any sentencing errors by filing an objection to the court\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA (1999), on September 21, 1999. Shortly thereafter, the State requested an extension of time in which to respond to Blister\u2019s reconsideration request. The State\u2019s response, filed on October 29, 1999, requested that the District Court schedule a hearing to address the issues raised in Brister\u2019s objection. Sixty days elapsed from the filing of the State\u2019s request for a hearing and the District Court neither responded to Brister\u2019s objection nor to the State\u2019s request. Brister therefore concluded, not illogically, that the State\u2019s request for a hearing was deemed denied, and in an effort to preserve his right to appeal, he filed his Notice of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b619 In <em>State v. St. John, </em>2001 MT 1, \u00b6 16, 304 Mont. 47, \u00b6 16, 15 P.3d 970, \u00b6 16, we were asked to determine whether St. John was barred from raising certain issues on appeal. We stated, \u201c[o]ur review of the record reveals that St. John did not object to the District Court\u2019s failure to consider sentencing alternatives under \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA, nor did he request reconsideration of the court\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA.\u201d (Emphasis provided). In the case at bar, Brister did request reconsideration of the court\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA (1999), and he promptly filed his notice of appeal upon expiration of the 120 days allowed for correction of the sentence. Therefore, we conclude that while he failed to contemporaneously object 'to the District Court\u2019s sentence, under the rationales of both <em>Lenihan </em>and <em>St. John, </em>Brister retains his right to appeal his purportedly illegal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b620 The State argues that Rule 5(b), M.R.App.P., requires that, \u201cin criminal cases an appeal from a judgment... must be taken within 60 days....\u201d The State maintains that because Brister filed his appeal on January 4, 2000, from a written judgment entered on August 27,1999, his appeal is untimely and should be dismissed by this Court. We disagree. The combined application of Rule 5(b), M.R.App.P., \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA (1999), and the <em>St. John </em>case compels a different result. While Rule 5(b), M.R.App.P., instructs an appellant to file an appeal within 60 days in a criminal case, \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA (1999), allows the district court to \u201ccorrect a sentence imposed in an illegal manner within 120 days after the sentence is imposed.\u201d As explained above, Brister requested such a correction. We therefore conclude that, under the specific facts in this case, Brister preserved his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa0\">\u00b621 We note that this Court has been somewhat inconsistent in the past, when addressing the question of whether failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>contemporaneously object to an illegal sentence at the time it is pronounced results in a waiver of the issue on appeal. It seems we established the sound rule <em>inLenihan, </em>then inexplicably departed from it at times, while reaffirming it at others. To the extent we have previously ruled in <em>State v. Smith, </em>2001 MT 111, 305 Mont. 298, 27 P.3d 39, <em>State v. St. John, </em>2001 MT 1, 304 Mont. 47, 15 P.3d 970, and <em>State v. Taylor, </em>2000 MT 202, 300 Mont. 499, 5 P.3d 1019, that failure to raise a contemporaneous objection to an illegal sentence at the time of hearing results in a waiver of the defendant\u2019s objection, we overrule these cases as to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b622 We next address whether the District Court\u2019s sentence violated Brister\u2019s constitutional protections against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b623 Brister directed his attorney to argue that imposing the new conditions in his suspended sentence constituted a second sentencing for a single crime and, therefore, violated his rights against double jeopardy. He states that, as a result, the case should be dismissed in its entirety. Brister\u2019s attorney concedes that he finds no basis for this claim, and therefore no argument was included in Brister\u2019s appeal on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b624  This Court has held on several occasions that revocation of a suspended sentence based upon violations of probationary conditions and reinstatement of the original sentence does not violate a person\u2019s constitutional rights against double jeopardy. <em>State v. Oppelt </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 48, 601 P.2d 394; <em>State v. Lange </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 486, 775 P.2d 213; <em>State v. Walker, </em>2001 MT 170, 306 Mont. 159, 30 P.3d 1099. Based upon the analysis and conclusion below, we need not address whether the inclusion of the additional conditions is also a violation of his rights against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b625 We last examine whether the District Court erred in imposing new conditions upon Brister\u2019s suspended sentence, when it reimposed a ten-year suspended sentence upon terms and conditions not contained in Brister\u2019s original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\u00b626 Brister was charged by information on September 12, 1983, for the August 1983 assault against his niece. He was originally sentenced in 1984. We have held that the law in effect at the time of the commission of the crime controls as to the possible sentence. <em>State v. Stevens </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 452, 904 P.2d 590. Therefore, we look to the revocation statute in effect at the time Brister committed his crime to determine what conditions the District Court could fairly and legally impose upon reinstatement of Brister\u2019s suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">\u00b627  The revocation statute in effect at the time Brister committed the offense was \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA (1983). This statute provided the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>district court in a revocation proceeding two alternatives-either revoke the suspended sentence and order the defendant to serve the remainder of his prison term, or continue the suspended sentence under the original terms. Here, the District Court did neither. Rather, it reimposed a suspended sentence conditioned upon multiple new conditions and terms not contained in the original sentence. This course of action was not permitted under the revocation statute in effect at the time Brister\u2019s crime was committed. Therefore, the District Court had no authority to impose new conditions upon the continuation of Brister\u2019s suspended sentence. <em>State v. Leistiko </em>(1992), 256 Mont. 32, 844 P.2d 97 (citation omitted); <em>Shockley, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b628 Having concluded the District Court exceeded its authority in imposing new conditions upon the continuation of Brister\u2019s suspended sentence, we again turn to the statute in effect at the time Brister committed his crime to determine what alternatives were available to the District Court. As noted above, the statute in effect in 1983 gave the District Court two alternatives-either revoke the suspended sentence and order Brister to serve the remainder of his prison term, or continue his suspended sentence under its original terms. Section 46-18-203, MCA (1983). In the past, we have resolved a similar problem by simply vacating the offending new conditions. <em>Shockley, </em>\u00b6 11. However, because it is readily apparent that the District Court expended considerable effort in fashioning new terms and conditions to attach to Brister\u2019s suspended sentence, we are unable to surmise what the court would have chosen to do had it realized it was limited to the two statutory choices discussed above. Therefore, we conclude the proper remedy here is to remand this matter to the District Court for a new disposition hearing in which to determine whether to strike all the new conditions added by the Court and continue Brister\u2019s suspended sentence under the original conditions, or revoke suspension and order Brister committed to the Montana Department of Corrections for the remainder of his sentence, as permitted under \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b629 We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b190-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
