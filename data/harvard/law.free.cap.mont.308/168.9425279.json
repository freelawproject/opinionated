Appellant, Wiley Micks, filed a motion which requested that the District Court reconsider its August 2, 2000 order, issue a temporary restraining order, and issue a preliminary injunction. The District Court denied Micks\u2019 motion and Micks appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">\u00b62 We restate the sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-12\">Did the District Court err when it denied Micks\u2019 motion to reconsider its August 2, 2000 order?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b63 Micks operates a genetic materials facility know as Quad Five near Ryegate, Montana, which provides horse, cattle, and sheep blood for medical and scientific purposes. The operation requires that the animals be quarantined for most of the year in paddocks or barns. Thus, Micks must produce hay to sustain the animals during quarantine.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b64 In order to irrigate his hay crop, Micks entered into a water purchase contract with the Deadman\u2019s Basin Water Users Association. In 2000, pursuant to the water purchase contract, Micks purchased the right to 775 acre feet of water from the Deadman\u2019s Basin Reservoir. On April 18,2000, the District Court appointed two water commissioners for the 2000 irrigation season to distribute the reservoir water pursuant to a rotation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b65 On August 2, 2000, the District Court, on its own motion, found that the \u201cremaining stored water level in Deadman\u2019s Basin Reservoir has reached a critical level\u201d and that the reservoir water was needed to maintain the Musselshell River flow \u201cto supply domestic, municipal, stock and wildlife water usage.\u201d Therefore, the District Court prohibited the irrigation of crops from the Musselshell River between August 12 and September 30, 2000, so long as the reservoir maintained its critically low level. As of August 12, 2000, Micks believed that he had used only 431 of his contracted 775 acre feet of water. Based on his limited usage and other reasons, Micks presumed that the District Court\u2019s prohibition did not apply to him. Thus, Micks continued to use the reservoir water to irrigate his hay crop.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b66 On August 12, 2000, the court-appointed water commissioners patrolled the Deadman\u2019s Basin irrigation system to verify that irrigators were complying with the District Court\u2019s order. The patrol revealed that the Quad Five and Sterling Zeier ranches were irrigating in violation of the District Court\u2019s order. Therefore, upon motion of the Musselshell/Golden Valley County Attorney, the District Court ordered Micks and Sterling Zeier to show cause on September 6, 2000, why they should not be held in contempt of court for failing to comply with the August 2, 2000 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u00b67 On September 1,2000, Micks filed a motion which requested that the District Court clarify its August 2, 2000 order to apply only to those individuals who obtain water directly from the Musselshell River. Micks argued that since his water was delivered via a system separate and apart from the Musselshell River, the District Court\u2019s order should not apply to him. Micks also argued to the District Court that the water in the reservoir should not be appropriated for other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>uses to Micks\u2019 detriment, as no senior water rights existed which enjoyed priority over Micks\u2019 water rights. Further, Micks\u2019 motion requested that the District Court issue a temporary restraining order to prohibit the water commissioners from interfering with Micks\u2019 use of the Deadman\u2019s Basin water. Finally, Micks\u2019 motion requested that the District Court order the water commissioners to show cause as to why the District Court should not issue a preliminary injunction forbidding them from utilizing Micks\u2019 Deadman\u2019s Basin water for purposes other than irrigation of Micks\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\">\u00b68 After receiving testimony at the September 6, 2000 show cause hearing, the District Court held Micks and Zeier in contempt of court for violating its August 2,2000 order. The District Court ordered Micks and Zeier to pay a $500 fine and sentenced them to five days in the Musselshell County Jail. In the alternative, the District Court allowed Micks and Zeier to pay an additional $500 in lieu of the five-day jail sentence. The District Court denied Micks\u2019 motion for reconsideration, temporary restraining order, and preliminary injunction. Micks appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion. However, he does not seek review of the contempt order. Zeier is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b69 The construction and interpretation of a contract is a question of law for the comb to decide. <em>Ophus v. Fritz, </em>2000 MT 251, \u00b6 19, 301 Mont. 447, \u00b6 19, 11 P.3d 1192, \u00b6 19. The standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err when it denied Micks\u2019 motion to reconsider its August 2, 2000 order?</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">\u00b611 In its August 2,2000 order, the District Court determined that the water in Deadman\u2019s Basin Reservoir was needed to maintain the \u201cminimal Musselshell River flows to supply domestic, municipal, stock and wildlife water usage.\u201d Therefore, the District Court prohibited the irrigation of crops from the Musselshell River for a specified period of time while the water level in the reservoir remained critically low.</p>\n<p id=\"APt\">\u00b612 Micks argues that no senior Deadman\u2019s Basin water right exists which entertains legal priority over his. As the Deadman\u2019s Basin water rights enjoy equal priority, Micks insists that any water rationing policy must be implemented on a pro-rata basis pursuant to the water purchase contracts. Micks contends that the August 2, 2000 order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>essentially instituted a first-come-first-serve water rationing plan which contravened the allocation provisions in the water purchase contracts. In so doing, Micks maintains that the District Court\u2019s order effectively misconstrued the contract provisions. Thus, Micks argues that the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b613 Musselshell County contends that Micks suffered no injury from the August 2, 2000 order because Micks availed himself of his full allotment of water prior to August 12, 2000. The County agrees that Micks was entitled to 775 acre feet of water from the reservoir. However, the County contends that Micks leased 300 acre feet to Zeier and consumed the remaining 475 acre feet prior to August 12, 2000. It accordingly contends that this appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b614 Contrary to the Countys contention, the District Court found that Micks had not appropriated his entire allotment of water. At the September 6, 2000 show cause hearing the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">This irrigation season lasted at least a month longer than was anticipated, and each of you [Micks and Zeier] had the same rights to take water, take your 100 percent or 130 percent out of there while there was water to be taken, and you did not do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At1\">Therefore, we decline to address the County\u2019s mootness argument further. We now proceed to the merits of Micks\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b615  The jurisdiction to interpret and determine existing water rights rests exclusively with the water courts. <em>Mildenberger v. Galbraith </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 161, 166, 815 P.2d 130, 134. District courts are granted the authority to supervise the distribution of water that has already been adjudicated and to enforce such water decrees. <em>Baker Ditch Co. v. District Court </em>(1992), 251 Mont. 251, 255, 824 P.2d 260, 262-63. Under certain circumstances a district court may \u201cfill in\u201d a pre-1973 water decree with further delineations such as time or season of use and acreage of application. <em>State ex rel. Jones v. District Court </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 1, 7, 938 P.2d 1312, 1316. However, it is clear that a district court has no authority to issue a final adjudication of water rights. <em>Mildenberger, </em>249 Mont. at 166, 815 P.2d at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">\u00b616 While the District Court\u2019s order clearly prohibits the irrigation of crops from the Deadman\u2019s Basin Reservoir, its justification for the prohibition is \u2022unclear. The following colloquy between the District Court and Micks\u2019 attorney demonstrates this ambiguity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">Court: And then we come to this idea of you say that all irrigation rights on stored water are even or equal. Well, here\u2019s one of the differences. Now your irrigation water during irrigation season usually lasts for a period of four or five months and that\u2019s it and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>then your irrigation season is over with. All your irrigation of crops is for a period of four or five months and then you have no more use for it for irrigation usually. On the other hand, water for livestock and for city use, for drinking water, people and domestic water, that water is used all year round.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-3\">Counsel: [I]s it your ruling that the stock water and municipal water rights, because of the longevity in their nature or other reasons, have some legal precedent or seniority over my client\u2019s contract irrigation water rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\">Court: Well, I don\u2019t know if it has so much priority, but I mean the period of use is all year long for the cities\u2019 water as opposed to irrigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">Counsel: And the reason I asked for the clarification is because pursuant to the Court\u2019s order we are going to - - you are going to service the municipalities\u2019 water rights and the in-stream stock water rights to the detriment of my client\u2019s irrigation rights, so I wanted it clear in my mind and for the record, is there some priority that you see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">Court: Well, that\u2019s one. One is for all year round, and the other is just for in the summer for irrigation and for a few months. Personally, yes, I see that people drinking water is probably more important them irrigating a person\u2019s crops. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the law, because in Montana I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve held that yet. Some states have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\u00b617  As stated above, the District Court had the authority to supervise the distribution of previously adjudicated water or enforce an existing water decree. However, the record is devoid of any reference to a water decree proclaiming priorities among the users of the Deadman\u2019s Basin water. In fact, it was stipulated at the hearing that all of the users entitled to the reservoir\u2019s water shared equal priority pursuant to the water purchase contracts. It appears that the District Court simply made a priority determination regarding domestic and irrigation water consumption based on its own inclinations. In so doing, the District Court exceeded its authority to simply \u201cfill in\u201d a water decree with further delineations.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">\u00b618 Moreover, the District Court\u2019s August 2, 2000 order essentially implemented a water rationing policy for those irrigators utilizing the Deadman\u2019s Basin Reservoir water. Those irrigators who satisfied their demand by August 12,2000, received their entire contracted allotment. Those irrigators who had utilized less than their full amount of water conditionally forfeited the remainder of their entitlement, effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>August 12,2000. This \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d approach to the water shortage dilemma contradicted the water rationing plan in the Deadman\u2019s Basin water purchase contract, which provided for pro rata rationing in the event of a shortfall of water. Section one of the contract states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnJ\">[I]n the event that ... [the reservoir] shall have an inadequate amount of water... to permit the furnishing of the number of acre feet of water in any year for which there are such outstanding water purchase contracts, the water purchaser in such year shall be entitled, in lieu of each acre foot of water for which he has contracted, to a share of the total water available representing the proportion that one acre foot of water annually bears to 20,000 acre feet of water annually or ... to the total number of acre feet of water agreed to be purchased annually under outstanding water purchase contracts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b6 19  The language of contractual provisions should be interpreted according to its plain, ordinary meaning. Ophus, \u00b6 23. When the language of a contract is clear and unambiguous and, as a result, susceptible to only one interpretation, the duty of the court is to apply the language as written. <em>Ophus, </em>\u00b6 23. This contract unambiguously requires a pro rata reduction in water distribution when an inadequate amount of water exists to satisfy the outstanding water purchase contracts. The August 2, 2000 order employed a \u201cfirst-come-first-serve\u201d policy in contravention of the water contract. Therefore, we hold that the District Court erred as a matter of law when it prohibited irrigation from Deadman\u2019s Basin Reservoir in a manner contrary to the water purchase contract. Consequently, the District Court erred in denying Micks\u2019 motion to reconsider the August 2, 2000 order. It further follows that Micks\u2019 motion to restrain the water commissioners from interfering with his use of the irrigation water to which he was entitled, that was stored in Deadman\u2019s Basin Reservoir, should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b620 Finally, Micks contends that the District Court\u2019s appropriation of his water for public purposes constituted a compensable taking. However, the District Court made no specific finding regarding the extent of Micks\u2019 water deprivation, nor did it determine whether the deprivation qualified as an unconstitutional taking. Therefore, this issue is not ripe for present determination, and wb decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b621 Reversed and remanded for such further proceedings consistent with this Opinion as may be deemed necessary.</p>\n<judges id=\"b202-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
