The District Court vacated the Human Rights Commission order based on its conclusion that Ashmore lacked standing and her claim was moot. Ashmore appeals the District Court\u2019s dismissal. We reverse the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">\u00b62 The following issue is dispositive on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it considered claims that Ashmore lacked standing and her claim was moot, even though those arguments were made for the first time in the District Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b64 The Hilands Golf Club is a member-owned, private country club in Billings, Montana. Prior to 1989, Hilands limited its full membership, which included voting privileges, to men only. Wives of male members were considered \u201cassociate\u201d members. That status included no voting privilege or proprietary interest in the Club.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b65 In 1989, the Montana Legislature amended the Montana Human Rights Act to prohibit gender discrimination in places of public accommodation. <em>See </em>\u00a7 49-2-304, MCA. As a liquor license holder, the Hilands Golf Club qualified as a place of public accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b66 On April 20,1989, in response to the Legislature\u2019s action, Hilands amended its bylaws and adopted a gender neutral membership policy. Hilands also modified its \u201cblackballing\u201d procedure (by which any three members could deny an applicant membership) and set up a grievance procedure to handle discrimination complaints. Women were allowed to join the Club for the $5,000 membership fee, and assume full membership status.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u00b67 Steve Zirko joined Hilands on August 22,1988, and his wife, Joan Ashmore, became an \u201cassociate\u201d member. Zirko and Ashmore knew of Hilands\u2019 men-only membership policy at the time. However, no other membership choices were available. Following the 1989 amendments, women were allowed to become voting members, and spouses of members, whichever gender, were made \u201cassociate\u201d members. Despite the bylaw change, Ashmore alleged that <em>de facto </em>discrimination continued, and that Hilands continued to publish, distribute and enforce gender-specific rules and regulations which either limited or denied services, facilities, and privileges to women.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\u00b68 On August 20,1990, Ashmore filed a preliminary complaint with the Montana Human Rights Commission pursuant to \u00a7 49-2-501(1), MCA, alleging gender discrimination. Ashmore filed a second preliminary complaint on October 2, 1990. On March 28, 1991, Ashmore filed a formal complaint with the Commission in which she alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">A. My husband is a member of the respondent\u2019s golf club and I am an associate member of the club.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">B. The majority of respondent\u2019s voting membership are [sic] male. Females were not permitted voting memberships until a year ago. Respondent has only two female members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-14\">C. The majority of the associate members are [sic] wives of voting members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-16\">D. Respondent has a rule regarding playing time that gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>members exclusive use of golf course on Thursdays, and on Saturday, Sunday and holiday mornings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b69 Steve Zirko resigned his voting membership on September 25, 1992. As a result, Ashmore\u2019s status as an \u201cassociate\u201d member ended. Ashmore applied for \u201cnon-resident\u201d member status and was accepted. In that status, she was entitled to play golf at \u201cany time reserved for regular members.\u201d On September 26, 1994, Ashmore voluntarily resigned her membership with Hilands.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b610 Ashmore\u2019s complaint of gender discrimination before the Human Rights Commission referred to incidents which occurred prior to her change in membership status in September of 1992 and her ultimate resignation from Hilands in 1994. Hearings before the Human Rights Commission Hearing Examiner occurred between June and August of 1993. On January 4,1994, the Hearing Examiner issued his Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order in favor of Ashmore. On June 13,1994, the Human Rights Commission affirmed the findings of the Hearing Examiner and ordered Hilands to pay Joan $750 in damages for emotional distress. Furthermore, the Commission enjoined Hilands from engaging in future discriminatory practices and ordered Hilands to create a three-person committee to review its policies and practices, promote greater numbers of female members, and monitor its progress.</p>\n<p id=\"AOd\">\u00b611 On July 12, 1994, pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA, Hilands filed a Petition for Judicial Review of the Commission\u2019s order. A challenge to the validity of Hilands\u2019 appeal was denied by this Court in <em>Hilands Golf Club v. Ashmore </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 324, 922 P.2d 469. On remand, Hilands filed a Motion to Dismiss based on its contention that Ashmore lacked standing and her claim was moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">\u00b612 On October 23, 2000, the District Court granted Hilands\u2019 Motion to Dismiss. On December 14, 2000, Ashmore filed a Notice of Appeal of the District Court\u2019s decision. To date, Hilands has neither paid Ashmore her monetary damages in the amount of $750 nor formed the three-person committee ordered by the Commission to undertake certain activities to eliminate and discourage further discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">\u00b613 We first note that Hilands\u2019 Motion to Dismiss was filed and granted in the District Court before the Court reached the underlying issues decided by the Human Rights Commission. The basis for Hilands motion was that \u201cthe present case is moot, that Respondent Ashmore lacks standing, and that, therefore, vacatur should be entered, vacating the Order of the Montana Human Rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Commission, and that this case should then be dismissed.\u201d Therefore, we are reviewing Hilands\u2019 Motion to Dismiss. A district court\u2019s ruling on whether a justiciable controversy exists is a conclusion of law. <em>Northfield Ins. Co. v. Montana Ass\u2019n of Counties, </em>2000 MT 256, \u00b6 8, 301 Mont. 472, \u00b6 8, 10 P.3d 813, \u00b6 8. We review the district court\u2019s conclusions on which its decision is based to determine whether they have been correctly decided. <em>Ridley v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 325, 329, 951 P.2d 987, 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b614 Did the District Court err when it considered claims that Ashmore lacked standing and her claim was moot, even though those arguments were made for the first time in the District Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b615 Ashmore contends that the District Court improperly dismissed the order of the Human Rights Commission based on standing and mootness. Ashmore argues that because Hilands knew the facts which gave rise to its standing and mootness claims prior to the contested hearing before the Human Rights Commission, Hilands in effect waived such arguments by not raising them during the administrative process. Ashmore relies on \u00a7 2-4-702(l)(b), MCA, of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lincoln County v. Sanders County </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 344, 862 P.2d 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b616 Hilands maintains that because both standing and mootness are jurisdictional issues, they can be raised at any stage of the proceedings. It relies on <em>Shamrock Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor </em>Co., 1999 MT 21, \u00b6 19, 293 Mont. 188, \u00b6 19, 974 P.2d 1150, \u00b6 19 <em>(\u201cShamrock F), </em>and <em>Shamrock Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., </em>1999 MT 39, \u00b6 9, 293 Mont. 317, \u00b6 9, 974 P.2d 1154, \u00b6 9 <em>(\u201cShamrock IF). </em>It further contends that not only can standing and mootness be raised, but a court has an obligation to examine its own jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>at each stage of the proceedings, even if the parties previously waived such issues.</p>\n<p id=\"A0B\">\u00b617 The District Court concluded that <em>Lincoln County\u2019s </em>application to the present case was doubtful in fight of our decisions in <em>Shamrock I </em>and <em>Shamrock II. </em>Based on that conclusion, the District Court dismissed the Human Rights Commission order.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u00b618 In order to best serve justice and allow parties to have their day in court, we encourage, as a general rule, a liberal interpretation of procedural rules governing judicial review of administrative decisions. <em>Hilands Golf Club v. Ashmore </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 324, 330, 922 P.2d 469, 473. That being said, a district court\u2019s authority to review administrative rulings is constrained by statutes duly enacted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Montana Legislature. <em>In re McGurran, </em>1999 MT 192, \u00b6 12, 295 Mont. 357, \u00b6 12, 983 P.2d 968, \u00b6 12. While it is true that a court has an obligation to consider its own jurisdiction <em>sua sponte, </em>a court\u2019s jurisdiction to review administrative decisions is statutorily created and limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b619 The Montana Administrative Procedure Act sets forth the procedure for judicial review of contested administrative decisions, like the one in this case. \u00a7 2-4-701 to -711, MCA. Section 2-4-702(l)(b), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">A party who proceeds before an agency under the terms of a particular statute may not be precluded from questioning the validity of that statute on judicial review, <em>but the parties may not raise any other question not raised before the agency unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that there was good cause for failure to raise the question before the agency. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARO\">\u00b620 When we interpret a statute, we first look to the plain meaning of the words it contains. <em>Clarke v. Massey </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 412, 416, 897 P.2d 1085, 1088. Where the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself and we will not resort to other means of interpretation. <em>Clarke, </em>271 Mont. at 416, 897 P.2d at 1088. Moreover, this Court is required to simply ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance found in the statute, neither inserting what has been omitted nor omitting what has been inserted. \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b621  A plain reading of \u00a7 2-4-702(l)(b), MCA, indicates that a party may question the validity of a statute for the first time on judicial review to the district court. Other than that exception, all other issues must be raised at the administrative level absent good cause. Section 2-4-702(l)(b), MCA, is, itself, a limitation on the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to review administrative decisions. This limitation stands in contrast to the original or appellate jurisdiction derived from Article III of the U.S. Constitution and Article VII, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution. Because the Legislature created judicial review of administrative decisions and at the same time limited the scope of review, the general rule that justiciability questions can be raised at any time is not applicable. Therefore, we conclude that standing and mootness claims cannot be raised for the first time on judicial review of an administrative agency decision unless the District Court determines that there was good cause for the party\u2019s failure to raise the question before the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b622 The question presented here was previously considered <em>inLincoln </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>County. </em>In that case, Sanders County argued that because Lincoln County did not raise the issue of standing to the Mining Board, an administrative agency, it could not raise the question before the District Court. We agreed. We held that the Montana Administrative Procedure Act specifically prohibits parties from raising an issue for the first time on judicial review, pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-702(1)(b), MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alf\">The District Court determined that Lincoln County had not shown good cause for failure to raise the issue before the agency. A review of the record indicates that the District Court was correct in this assessment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\">We conclude that Lincoln County cannot raise on judicial review something it did not raise before the agency itself. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in ruling that Lincoln County could not challenge the standing of Sanders County to object to an administrative decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\"><em>Lincoln County, </em>261 Mont. at 351, 862 P.2d at 1138. While <em>Lincoln County </em>addressed the issue of standing, we conclude that \u00a7 2-4-702(1)(b), MCA, applies to all questions, including other justiciability questions like mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b623 The District Court concluded that <em>Lincoln County </em>was inapplicable given this Court\u2019s decisions <em>in/Shamrock I </em>andII. In those separate cases, national automobile companies, Ford Motor Company in <em>Shamrock I </em>and the Chrysler Corporation in <em>Shamrock II, </em>notified Shamrock Motors, Inc., that it intended to terminate its automobile dealer franchise due to Shamrock\u2019s unauthorized sale of 80% of its stock without the auto companies\u2019 knowledge and consent. The dispute was contested before the Motor Vehicle Division, an administrative agency, which ruled that Ford and Chrysler had good cause. Shamrock filed for judicial review in the district court. Both automobile companies removed the case to federal court, and, while the matter was pending before the Ninth Circuit, Shamrock\u2019s franchise relationship with both companies ended. In <em>Shamrock I, </em>Shamrock sold the dealership to Brooks Hanna Ford, and resigned as a Ford dealer. <em>Shamrock I, </em>\u00b6 12. In <em>Shamrock II, </em>Chrysler terminated the franchise. <em>Shamrock II, </em>\u00b6 10. The Ninth Circuit vacated the U.S. District Court\u2019s decisions because the court lacked jurisdiction. On remand back to state court, Shamrock filed a renewed petition for judicial review. Both Ford and Chrysler filed motions to dismiss based on mootness and lack of standing, given the fact the franchise relationship no longer existed. The District Court reversed the order of the Motor Vehicle Division without addressing the basis for Ford\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>and Chrysler\u2019s motions to dismiss. On appeal to this Court, we reversed, and held that because mootness is a threshold issue, it must be dealt with prior to addressing the underlying dispute. <em>Shamrock I, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Shamrock II, </em>\u00b6 13. We determined that a matter is moot when due to an event or happening, the issue has ceased to exist and no longer presents an actual controversy. <em>Shamrock I, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Shamrock II, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b624 However, the facts in those cases are distinguishable. In <em>Shamrock I, </em>the sale of the dealership from Shamrock to Brooks Hanna occurred <em>after </em>the contested administrative hearing. Similarly, in <em>Shamrock II, </em>the franchise was terminated by Chrysler <em>after </em>the contested administrative hearing. Therefore, the case was made moot by a subsequent event which followed the administrative hearing and good cause would have existed to raise those issues for the first time on judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b625  Here, Hilands knew that lack of standing and mootness claims were viable issues that could be raised before the Human Rights Commission, yet failed to raise them. To allow Hilands to raise those questions for the first time at the District Court would contravene the plain language of \u00a7 2-4-702(l)(b), MCA. If, however, an event had occurred after the administrative hearing that raised standing or mootness issues, Hilands presumably would be able to satisfy the court that \u201cthere was good cause for failure to raise the question before the agency,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-702(l)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b626  Upon review of the record, we conclude that the good cause exception is not present in this case. The record indicates that Hilands was aware of such defenses during the administrative agency proceeding. On the standing issue, Hilands\u2019 brief in support of its Motion to Dismiss, on page 28, argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">Apart from mootness ... any standing she may have had to raise that issue evaporated when she lost her associate status and became a non-resident member. She simply is not harmed by the course usage rules of Hilands, because she, as a non-resident member, has all course privileges. This was true at the time of the hearing because she had become a non-resident member by that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Hilands concedes a standing argument was available prior to June 2, 1993, the first hearing date before the Hearing Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">\u00b627 As to the mootness issue, Hilands similarly acknowledges the availability of the argument prior to the hearing on page 24 of its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azs\">Even assuming that this complaint of Ms. Ashmore states an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>actionable claim under the Montana Human Rights Act, such claim is moot, and was moot at the time the Human Rights Commission heard this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Hilands contends that Ashmore mooted the issues when she lost her \u201cassociate\u201d status and became a \u201cnon-resident\u201d member in September of 1992, and when she resigned her Hilands membership in September of 1994. Her change in membership status in 1992 occurred prior to the first hearing on June 2, 1993. Therefore, the mootness argument was available, yet Hilands failed to raise it. If Ashmore had resigned her membership in 1994, without a change of membership status in 1992, there may have been good cause to raise the argument before the District Court for the first time on judicial review. Yet, given the congruent nature of the mootness arguments, both changes in membership status, Hilands could have argued the case was moot before the Hearing Examiner. It did not, and, as a result, waived similar mootness arguments based on a membership status change.</p>\n<p id=\"ADH\">\u00b628  Therefore, because Hilands failed to raise questions of standing and mootness during the agency proceeding when it could have done so, the District Court erred in its dismissal of the Human Rights Commission order. Because this issue is dispositive, we will not address the other issues of justiciability raised on appeal. We remand to the District Court for further consideration of any substantive issues raised in the Petition for Judicial Review.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u00b629 We reverse and remand to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b147-9\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"A3a\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">\u00b630 I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">\u00b631 The Court holds that the District Court erred in dismissing the claims for lack of standing and mootness, because these grounds were not raised before the agency, citing \u00a7 2-4-702(l)(b), MCA. At \u00b6 21, the Court describes this statutory provision as a legislatively imposed limitation on the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction which \u201cstands in contrast\u201d to the constitutional mandate to hear cases and controversies. I respectfully submit that, while correctly noting the contrast, the Court fails to properly apply the constitutional principle at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">\u00b632 While the Legislature can limit the jurisdiction of the district court, the Constitution provides a prior limitation. Article VII of the Montana Constitution, like Article III of the United States Constitution, mandates that courts may only hear justiciable cases. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>have previously explained that standing is a requirement under this constitutional provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">The concept of standing arises from two different doctrines: (1) Discretionary doctrines aimed at prudently managing judicial review of the legality of public acts, [citation omitted]; and (2) doctrines of constitutional limitation in the federal courts drawn from the \u201ccases and controversies\u201d definition of federal judicial power in Article III, United States Constitution and in the Montana courts drawn from the \u201ccases at law and in equity\u201d definition of state judicial power in Article VII, 1972 Montana Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">From these cases we synthesize that the issue presented for review must represent a \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy\u201d within the judicial cognizance of the state sovereignty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\"><em>Stewart v. Board of County Commissioners </em>(1977), 175 Mont. 197, 200-01, 573 P.2d 184, 186. Thus, the Constitution requires that a party have standing before a district court may hear the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\u00b633 However, the Court turns this principle on its head, holding that the Legislature\u2019s enactment of \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA, prohibits the district court from applying the constitutional principle of standing in those cases in which the issue was not previously raised before the agency. The Court essentially holds that the requirement of standing can, pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA, be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">\u00b634 Standing is jurisdictional and can never be waived:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">Plaintiffs argue that the defendant Board is raising the issue of standing for the first time on appeal and that... the Board is now precluded from raising this defense.... <em>Objections to standing cannot be waived and may be raised by the court sua sponte. United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co. </em>(1956), 351 U.S. 192, 197, 76 S.Ct.763, 100 L.Ed. 1081; 6 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Civil \u00a7 1542 at 642-43.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-10\"><em>Stewart, </em>175 Mont. at 203-04, 573 P.2d at 188 (emphasis added). The Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA, as prohibiting the District Court from applying the standing requirement violates Article VII of the Montana Constitution and elevates legislative enactment over constitutional mandate. The Legislature can no more require courts to hear cases that lack standing than it could require courts to issue advisory opinions. Our Constitution prohibits it.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">\u00b635 This prohibition applies to other justiciability concerns, such as ripeness, feigned or collusive cases, political questions, and, at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>here, mootness. In <em>Roosevelt v. Montana Dept. of Revenue, </em>1999 MT 30, 293 Mont. 240, 975 P.2d 295, we quoted from <em>Hardy v. Krutzfeldt </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 521, 526, 672 P.2d 274, 276, explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">\u201cThe judicial power vested in the district courts and the Supreme Court of Montana, by the provisions of the Montana Constitution, extend to such \u2018cases at law and in equity\u2019 as are within the judicial cognizance of the state sovereignty. Article 8, secs. 3,11, [1889 Montana Constitution.] <em>By \u2018cases\u2019and \u2018controversies\u2019 within the judicial power to determine, is meant real controversies and not abstract differences of opinion or moot questions. </em>Neither federal nor state Constitution has granted such power.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">We have followed this same principle of judicial restraint since the adoption of our new Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\"><em>Roosevelt, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 47-48 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AGF\">\u00b636 For these reasons, I believe that <em>Lincoln County </em>was wrongly decided and should be reversed. Further, I would not apply the statutory prohibition on raising new questions, set forth in \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA, to constitutional justiciability requirements. Consequently, I would address the merits of the District Court\u2019s order, i.e., whether, under the facts of this case, the claims were properly dismissed on the grounds of standing and mootness.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
