We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b62 The following issues were presented for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court properly determined that the DOR failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 16-6-303, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u00b64 2. Whether the DOR violated Seaman\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Aou\">\u00b65 Seaman is the holder of a Montana Al-Acoholic Beverage License and the operator of the Depot Bar and Casino in Poplar, Montana. On April 17, 1996, after a lengthy investigation by the Montana Department of Justice (DOJ), DOJ issued criminal citations charging Seaman with violating \u00a7\u00a7 16-6-301 and 16-6-303, MCA, by selling liquor not purchased from an agency liquor store. Seaman was found guilty of both charges on January 14, 1997, in Justice Court. On September 19,1997, DOR advised Seaman that it intended to revoke his license, and after a hearing, DOR issued an order revoking Seaman\u2019s license on March 24, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">\u00b66 The investigation leading to the charges against Seaman began in December 1995, when Roosevelt County Sheriff John Granger, while shopping in Williston, North Dakota, noticed Seaman\u2019s pickup truck parked outside the Rough Rider Liquor Store. He observed Seaman exit the liquor store pushing a cart loaded with three or four cases of alcohol and place the cases into his truck. After observing Seaman, Sheriff Granger advised the Gambling Division of the DOJ of his observations and requested investigative assistance. DOJ investigators attempted over the next few months to observe Seaman purchasing liquor in North Dakota and transporting it into Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"ATk\">\u00b67 On January 3,1996, the DOJ investigators traveled to Williston, North Dakota, where they made application for, and were granted, a search warrant to seize records and documents pertaining to sales of alcohol from the Rough Rider Liquor Store to Seaman during the calendar year 1995. The records indicated that Seaman had purchased liquor from the store at least nineteen times during that year. DOJ investigators were able to correlate Seaman\u2019s purchases as indicated on sales tax exemption forms with cash register tapes from the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u00b68 After obtaining evidence of Seaman\u2019s North Dakota liquor purchases, the investigators interviewed Seaman and performed an inspection of his bar on April 17,1996. At that time, the investigators seized fifteen bottles of rum and two bottles of vodka that had been purchased in North Dakota. The same day, the DOJ investigators issued two citations to Seaman, charging him with violating \u00a7 16-6-303, MCA, which prohibits a Montana licensee from selling, keeping for sale, or having on the licensee\u2019s premises for any reason, any liquor except that purchased from a Montana state agency liquor store, and violating \u00a7 16-6-301, MCA, which prohibits any person from possessing in excess of three gallons of an alcoholic beverage purchased in another state or foreign country.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b69 Seaman was convicted of both charges on January 14, 1997, in Roosevelt County Justice Court. On January 22, 1997, the DOJ investigation report regarding Seaman\u2019s out-of-state liquor purchases was received by DOR. The report did not reference Seaman\u2019s Justice Court conviction. Following DOR operating procedures, Amber Carpenter (Carpenter), a Liquor Licensing Compliance Specialist, prepared and submitted a draft notice of license revocation to DOR legal counsel for approval in February 1997. After learning of Seaman\u2019s conviction, legal counsel instructed Carpenter to revise the notice of revocation. Carpenter prepared a second draft, which was approved by DOR legal counsel and sent to Seaman on September 19, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b610 On October 3, 1997, Seaman filed a request for a hearing on the license revocation, and a hearing was ultimately held on October 5 and 6, 1999. The hearing examiner held that Seaman\u2019s license was properly revoked by DOR, and that holding was affirmed in the final agency decision issued by the director of DOR on March 24, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\u00b611 Seaman then filed a petition for judicial review in the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, which reversed the agency decision. The District Court concluded that DOR failed to comply with the mandate of \u00a7 16-6-303, MCA, to \u201cimmediately\u201d revoke the license, and that the process of revocation violated Seaman\u2019s due process rights. The DOR appeals the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">\u00b612 A district court reviews an administrative decision in a contested case to determine whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the agency correctly interpreted the law. <em>Laudert v. Richland County Sheriff\u2019s Dept., </em>2000 MT 218, \u00b6 14, 301 Mont. 114, \u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>14, 7 P.3d 386, \u00b6 14. We employ the same standards when reviewing a district court order .affirming or reversing an administrative decision. <em>Langager v. Crazy Creek Prod., Inc., </em>1998 MT 44, \u00b6 13, 287 Mont. 445, \u00b6 13, 954 P.2d 1169, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b613 Did the District Court properly determine that the DOR failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 16-6-303, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b614 Section 16-6-303, MCA, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">It is unlawful for any licensee to sell or keep for sale or have on the licensee\u2019s premises for any purpose whatever any liquor except that purchased from an agency liquor store.... If the department is <em>satisfied </em>that the liquor was knowingly sold or kept for sale within the licensed premises by the licensed or by the licensee\u2019s agents, servants, or employees, the department shall <em>immediately </em>revoke the license. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">\u00b615 Pursuant to this provision, DOR must \u201cimmediately\u201d revoke a license when it is \u201csatisfied\u201d that the license holder has violated the statute. DOR argues that it was not satisfied that a violation of the statute had occurred until it received the investigative report from the DOJ on January 22, 1997. Seaman argues that DOR was satisfied a violation had occurred on April 17,1996, when the DOJ investigators issued Seaman the two citations, imputing the knowledge of the DOJ investigators onto the DOR, a sister agency in the enforcement of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">\u00b616 The District Court agreed with Seaman, finding that DOR was \u201csatisfied\u201d a violation of the statute had occurred at the time the citations were issued, but also determining that, at the very latest, DOR was \u201csatisfied\u201d a violation of the statute had occurred on January 14,1997, when Seaman was convicted of the charges in Justice Court. The District Court reasoned that, using either date, DOR failed to act \u201cimmediately\u201d as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">\u00b617 Our decision does not require that we resolve the question of whether the DOR was satisfied for purposes of \u00a7 16-6-303, MCA, that a violation of the statute occurred on April 17,1996, by virtue of DOJ\u2019s issuance of the citations to Seaman and imputation of that action to DOR. DOR admittedly was satisfied of the violation when it received the investigative report on January 22,1997. Seaman\u2019s conviction on January 14, 1997, was also sufficient to place DOR on notice and therefore satisfy DOR of the violation for purposes of \u00a7 16-6-303, MCA. Our analysis here addresses whether DOR complied with the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>when it issued the notice of revocation eight months thereafter, on September 19,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b618 Section 16-6-303, MCA, does not offer a definition of the term \u201cimmediately,\u201d and this Court has not had occasion to interpret the meaning of the word within the context of this statute. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cimmediate\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">Present; at once; without delay; not deferred by any interval of time. In this sense, the word, without any very precise signification, denotes that action is or must be taken either instantly or without any considerable loss of time. A reasonable time in view of particular facts and circumstances of case under consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 5th Edition, page 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\u00b619 We have previously addressed the meaning of the word in a case construing a divorce statute. In <em>Putnam v. Putnam </em>(1929), 86 Mont. 135, 282 P. 855, this Court referenced various judicial interpretations of the term \u201cimmediately,\u201d and determined that when used in a statute, where it relates to time, the word has an elastic, rather than a precise meaning. This Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">Taking the liberal view, it means, when referring to the doing of an act, as soon as the act can with reasonable diligence be performed, ... with due diligence under the circumstances of the particular case, and without unnecessary or unreasonable delay, ... within a reasonable time, with due diligence, under the circumstances of the particular case, and without unnecessary delay.... [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\"><em>Putnam, </em>86 Mont. at 144, 282 P. at 859-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">\u00b620 In determining whether DOR acted immediately, the District Court applied what it considered to be the most lenient definition of the word, using \u201ca reasonable time under the circumstances.\u201d This definition is consistent with our prior decisions and the legal meaning of the word as defined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">\u00b621 DOR argues that its issuance of the notice of license revocation on September 19, 1997, complied with the requirements of \u00a7 16-6-303, MCA. It contends that Carpenter \u201cimmediately\u201d began the revocation process once she received the DOJ report on January 22, 1997. She submitted a draft notice to the legal staff for approval. After legal review, Carpenter revised her draft notice and resubmitted it for legal approval. Upon the second review by legal counsel, the notice was approved and issued on September 19, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">\u00b622  The District Court found that the process involved in issuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>a notice of license revocation did not require the delay occasioned here, and, therefore, DOR had not satisfied the statutory mandate that it act immediately. We agree. The notice of revocation itself consists of three paragraphs, barely exceeding one page in length. Carpenter prepared a draft of the notice for review by the legal counsel within a couple of weeks after receiving the DOJ investigative report, but the drafted notice waited for counsel approval for most of the eight-month period preceding its issuance. Even applying the broadest definition of \u201cimmediately\u201d from <em>Putnam, </em>\u201cacting in a reasonable time under the circumstances,\u201d it cannot be said that DOR acted immediately to revoke Seaman\u2019s license by taking eight months to initiate the process. Therefore, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the DOR did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 16-6-303, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b623 Did the DOR violate Seaman\u2019s due process rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b624 The District Court determined that DOR\u2019s delay not only violated the statute, but also violated Seaman\u2019s rights of due process. Having determined that the District Court properly resolved this matter by holding that DOR\u2019s revocation of Seaman\u2019s liquor license was improper on statutory grounds, it is unnecessary for this Court to determine if Seaman\u2019s due process rights were implicated. Therefore, we decline to address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b625 The District Court\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b340-7\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, TRIEWEILER, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b340-8\">JUSTICE COTTER,</author>\n<p id=\"Ay1\">specially concurring,</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">\u00b626 I concur in the Court\u2019s disposition of this case, and in its reasoning, as far as it goes. However, there is an additional factual basis for affirming the District Court which the majority felt was unnecessary to the resolution of the case, but which entered into my decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">\u00b627 In the spring of 1996, shortly after DOR investigators issued criminal citations to Seaman charging him with the statutory violations described in the Court\u2019s Opinion, Seaman made application to DOR for modification and expansion of his licensed premises. The proposed expansion entailed expensive alterations and improvements to the premises. On May 22, 1997, DOR approved Seaman\u2019s request for expansion of his bar and casino. In approving the expansion, DOR did not advise Seaman that it had already undertaken the drafting of the notice to revoke his liquor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">\u00b628 Having received DOR approval of his proposed expansion, Seaman expended substantial funds in improving the bar and casino. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>It was not until September 19,1997, five months after DOR approved Seaman\u2019s expansion of his bar and casino, that DOR first advised Seaman it intended to revoke his license.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b629 DOR essentially argues that because Seaman had already been convicted in justice court of a statutory violation, he should have known his license could be revoked, and that he thus undertook his business alterations at his own risk. Seaman counters that had DOR \u201cimmediately\u201d given notice of its intent to revoke his license, he would have been able to make am informed decision as to whether or not to remodel his premises. This only makes sense. More to the point, a green light for the remodeling project from the entity empowered to revoke one\u2019s license would certainly suggest to its beneficiary that his license was, in all likelihood, safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b630 The District Court concluded it was \"... especially disturbing to note that the Department would approve am expansion of facilities knowing all the while that it was mandated by statute to proceed with revocation of the license.\u201d I agree. If the arm of DOR responsible for granting a request to improve a licensed premises did not know what the arm of DOR handling license revocations was doing, it should have. If it did know, and proceeded to grant the remodeling application anyway, the approval was at best mean-spirited and at worst deceitful. Either way, I cannot countenance a method of doing business which essentially gives with one hand while taking away with the other. Accordingly, I affirm for this reason as well as for the reasons referenced by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the foregoing special concurrence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
