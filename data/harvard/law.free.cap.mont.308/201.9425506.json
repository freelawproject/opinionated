A jury found Azure guilty of deliberate homicide of John Cavill; mitigated attempted deliberate homicide of Lois Cavill; and criminal mischief, a misdemeanor. Azure\u2019s motion for a new trial or modified verdict was denied, and the District Court sentenced Azure to 110 years for deliberate homicide with the use of a weapon, 12 years for mitigated attempted deliberate homicide with the use of a weapon, and 6 months for criminal mischief, with all sentences to run consecutively. Azure appeals the court\u2019s denial of his motion for a modified verdict, and alleges improper jury impanelment procedure and prosecutorial misconduct. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">1. Whether Azure\u2019s allegation of an unlawful jury impanelment may be reviewed on direct appeal, when no objection was raised at trial;</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>2. Whether Azure\u2019s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct may be reviewed on appeal, when no objection to the conduct was raised at trial; and</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">3. Whether the District Court erred when it denied Azure\u2019s motion for a modified verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b63 Azure and Lois Cavill (Lois) were married in 1981. According to Lois, the marriage began to deteriorate when Azure started drinking, and in 1987, she filed for divorce following an incident when Azure threatened to kill her. Lois later withdrew the papers upon promises by Azure to stop drinking. In December of 1996, Azure was drinking again and because she felt threatened, Lois obtained a restraining order to keep Azure away from her. However, Azure violated the restraining order on January 6, 1997, when he broke into Lois\u2019 residence and was waiting on the couch when Lois came home. Azure pointed a gun at Lois, and he told her that he had one shell in the chamber for her and one for him. Lois convinced Azure she would not leave him, and that she would help him. Azure stayed at the house that night, and the couple met with a marriage counselor the next day. However, Lois decided to go through with divorce proceedings after Azure accused her of having an affair. Lois left the residence on January 13, 1997, and went to Plains, Montana, to stay with her brother, Fred Cavill (Fred). According to Fred, when Azure later called for Lois at his house, Azure told him that if he couldn\u2019t talk to Lois, Azure would blow her head off, burn her house down, and shoot himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u00b64 On February 3,1997, the couple reached a property settlement in their divorce; Azure received $5,500.00, the van, and his truck, while Lois received the house and a truck. Lois\u2019 brother John Cavill (John) came to Great Falls to help Lois pack her belongings and move to Plains. On February 13, while Lois and John were packing her things, Lois observed Azure\u2019s van drive by the house several times. Several neighbors also observed Azure\u2019s van in the area that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\u00b65 Later on February 13, at approximately 8:30 p.m., a prospective buyer for Lois\u2019 house, Kathy Carson (Carson), discovered the front tires of her truck and the rear tires of John\u2019s truck had been slashed with a large knife while she was looking at the house. Carson, a local police officer, was off duty at the time. After learning about Lois\u2019 estranged relationship with Azure and past incidents of threatening behavior by Azure, Carson arranged to have a patrol officer periodically check on the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>\u00b66 At approximately 8:58 p.m., Great Falls City Police Officer, Steven Pre\u2019tat (Pre\u2019tat), responded to the call regarding the slashed tires. After Pre\u2019tat examined the tires, Lois showed him a note that Azure had written to her that read: \u201cTell me something or it could be bad. I love you. I don\u2019t want trouble.\u201d Pre\u2019tat looked for Azure\u2019s van in the area, but did not locate it. Pre\u2019tat informed Great Falls Police Officer Doug Otto (Otto) of the situation, and advised him to look for Azure in the area, since Otto was scheduled for the night shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b67 Shortly after 10:00 p.m., a neighbor who lived just down street from Lois\u2019 house observed Azure\u2019s van slowly drive up in front of her house without its lights on. The van was parked for about ten or fifteen minutes and then proceeded towards Lois\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b68 About this same time, police officer Otto came on shift and proceeded to check on Lois\u2019 residence. When he arrived, Otto observed Azure\u2019s van parked in front of Lois\u2019 house, but could not see anyone around the vehicle. The officer positioned his patrol car so he could observe the residence and turned his headlights off. While Otto was parking his patrol car, he heard a gunshot and saw a muzzle flash, and then immediately heard two more shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b69 At approximately 10:20, p.m., Lois was in the back bedroom when she heard John holler something about trouble, and as she ran towards the kitchen, she heard the first shot. Lois called to John but he did not respond. Lois grabbed a gun to try and protect herself, but while she was loading a shell, the gun jammed. Lois then heard another shot and hid behind some boxes in the dining room area. When Lois reached up to shut off the fights, she saw John lying in the kitchen, and then looked out of the window and saw Azure in his van with Otto\u2019s patrol car right behind it.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b610 After the shots, Otto called for back-up and then observed a man, later identified as Azure, get into the van and drive off. With his fights and siren activated, Otto pursued the van for several minutes, observing the van fail to stop at stop signs and stop fights. Other law enforcement officers joined the pursuit and at one point, threw a stop stick in front of Azure\u2019s van. Although the stick punctured a tire on the van, Azure continued to drive. Eventually Azure stopped his van at a local bar, where he got out and walked toward the bar. Azure was sprayed with pepper spay and then subdued by Otto and another officer. Otto then arrested Azure and Great Falls City Police Officer John Cathell (Cathell) advised him of his Miranda rights. Otto and Sergeant John Cameron (Cameron) testified that Azure did not appear agitated or emotionally upset at the time of his arrest. Cameron testified that when he looked inside Azure\u2019s van, he observed a bolt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>action rifle lying between the van\u2019s front seats.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b611 While Azure was being pursued, several Great Falls City Police officers and detectives responded to Lois\u2019 residence. Upon entering the house, officers observed John lying dead on the kitchen floor, with a massive gunshot wound to his left eye. His feet were underneath the kitchen sink kick board, and the officers observed one bullet hole in the kitchen window, which was positioned above the sink. According to Detective William Bellusci (Bellusci), John was standing in front of the kitchen window and leaning towards the sink when he was shot. The officers also observed two bullet holes in the dining room window.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b612 Two shell casings matching Azure\u2019s rifle were found on the lawn, while a third was found on the van\u2019s floor on the passenger\u2019s side. The rifle between the seats of Azure\u2019s van was a .270, and a partially full box of .270 ammunition was found in the van. The scope affixed to the rifle was set for close range, for shooting a distance of 25 to 30 feet. Detective Bellusci testified that when looking through a scope at a window that was lit up at night, the light would silhouette anything within the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b613 After his arrest, Otto transported Azure to the police department where he waited in a holding cell. Otto testified that Azure did not appear emotionally upset in the holding cell, nor did Otto observe anything unusual about Azure\u2019s behavior. While in the cell, Azure initiated a conversation with Cathell who informed Azure of his Miranda Rights again. However, Azure continued to converse with Cathell, stating, \u201cI\u2019m in the process of getting divorced right now and this is what this is all about.\u201d However, Azure also stated that he didn\u2019t remember anything, saying, \u201cThe only thing I remember is I\u2019m driving down the street and a bunch of cops behind me;\u201d but then asked, \u201cDid I run over somebody or what?\u201d Soon after, Azure states again that this all about the divorce, and adds, \u201cI went and got drunk. I don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d and then, \u201cI\u2019ll be sixty years old pretty soon, and I can\u2019t believe I did something like that.\u201d However, Azure again refers to hurting someone: \u201cBoy! I hope nobody got hurt. Shit! That would really bum me out if somebody got hurt. Did I get in a wreck or what?\u201d Finally, Azure also said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019d do something like this. And I don\u2019t even know what I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b614 Shortly after his last statement, while still in the holding cell, Azure complained of chest pain, but told the paramedics that he drank all night and added, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m having a heart attack.\u201d During the transportation to the hospital, Azure voluntarily told Officer Cathell, \u201cGod, I hope I didn\u2019t hurt anyone too bad. If I did, I hope I have a heart attack.\u201d Azure was treated and released and eventually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>transported to the County Jail. While being booked at the jail, Azure voluntarily said to the booking officer, several times, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I shot him.\u201d According to the officer, Azure blurted out, \u201cWhat makes a man shoot someone like I did?\u201d and \u201cAll of this happened because of the divorce.\u201d The booking officer testified that at the time he was being booked into the jail, Azure was aware that he was charged with deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b615 Azure claims that the statements he made in the holding cell were made after he was given a citation and told that he was charged with \u201cfirst degree homicide,\u201d and that his chest pains were related to finding out he was charged with killing John Cavill. Officer Cathell testified that when Azure was arrested at the bar, none of the officers told Azure that a person had been killed. According to Cathell, and verified by the contents of the videotape of Azure while he was in the holding cell, no one told Azure that John had died while Azure was in the holding cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b616 On February 27, 1997, Azure was charged by Information with the following Counts: (I) deliberate homicide of John Cavill; (II) attempted deliberate homicide of Lois Cavill; and (III) criminal mischief, a misdemeanor, for slashing the tires on two trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b617 At the trial in October of 1997, Azure testified he was severely depressed over the divorce and that he was under extreme emotional stress when he shot at the house. Azure explained that he had intended only to shoot out the windows, and that he did not know John was standing at the window when he fired the first shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b618 During the trial, witnesses characterized Azure as being depressed, under a lot of stress, and very withdrawn just prior to the shooting on February 13, 1997. A legal secretary for Azure\u2019s attorney testified that Azure did not want to get divorced, and was constantly crying when he was at his attorney\u2019s office. She also admitted that on February 12,1997, when she saw Azure, he told her he was drunk, and on February 13, the day of the shooting, she smelled alcohol on Azure when he came to sign the divorce papers at 10:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u00b619 Deborah Morris (Morris), Azure\u2019s daughter, testified that on the night of the shooting, Azure called her around 10:00 p.m. Azure was upset and crying and indicated he wished Lois would talk to him. Azure also told Morris he intended to kill himself, and that he wanted Fred, Lois\u2019 brother, to quit messing with him. When Azure called Morris back five minutes later, all he did was cry. During her testimony, the State questioned Morris about previous statements she made to Detective Bellusci concerning threats Azure made about Fred, but Morris denied making those statements. Azure denied ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>threatening Fred or John Cavill.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b620 James Donahue (Donahue), a Deputy County Attorney who handles involuntary commitments, testified that in January, 1997, Lois called him and relayed concerns she had about Azure\u2019s mental health and behavior. Donahue testified that he talked to Azure\u2019s daughter, Morris, about similar concerns, and that both women frequently called his office about the matter. Donahue explained he did not take any steps to have Azure committed because the information he received indicated Azure\u2019s problems were with alcohol, and the county attorney\u2019s office only handles commitments for people with psychiatric illness. Donahue never spoke with Azure personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b621 Azure testified that after being served divorce papers on January 6, 1997, he was very depressed and suicidal, and he drank a considerable amount during that day. He admitted breaking into the house and pointing a gun at Lois, but denied the gun was loaded, or that he intended to hurt Lois. He said he used the gun to make her talk to him, and admitted he told Lois he had one shell for her and one for him in the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b622 Azure also admitted he drove by the house several times on February 13, and that he punctured the two trucks\u2019 tires due to his frustration with the divorce. According to Azure, he returned to the house sifter 10:00 p.m. to see if Lois and John were gone so he could sleep in the house rather than in his van. Azure said that after parking his van kitty corner from the residence, he sat for about 10 or 15 minutes, watching the house and crying. He then drove up to the house and parked his van with the driver\u2019s side closest to the house.</p>\n<p id=\"AxEz\">\u00b623 Azure explained that he wanted to shoot out some windows in the house so it would be too cold for Lois and J ohn to stay there that night. In his mind, Azure thought if he could not stay in the house, Lois and John should not be able to either. Azure testified that when he got out of his van, the kitchen fight was on, but that he did not see John, nor was it his intention to shoot John. Azure testified that when he shot at the kitchen window he was approximately 20 or 25 feet away and that he was crying pretty hard and everything was blurry. He then shot twice at the dining room window, but it did not break. While walking toward the window to break it, Azure saw Officer Otto, and got into his van and left. Azure said he drove towards the river, because he wanted to kill himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b624 At the trial, Dr. Michael Scolatti (Scolatti), a clinical psychologist, testified as to Azure\u2019s psychological condition the night of the shooting. Scolatti testified that Azure did not develop the typical coping strategies that are developed during childhood, and explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Azure was clinically depressed for two months prior to the shooting, which was exacerbated when he would drink. According to Scolatti, Azure felt powerless and hopeless about his marriage ending, especially since he could not talk to Lois. The high level of stress and depression that Azure experienced, according to Scolatti, eroded his ability to make good decisions, think clearly, or concentrate on problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b625 Scolatti also diagnosed Azure with avoidant personality disorder, which relates to how a person interacts with others; in Azure\u2019s case it meant he felt inadequate and at fault for the divorce, while still holding out hope for reconciliation. According to Scolatti, factors such as Lois leaving, signing the divorce papers, and not being able to get into the house that night, were all \u201cprovocations\u201d to the shooting. Scolatti testified that in his opinion, Azure was under extreme emotional distress during the period of time leading up to the shooting that affected his ability to function and make sound decisions. Scolatti noted these factors as the main contributors: the divorce, and Azure\u2019s clinical depression, physical disability, and avoidant personality disorder. Scolatti stated that in his opinion, on the night of the shooting Azure could have acted purposely or knowingly, but that he did so under extreme emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b626 Dr. William Stratford (Stratford), a forensic psychiatrist, testified for the State as to Azure\u2019s emotional state the night of the shooting. Stratford testified that although Azure was acting under some stress at the time of the offense, in his opinion, Azure was not under extreme emotional stress. Stratford explained that in his opinion, Azure did not \u201csnap\u201d the night of the shooting, but rather there were certain behaviors and choices that led up to the events. Stratford testified that Azure met the criteria for alcoholism and some broad form of depression. Stratford also agreed that Azure was not suffering from any mental impairment that prevented him from acting purposely or knowingly at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b627 Following the trial, the jury convicted Azure on Counts I, deliberate homicide of John Cavill, and III, criminal mischief, but on Count II, found Azure guilty of the lesser offense, mitigated attempted deliberate homicide of Lois Cavill.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b628 On November 5, 1997, Azure filed a Motion for New Trial or Modified Verdict, wherein he argued in part that the guilty verdict of deliberate homicide was inconsistent with the reduced guilty verdict of mitigated attempted deliberate homicide. Following a hearing on December 8, 1997, and after considering the parties\u2019 briefs and arguments, the District Court denied Azure\u2019s motion for a new trial or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>modified verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b629 On December 9, 1997, Azure was sentenced to 110 years for deliberate homicide with the use of a weapon; 12 years for mitigated attempted deliberate homicide with the use of a weapon; and 6 months for criminal mischief, with all sentences to run consecutively. Azure\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b630 The standard of review that applies to a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for directed verdict in a criminal case is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Hall, </em>1999 MT 297, \u00b6 19, 297 Mont. 111, \u00b6 19, 991 P.2d 929, \u00b6 19 (citation omitted). We deem a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as a motion for a new trial made under \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, and our standard of review of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for new trial is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Bell </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 482, 485, 923 P.2d 524, 526 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AEs\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u00b631 May Azure\u2019s allegation of an unlawful jury impanelment be reviewed on direct appeal when no objection was raised at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">\u00b632 Azure claims that his jury impanelment was defective under <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, 298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204, wherein we held the clerk\u2019s procedure for impaneling the jury did not comply with Montana law, and remanded the case for a new trial. Azure argues that because he was tried two months after LaMere and in the same District, \u201cit was highly probable that Azure\u2019s jury was impanelled in the same illegal manner.\u201d Azure asks this Court to remand this case for fact-finding on this issue, since there was no record made as to how the jury was gathered.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">\u00b633 The State counters that Azure waived this claim for the purposes of appellate review when he failed to make a record of the procedure used to impanel the jury. The State argues it would be improper for this Court to remand for fact finding on the issue, noting it would undermine the rules regarding contemporaneous objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">\u00b634 Azure acknowledges his allegations of improper jury impanelment are raised for the first time on appeal. Failure to make a timely objection during trial constitutes a waiver of the objection except as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>provided in \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA. Section 46-20-104(2), MCA. However, Azure argues that under the plain error doctrine this Court has the discretion to review this issue since it concerns a manifest miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b635 In <em>LaMere, </em>we reversed the District Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to strike the jury panel after considering affidavits and statistical evidence which revealed the potential for bias in the jury selection technique used by the clerk of court. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-9. Based on the record before us, we concluded the process of using the telephone to summon prospective jurors into court did not comply with the statute governing impanelling of a trial jury, and therefore vacated LaMere\u2019s conviction and remanded the case for retrial. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 75-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b636 In <em>State v. Highpine, </em>2000 MT 368, 303 Mont. 422, 15 P.3d 938, and <em>State v. Lopez, </em>2001 MT 97, 305 Mont. 218, 26 P.3d 745, we applied our holding from <em>LaMere, </em>and found the district court in both cases erred by denying the defendants\u2019 motions to strike the jury panel. <em>See Highpine, </em>\u00b6 41 and <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17. In both cases, the record demonstrated the jury was summoned by telephone. See <em>Highpine, </em>\u00b6 39, and <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b637 Azure argues that the Clerk of the Eighth Judicial District Court, \u201ccommonly summoned [eligible jurors] to court by telephone,\u201d and that this impaneling procedure was the \u201cstandard practice in the Eighth Judicial District Court during 1997 and 1998.\u201d Azure also asserts the \u201ccourt knew the statutes were not being followed by the clerk of court</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b638 However, Azure cites to nothing in the record concerning the actual procedure used by the clerk in summoning the jury panel or any evidence of potential prejudice based on the method of summoning the jury. It is axiomatic that this Court will not consider \u201cevidence\u201d not contained in the record on appeal. <em>State v. Spina, </em>1999 MT 113, \u00b6 17, 294 Mont. 367, \u00b6 17, 982 P.2d 421, \u00b6 17 (citation omitted). Moreover, this Court\u2019s review of allegations on direct appeal is confined to the record. <em>State v. Henry </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 491, 496, 898 P.2d 1195, 1198 (citations omitted). <em>See also, State v. Mix </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 351, 361, 781 P.2d 751, 757 (citations omitted) (\u201cWe have long held to the principle that an appellate court in reaching its decision will only consider material ascertainable from the record.\u201d). Accordingly, we cannot simply rely on Azure\u2019s allegations of improper jury impanelment procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u00b639  Azure asks this Court to remand this case for a determination of what method the clerk of court used in summoning the jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>However, remanding for a hearing is not a proper remedy for an appeal on direct review, since an evidentiary hearing \u201ccan only be accomplished in a postconviction proceeding.\u201d <em>State v. Whitlow, </em>2001 MT 208, \u00b6 38, 306 Mont. 339, \u00b6 38, 33 P.3d 877, \u00b6 38 (Nelson, J., specially concurring and dissenting). <em>See also State v. St. John, </em>2001 MT 1, \u00b6 40, 304 Mont. 47, \u00b6 40, 15 P.3d 970, \u00b6 40, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, 308 Mont. 154, 41 P.3d 314 (when the record does not provide the basis for the challenged acts or omissions of counsel, a defendant\u2019s claim for ineffective assistance of counsel is more appropriately brought as a petition for posteonviction relief). Because we cannot determine from the record what procedure the clerk of court used in summoning the jury, we decline to review this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b640 Finally, we will not review Azure\u2019s claim pursuant to the plain error doctrine, as there is no record before us to determine whether an error occurred, let alone if the error met the criteria of the plain error doctrine under common law or \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b641 May Azure\u2019s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct be reviewed on appeal when no objection to the conduct was raised at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u00b642 Azure argues the State committed prosecutorial misconduct by introducing \u201cfalse evidence\u201d during the trial concerning threats Azure allegedly made toward Fred Cavill. Azure contends the State\u2019s introduction of testimony from Morris that Azure had made threats toward Fred Cavill was \u201cfalse evidence,\u201d since Morris denied telling the detective Azure had made the threat the night of the shooting. Azure argues the State again introduced this \u201cfalse evidence\u201d when it asked Azure about the statements, even though Azure said he did not remember making the statements. Significantly, Azure admits no objections to this \u201cfalse evidence\u201d were made during Morris\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"AHy\">\u00b643 The State contends nothing in the record indicated the State introduced false testimony or forced Azure to speculate as to statements he made about Fred Cavill. The State argues that Azure is precluded from raising this issue on direct appeal since he failed to make contemporaneous objections at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\u00b644 Specific objections must be made to portions of testimony deemed inappropriate. <em>State v. Courchene </em>(1992), 256 Mont. 381, 385, 847 P.2d 271, 273 (citation omitted). Failure to make a timely objection during trial constitutes a waiver of the objection except as provided in \u00a7 46-20-701(2). Section 46-20-104(2), MCA. \u201c[Wjhere a criminal defendant fails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>to make a contemporaneous objection to the prosecution\u2019s characterization of the facts during trial, this Court is precluded \u2018from addressing an issue under \u00a7 46-20-104(2), MCA, unless the criteria under \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, can he met or the comments create an exception under the plain error doctrine.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Stuit </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 176, 182, 885 P.2d 1290, 1294 (citation omitted). <em>See also State v. Rodgers </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 413, 419, 849 P.2d 1028, 1032 (citation omitted) (When the district court was not given an opportunity to rule on the admission of a statement or to correct itself if admission was not proper, \u201c[w]e will not put the trial court in error where it has not been given such a chance\u201d). For an objection to be contemporaneous and thus preserve an appeal, it must be \u201cmade at trial in a timely manner and upon specific grounds, which appear on the record, and which is made as soon as the ground for the objection becomes apparent.\u201d <em>Stuit, </em>268 Mont. at 182, 885 P.2d at 1294 (citations omitted). Azure did not object at any time to Morris\u2019 testimony on direct examination or to Azure\u2019s testimony on cross examination. Nor has Azure argued that the plain error doctrine should apply to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b645  Therefore, we conclude Azure waived his right to an appellate review of his claims regarding prosecutorial misconduct arising out of the statements Azure allegedly made to Morris.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b646 Did the District Court err when it denied Azure\u2019s motion for a modified verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b647 Azure argues that the District Court erred when it denied his motion for a modified verdict. Azure had asserted that the jury\u2019s verdict on deliberate homicide was logically and legally inconsistent with the verdict of mitigated attempted deliberate homicide. Azure contends that once the jury concluded Azure was acting under extreme stress at the time he shot at the dining room window, it had to likewise conclude that Azure was also under extreme stress when he shot at the kitchen window, seconds earlier, killing John. The State argues that this Court should not second-guess a jury verdict, and that inconsistencies are allowed in verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\u00b648  We have held that \u201cwhere separate acts are charged in an information, and each act is a separate offense, an acquittal or conviction of one or more counts does not affect the other counts.\u201d <em>State v. Sanderson </em>(1985), 214 Mont. 437, 451, 692 P.2d 479, 487 (citation omitted). In cases where the sufficiency of the evidence is considered, we will not substitute our judgment for that of the jury, which is \u201cable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>to view firsthand the evidence presented, observe the demeanor of the witnesses, and weigh the credibility of each party.\u201d <em>Sanderson, </em>214 Mont. at 452, 692 P.2d at 487. <em>See also, State v. Larson </em>(Minn. 1979), 281 N.W.2d 481, 487 (It is within the jury\u2019s prerogative to find a defendant guilty of four homicides, but find that he lost his ability to distinguish right from wrong when he fatally shot the last victim).</p>\n<p id=\"Akb\">\u00b649 Moreover, we will not attempt to ascertain what the jury actually determined. <em>See Dallas v. Arave </em>(9th Cir. 1993), 984 F.2d 292, 295. \u201cIf the circumstances reasonably justify the verdict, this Court must assume the existence of every fact which the jury reasonably could have deduced from all the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Doney </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 22, 33, 636 P.2d 1377, 1384 (citation omitted). Whether Azure acted under extreme emotional distress was a question of fact for the jury. <em>See State v. Sunday </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 292, 301, 609 P.2d 1188, 1194 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b650 A rational trier of fact could have found Azure was not under extreme emotional stress when he shot John Cavill, particularly if the jury concluded Azure could in fact see John in the window when he fired the shot. The evidence presented to the jury concerning Azure\u2019s emotional stressors predominantly revolved around his relationship with Lois-her leaving him, Azure not being able to talk to her, and the signing of the divorce papers. The jury could have reasonably concluded there was mitigation in Azure\u2019s acts toward Lois, but not in his actions toward John. After all, the jury heard evidence that Azure could in fact see John in the window prior to firing the first shot. They also heard Azure testify that the statements he made in the holding cell and his \u201cheart attack\u201d were the result of being told he was charged with \u201cfirst degree homicide;\u201d however, they also heard testimony that Azure was not informed of John\u2019s death at the time. The jury also viewed the tape of Azure in the holding cell, where he does not mention shooting any windows at all, and there is no discussion by either Azure or any officer as to why Azure was arrested. Further, Azure\u2019s statements on the holding cell tape oscillated between saying he did not know what happened to statements such as, \u201c I can\u2019t believe I\u2019d do something like this;\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m right in the middle of getting a divorce, this is what this is all about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b651  For a charge of deliberate homicide to be reduced to mitigated deliberate homicide, \u201cthe jury must be convinced by a preponderance of the evidence that such reduction is warranted, in accordance with \u00a7 45-5-103, MCA.\u201d <em>State v. Byers </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 17, 36, 861 P.2d 860, 872, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. </em>Egelhoff (1995), 272 Mont. 114, 900 P.2d 260 and <em>State v. Rothacher </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 303, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>901 P.2d 82. Section 45-5-103, MCA, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">(1) A person commits the offense of mitigated deliberate homicide when the person purposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being but does so under the influence of extreme mental or emotional stress <em>for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse. The reasonableness of the explanation or excuse must be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the actor\u2019s </em>situation. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b652 The jury could have logically concluded there was no reasonable explanation or excuse for Azure to shoot at John, while also concluding there was a reasonable explanation for Azure\u2019s actions towards Lois. Thus, we conclude the jury verdicts are not legally or logically inconsistent. Therefore, the District Court did not err when it denied Azure\u2019s motion for a modified verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b653 Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b242-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
