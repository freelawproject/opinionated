We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Whether the District Court erred in concluding that Officer Leasure had objective data from which he could form a particularized suspicion that Kleinsasser or an occupant of his vehicle was engaged in wrongdoing thus justifying an investigative stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">\u00b63 Many of the facts in this case are undisputed. On November 16, 1999, at approximately 9:48 p.m., Kleinsasser\u2019s vehicle was parallel parked in a legal manner, with its lights on, off the right side of the Vaughan Frontage Road outside Great Falls, Montana. Cascade County Sheriffs Deputy Troy Leasure, accompanied by Reserve Sheriffs Deputy Travis Palmer, was returning to Great Falls from Sun Prairie in his patrol car. Officers Leasure and Palmer came upon Kleinsasser\u2019s vehicle from behind. As they passed the vehicle, the officers observed a man standing beside the passenger door of the vehicle on the side furthest from the road. The man appeared to be urinating. Officer Palmer later testified that he observed a stream of fluid for a brief second, but the individual had taken steps so as not to expose himself to passers-by.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">\u00b64 Officer Leasure continued on for about one-half mile before deciding to turn around to warn the individual about the impropriety of his conduct or, as Officer Leasure later testified, \u201cto give him a good tongue lashing.\u201d Upon reaching the vehicle, there was no longer anyone standing near it. The officers observed that Kleinsasser was seated in the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle and that he was making a call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>on his cellular phone. They also observed that an individual was seated in the front passenger seat of the vehicle and another individual was lying down on the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b65 When Kleinsasser rolled down his driver\u2019s side window to speak to Officer Leasure, Officer Leasure noticed the odor of alcohol emanating from inside the vehicle. Officer Leasure questioned Kleinsasser and the other two men in the vehicle about the identity of the man who had been standing outside. All three denied standing by the vehicle and also denied knowing who had been doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b66 After further conversation, Officer Leasure asked Kleinsasser to exit the vehicle and observed that Kleinsasser had a hard time keeping his balance. Officer Leasure had Kleinsasser perform field sobriety tests, which Kleinsasser failed. Officer Leasure requested Kleinsasser take a preliminary breath test, which Kleinsasser refused. Consequently, Officer Leasure arrested Kleinsasser for driving under the influence of alcohol. After the officers transported Kleinsasser to the detention center, Kleinsasser once again refused to provide a breath sample and his driver\u2019s license was seized and suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b67 Kleinsasser challenged the license suspension pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA, asserting that Officer Leasure illegally seized his license. Discovery ensued and the depositions of Officers Leasure and Palmer were filed. Officers Leasure and Palmer also testified at the June 30, 2000 hearing on Kleinsasser\u2019s petition challenging the suspension. Thereafter, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order denying Kleinsasser\u2019s petition. Kleinsasser appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\u00b68 <em>Whether the District Court erred in concluding that Officer Leasure had objective data from which he could form a particularized suspicion that Kleinsasser or an occupant of his vehicle was engaged in wrongdoing thus justifying an investigative stop.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact on the denial of a petition for reinstatement of a driver\u2019s license to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Anderson v. State, Dept. of Justice </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 259, 262, 912 P.2d 212, 214 (citing <em>Bauer v. State </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 119, 122, 910 P.2d 886, 888). We then review the court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Anderson, </em>275 Mont. at 262, 912 P.2d at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">\u00b610  \u201cBecause a presumption of correctness attaches to the State\u2019s act of suspending or revoking a driver\u2019s license, the driver bears the burden of proving that the suspension or revocation of a driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>license was improper.\u201d <em>Hulse v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 14, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 14, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 14 (citing <em>Jess v. State Dept. of Justice </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 254, 259-60, 841 P.2d 1137, 1140 overruled on other grounds by <em>Bush v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 270, 291 Mont. 359, 968 P.2d 716). Furthermore, a district court may consider only a limited number of issues in a driver\u2019s license reinstatement proceeding. Section 61-8-403(4)(a) &amp; (b), MCA. Insofar as is relevant in the present case, the only issue under consideration was whether Officer Leasure \u201chad reasonable grounds to believe\u201d that Kleinsasser \u201chad been driving or was in actual physical control of a vehicle upon ways of this state open to the public while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of the two.\u201d Section 61-8-403(4)(a)(i), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b611 The \u201creasonable grounds\u201d requirement contained in \u00a7 61-8-403(4)(a)(i), MCA, is the equivalent of \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d as defined in \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>Seyferth v. State, Dept. of Justice </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 377, 384, 922 P.2d 494, 498; <em>Anderson, </em>275 Mont. at 263, 912 P.2d at 214). Section 46-5-401, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">Investigative stop. In order to obtain or verify an account of the person\u2019s presence or conduct orto determine whether to arrest the person, a peace officer may stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that <em>the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abc\">\u00b612 This statute was amended in 1991 to reflect our holding in <em>State v. Gopher </em>(1981), 193 Mont. 189, 631 P.2d 293, wherein we adopted the two-part test enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Cortez </em>(1981), 449 U.S. 411, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621, to evaluate whether a law enforcement officer has sufficient cause or a \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d to stop a person. We held in <em>Gopher </em>that in asserting that a law enforcement officer had the particularized suspicion to make an investigatory stop, the State has the burden to show: (1) objective data from which an experienced officer can make certain inferences; and (2) a resulting suspicion that the occupant of a certain vehicle is or has been engaged in wrongdoing or was a witness to criminal activity. <em>Gopher, </em>193 Mont. at 194, 631 P.2d at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b613 A determination of whether particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact dependent on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>Anderson, </em>275 Mont. at 263, 912 P.2d at 214; <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 46, 50, 899 P.2d 540, 542-43). \u201cIn evaluating the totality of the circumstances, a court should consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the quantity, or content, and quality, or degree of reliability, of the information available to the officer.\u201d <em>State v. Pratt </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 156, 161, 951 P.2d 37, 40 (citing <em>Alabama v. White </em>(1990), 496 U.S. 325, 330, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2416, 110 L.Ed.2d 301). When the totality of the circumstances does not support a particularized suspicion, the investigatory stop is not justified. <em>Reynolds, </em>272 Mont. at 50, 899 P.2d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b614 Kleinsasser asserts that an investigative stop of his vehicle was not justified in this case because the officers lacked sufficient data from which they could conclude that the person they observed on the side of the road was an occupant of Kleinsasser\u2019s vehicle. Both officers testified that they did not observe anyone entering or exiting Kleinsasser\u2019s vehicle at any time. The officers merely observed that there was an individual on the side of the road when they originally proceeded past Kleinsasser\u2019s vehicle and that upon returning to that location, the individual that the officers had observed earlier was no longer there. The officers assumed that this individual was an occupant of Kleinsasser\u2019s vehicle, yet they were unable to determine which of the occupants of the vehicle, if any, was the individual they had observed on the side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b615 Kleinsasser also argues that to justify an investigative stop under \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA, the facts must demonstrate that the observed behavior was a violation of the laws of Montana. To that end, the State argues that the observed behavior was a violation of \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA, the statute defining disorderly conduct. Section 45-8-101, MCA, provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">Disorderly conduct. (1) A person commits the offense of disorderly conduct if he knowingly disturbs the peace by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">(i) <em>creating a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act that serves no legitimate </em>purpose;... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avns\">\u00b616 First, we agree with Kleinsasser\u2019s assertion that this behavior did not create a hazardous condition. Despite the State\u2019s allegation that a driver passing by the area may have been distracted by the activities of the individual on the roadside, any possible distraction would be minimal given the time of night and the steps taken by the individual to conceal himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\u00b617 Second, we disagree with the State\u2019s assertion that the act served no legitimate purpose. It is hard to imagine any act which serves a more legitimate purpose than to have to answer nature\u2019s call. Unfortunately, it sometimes happens that that call comes at a time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>when we are far removed from the proper facilities. Officer Leasure himself testified that he had, on occasion, been placed in the same position and that he was forced to act in the same manner as the individual here.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b618 Third, while the act may be physically offensive to many, Officer Leasure testified that where the act is performed would play a large part in whether or not it was illegal. The State points to two cases wherein the individuals involved were cited for disorderly conduct for urinating in public. In the first case, the individual was cited for urinating in the 1800 block of Tenth Avenue South within the Great Falls city limits, near a busy, well-lighted street. In the second case, the individual was cited for urinating on a bench in the Cascade County Adult Detention Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b619 The Criminal Law Commission (CLC) comments to \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA, provide the following analysis of the conduct comprising a violation of this statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">The crime of disorderly conduct appears to be directed at curtailing that kind of behavior which disrupts and disturbs the peace and quiet of the community by various kinds of annoyances. These acts standing alone may not be criminal under other categories such as theft, or assault and battery, or libel, etc. The difficulty is in defining the conduct which falls within these objectives, <em>for a given act under some circumstances is not objectionable, while under others it is. </em>Thus sounding a horn at a carnival is not objectionable. But sounding it at midnight in a residential section might be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">The intent of the provision is to use somewhat broad, general terms to establish a foundation for the offense and leave the application to the facts of a particular case. Two important qualifications are specified in making the application, however. First, the offender must knowingly make a disturbance of the enumerated kind, and <em>second, the behavior must disturb \u201cothers.\u201d It is not sufficient that a single person or a very few persons have grounds for complaint. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Unlike the facts in the case before us on appeal, in both of the cases relied upon by the State the behavior was done in very public places and could conceivably be considered to have disturbed \u201cothers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">\u00b620 Indeed, our review of the CLC comments to \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA, leads us to conclude that when a Big Sky motorist is faced with the burning question: \u201cTo pee, or not to pee,\u201d the answer must depend upon the place, time of day, traffic, and other circumstances. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>wrong answer-dictated though it may be by a need subordinate only to drawing one\u2019s next breath-may turn a legitimate act into a criminal one.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b621 In the present case, the incident occurred in the dark of the night, in a rural location where, as Officer Palmer testified, there were no overhead lights of any kind and there was no other traffic around at the time. Moreover, there was no evidence that the behavior disturbed anyone other than Officers Leasure and Palmer, and neither officer was so disturbed by the behavior that they considered giving the individual a citation. In fact, Officer Palmer testified that he observed nothing of an illegal nature that required immediate attention and Officer Leasure testified that, even though he turned his patrol car around to return to the scene, he had no intention to investigate any illegal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b622  Therefore, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s determination that the initial stop of Kleinsasser\u2019s vehicle was justified by particular suspicion is not supported by substantial evidence and is clearly erroneous. Because Officer Leasure did not have particularized suspicion to justify an investigative stop of Kleinsasser\u2019s vehicle, the subsequent seizure of Kleinsasser\u2019s driver\u2019s license was invalid. Thus, we hold that the District Court erred in denying Kleinsasser\u2019s petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b623 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b359-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b359-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Amh\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">\u00b624 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion which, in my view, turns \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d on its head by requiring law enforcement officers to <em>know, </em>both in fact and under the law, that an offense has been committed prior to making an investigative stop. I cannot agree, and I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">\u00b625 Notwithstanding that the ultimate issue in the District Court was whether Officer Leasure had particularized suspicion or reasonable grounds to believe Kleinsasser had been driving or was in physical control of a vehicle upon a public way while under the influence of alcohol, the dispositive question in both that court and on appeal is whether Officer Leasure had a particularized suspicion to make an investigatory stop of Kleinsasser\u2019s vehicle in the first instance. The trial court found that he did and that, having properly returned to the vehicle, subsequent events properly gave rise to Kleinsasser\u2019s arrest for DUI and the State\u2019s revocation of his driver\u2019s license. Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>applicable statute and our case law, it is my view that the District Court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b626 I join the Court in focusing first on the portion of \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA, which authorizes an officer to stop a person or vehicle observed in circumstances creating a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed or is committing an offense. I also join in the Court\u2019s statement of our two-part test for particularized suspicion, which requires the State to show objective data from which an experienced officer can make certain inferences and a resulting suspicion that the occupant of a vehicle is or has been engaged in wrongdoing. <em>See Gopher, </em>193 Mont. at 194, 631 P.2d at 296. Moreover, it is important to recognize that the particularized suspicion necessary for an investigative stop is a less stringent standard to meet than the probable cause standard <em>(see State v. Williamson, </em>1998 MT 199, \u00b6 12, 290 Mont. 321, \u00b6 12, 965 P.2d 231, \u00b6 12 (citation omitted)). In turn, of course, probable cause is a lesser standard than the State\u2019s beyond a reasonable doubt burden in proving that a criminal offense was committed. Unfortunately, the Court fails to properly apply these principles in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b627 Instead, the Court begins by suggesting, but not concluding, that the officers lacked sufficient objective data from which to conclude that the person they observed on the side of the road was an occupant of Kleinsasser\u2019s vehicle. To the extent this section of the Court\u2019s opinion is intended to buttress the Court\u2019s later discussion and conclusions, I submit it is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b628 First, it is undisputed that the person the officers observed was urinating behind or beside the door of Kleinsasser\u2019s vehicle. Second, there is no suggestion that other persons were in the vicinity on foot at approximately 9:30 in the evening; nor does the record reflect the existence of another parked vehicle nearby from which the person at issue could have exited and re-entered after urinating beside Kleinsasser\u2019s vehicle. Third, the time lapse between the officers\u2019 observations and their return to the vehicle was minimal. The fact that the person was no longer outside the vehicle in the location where the urinating occurred does not negate the objective data that a man was observed urinating immediately next to the Kleinsasser vehicle, especially in fight of the fact that there were three males in the vehicle upon the officers\u2019 arrival there. Finally, in this regard, the Court\u2019s reliance on the fact that the officers were unable to identify one of the occupants of the vehicle as the urinater, after the \u201cstop\u201d occurred and because the occupants simply denied having committed that act, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>totally improper. The question is whether objective data existed <em>prior </em>to the stop upon which the officers reasonably relied in making contact with the occupants of the vehicle. Under the circumstances here, it clearly did.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b629 More important, however, and far more dangerous for the future of law enforcement\u2019s ability to protect Montanans, is the Court\u2019s implicit adoption of Kleinsasser\u2019s argument that the \u201cfacts\u201d must \u201cdemonstrate\u201d that the observed behavior was a violation of the law before an investigative stop can be justified. The question of whether an offense occurred is not for this Court or the District Court to resolve in the context of a proceeding over a driver\u2019s license suspension. If an offense is charged, that question is for the finder of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b630 The question before us here is whether urinating beside a road or in any other, public place can constitute the criminal offense of disorderly conduct. The Court determines that it can, and I agree. Having so concluded, it is my opinion that the particularized suspicion issue is largely resolved. Based on their personal observations and the inferences properly drawn therefrom, the officers had a particularized suspicion that an occupant of Kleinsasser\u2019s vehicle had committed the offense of disorderly conduct. Nothing more was required to make the stop of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b631 Particularized suspicion does not turn on whether a charge is subsequently filed or on whether the State could prove beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal trial that, given the time, place and circumstances, the offense had been committed. In that regard, the Court\u2019s reliance on the comments of the Criminal Law Commission to the statute defining the offense of disorderly conduct have no relevance here; those comments go to matters concerning charging and proving the offense. Thus, the questions on which the Court focuses-whether an occupant of the Kleinsasser vehicle actually created a physically offensive condition that served no legitimate purpose-have no place in our consideration of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u00b632 We all agree that urinating in a public place can constitute the criminal offense of disorderly conduct. Because the officers observed such conduct in this case, I would conclude that the District Court properly determined the officers had a particularized suspicion to stop the Kleinsasser vehicle on the basis that an occupant had committed a criminal offense. While it is easy to be amused over the \u201cto pee or not to pee\u201d language used by the Court and, as a result, to underestimate the consequences of the Court\u2019s decision here, I am greatly concerned about where the Court\u2019s holding in this case will lead us, that is, what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>effect it will have on law enforcement\u2019s ability to make investigatory stops in future cases involving particularized suspicion that <em>other </em>offenses are being or have been committed. If a law enforcement officer must be able to <em>prove </em>that an offense has been committed before making an investigative stop, the applicable statute has been judicially repealed and <em>Gopher </em>has been effectively overruled. I simply cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b633 I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
