He was sentenced to five years at Montana State Prison and designated a persistent felony offender. From this judgment Paul appeals. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">\u00b62 Paul raises several issues which we have restated for clarity as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">\u00b63 1. Whether one of the jurors at Paul\u2019s trial should have been removed for cause for expressing doubt about her ability to remain impartial while deciding Paul\u2019s case and whether Paul was prejudiced by the failure to remove this juror from the final jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">\u00b64 2. Whether defense counsel rendered deficient performance during jury selection for not removing a juror, whom he had challenged for cause, for expressing concern over whether she could remain impartial and whether Paul was prejudiced by the failure to remove this juror from the final jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court violated Paul\u2019s constitutional right to appear in all criminal proceedings against him when the court excluded Paul from the in-chambers individual <em>voir dire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">\u00b66 4. Whether Paul\u2019s right to a fair trial was prejudiced by a law enforcement officer\u2019s testimony, based on out-of-court statements made by the victim, that Paul threatened to throw the victim into the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\u00b67 5. Whether the State and the District Court improperly shifted the burden of proof to Paul when the State demanded to know why a witness had not been subpoenaed and the court ordered Paul to call the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b68 6. Whether defense counsel rendered deficient performance when he opened the door to testimony about alleged prior incidences of domestic violence between Paul and the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b69 Because we determine that Issue 3 is dispositive, we do not address Paul\u2019s remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b610 On February 28, 2000, the State charged Paul with partner or family member assault, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA. The charge stemmed from an argument that ensued between Paul and his girlfriend Angela on the night of February 8,2000. Angela had thrown away some letters that belonged to Paul and Paul became angry. Angela later testified that during the argument, Paul called her names and threatened to kill her. She also testified that he hit her in the head and stomach approximately nine times and that whenever she tried to leave, he would \u201cslam\u201d her back down.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">\u00b611 On June 20, 2000, the State filed a notice of intent to introduce evidence of Paul\u2019s three prior convictions for domestic abuse. Defense counsel filed a motion and brief objecting to the introduction of this evidence. The District Court ordered that the State could not use any evidence of Paul\u2019s prior domestic abuse convictions in its case in chief. However, the court did allow the State to reserve the right to use this evidence on rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\u00b612 At trial, before <em>voir dire </em>began, the District Court granted the State\u2019s motion to conduct individual <em>voir dire </em>in chambers of any prospective juror who had personal experiences with domestic violence. During the State\u2019s <em>voir dire, </em>several prospective jurors raised their hands indicating that they had had such personal experiences. The court recessed to meet with these prospective jurors individually in chambers. Both the prosecutor and defense counsel were in attendance, however, Paul was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">\u00b613 During the in-chambers <em>voir dire, </em>one prospective juror explained that she had been an emergency room nurse and had dealt with people who had been battered. When asked if she could be impartial in this case, she responded that \u201cthere might be some latent anger things that I\u2019m not sure about that might come up. I don\u2019t know.\u201d After a continued discussion along these lines, defense counsel challenged this juror for cause, but the court denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u00b614 Subsequently, of the nine prospective jurors questioned in chambers, six were removed for cause. After the seats of the removed jurors were filled with new jurors and after further <em>voir dire, </em>two additional jurors raised their hands wanting to speak privately. The court recessed stating, \u201cI\u2019ll see everybody, including the two jurors that raised their hands in chambers. I mean everybody meaning counsel.\u201d Paul was again excluded from the in-chambers <em>voir dire. </em>Both of these jurors were removed for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b6 15 After both attorneys passed the panel for cause, the court recessed and met with counsel in chambers to allow counsel to exercise their peremptory challenges. Once again, Paul was not included in the in-chambers meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b616 Before defense counsel exercised his final peremptory challenge, he stated \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anybody really bad left.\u201d Defense counsel then used his final peremptory challenge to remove someone other than the emergency room nurse who had expressed anger over domestic violence cases even though defense counsel had earlier challenged her for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b617 At the close of this in-chambers meeting, the prosecutor stated: \u201cI just noticed the defendant wasn\u2019t in here, did we need to have him here?\u201d The court responded, \u201cI assume you wanted to waive his presence.\u201d To which Paul\u2019s counsel agreed, \u201cThat is fine. I asked him if he had any feelings about it one way or the other and he didn\u2019t....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AkK\">\u00b618 Once trial began, Angela testified that she was afraid of Paul and that she could not call the police regarding the incident until the following day when Paul dropped her off at a job interview. Billings police officer Phillip Hageman, who had responded to Angela\u2019s call, testified that Angela told him that Paul had threatened to kill her by throwing her into the river. However, Angela admitted that she had no physical injuries from the incident and she declined any medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u00b619 Following the State\u2019s case in chief, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict but the court denied the motion. Paul then testified in his own behalf. He admitted that he and Angela had argued over the letters, but he denied hitting Angela or refusing to allow her to leave. On cross-examination, in response to Paul\u2019s testimony that his cousin John had been present during the argument, the State inquired why Paul had not asked John to testify. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial arguing that the State was attempting to shift the burden of proof to Paul. The court denied defense counsel\u2019s motion and subsequently ordered defense counsel to call John as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\u00b620 John was living in the house with Paul and Angela and was at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>home at the time of this incident. John testified that although he had heard Angela and Paul in a heated argument, he did not see any physical violence between the two. Moreover, the day following the incident, John accompanied Paul and Angela while they did errands. John testified that Angela seemed her usual self and that she did not seem upset. In rebuttal, Angela was allowed to testify, over defense counsel\u2019s objections, about two prior occasions in which Paul had allegedly assaulted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b621 The jury found Paul guilty and on October 18, 2000, the District Court sentenced Paul to five years in Montana State Prison and designated him a persistent felony offender. Paul appeals his judgment and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b622 <em>Whether the District Court violated Paul\u2019s constitutional right to appear in all criminal proceedings against him when the court excluded Paul from the in-chambers individual voir dire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b623 The federal constitutional right to be present at all criminal proceedings is one of the most basic rights contained in the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Illinois v. Allen </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 337, 338, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 1058, 25 L.Ed.2d 353. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s right to be present at all proceedings... which may take his life or liberty is designed to safeguard the public\u2019s interest in a fair and orderly judicial system.\u201d <em>Sturgis v. Goldsmith </em>(9th Cir. 1986), 796 F.2d 1103, 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\u00b624 In Montana, the right of a criminal defendant to be present at his trial is expressly guaranteed by the Montana Constitution: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to appear and defend in person and by counsel....\u201d Art. II, Sec. 24, Mont.Const.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">\u00b625 Since the right to appear and defend in person is found within Montana\u2019s Declaration of Rights, it is a fundamental right. A right is \u201cfundamental\u201d under Montana\u2019s Constitution if the right is either found in the Declaration of Rights or is a right \u201cwithout which other constitutionally guaranteed rights would have little meaning.\u201d <em>Butte Community Union v. Lewis </em>(1986), 219 Mont. 426, 430, 712 P.2d 1309, 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">\u00b626 This Court recognized as early as 1922, when interpreting an identical provision of the 1889 Montana Constitution, that \u201cthe defendant must be present throughout the <em>entire </em>trial.\u201d <em>State v. Reed </em>(1922), 65 Mont. 51, 56, 210 P. 756, 757 (emphasis added). The Court stated in <em>Reed:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">No principle of law, relating to criminal procedure, is better <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>settled than that, in felony cases, nothing should be done in the absence of the prisoner. It is his unquestioned right \u201cto be confronted with his accusers and witnesses.\u201d He has the legal right to be present when the jury are hearing his case, and at all times during the proceeding of the trial, when anything is done which in any manner affects his right....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><em>Reed, </em>65 Mont. 51, 58, 210 P. 756, 758 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b627 Numerous other jurisdictions have also held that the exclusion of a criminal defendant from <em>voir dire </em>is reversible error. <em>See, for example, United States v. Alikpo </em>(5th Cir. 1991), 944 F.2d 206 (\u201cthe defendant is sorely handicapped and can be of little assistance to counsel when he has not had the opportunity to hear the venire\u2019s responses to questions and observe their reactions to him and to the proceedings\u201d); <em>State v. Garcia-Contreras </em>(Ariz. 1998), 953 P.2d 536 (holding that it was error to force defendant to choose between participating in <em>voir dire </em>in his prison attire or not being present for <em>voir dire); State v. Harris </em>(Wis.Ct.App. 1999), 601 N.W.2d 682 (\u201cthe interplay between potential jurors and a defendant, while often subtle, is both immediate and continuous\u201d and the jurors \u201cgesture and attitudes\u201d must be scrutinized to ensure impartiality and \u201cno transcript can recapture the atmosphere of the <em>voir dire\u201d); State v. Dishon </em>(N.J. Super.Ct.App.Div. 1997), 687 A.2d 1074 (defendant\u2019s presence during jury impaneling is essential so that he can assist his attorney in the selection of an impartial jury. \u201cHe is entitled to hear questions intended to disclose a juror\u2019s bias, hostility or predisposition to believe or discredit the testimony of potential witnesses, and the juror\u2019s answers so that he has the opportunity to assess the juror\u2019s facial expressions and demeanor.\u201d); <em>People v. Bennett </em>(Ill.App.Ct.1996), 669 N.E.2d 717 (defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were violated when defendant excluded from individual <em>voir dire </em>proceedings); <em>People v. Sloan </em>(N.Y. 1992), 592 N.E.2d 784 (defendant had fundamental right to be present during <em>voir dire </em>questioning as the questions \u201cdelved into attitudes and feelings concerning some of the events and witnesses involved in the very case to be heard\u201d); <em>Boone v. United States </em>(D.C. 1984), 483 A.2d 1135 (defendant entitled to be personally present during individual bench conference <em>voir dire </em>proceedings because it would be \u201cimprobable to expect a lawyer to.be able to relate those impressions gained at the bench to his client. Each impression is, at bottom, a personal one.\u201d); <em>State v. Carver </em>(Idaho 1972), 496 P.2d 676 (a defendant\u2019s presence at <em>voir dire </em>is crucial and having the accused present insures that he has first hand knowledge of the actions taken which lead to the eventual outcome of the trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u00b628 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the in-chambers <em>voir dire </em>was conducted specifically to elicit prospective jurors\u2019 personal feelings and experiences regarding domestic violence. Since Paul was excluded from the in-chambers <em>voir dire, </em>he never heard those prospective jurors responses. In particular, he did not have the opportunity to hear the emergency room nurse explain her biases in seeing repeat incidences of domestic violence. This prevented Paul from knowing about her prejudices and from insisting that defense counsel strike her with a peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b629 The State contends that Paul waived his right to be present during the in-chambers individual <em>voir dire </em>as evidenced by defense counsel\u2019s statement that Paul did not have any feelings one way or the other about being present. The State also contends that when the prosecutor raised the issue of Paul\u2019s absence, defense counsel had the opportunity to object to Paul\u2019s absence or secure his presence, but defense counsel failed to do either.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b630 The State has confused the procedural process of exercising peremptory strikes with the substantive process of <em>voir dire. </em>The colloquy referred to by the State occurred after the in-chambers individual <em>voir dire </em>and at the conclusion of the in-chambers meeting to exercise peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b631 This Court has recognized the difference between the <em>voir dire </em>process and peremptory challenge proceedings. \u201c[T]he act of the peremptory challenge of jurors is a pro forma execution of the decisions formulated during questioning.\u201d <em>State v. Hart </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 375, 392, 625 P.2d 21, 30, <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 827, 102 S.Ct. 119, 70 L.Ed.2d 102. While it is not reversible error for a defendant to not be personally, present during the peremptory challenge proceedings, a defendant\u2019s presence may be crucial during <em>voir dire. Hart, </em>191 Mont. at 392, 625 P.2d at 30. In the case before us on appeal, defense counsel indicated that Paul did not want to be present during the act of the peremptory challenges of the jurors, however, this did not constitute a waiver of Paul\u2019s constitutional right to be present during the in-chambers individual <em>voir dire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b632 The State argues that Paul\u2019s absence from the in-chambers individual <em>voir dire </em>did not result from any exclusionary action by the District Court, but was instead done with the full cooperation of defense counsel. The State maintains that by failing to object to the trial court ordering only counsel into the individual <em>voir dire, </em>defense counsel waived Paul\u2019s right to be personally present.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\u00b633 The State relies on <em>United States v. Gagnon </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 522, 529, 105 S.Ct. 1482, 1486, 84 L.Ed.2d 486, for the proposition that if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>defendant is entitled to attend certain stages of the trial which do not take place in open court, the defendant or his counsel must assert that right at the time. In <em>Gagnon, </em>the defendants did not expressly waive their right to be present in the in-chambers <em>voir dire. </em>Nevertheless, the Supreme Court held that the defendants\u2019 total failure to assert their rights to attend the conference with the juror sufficed to waive their rights. <em>Gagnon, </em>420 U.S. at 529, 105 S.Ct. at 1486.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b634 However, unlike the case before us on appeal, <em>Gagnon </em>did not involve a defendant\u2019s right to be personally present during a critical stage of the trial. In <em>Gagnon, </em>the trial judge held an in-camera hearing, attended by Gagnon\u2019s counsel, to assess a juror\u2019s concern on observing Gagnon sketching portraits of the jury. The Supreme Court characterized the inquiry as a \u201cminor occurrence\u201d and held that Gagnon\u2019s constitutional rights had not been violated by his nonappearance at a non-crucial stage of the proceedings. <em>Gagnon, </em>470 U.S. at 527, 105 S.Ct. at 1484-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b635 The State also argues that even if this Court finds that the record is insufficient to show an express waiver, Paul had ample opportunity to object to his absence from the in-chambers <em>voir dire, </em>but he failed to do so. \u201cWaiver is defined as the voluntary abandonment of a <em>known </em>right.\u201d <em>State v. Musgrove </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 162, 170, 582 P.2d 1246, 1251 (emphasis added) (citing 28 Am. Jur.2d 836, Estoppel and Waiver, Part 2, \u00a7 154). <em>See also Welsh v. Great Falls </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 403, 411, 690 P.2d 406, 411. This Court will not engage in presumptions of waiver; any waiver of one\u2019s constitutional rights must be made specifically, voluntarily, and knowingly. <em>Park v. Sixth Jud. Dist. Court, </em>1998 MT 164, \u00b6 36, 289 Mont. 367, \u00b6 36, 961 P.2d 1267, \u00b6 36 (citing <em>Johnson v. Zerbst </em>(1938), 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461; <em>State Lucero </em>(1968), 151 Mont. 531, 538, 445 P.2d 731, 735).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b636  Before a defendant can waive a fundamental right, \u201csuch waiver, to be recognized by the courts, must be informed and intelligent for there can be no waiver by one who does not know his rights or what he is waiving.\u201d <em>State v. Allison </em>(1944), 116 Mont. 352, 360, 153 P.2d 141, 145. In holding that the defendant in <em>Allison </em>had not expressly waived his right to remain silent, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">The rights guaranteed by the Constitution apply to all alike-the well-informed who know their rights as well as to the ignorant who never heard of such rights. There stands the right like the rock of Gibraltar and it so remains protecting the life and liberty of every person whether the particular person knows about it or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Allison, </em>116 Mont. at 360, 153 P.2d at 144-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b637  In the instant case, neither the trial court, the prosecutor, or defense counsel informed Paul that he had a constitutional right to be present dining the individual questioning of the jurors. Nor did the court give Paul the opportunity to choose to participate in the individual <em>voir dire. </em>Therefore, not only did Paul not voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly waive his right to be present, he was never afforded the opportunity to waive that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b638  Consequently, we hold that in the future, a trial court must explain to the defendant, on the record, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of the trial, including in-chambers individual <em>voir dire, </em>and that if a defendant chooses to waive that right, the court must obtain an on-the-record personal waiver by the defendant acknowledging that the defendant voluntarily, intelligently and knowingly waives that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u00b639 In <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, \u00b6 26, 298 Mont. 358, \u00b6 26, 2 P.3d 204, \u00b6 26, this Court explained how errors involving jury selection \u201cindelibly affect the fairness of the trial\u201d since those errors occur before trial. We identified in <em>LaMere </em>that jury selection errors are \u201cstructural\u201d errors and as such, they are not amenable to harmless error review. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 39-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u00b640  Paul\u2019s exclusion from the in-chambers individual <em>voir dire </em>proceedings was structural error and as such it undermined the integrity of the entire trial. Therefore, we reverse Paul\u2019s conviction and sentence and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\u00b641 That said, the dissent has raised several contentions that deserve a response. First, the dissent maintains that before the commencement of the trial in this matter, Paul was given notice of the State\u2019s intention to conduct individual <em>voir dire </em>with certain prospective jurors. However, the transcript in this matter gives no indication that Paul was present during the pre-trial proceeding in which the State requested permission from the court to conduct individual <em>voir dire. </em>The dissent also maintains that this procedure was no surprise to the defense and that the defense had \u201cample notice and opportunity to prepare for this eventuality.\u201d In reality, the State\u2019s request to conduct <em>voir dire </em>in this manner occurred only seconds before <em>voir dire </em>began-hardly \u201cample notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">\u00b642 Second, it does not appear that Paul was aware that he had a right to be present during the in-chambers individual <em>voir dire. </em>Certainly the court\u2019s pronouncement prior to each individual <em>voir dire </em>session would have given Paul the impression that he did not have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>right to be present. For instance, before the first individual <em>voir dire </em>session, the court commanded: \u201cAnd at this time, those five people, counsel, and the Court will visit [] in my chambers.\u201d By the same token, before the second individual <em>voir dire </em>session, the court more particularly commanded: \u201cI\u2019ll see everybody, including the two jurors that raised their hands in chambers. I mean everybody meaning counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u00b643 Third, the dissent asserts that after the State questioned the court about Paul\u2019s absence from the process, defense counsel informed the court that he had discussed it with Paul and that Paul\u2019s absence was not a problem. However, as we discussed earlier in this Opinion, this discussion did not occur until the tail-end of the in-chambers meeting to exercise peremptory challenges, well after both individual <em>voir dire </em>sessions had taken place. The dissent is mistaken in assuming that defense counsel\u2019s waiver of Paul\u2019s right to be present during the in-chambers meeting to exercise peremptory challenges also encompassed a waiver of Paul\u2019s right to be present during the two previous individual <em>voir dire </em>sessions. Clearly defense counsel was referring only to the situation at hand-the in-chambers meeting to exercise peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b644 Fourth, the dissent takes exception to our reliance on <em>Allison </em>stating that the Court in <em>Allison </em>required an express waiver of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights only because the defendant was not represented by counsel. While the dissent is correct that the defendant in <em>Allison </em>was not represented by counsel during one part of the process, that fact does not change the central ruling of <em>Allison </em>that to be recognized by the courts, the waiver of a fundamental right \u201cmust be informed and intelligent.\u201d <em>Allison, </em>116 Mont. at 360, 153 P.2d at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b645 Fifth, the dissent expresses its agreement with <em>United States v. Corcoran </em>(2d Cir. 1996), 100 F.3d 944, <em>cert denied, </em>517 U.S. 1228, 116 S.Ct. 1864, 134 L.Ed.2d 962, an unpublished disposition wherein the Second Circuit Court of Appeals adopted the holding of an earlier opinion by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. In that case, <em>United States v. Corcoran </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1994), 855 F. Supp. 1359, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the basis that defense counsel\u2019s waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to be present at a side-bar conference with a prospective juror was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"Akj\">\u00b646 Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion that <em>Corcoran </em>supports its position, the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Corcoran </em>is more supportive of the position expressed in this Opinion. In the first place, the court in <em>Corcoran </em>relied in part on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>in <em>Gagnon, </em>which, as we established earlier in this Opinion, only applied to a defendant\u2019s absence from a non-crucial stage of the trial. Next, the court in <em>Corcoran </em>concluded that the side-bar conference at issue in that case, unlike the case <em>sub judice, </em>concerned a question of law and that a defendant need not be present at a conference or argument upon a question of law. <em>Corcoran, </em>855 F. Supp. at 1377. Finally, the <em>Corcoran </em>court noted that the defendant did not suffer any prejudice as a result of his absence from the side-bar conference because the court excluded the juror who was the subject of the sidebar. <em>Corcoran, </em>855 F. Supp. at 1377.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b647 The court in <em>Corcoran </em>cited with approval passages from two earlier Second Circuit cases. These passages are particularly relevant to and supportive of our holding in this case. \u201c[A] waiver by counsel of a defendant\u2019s right to be present during the proceedings is valid when made <em>in the presence of the defendant.\u201d Corcoran, </em>855 F. Supp. at 1376 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>United States v. Doe </em>(2d Cir. 1992), 964 F.2d 157, 159, <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1009, 113 S.Ct. 628, 121 L.Ed.2d 560). And, although a waiver may come from a defendant\u2019s attorney because there is no federal constitutional provision requiring otherwise, \u201cit is certainly preferable that the waiver <em>come from the defendant directly.\u201d Corcoran, </em>855 F. Supp. at 1376 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Polizzi v. United States </em>(2d Cir. 1991), 926 F.2d 1311, 1322).</p>\n<p id=\"AJg\">\u00b648 Finally, and while not involving the same issue, it is worth, again, refering to <em>LaMere </em>and to this Court\u2019s discussion of the critical importance of jury selection in assuring an accused the right to a fair trial. We stated in <em>LaMere:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">the impartiality of the jury goes to the very integrity of our justice system, and the right to an impartial jury is so essential to our conception of a fair trial that its violation cannot be considered harmless error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-6\"><em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 50. Given the importance of this fundamental right to a fair and impartial jury, it cannot but follow that a defendant\u2019s right to be personally present during the critical stage at which the jury is chosen, must be jealously guarded and preserved against all but the accused\u2019s personal, on-the-record, knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver. The record before us ably demonstrates that Paul was not given the opportunity to make such a waiver, nor did he do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u00b649 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b113-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, COTTER, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b113-9\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"A2JU\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">\u00b650 I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\u00b651 As it did in the similar case of <em>State v. Tapson, </em>2001 MT 292, 307 Mont. 428, the Court ignores longstanding precedent in reaching its decision herein. Further, the Court misapprehends the fundamental role of defense counsel in criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b652 Before the commencement of the trial in this matter, Defendant Bird was given notice of the State\u2019s intention to conduct individual <em>voir dire </em>with prospective jurors who had experiences with domestic violence. The procedure undertaken was no surprise to the defense, which had ample notice and opportunity to prepare for this eventuality.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b653 Thus, the defense had been fully advised when the anticipated time came to conduct individual <em>voir dire. </em>Yet, no objection of any kind was made to the procedure by the defense. By participating in the procedure without objection, the defense fully consented to the procedure, and to the presence or absence of the people in the room at the time it was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b654 In a case decided last year, involving an alleged violation of a constitutional trial right, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">In addition to requiring a timely objection, we have held that the objection must specify what authority, rule, statute or constitutional provision might be violated by the court\u2019s decision in order to preserve the issue for appeal; the objector has an obligation to make the basis for the objection clear to the court so that the district court has an opportunity to correct itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-8\"><em>State v. LaDue, </em>2001 MT 47, \u00b6 29, 304 Mont. 288, \u00b6 29, 20 P.3d 775, \u00b6 29. This principle is so fundamental and longstanding from cases decided long before <em>LaDue </em>that citation to authority is hardly necessary. Objections are required during trial, both to give opportunity for the trial court to correct a problem, and to preserve an issue for appeal. Bird failed to do so. Yet, the Court ignores this principle altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">\u00b655 Beyond failing to object, the defense folly consented to Bird\u2019s absence from the individual <em>voir dire </em>process. \u201cWe will not put a district court in error for an action in which the appealing party acquiesced or actively participated.\u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>1999 MT 115, \u00b6 32, 294 Mont. 397, \u00b6 32, 983 P.2d 881, \u00b6 32. This particular legal principle is not important today, either. Perhaps it will be back in vogue on another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">\u00b656 And more than failing to object, and fully consenting to Bird\u2019s absence, defense counsel here was questioned about Bird\u2019s absence from the process. After the issue was specifically identified, defense counsel informed the court that he had previously discussed it with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Bird, and that Bird\u2019s absence was not a problem. Again, after this specific prompting, counsel offered no objection, and fully consented to Bird\u2019s absence. From this record, I would conclude that Bird, through his counsel, waived his right to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b657 The Court holds at \u00b6 35 that there was not a valid waiver because a party can only waive a <em>known </em>right. A defendant\u2019s knowledge of his rights prior to waiver is indeed important. That is why the United States Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">\u201cEven the intelligent and educated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law.... He lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defense, even though he have a perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\"><em>Gideon v. Wainright </em>(1963), 372 U.S. 335, 345, 83 S.Ct. 792, 797, 9 L.Ed. 2d 799, 805-06, quoting <em>Powell v. Alabama </em>(1932), 287 U.S. 45, 68-69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 64, 77 L.Ed. 158, 170. Thus, it is defense counsel who embodies a defendant\u2019s knowledge of his own legal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u00b658 However, the Court, not satisfied with the <em>Gideon </em>principle, refuses to honor the informed choice made by Bird\u2019s counsel at trial, and instead honors Bird\u2019s change of mind on appeal, to the prejudice of the State and the victim. In so doing, the Court misapprehends the fundamental role that defense counsel are to play in criminal proceedings-a role which, like that of the State\u2019s, is to be conducted without the prompting or assistance of this Court. I would let defense counsel fulfill its duty as commissioned in <em>Gideon v. Wainright. </em>There are remedies if counsel fails to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">\u00b659 The Court relies on <em>State v. Allison </em>(1944), 116 Mont. 352, 153 P.2d 141, for its conclusion that Bird\u2019s constitutional right was not adequately waived. It trumpets that constitutional rights are like the Rock of Gibraltar that must be expressly waived, and therefore, as in the 1944 <em>Allison </em>case, this case must be reversed. Amid the trumpeting, however, the Court has overlooked the critical point: the <em>Allison </em>Court required an express waiver of Allison\u2019s constitutional rights precisely because Allison was not represented by defense counsel. For good reason, the Court found that the actions of law enforcement-ordering Allison to give testimony against himself in a hastily convened proceeding in Allison\u2019s tavern without benefit of counsel-could not withstand constitutional scrutiny. Such occurrences are invalid per se under <em>Gideon v. Wainright. </em>I doubt the Court actually views <em>Allison </em>as controlling law today.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>\u00b660 Even so, the facts here are quite different than in <em>Allison. </em>Bird was represented by counsel. Both Bird and his counsel had been notified in advance of the proposed <em>voir dire </em>procedure. Bird\u2019s counsel discussed Bird\u2019s right to be present with Bird, and Bird chose to be absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b661 I would find that Bird properly waived his right to be present during the individual <em>voir dire. </em>I agree with <em>United States v. Corcoran </em>(2nd Cir.1996), 100 F.3d 944 (adopting District Court\u2019s opinion), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 U.S. 1228, 116 S.Ct. 1864, 134 L.Ed.2d 962, wherein the Second Circuit Court found that waiver by defense counsel of the defendant\u2019s right to attend an individual <em>voir dire </em>conference was valid, and with the principle set forth in <em>United States v. Gagnon </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 522, 105 S.Ct. 1482, 84 L.Ed. 2d 486, that the district court need not obtain an express on-the-record waiver to excuse a defendant from every trial conference that the defendant may have a right to attend. Defense counsel\u2019s consent is sufficient. I would further find, honoring our longstanding precedent, that Bird failed to preserve this issue for appeal by failing to object and by consenting to the procedure. I would affirm his conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
