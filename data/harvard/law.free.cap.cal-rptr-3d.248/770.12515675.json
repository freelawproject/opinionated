The court properly found the Department was entitled to reimbursement for these Medi-Cal expenses. Therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Special Needs Trust\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Brenda Gonzalez (Brenda or Beneficiary) suffered complications at birth that left her severely disabled. A medical malpractice lawsuit brought on Brenda's behalf yielded a $ 2.4 million settlement. On October 13, 1999, a federal district court placed these proceeds in a special needs trust (the Trust) pursuant to Probate Code sections 3604 and 3605, which allow courts to approve payment of settlements or judgments to special needs trusts established for minors or disabled persons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The purpose of placing these proceeds in the Trust was to preserve Brenda's eligibility for Medi-Cal benefits while sheltering assets to be used for her special medical needs that would not be covered by Medi-Cal. The Trust thus sets forth that \"[f]or purposes of determining the Beneficiary's Medi-Cal eligibility ... no part of the principal or income of the trust estate shall be considered available to said Beneficiary.\" The Trust provides that its \"intent and purpose ... is to provide a discretionary, spendthrift trust, to supplement public resources and benefits when such resources and benefits are unavailable or insufficient to provide for the Special Needs of the Beneficiary.... This is not a trust for the support of the Beneficiary. All payments made under this Trust must be reasonably necessary in providing for this Beneficiary's special needs ....\" The Trust further provides that \"[t]he Beneficiary has no interest in the income or principal of the trust, other than as set forth herein,\" and \"because this trust is to be conserved and maintained for the Special Needs of the Beneficiary, no part of the principal or income of the trust shall be construed to be part of the Beneficiary's 'estate.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Trust was set up to terminate upon Brenda's death. It sets forth that \"[n]otwithstanding any provisions of this instrument to the contrary, this trust is subject to the provisions and requirements of California Probate Code Sections 3604 and 3605, which require that notice of the Beneficiary's death or the trust termination be given ... to ... [the Department].\" The Trust includes the following provision commonly referred to as a \"payback\" provision: \"In accordance with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p (d) (4) (A), upon termination, whether by death or otherwise, and after payment of provision has been made for expenses of administration, the remaining trust estate shall be payable to any state, or agency of a state, which has provided medical assistance to the Beneficiary under a state plan under Title XIX of the Social Security Act [ (SSA) ], up to an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on behalf of the Beneficiary under such state plan.\" Only after such reimbursements to the state would any\n   remaining funds be distributed to Brenda's legal heirs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Tracking the requirements of Probate Code section 3604, subdivision (b), the federal district court's order establishing the Trust provides: \"Brenda Gonzalez is likely to have special needs related to her disability, as described in the Petition, that will not be met without the Trust,\" and \"[t]he money to be paid to the Trust does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably necessary to meet her special needs.\" The order reiterates that the Trust \"shall be subject to the provisions and requirements of California Probate Code Sections 3604 and 3605.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Department's Claim for Reimbursement from the Trust for Medi-Cal Payments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Brenda died on April 21, 2016, at age 21. At the time of her death, approximately $ 1.6 million remained in the Trust. The Department received notice of Brenda's death on or about April 22, 2016 and, on May 6, 2016, filed a creditor's claim with the probate court. The creditor's claim sought reimbursement from the Trust for Medi-Cal payments for medical care for Brenda in the amount of $ 3,972,501.21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Petition Seeking Distribution of Trust Remainder to Heirs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 10, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a petition seeking an order directing the trustee to distribute the Trust remainder to Plaintiffs, Brenda's heirs. Relying on former Welfare and Institutions Code section 14009.5, subdivision (b)(2)(c),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which sets forth the Department's right to reimbursement for Medi-Cal payments from deceased beneficiaries' estates, Plaintiffs argued that, because Brenda received the Medi-Cal services when she was under 55 years old, the Department had no right to recovery from the Trust remainder for those expenditures. In the alternative, Plaintiffs argued that the charges erroneously included medical expenses incurred prior to the establishment of the Trust, as well as expenses for special education services pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and regional center services pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Lanterman Act).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Department opposed the petition, contending federal and state law mandated it be reimbursed from the Trust for Brenda's Medi-Cal expenses\n   and that former Welfare and Institutions Code section 14009.5 did not apply to limit the Department's recovery. The Department further argued it was not seeking reimbursement for services rendered before the Trust was created. Finally, the Department argued Plaintiffs had not carried their burden to prove Brenda received special education or regional center services and, in any event, the Department was entitled to recover for such services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The probate court denied the petition and ordered the trustee to pay the Department's creditor's claim of $ 3,972,501.21 from the remaining assets of the Trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs timely filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs contend the Department has no right to reimbursement from the Trust remainder for Medi-Cal payments for\n   medical services provided to Brenda. They assert that the Department's right to reimbursement is governed by the Medi-Cal provisions applicable to a decedent's estate, found at former Welfare and Institutions Code section 14009.5, which did not permit reimbursement for Medi-Cal payments where the decedent was under age 55 at the time the services were provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Department asserts those provisions governing estates are inapplicable and special provisions applicable solely to special needs trusts give the Department a right of reimbursement. The proper resolution of this issue requires reconciliation of federal statutes governing Medicaid with state Medi-Cal statutes and regulations as well as provisions in the Probate Code.

Prior to 1993, if a disabled person received a lump sum of money-such as the proceeds of a settlement or a judgment-and those assets were placed in a trust, the trust assets could render the disabled beneficiary ineligible for Medicaid due to these funds being considered an \"available asset\" for purposes of calculating eligibility.

Alexandria's trust would not have been approved by the court had it not contained the condition required in section 1396p(d)(4)(A).

Pennsylvania's law permitting nonprofit organizations to retain a maximum of 50 percent of the trust remainder ran counter to this clear intent, and, accordingly, it was preempted.

[\u00b6] Accordingly, the State Medicaid Manual at Section 3259.7 ('Exceptions to Treatment of Trusts Under Trust Provisions') provides that in order for a Medicaid beneficiary to have a trust classified as ... a special needs trust ..., the trust must contain a provision that directs payback to the state in accordance with the above-described provisions. A trust that does not contain the relevant payback provision language, or applies limitations on the payback beyond the ones specifically identified in the statute (those being, upon the death of the individual, up to an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid ...) may not qualify as a [ section 1396p(d)(4) ] trust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Thus, according to CMS, \"[a] state's entitlement to reimbursement from trusts described in [ section 1396p(d)(4) ] exists independent of the estate recovery authority in [ section 1396p(b) ],\" and \"[t]he mandatory reimbursement terms in a [ section 1396p(d)(4) ] trust, and not the provisions of [ section 1396p(b) ], provide the basis for a state's reimbursement rights from such trusts.\" \"The statutory language does not limit the states' right to reimbursement from [ section 1396p(d)(4) ] trusts to the services a Medicaid beneficiary receives, nor does it condition the right upon the age of a trust beneficiary or absence of surviving family members, or otherwise make the states' reimbursement rights subject to [ section 1396p(b) ].

Those proceeds are set aside for the specific purpose of meeting the medical needs of the beneficiary-and, pursuant to Probate Code section 3604, the court must find that only an amount reasonably believed to be necessary to cover medical needs is being sheltered in this trust. Where a third party has been found liable for the beneficiary's injuries resulting in long-term medical costs, proceeds provided by the third party fairly should go towards these medical costs; only if the medical expenses prove lower than reasonably expected should those funds be distributed to the beneficiary's heirs upon the death of the beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The policy is well-illustrated in the case before us. Brenda had medical expenses of almost $ 4 million. Had the assets in her special needs trust made her ineligible for Medi-Cal, her family may well have struggled to pay for all her special medical needs over her 21-year life. Because she was able to qualify for Medi-Cal, the state paid almost $ 4 million in medical expenses on\n   her behalf, and Trust assets that originally totaled approximately $ 2.4 million paid for additional services and supplies that Brenda needed but were not covered by Medi-Cal. Upon Brenda's death, there is no policy justification for the remaining $ 1.6 million earmarked for medical expenses to go to her heirs, as opposed to reimbursing the state to the extent possible-here, approximately 40 percent of the total medical expenses incurred. It comports with principles of fairness to allow the Department to partially recover the healthcare payments for Brenda, so that those funds can be expended on behalf of other Medi-Cal recipients.\n   E.\n   <em>\n    The Trust itself requires reimbursement to the Department\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Our conclusion that the Department is entitled to be reimbursed from the Trust residual is further supported by the directives of the Trust itself.

We reject Plaintiffs' contention that the Trust's explicit payback provision is \"eviscerated\" by the subsequent provision in the Trust that \"[n]otwithstanding any provisions of this instrument to the contrary, this trust is subject to the provisions and requirements of California Probate Code Sections 3604 and 3605, which require that notice of the Beneficiary's death or the trust termination be given ... to ... [the Department].\" As discussed above, we do not agree with Plaintiffs that Probate Code section 3605 prohibits reimbursement from the Trust because Brenda was under 55.

The court reasoned because there certainly were at least $ 1.6 million in legitimately claimed medical expenses included in the $ 4 million claim, it did not really matter if some additional expenses (for which the Department would not be reimbursed) were for special education and regional center services. Counsel for Plaintiffs essentially conceded the issue, and declined the court's offer to continue the hearing so that Plaintiffs could conduct discovery on how much, if any, of the payback request was for IDEA or Lanterman Act services. Accordingly, even if we assume that expenses for such services are not appropriately claimed by the Department from a special needs trust (a question we need not reach), Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden to demonstrate that the $ 1.6 million available for reimbursement would necessarily go to reimburse the Department for any such services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.
