J.\n </judges>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  This case concerns whether the trial court properly instructed the jury on the so-called kill zone theory, under which a defendant may be convicted of the attempted murder of an individual who was not the defendant's primary target. As we shall explain, we conclude that a jury may convict a defendant under the kill zone theory only when the\n  jury finds that: (1) the circumstances of the defendant's attack on a primary target, including the type and extent of force the defendant used, are such that the only reasonable inference is that the defendant intended to create a zone of fatal harm - that is, an area in which the defendant intended to kill everyone present to ensure the primary target's death - around the primary target; and (2) the alleged attempted murder victim who was not the primary target was located within that zone of harm. Taken together, such evidence will support a finding that the defendant harbored the requisite specific intent to kill both the primary target and everyone within the zone of fatal harm.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  We caution, however, that trial courts must be extremely careful in determining when to permit the jury to rely upon the kill zone theory. The kill zone theory permits a jury to infer a defendant's intent to kill an alleged attempted murder victim from circumstantial evidence (the circumstances of the defendant's attack on a primary target). But, under the reasonable doubt standard, a jury may not find a defendant acted with the specific intent to kill everyone in the kill zone if the circumstances of the attack would also support a reasonable alternative inference more favorable to the defendant. (See CALCRIM No. 225.) Permitting reliance on the kill zone theory in such cases risks the jury convicting a defendant based on the kill zone theory where it would not be proper to do so. As past cases reveal, there is a substantial potential that the kill zone theory may be improperly applied, for instance, where a defendant acts with the intent to kill a primary target but with only conscious disregard of the risk that others may be seriously injured or killed. Accordingly, in future cases trial courts should reserve the kill zone theory for instances in which there is sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that the\n  <em>\n   only\n  </em>\n  reasonable inference is that the defendant\n  intended to kill (not merely to endanger or harm) everyone in the zone of fatal harm.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the present matter, defendants Michael Canizales and KeAndre Windfield were jointly charged and tried before a single jury on counts including first degree murder and two attempted murders. The trial court gave a kill zone instruction in connection with one of the two alleged attempted murder victims. The Court of Appeal concluded that the jury was properly instructed on that theory, and upheld defendants' attempted murder convictions. We conclude there was not sufficient evidence in the record to support an instruction on the kill zone theory, and that the error requires reversal of the attempted murder convictions at issue because those convictions may have been based on the kill zone theory even though that theory was not properly applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants raise the additional argument that instructing pursuant to CALCRIM No. 600, the current standard instruction regarding attempted murder, violated defendants' federal constitutional rights to due process\n   because it led the\n   jurors to believe they could convict defendants of the attempted murder of one victim without finding the requisite intent to kill. In light of our conclusion that the judgment must be reversed because the evidence was insufficient to support an instruction on the kill zone theory, we need not address defendants' constitutional challenge to CALCRIM No. 600.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The convictions in this case arose from a gang-related shooting at a neighborhood block party on West Jackson Street in Rialto. Travion Bolden and Denzell Pride, the alleged attempted murder victims, both lived in apartments on West Jackson and were members of the Hustla Squad Clicc, a large Rialto-based criminal street gang. Defendants Canizales and Windfield were members of a smaller gang called Ramona Blocc that was also based in Rialto. The two gangs were rivals, and shootings between them were commonplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Around noon on July 18, 2008, Bolden and Pride saw Canizales at a fast-food restaurant near West Jackson. The encounter led to a brief argument between Pride and Canizales over Canizales's female companion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Later that same day, Bolden had his own confrontation with Canizales after one member of a group of female friends with whom Bolden was socializing outside his apartment called out to Canizales to join them as he was passing by. Canizales approached and, in what one witness described as a somewhat aggressive manner, asked Bolden \"what's up\" and where he was from. When Bolden responded that he \"didn't bang,\" Canizales walked away. Bolden provided a somewhat different account to an investigating officer, saying that he believed Canizales was challenging him to a fight, that Bolden responded to that challenge by removing his shirt and approaching Canizales to fight him, and that Canizales walked away once Bolden took off his shirt. According to Bolden's trial testimony, he felt that Canizales had disrespected him and that, once Canizales had left, Bolden immediately went to find Pride to tell him what had happened. Pride quickly took off running after Canizales, with Bolden following at a slower pace behind him. The pursuit was cut short, however, when Pride's mother yelled at him to stop and he returned to where he and Bolden had been talking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the encounter with Bolden, Canizales walked to a nearby grocery store, from where he sent someone to summon Ramona Blocc gang leader Windfield. About 8:35 p.m., after joining Canizales outside the grocery store, Windfield spoke briefly with the driver of a vehicle that had pulled up next to them, then patted the car's trunk and said \"Jackson Street\" as the car drove away. Moments later, Windfield and Canizales headed toward West Jackson, skipping and strutting, throwing gang signs, and yelling \"Ramona Blocc.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Meanwhile, people had begun to congregate on the 300 block of West Jackson to prepare for the neighborhood block party that night. By nightfall, there were approximately 10 to 30 or more people outside on the sidewalks and in the street, talking, dancing, and partying. Twenty-six-year-old Leica Cooksey was with a group of young women who had gathered around her parked car, dancing to the music on the car's radio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The testimony at trial showed slightly different accounts of where the victims were located prior to the shooting. For example, Bolden testified that he and Pride were standing in the street in front of Pride's apartment on the same side of the street as Cooksey and her friends, who were about 20 feet away. Other testimony indicated that Cooksey's group was on the\n   side of the street opposite Pride's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Bolden testified that as he talked with Pride he noticed that an unfamiliar car had passed them several times and then parked on Willow Avenue, which runs perpendicular to the east side of West Jackson's 300 hundred block. Bolden and Pride then saw five or six men, including Canizales and Windfield, line up shoulder to shoulder near a manhole cover at the intersection between West Jackson and Willow, facing West Jackson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The evidence at trial provided somewhat different versions of what happened next. Bolden testified that he observed Windfield pull a gun out of his waistband and attempted to pass it to Canizales, who did not take it. Bolden then heard Windfield first say either, \"That's that little nigga,\" or, \"There goes those little niggas right there,\" and then \"Bust.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sparks and the sound of gunfire followed. According to Bolden, after Windfield had fired the first shot, Pride grabbed Bolden and they ran away from the direction of the gunfire. Pride testified, however, that he was standing in front of his apartment when the first shot was fired, and that he ran to his young nieces and hurried them inside for safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Bolden had provided still another version of the shooting in a recorded interview by Detective Williams that occurred two years after the shooting and about one year prior to trial. In that account, Bolden told the officer he was standing inside a West Jackson apartment building's front yard gate smoking marijuana with some neighbors when he noticed an unfamiliar car pass by several times. When the car's occupants got out of the vehicle on Willow Avenue and started walking, he heard Windfield say, \"That's the little nigga right there.\" The officer asked Bolden whether Windfield was referring to him (Bolden). Bolden replied that they had seen Pride because Pride \" 'gave it away when he started runnin' \" and that was when the \"gunshots came on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Pointing to a location on the investigator's map, Bolden said that Pride had been talking on his phone while standing near a parked car that was about four car lengths away from him, closer to Willow. When Bolden heard someone yell \"bust,\" he came out from the gate to find Pride. Moments later, Bolden saw a gunshot flash and started running.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Bolden further testified that once the shooting had begun, he ran away along the sidewalk in a straight line but that Pride zig-zagged back and forth across the street, at one point running behind a bus that was parked on the same side of the street where Cooksey and her friends were dancing to her car's radio. Bolden could hear the gunfire coming their way, with bullets flying by them and \"tingling through the gates.\" Bolden also believed, however, that Windfield could not control his gun, and he described the bullets as \"going everywhere.\" When Windfield stopped shooting, he and Canizales ran down Willow Avenue, away from the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Neither Pride nor Bolden was hit by gunfire, but one of the shots struck Cooksey in the abdomen and she later died as a result of that injury. Investigators found five expended cartridge casings at the corner of West Jackson and Willow, approximately 100 feet from where Cooksey was shot. The casings were nine millimeter and all of them had been fired from a single semi-automatic gun. A defense investigator determined that the distance from the manhole cover on Willow to where Pride and Bolden stood when the shooting began was 160 feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Detectives spoke with Canizales and Windfield shortly after the shootings but the investigation stalled and no charges were filed. Meanwhile, Pride and Bolden had left the area and could not be located. About one year after the incident, however, Windfield told a family friend that he and Canizales had gone to West Jackson to shoot the Hustla Squad member who had killed his cousin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Windfield explained that a girl got in the way of his gunfire while the person he was shooting at ran away. Four months after that conversation, Windfield's friend reported the confession to police, and the investigation reopened. Although officers had difficulty locating Bolden and Pride, they eventually obtained statements from them describing the incident and implicating Canizales and Windfield in the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Canizales and Windfield were charged by amended information with the deliberate, premeditated murder of Cooksey, the deliberate, premeditated attempted murders of Bolden and Pride, and street terrorism. ( Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a) ; 664, subd. (a) and 187, subd. (a); 186.22, subd. (a).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amended information also alleged that Canizales and Windfield committed the crimes to\n   benefit a street gang, and that a principal personally discharged a firearm causing death, within the meaning of sections 186.22, subdivision (b), and 12022.53, subdivisions (b), (c), (d), and (e)(1). Neither Canizales nor Windfield testified at trial. At the close of evidence, the court dismissed the street terrorism charge and several of the firearm enhancements in the interest of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court instructed the jury on attempted murder using CALCRIM No. 600.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   During closing argument, which occurred after the court had given its instructions, the prosecutor offered two theories of defendants' liability for the attempted murder of Bolden. She argued first that the evidence showed Windfield was shooting at, and attempting to kill, both Pride and Bolden, presumably because they were members of the Hustla Squad gang. She then described the concept of the kill zone. The prosecutor told the jury that \"[i]f they're shooting at someone and people are within the zone that they can get killed, then you're responsible for attempted murder as to the people who are within the zone of fire. Okay. So there were times when [Bolden] told you that he was with [Pride], near [Pride], close proximity to [Pride]. So they're both within the zone of fire, the range [of] the bullets that are coming at them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As relevant here, the jury found both defendants guilty of the first degree murder of Cooksey and the premeditated attempted murders of Bolden and Pride, and found as to all three counts that the offenses were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang. The Court of Appeal reversed Canizales's first degree murder conviction of Cooksey in light of this\n   court's decision in\n   <em>\n    People v.

The kill zone theory looks to circumstantial evidence to support a permissive inference regarding a defendant's intent. This is not unusual.

As past cases demonstrate, however, even when a jury is otherwise properly instructed on circumstantial evidence and reasonable doubt, the potential for misapplication of the kill zone theory remains troubling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We therefore conclude that the kill zone theory for establishing the specific intent to kill required for conviction of attempted murder may properly be applied only when a jury concludes: (1) the circumstances of the defendant's attack on a primary target, including the type and extent of force the defendant used, are such that the only reasonable inference is that the defendant intended to create a zone of fatal harm - that is, an area in which the defendant intended to kill everyone present to ensure the primary target's death - around the primary target; and (2) the alleged attempted murder victim who was not the primary target was located within that zone of harm. Taken together, such evidence will support a finding that the defendant harbored the requisite specific intent to kill both the primary target and everyone within the zone of fatal harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In determining the defendant's intent to create a zone of fatal harm and the scope of any such zone, the jury should consider the circumstances of the offense, such as the type of weapon used, the number of shots fired (where a firearm is used), the distance between the defendant and the alleged victims, and the proximity of the alleged victims to the primary target. Evidence that a defendant who intends to kill a primary target acted with only conscious disregard of the risk of serious injury or death for those around a primary target does not satisfy the kill zone theory. As the Court of Appeal recently explained in\n   <em>\n    People v. Medina\n   </em>\n   (2019)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515379\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/244/714/\">\n    33 Cal.App.5th 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at page 156,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515379\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/244/714/\">\n    244 Cal.Rptr.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   ), the kill zone theory does not apply where \"the defendant merely subjected persons near the primary target to lethal risk. Rather, in a kill zone case, the defendant has a primary target and reasons [that] he cannot miss that intended target if he kills everyone in the area in which the target is located. In the absence of such evidence, the kill zone instruction should not be given.\" We believe our formulation of the kill zone theory here guards against the potential misapplication of the theory, and is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Bland\n   </em>\n   and the general principles discussed above regarding circumstantial evidence and the prosecution's burden of\n   proving each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We emphasize that going forward trial courts must exercise caution when determining whether to permit the jury to rely upon the kill zone theory. Indeed, we anticipate there will be relatively few cases in which the theory will be applicable and an instruction appropriate. Trial courts should tread carefully when the prosecution proposes to rely on such a theory, and should provide an instruction to the jury only in those cases where the court concludes there is sufficient evidence to support a jury determination that the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   reasonable inference from the circumstances of the offense is that a defendant intended to kill everyone in the zone of fatal harm.

Pride was a known member of Hustla Squad, and Windfield had admitted to a family friend that on the night in question he and Canizales had gone to West Jackson to \"get a Hustla Squad\" gang member who had killed his cousin. Moreover, Pride and Canizales had engaged in a verbal altercation around noon on the day of the shooting. Finally, the evidence showed that after defendants and their companions had lined up along Willow Avenue facing West Jackson Street, where Pride and Bolden were standing together on the sidewalk, Winfield yelled, \"That's that little nigga. Bust\" - and then opened fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   But an instruction on the kill zone theory would have been warranted in this case only if there was substantial evidence in the record that, if believed by the jury, would support a reasonable inference that defendants intended to\n   kill everyone within the \"kill zone.\" To qualify, the record would need to include (1) evidence regarding the circumstances of defendants' attack on Pride that would support a reasonable inference that defendants intentionally created a zone of fatal harm around him, and (2) evidence that Bolden was located within that zone of fatal harm. Taken together, such evidence would permit a finding that defendants harbored the requisite intent to kill Bolden because he was within the zone of fatal harm that defendants intended to create around Pride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Attorney General argues the evidence is sufficient to support a reasonable inference that defendants intentionally created a zone of fatal harm around Pride because, like in\n   <em>\n    Bland\n   </em>\n   , the five shots Windfield fired at Pride (the primary target) were enough to kill everyone in that\n   zone. We conclude, however, that the evidence concerning the circumstances of the attack (including the type and extent of force used by Windfield) was not sufficient to support a reasonable inference that defendants intended to create a zone of fatal harm around a primary target.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Attorney General is correct that in\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   Maryland's high court observed that \"courts have permitted an inference that the defendant created a kill zone when a defendant ... fired multiple bullets at an intended target.\" (\n   <em>\n    Harrison,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2186223\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/382/477/\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 855 A.2d at p. 1231.)

For example,\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   pointed out that in\n   <em>\n    Wilson,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2075874\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/313/600/\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 546 A.2d at page 1042, the defendants had fired \" 'multiple bullets' \" from two handguns.

Rather, the number of shots fired is simply one of the evidentiary factors to consider when assessing whether the type and extent of the defendant's attack supports instruction on the kill zone theory.

In\n   <em>\n    Bland\n   </em>\n   , for example, the defendant approached the driver's side of the victims' car and started shooting into the vehicle, then fired at the car as it started to drive away.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , the defendants engaged in a heated verbal argument with a man. After threatening to pistol whip him, the defendants then drew their handguns and opened fire on their target, missing him but hitting a bystander who was near both defendants and their target. (\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 546 A.2d at p. 1042.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   By contrast, here the evidence at trial showed that Windfield attacked his target by firing five bullets from a nine-millimeter handgun at a distance of either 100 or 160 feet away. Moreover, the attack occurred at a block party on a wide city street, not in an alleyway, cul de sac, or some other area or structure from which victims would have limited means of escape. As Bolden described it, the bullets were \"going everywhere\" and \"tingling through the gates\" as he and Pride ran down the street away from the gunfire after the first shot was fired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Even accepting as more credible the prosecution's evidence that Windfield was 100 feet rather than 160 feet away from Pride and Bolden when he first fired in their direction, we conclude that a factfinder could not reasonably infer defendants intended to create a zone of fatal harm around Pride based on the record in this case. The evidence presented here showed\n   that from a substantial distance Windfield shot five bullets in the direction of a target who immediately ran down a city street after the first shot was fired. This evidence was insufficient to support instruction on the kill zone theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We emphasize that the determination whether substantial evidence supports instruction on the kill zone theory is based on evidence regarding the circumstances of the attack on the primary target, from which the defendant's intent to create a zone of fatal harm may be inferred. Such a determination does not turn on the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the defendant's chosen method of attack. But whether the inference reasonably could be drawn in this particular case is at least informed by evidence that neither Pride nor Bolden was hit by any of the shots fired by Windfield. This evidence - when viewed in conjunction with evidence regarding the limited number of shots fired, defendants' lack of proximity to Pride, and the openness of the area in which the attack occurred - further diminishes any inference that defendants intended to create a zone of fatal harm around Pride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Because we conclude that the evidence here is insufficient to support a finding that defendants intended to create a zone of fatal harm, we have no occasion to determine the scope of any such zone given these facts. In cases where substantial evidence exists to support a finding that the only reasonable\n   inference is that a zone of fatal harm has been created, the jury is to consider the circumstances of the attack, including the type and extent of force used during the attack, to determine the scope of that zone and whether the alleged victim was within the zone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    2. The error in instructing on the kill zone theory was prejudicial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We have concluded above that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court's instruction on the kill zone theory. For the reasons provided below, we\n   conclude that the court's error in instructing on that theory requires reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As previously discussed, the jury was instructed on two theories of liability in connection with the count charging the attempted murder of Bolden.

In doing so, we consider the instructions provided to the jury and counsels' argument to the jury. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    People v.

In relevant part, the instruction informed the jury that to convict defendants of attempted murder it must find \"[t]he defendant took a direct but ineffective step toward killing another person\" and \"intended to kill that person.\" It further explained that \"[a] person may intend to kill a particular victim or victims and at the same time intend to kill everyone in a particular zone of harm or 'kill zone.' \" The instruction indicated that the People must prove \"that the defendant[s] not only intended to kill Denzell Pride but also either intended to kill Travion Bolden, or intended to kill everyone within the kill zone.\" Finally, the instruction directed the jury that if it had \"a reasonable doubt whether the defendant[s] intended to kill Travion Bolden or intended to kill Denzel Pride by killing everyone in the kill zone,\" it must return verdicts of not guilty. Beyond its reference to a \"particular zone of harm,\" the instruction provided no further definition of the term \"kill zone.\" Nor did the instruction direct the jury to consider evidence regarding\n   the circumstances of defendants' attack when determining whether defendants \"intended to kill Denzel Pride by killing everyone in the kill zone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The prosecutor's description of the kill zone theory given during closing argument substantially aggravated the potential for confusion. The prosecutor told the jury that under the kill zone theory, when a defendant is \"shooting at someone and\n   people are within the zone that they can get killed, then [the defendant] is responsible for attempted murder as to the people who are\n   within the zone of fire.\" Pointing to Bolden's testimony that he was at times in close proximity to Pride, the prosecutor argued that they were \"both within the zone of fire, the range [of] the bullets that are coming at them.\" The prosecutor's definition of the kill zone as an area in which people \"can get killed\" or are in a \"zone of fire\" was significantly broader than a proper understanding of the theory permits. Indeed, it essentially equated attempted murder with implied malice murder. (See\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 33 Cal.App.5th at p. 155,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515379\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/244/714/\">\n    244 Cal.Rptr.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [holding that allowing the kill zone instruction based on an asserted natural and probable consequence that anyone within a zone of harm could die \"replaces the specific intent/express malice required for an attempted murder conviction with conscious disregard for life/implied malice, which\n   <em>\n    Bland\n   </em>\n   makes clear cannot support an attempted murder conviction\"].) Thus, the prosecutor's argument had the potential to mislead the jury to believe that the mere presence of a purported victim in an area in which he or she could be fatally shot is sufficient for attempted murder liability under the kill zone theory. So misled, the jury might well have found factual support for what was effectively an \"implied malice\" theory of attempted murder without detecting the legal error. (See\n   <em>\n    Guiton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 4 Cal.4th at p. 1128,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20365\">\n    17 Cal.Rptr.2d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20P.2d%2045\">\n    847 P.2d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In light of these facts, we conclude that there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the kill zone instruction in a legally impermissible manner. The court's error in instructing on the factually unsupported kill zone theory, combined with the lack of any clear definition of the theory in the jury instruction as well as the prosecutor's misleading argument, could reasonably have led the jury to believe that it could find that defendants intended to kill Bolden based on a legally inaccurate version of the kill zone theory - that is, that defendants could be found guilty of the attempted murder of Bolden if Windfield shot at Pride knowing there was a substantial danger he would also hit Bolden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   These circumstances make this case similar to\n   <em>\n    People v.

Considering the evidence regarding the shooting, the prosecutor's argument, and the jury's questions during deliberation, we conclude that the attempted murder convictions as to Bolden must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   First, although there was strong evidence that Pride was defendants' primary target, there was conflicting evidence regarding whether defendants also intended to kill Bolden specifically. On the one hand, Detective Williams testified that Pride indicated to him during a pretrial interview that the shooter was targeting Bolden, not him. Detective Williams's interview with Bolden, when Bolden described his earlier confrontation with Canizales, likewise suggested that Bolden believed Windfield was shooting at him. The evidence also showed Bolden was a member of a rival gang and that defendants, who were members of the Ramona Blocc gang, were seeking to retaliate against the Hustla Squad gang for the fatal shooting of Windfield's cousin. Taken together, this evidence indicates that the jury\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have concluded that defendants had the requisite intent to kill Bolden specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   But other evidence leads us to conclude that it is not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable jury would have\n   come to that determination. Bolden told Detective Williams and testified at trial that Windfield was not talking about him when he said, \"There goes that little nigga,\" because Windfield did not know him, and that defendant saw Pride, who \"gave it away\" by running.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bolden testified he thought Windfield was shooting at Pride because Bolden \"would have got hit first\" if Windfield was shooting at him. When Bolden described the gunshots he stated the bullets were \"tingling through the gates\" and \"going everywhere\" because Windfield could not control his gun. There\n   was also testimony at trial that Windfield later admitted to a family friend that \"the guy he was shooting at ran and the girl got in the way.\" Based on the evidence alone, then, it is not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable jury would conclude defendants intended to kill Bolden specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Next, the jury instructions and the prosecutor's argument further support a finding of prejudice. As detailed, both the prosecutor's closing argument and the attempted murder instruction given in connection with the charge involving Bolden had the potential to cause confusion regarding the application of the kill zone theory. To be sure, the instructions made clear there were two theories for finding criminal liability with regard to the attempted murder of Bolden and plainly informed the jury that defendants could be liable if they intended to kill Bolden specifically. The prosecutor also emphasized both\n   theories in her argument, and strenuously argued the theory that defendants specifically targeted both Bolden and Pride. That portion of her argument emphasized that Bolden and Pride's gang affiliation provided the motive for the shooting because defendants were \"trying to kill Hustla Squad.\" She also emphasized Bolden's pretrial statements to Detective Williams that Windfield was shooting at him as evidence that showed defendants had in fact \"shot at both of them.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this does not overcome the potential for confusion created by the attempted murder instruction in combination with the prosecutor's argument. Taken together, it cannot be said beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable jury would conclude defendants targeted Bolden specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The jury's questions during deliberations are also instructive. The jury here did not ask questions directed solely to the kill zone theory or that otherwise suggested it had relied solely on the kill zone theory to find defendants guilty of the attempted murder of Bolden. (Cf.\n   <em>\n    In re Martinez\n   </em>\n   (2017)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514041\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/226/315/#p1227\">\n    3 Cal.5th 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1227,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514041\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/226/315/#p1227\">\n    226 Cal.Rptr.3d 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514041\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/226/315/#p1227\">\n    407 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [jury's mid-deliberations\n   note seeking clarification of the standard instruction on aider and abettor liability, and the court's response to that inquiry, suggested that the jury may have found the defendant guilty of murder based on the invalid theory that the murder was a natural and probable consequence of the assaults that preceded the shooting].) But, as defendants point out, the jury did request a readback of Bolden's testimony to the effect that \"[t]hey weren't shooting at me.\" In the portion of Bolden's testimony that the jury asked to rehear, the prosecutor asked Bolden whether Windfield was shooting at him. Bolden answered, \"To be honest, I don't feel he was shooting at me because I was in front of [Pride]. ... But he was shooting our way.\" When asked to confirm that he had told Detective Williams in a pretrial interview that Windfield was shooting at him, however, Bolden said he \"couldn't remember that part\" but that he \"probably did.\" The request for a readback is not dispositive, but it suggests the jurors at one point were focused on testimony that would have supported the theory that defendants did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   target Bolden specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The jury's findings on sentencing enhancement allegations are also relevant to our consideration. The Attorney General asserts that the jury's true findings as to the allegation that defendants acted willfully, deliberately, and with\n   premeditation in attempting to murder Bolden (see \u00a7\u00a7 664, subd. (a) and 187, subd. (a)) show the jury necessarily determined that defendants acted with the specific intent to kill. The jury could not have found premeditation and deliberation without also having determined that defendants had formed the intent to kill. (See\n   <em>\n    People v. Catlin\n   </em>\n   (2001)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456839\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/26/81/#p151\">\n    26 Cal.4th 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 151,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2031\">\n    109 Cal.Rptr.2d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20P.3d%20357\">\n    26 P.3d 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) We agree with Windfield, however, that the true findings regarding the allegation that defendants acted with deliberation\n   and premeditation in attempting to murder Bolden do not affect our determination. As we explained\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , the kill zone theory permits the jury to infer that the defendant harbored the requisite specific intent to kill the primary target\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   everyone within the zone of fatal harm. Thus, the jury would have found a specific intent to kill were it to have relied solely on the kill zone theory of attempted murder liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Nor are we persuaded that the jury's true findings concerning the separate gang enhancement allegation necessarily leads to the conclusion that the jury did not rely on the kill zone theory. The jury determined that defendants committed the attempted murder of Bolden to benefit the Ramona Blocc gang. Those findings could suggest that the jury accepted the prosecutor's alternate theory that defendants intended to kill both Pride and Bolden because they belonged to the Hustla Squad gang. But the findings could also suggest that, relying on the kill zone theory, the jury found that defendants created a zone of fatal harm in which they intended all persons would be killed for the benefit of the gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Having examined the entire record, we conclude that it is not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable jury would have returned the same verdict absent the error. Reversal is required on the attempted murder counts regarding Bolden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' challenges to CALCRIM No. 600\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants argue that the paragraph relating to the kill zone theory in CALCRIM No. 600, the standard instruction regarding attempted murder given in their case, erroneously permitted the jury to return a verdict of guilt on the count charging the attempted murder of the nontargeted victim without a finding of the\n   requisite element of intent to kill, in violation of their right to due process. Because we conclude that the instruction should not have been given and that doing so prejudiced defendants, we need not reach this separate constitutional challenge.\n   <strong>\n    III.
