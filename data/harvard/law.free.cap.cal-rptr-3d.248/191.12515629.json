The juvenile court declared J.M. a ward of the court pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 602\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and committed her to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Justice (also Division of Juvenile Facilities; hereafter DJJ)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for a maximum term of seven years, with credit for 206 days in custody. On appeal, J.M. contends the juvenile court did not make certain legally required findings and abused its discretion. J.M. also contends her admission was not voluntary and her counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Moreover, in supplemental briefing, J.M. argues the\n   case should be remanded so that the juvenile court can determine whether to grant her a mental health diversion under Penal Code sections 1001.35 and 1001.36. In a consolidated petition for writ of habeas corpus, J.M. reiterates her claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and involuntary admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the published portion of our opinion, we conclude the mental health diversion law does not apply to juveniles in delinquency proceedings. In the unpublished portion of our opinion, we order that the juvenile court's imposition of a registration fee for the appointment of counsel and the discretionary probation conditions be stricken from the December 4, 2017, disposition order. We also order that the prohibition against J.M. possessing a \"weapon\" until age 30 be amended to substitute \"firearm\" for \"weapon,\" consistent with Penal Code section 29820, subdivision (b). The juvenile court is directed to amend its records in a manner consistent with this opinion and to forward copies of all such pertinent documents to the Director of DJJ (see\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , part E). We also direct the trial court clerk to correct the date on the notice of appeal (see\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , part A, fn. 3). In all other respects, we affirm the disposition order, without prejudice to J.M. raising the issue of additional post-disposition credits in the juvenile court (see\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , part D), and we deny the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    **\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    ***\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.-F.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    \u2020\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

In her supplemental briefing, J.M. argues the case should be remanded so that the juvenile court can determine whether to grant her a mental health diversion under Penal Code sections 1001.35 and 1001.36. For the reasons below, we conclude that the mental health diversion law does not apply to juveniles in delinquency proceedings, and that this does not violate equal protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Inapplicability of the Mental Health Diversion Law to Juveniles\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Penal Code section 1001.35 specifies that the purpose of the mental health diversion law \"is to promote all of the following: [\u00b6] (a) Increased diversion of individuals with mental disorders to mitigate the individuals' entry and reentry into the criminal justice system while protecting public safety. [\u00b6] (b) Allowing local discretion and flexibility for counties in the development and implementation of diversion for individuals with mental disorders across a continuum of care settings. [\u00b6] (c) Providing diversion that meets the unique mental health and support needs of individuals with mental disorders.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Penal Code section 1001.36, subdivision (a), provides for discretionary \"pretrial diversion\" to a \"defendant\" suffering from certain mental illnesses who has been charged in an \"accusatory pleading\" with a misdemeanor or felony. \"Pretrial diversion\" is defined in relevant part as \"the postponement of prosecution, either temporarily or permanently, at any point in the judicial process from the point at which the accused is charged until adjudication, to allow the defendant to undergo mental health treatment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In order for a defendant to qualify for diversion, the court must be satisfied that all the following requirements are met: the defendant suffers from a mental disorder as identified in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\" including PTSD ( \u00a7 1001.36, subd. (b)(1)(A) ); the defendant's mental disorder was a significant factor in the commission of the charged offense, based on any relevant and credible evidence (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (b)(1)(B)); in the opinion of a qualified mental health expert, the defendant's symptoms of the mental disorder motivating the criminal behavior would respond to mental health treatment (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (b)(1)(C)); the defendant consents to diversion and agrees to comply with treatment (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (b)(1)(D), (E)); and the defendant will not pose an \"unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,\" as defined in section 1170.18, if treated in the community, based on the opinions of the district attorney, the defense, or a qualified mental health expert, the defendant's violence and criminal history, the current charged offense, and any other factors that the court deems appropriate (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (b)(1)(F)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After ensuring that the defendant meets the above requirements, a trial court may order the defendant into a diversion program for \"no longer than two years.\" ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 1001.36, subd. (c)(3).) If the defendant performs satisfactorily in the program, the court must dismiss the underlying charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (e).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   J.M. argues that the new law, as an ameliorative statute, applies retroactively to cases pending on appeal, and that she meets all six eligibility requirements. The People assert that the statute, which became effective June 27, 2018 (Stats. 2018, ch. 34, \u00a7 24)-after J.M.'s admission and the dispositional order-does not apply retroactively. The People further contend that the mental health diversion statute, by its terms, does not apply to juvenile cases, and that even if it did, J.M. has not demonstrated a prima facie case of her eligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Whether or not the new mental diversion law applies to juveniles is a matter of statutory interpretation. Thus, \" '[o]ur first step is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute, giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Garcia v.

Notably, a juvenile delinquency matter is not criminal in nature (\u00a7 203), and unlike the adult justice system, which seeks to punish, the fundamental purpose of the juvenile justice system is to rehabilitate. (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Furthermore, as the Legislature recognized in recently amending Proposition 57 to increase the number of minors retained under juvenile court jurisdiction, the juvenile system is very different from the adult system in\n   terms of the mandatory age-appropriate treatment, services, counseling, and education it provides to minors.

(\n   <em>\n    M.S.\n   </em>\n   , at p. 1192.) These distinctions include the circumstances that: a juvenile proceeding is commenced by the filing of a petition, not a criminal complaint; there are no jury trials in juvenile court, but rather, the court presides over jurisdictional hearings; there are no convictions in juvenile court, and instead, a juvenile court's findings that the petition's allegations are true will bring the juvenile within the court's jurisdiction; and there are no sentences in juvenile court, but rather, \"a wide variety of rehabilitation alternatives\" may be imposed at a disposition hearing.

Second, J.M. argues\n   <em>\n    M.S.\n   </em>\n   failed to address equal protection concerns raised by denial of the benefits of the mental health diversion program to juveniles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Jovan B.\n   </em>\n   , the California Supreme Court held that Penal Code section 12022.1 -which increases the period of imprisonment for a felony committed while the offender is out on bail or on his or her own recognizance (O.R.)-applies to juvenile delinquency proceedings. In so holding,\n   <em>\n    Jovan B.\n   </em>\n   concluded that the statute's use of criminal terminology, i.e., information, indictment, complaint, preliminary hearing, and sentencing, \"cannot be dispositive of the question of whether the bail/O.R. enhancement applies to juvenile wards.\" (\n   <em>\n    Jovan B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 6 Cal.4th at p. 812,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20428\">\n    25 Cal.Rptr.2d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=863%20P.2d%20673\">\n    863 P.2d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

Ensuring access to needed mental health treatment is part of the juvenile court's overarching responsibility to provide minors alleged to be wards with the necessary \"care, treatment, and guidance that is consistent with their best interest, that holds them accountable for their behavior, and that is appropriate for their circumstances.\" (\u00a7 202, subd. (b).). Moreover, the Juvenile Court Law has its own independent scheme for addressing minors alleged to be wards with serious mental disorders and other emotional and developmental issues. (\u00a7\u00a7 710-713.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Were we to construe the mental health diversion law as applying to juveniles, it would conflict with or infringe upon these and other provisions specifically contemplated by the Legislature to provide an appropriate and comprehensive course of treatment and rehabilitation for juveniles. (\u00a7\u00a7 202, 710-713, 790-796.) As discussed, a mental health diversion program under Penal Code section 1001.36 may postpone the adjudication of charges for up to two years. ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 1001.36, subd. (c).) Allowing a juvenile to be siphoned off into the mental health diversion program in this fashion would thus serve to stall a comprehensive disposition that beneficially and timely addresses the juvenile's other rehabilitation needs, such as education, counseling, and discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Moreover, we note the Juvenile Court Law's deferred judgment provisions (\u00a7\u00a7 790-796) resemble a diversion scheme in many respects-i.e.,\n   providing for \"treatment, and rehabilitation efforts\" (\u00a7 790, subd. (b)); abating the adjudicatory process (\n   <em>\n    In re Mario C.\n   </em>\n   (2004)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"695415\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/124/1303/#p1308\">\n    124 Cal.App.4th 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1308,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20891\">\n    21 Cal.Rptr.3d 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); and potentially resulting in dismissal of the charges in the wardship petition upon satisfactory completion of the assigned program (\u00a7 793, subd. (c))-except in the critical respect that it is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   available where the offense charged is enumerated in section 707, subdivision (b), which includes torture. (\u00a7 790, subd. (a)(2); \u00a7 707, subd. (b)(23).) In other words, the Legislature, in crafting the deferred judgment program under the Welfare and Institutions Code, did not intend to allow diversion for juveniles charged with offenses listed in section 707, subdivision (b), while the diversion program authorized in the Penal Code does in fact permit diversion for defendants charged with at least some of those offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Extending the reach of Penal Code sections 1001.35 and 1001.36 to juveniles would thus conflict with the Legislature's intent to limit the availability of diversion but to timely extend rehabilitative services for certain juveniles. In the absence of a clear expression of legislative intent, we are not persuaded the Legislature meant to abandon such differences between the adult and juvenile statutory schemes. (\n   <em>\n    Derrick B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 39 Cal.4th at p. 546,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2013\">\n    47 Cal.Rptr.3d 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=139%20P.3d%20485\">\n    139 P.3d 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   J.M. contends the failure to find Penal Code sections 1001.35 and 1001.36 applicable to juveniles will impermissibly result in the imposition of harsher punishments on juveniles. Relying on Welfare and Institutions Code section 726, subdivision (d)(1), she argues that a minor who committed torture would have to serve an entire sentence at DJJ, while an adult who successfully completes the diversion program for the same offense would serve no time at all. That reliance is misplaced. Such circumstances do not violate section 726, subdivision (d)(1), because that statute simply provides that a ward may not be held in physical confinement in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment that\n   <em>\n    could be\n   </em>\n   imposed upon an adult convicted of the same offense. (Compare Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 607, subd. (f) [discharge upon expiration of two-year period of control or when person attains age 23] with Pen. Code, \u00a7 206.1 [torture punishable by life imprisonment].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In sum, we conclude juveniles who are not charged as adults are not statutorily eligible for the mental health program under Penal Code sections 1001.35 and\n   1001.36. Disallowing adult-focused mental health diversion to juveniles promotes, rather than detracts from, the existing rehabilitative and\n   mental health resources available under the Juvenile Court Law, while properly maintaining the legislatively-enacted distinctions between the two systems.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Equal Protection\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   J.M. next argues that excluding juveniles from the mental health diversion law available to adult offenders would violate the equal protection guarantees in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 7, of the California Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The constitutional guarantee of equal protection \" 'does not preclude the state from drawing any distinctions between different groups of individuals, but does require that, at a minimum, classifications which are created bear a rational relationship to a legitimate public purpose.
