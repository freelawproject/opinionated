Amended notice of appeal was filed April 4, 2018 (correcting attachment). The appeal included only the decision as to Respondent.

Therefore, the Labor\n     Commissioner's decision as to Bolamon Properties, Inc. is final and not included in the appeal for a trial de novo or this appeal.\n     <em>\n      Trial Court Dismissal of Appeal and Release and Exoneration of Appeal Bond\n     </em>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     On April 30, 2018, by written order the Trial Court dismissed Respondent's appeal of the Labor Commissioner's Order, Decision or Award and ordered that judgment be entered in favor of Appellant in the amount of the award of the Labor Commissioner plus attorney's fees.

No opposition was filed by Respondent to the Supplemental Motion for Judicial Notice.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-21\">\n     The Appellate Division\n     <strong>\n      GRANTS\n     </strong>\n     the Supplemental Motion for Judicial Notice. However, the Appellate Division determines that none of the Trial Court matters subject to Appellant's Motion and Supplemental Motion for Judicial Notice are necessary for the Appellate Division's Opinion herein. Therefore, the matters are not considered.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-22\">\n     <strong>\n      <em>\n       Discussion\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-23\">\n     At issue in the appeal to the Appellate Division is the fact that the Trial Court dismissed Respondent's appeal of the Labor Commissioner's decision due to failure to timely file the required appeal bond. Labor Code \u00a7 98.2(b). But the Trial Court then ordered that the late-filed bond be exonerated and released back to the employer's surety. The Trial Court found that Respondent's appeal bond was \"an attempted bond, rather than an actual bond as result of lack of jurisdiction.\" The appeal is, therefore, from the Trial Court's June 13, 2018 Order exonerating and releasing the Labor Code \u00a7 98.2(b) appeal bond back to surety of Respondent.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-25\">\n     <em>\n      (b) As a condition to filing an appeal pursuant to this section, an employer shall first post an undertaking with the reviewing court in the amount of the order, decision, or award. The undertaking shall consist of an appeal bond issued by a licensed surety or a cash deposit, with the court in the amount of the order, decision, or award. The employer shall provide written notification to the other parties and the Labor Commissioner of the posting of the undertaking. The undertaking shall be on the condition that, if any judgment is entered in favor of the employee, the employer shall pay the amount owed pursuant to the judgment, and if the appeal is\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      withdrawn or dismissed without entry of judgment, the employer shall pay the amount owed pursuant to the order, decision, or award of the Labor Commissioner unless the parties have executed a settlement agreement for payment of\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-26\">\n     <em>\n      some other amount, in which case the employer shall pay the amount that the employer is obligated to pay under the terms of the settlement agreement.\n      <strong>\n       If the employer fails to pay the amount owed within 10 days of entry of the judgment,\n      </strong>\n     </em>\n     <strong>\n      <em>\n       dismissal, or withdrawal of the appeal, or the execution of a settlement agreement, a portion of the undertaking equal to the amount owed, or the entire undertaking if the amount owed exceeds the undertaking, is forfeited to the employee.\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n     <em>\n      Labor Code \u00a7 98.2 (emphasis added).\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-27\">\n     Labor Code \u00a7 98.2(b) states that an undertaking posted by an employer shall be forfeited to the employee if (1) the employer fails to pay the amount owed within 10 days of (2) the entry of a judgment, dismissal, or withdrawal of the appeal (which occurred here on April 30, 2018). Labor Code \u00a7 98.2(b) does not distinguish between the type of dismissal of the appeal. In this case, the appeal was dismissed by the Trial Court because the required undertaking was not timely filed by the employer with the Trial Court. Labor Code \u00a7 98.2(b) gives only one directive as to the disposition of an appeal bond if the appeal is dismissed and the judgment is not fulfilled. Absent other authority, the Appellate Division follows the clear directive of Labor Code \u00a7 98.2(b) to forfeit the undertaking to the employee upon dismissal of the appeal.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-28\">\n     Although Respondent's argument that the Trial Court did not have \"subject matter jurisdiction\" to hear the appeal because of the late-filed bond is technically correct, Respondent cites no authority under Labor Code \u00a7 98.2 that dismissal for lack of appeal jurisdiction (for failure to meet the timely appeal bond requirement of the statute or otherwise) renders any posted bond a non-existent or an \"attempted bond.\"\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-29\">\n     The public policy behind Labor Code \u00a7 98.2 is supported by releasing the bond to the employee in accordance with the statute. In this case, after Respondent\n     filed a timely notice of appeal -- but without the required undertaking -- the Appellate Division finds that Respondent assumed the risk of forfeiture by filing the untimely bond. At that point, Respondent could have simply failed to file a bond and the appeal would nonetheless have been dismissed for failure to meet the Labor Code \u00a7 98.2 requirements. Additionally, the Respondent employer had the option under Labor Code \u00a7 98.2(b) to pay the amount owed pursuant to the judgment after dismissal of the appeal and the bond would not be forfeited to the employee under the statute.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-30\">\n     There is no direct case authority on point. But the case law that exists more closely supports the Appellant's position that the bond must be forfeited to the\n     employee pursuant to Labor Code \u00a7 98.2(b).\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Tabarrejo v.
