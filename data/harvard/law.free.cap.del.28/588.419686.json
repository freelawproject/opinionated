D. 1912, the president of the Delmar Lumber Manufacturing Company; that on the twentieth day of said month one of the officers of said company filed a bill in chancery, this state, alleging that the company was at that time insolvent to which bill answer was filed by the company admitting all the allegations therein, -under the oath of its president, the husband of the defendant, to the truth of the matters contained in the answer, and that the execution and filing of the answer was done in pursuance and direction of the authority of- a resolution of the board of directors of the company, passed, etc.; that upon the bill and answer the Chancellor did on, etc., decree the company to be insolvent, and appointed the husband of the defendant and another, receivers of said company, that on the eleventh day of July, A.

See 4 <em>Boyce, </em>537, 89 <em>Atl. </em>741. Issue was joined, and the case came on for trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-6\">It was shown that the lumber and building materials bought by the defendant from the Delmar Lumber Manufacturing Company were bought on June twentieth, twenty-first and twenty-second, the husband acting as agent for his wife in the transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>tian. Proof of payment corresponded to the allegations set up in the special plea of payment. The defendant testified that her husband was owing her, at the time of the transaction, about fifteen hundred dollars; and that he was her agent in the purchase of the lumber which she was to receive in part payment of his indebtedness to her. There was likewise proof of the insolvency proceedings in chancery, this state, and of the bankrupt proceedings alleged in the replication to the plea of payment; and the manner of the alleged payment by the defendant was not controverted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-5\">At the close of the testimony, upon application of the plaintiff, the court gave binding instructions to the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff in the following opinion:</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b603-6\">Boyce, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"AAV\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> There is no conflict in the testimony respect-</p>\n<p id=\"AjV\">ing the vital facts of this case. It is conceded that Theodore A. Veasey was the agent of Mary A. Veasey, the defendant, his wife, for the purchase of the lumber and building materials, the subject of this action, from the Delmar Lumber Manufacturing Company of which he was its president at the time of the transaction. Mr. Veasey knew at the time he made the purchase for his wife that his company was insolvent as is shown by his answer to a bill in equity for the appointment of a receiver. He cannot now be heard to deny his knowledge of these proceedings under which the Chancellor upon bill and answer found the said company to be insolvent, and appointed Mr. Veasey one of the receivers. A petition in bankruptcy against the said company was filed within four months from the purchase of the lumber by Mr. Veasey for his wife and the company was subsequently adjudged a bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Mr. Veasey\u2019s knowledge of the insolvency of his company must be regarded as the knowledge of his principal, the defendant in this action, according to well settled principles, that a principal is chargeable with the knowledge the agent possesses in the transaction of the business he has in charge. As Mr. Veasey, the agent of his wife and the president of his company, was aware of the insolvent condition of the company, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>must be charged that he had reasonable ground to believe that in transferring the lumber and building materials from the insolvent company t\u00f3 his wife in consideration of the credit which was to be given to the company in part payment of the alleged indebtedness due to him from the company that he was preferring himself to other creditors of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> It is conceded that in the arrangement between Mr. Veasey and his wife for the payment of the lumber, the wife was; to credit certain evidences of indebtedness due her from her husband. The transaction was therefore voidable, and the trustee in bankruptcy may recover the value of the lumber from the defendant, she being the person under the bankrupt act, deemed to be benefited by the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we impute no intention of bad faith on the part of Mr. Veasey, but his act was a preference to himself and a benefit to his principal within contemplation of the bankrupt act and is therefore invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">We are constrained for the reasons assigned to instruct the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim, being the sum of five hundred and one dollars and seventy cents, with interest from July 21, 1912; and, gentlemen of the jury, you are so instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
