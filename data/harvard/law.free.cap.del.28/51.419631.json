Supreme Council, etc., </em>152 <em>Mich. </em>266, 116 <em>N. W. 383; </em>16 L. <em>R. A. (N. S.) </em>555, 15 <em>Ann. Cas. 232; Cooley on Insurance, Vol. </em>1, <em>p. </em>261.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In part C, second page, of the application for'the p'olicy signed by the insured, in this case, it was agreed by him \u201cto induce the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to issue policy, and in consideration therefor I agree, on behalf of myself and of any other person who shall have or claim interest in my policy issued under this application, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-13\">\u201cWhenever nothing is written in the following paragraph it is agreed that the declaration is true without exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-14\">In paragraph 12 following is this: \u201cI have no insurance on my life, except in the following named companies and for the following amounts, and by the word \u2018 company \u2019 I mean any company, association, society or order granting life insurance.\u201d Nothing is written in this paragraph but under part A, on the first page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>of the application, are the following questions and answers: \u201c 13. Is said life now insured in any other company or society, or association? If so, give names and associations. No. 13a. Any other? None.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">There is also this stipulation: \u201cI hereby apply' for the described policy, and all the statements in parts A and C of this application are made by me to induce the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to issue said policy of insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The law is well settled that false answers to questions such as are involved in this case in an application for insurance vitiate the contract, the answers being held to be warranties, and to be material to the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The answers of the applicant in this case before us regarding the fact of other insurance existing on his life, at the time he made the application to the Metropolitan Insurance Company, having been proven to be false, their 'falsity renders the policy issued null and void, and plaintiff cannot recover. <em>Grand Fraternity v.
