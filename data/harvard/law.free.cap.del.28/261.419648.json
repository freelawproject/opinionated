Laws, c. </em>191, \u00a7 16, relating to the character and purpose of delivery of negotiable instruments, and was therefore sufficient to prevent judgment.</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b273-7\"><em>(December </em>16, 1914.)</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b273-8\">Judges Boyce and Rice sitting.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b273-9\"><em>Charles F.

W. Morgan to the International Radiator Company for eight hundred and forty dollars. Receivers of the payee were appointed, and action was brought by them against Henry W. Morgan, the maker. The plaintiffs filed an affidavit of demand to obtain judgment at first term. The defendant thereupon filed an affidavit of defense, in which he deposes and says that he verily believes there is a legal defense to the whole of the cause of action in the said suit, the nature and character of which defense is as follows, to wit: That the note sued upon in the above stated action was issued to evidence the amount of certain advances made by the said the International Radiator Company to the said Henry W. Morgan prior to the date of the said note, while the said Henry W. Morgan was engaged in the business of said company, and the said note was not delivered by the said Morgan for the purpose of transferring the property in the said note to the said the International Radi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ator Company; that the said advances as evidenced by the said -note were expended in furtherance of and on behalf of the company, and that the said note was not delivered for the purpose of giving effect thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">Motion was made by plaintiff\u2019s counsel for judgment notwithstanding the affidavit of defense, on the ground that it discloses a state of facts which would not be a legal bar to the action, even assuming the same to be true.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b274-7\">Boyce, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARn\">The affidavit of defense filed in this case is manifestly made within the purview of <em>Section </em>16, <em>Chapter </em>191, <em>Volume </em>26, <em>Laws of Delaware, </em>404 (the uniform act of negotiable instruments), respecting the character and purpose of the delivery of a negotiable instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The defense relied upon by the affidavit is to the effect that the note sued upon was in the language of the statute, delivered for a special purpose only, and not for the purpose of transferring the property in the instrument. The affidavit raises such a doubt in the minds of the court, that we are constrained to deny judgment on the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit of demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Judgment is refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
