Where did you live after you married Mr. Carey? A. In Philadelphia and Camden. Q. Where do you live now? A. I live near Cheswold (Kent County, Del.), and have for a year. I have lived in Kent County for more than two years. Kent County is my home.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-13\">Conrad, J.:\u2014When did she come to Delaware?</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-14\"><em>Mr. </em>Kenney:\u2014She came to Delaware on the eleventh day of July, 1911. She had not actually lived here two years prior to the bringing of this action, but it is not necessary in this action. She is the daughter of Mrs. Frazier, who has always lived here. The defendant ran away with her when she was a child, fourteen years old.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-15\">In the plaintiff\u2019s petition, which is sworn to, it is averred that she finally left her husband and came to Delaware to remain, on the eleventh day of July, 1911. In respect to the jurisdiction of the court in divorce cases where the service cannot be personal, the statute, <em>Chapter </em>221, <em>Volume </em>24, <em>Delaware Laws, Section </em>11, provides as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u201cWhen the defendant cannot be served personally within this state, and when at the time of the commencement of the action the plaintiff is a <em>bona fide </em>resident of this state, jurisdiction for the purpose of divorce, whether absolute or from bed and board, may be acquired by publication as hereinbefore provided, to be followed where practicable by service upon or notice to the defendant without this state, under the following conditions:</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">\u201c (a) When, at the time the cause of action arose, the plaintiff was a <em>bona fide </em>resident of this state, and has continued so to be down to the time of the commencement of the action; except that no action for absolute divorce shall be commenced for any cause other than adultery or bigamy, unless the plaintiff has been for the two years next preceding the commencement of the action a <em>bona fide </em>resident of this state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-6\">\u201c (b) When, since the cause of action arose, the plaintiff has become, and for at least two years next preceding the commencement of the action has continued to be, a <em>bona fide </em>resident of this state: Provided, the cause of action alleged was recognized in the jurisdiction in which the plaintiff resided at the'time the cause of action arose, as a ground for the same relief asked for in the action in this state.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b67-7\">Pennewill, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"AD\">It clearly appears from the petition, as well as from the testimony and admission of counsel, that the plaintiff was not a resident of this state at the time the adultery is alleged to have been committed, and also that she had not resided in this state for two years thereafter, and up to the commencement of this action. The court is, therefore, without jurisdiction of the cause. The divorce must be refused and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In an action for divorce, where the ground relied upon is adultery or bigamy, and the defendant cannot be served personally, in order that the court may have jurisdiction, there must have been publication as provided by the act, and the plaintiff must either have been a <em>bona fide </em>resident of the state at the time the cause of action arose, and continued so to be down to the time of the commencement of the action, or must, since the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>of action arose, have become, and for at least two years next preceding the commencement of the action continued to be, a <em>bona fide </em>resident of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The petition is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
