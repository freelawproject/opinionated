Montgomery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> One of the results of the contract between the parties was to create a bailment of the property in question. Upon the delivery of the property to the defendant the latter acquired a special property therein which carried with it a right of possession until the contract was fully performed or terminated. And until the completion or termination of the contract the plaintiff did not have a right of possession of the property. After the property had been delivered to the defendant, and after one or more deliveries of the lamp burners had been made, the plaintiff sent the following letter to the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">\u201cPhiladelphia, Pa., May 16, 1911.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADM\">\u201cThe Delaware Marine Supply Mfg. Co., Concord Pike, Wilmington, Del.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">\u201cGentlemen:\u2014Referring to our contract with your company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>by which you were to make, of proper efficiency, quantities of lamps as set out in the contract and in accordance with our correspondence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">\u201cWe greatly regret that you have utterly failed either to make the lamps properly or to deliver them within the time agreed upon. Having given you repeated notices of what we would be obliged to do, and having given you all of the assistance in our power, by resolution of the board of directors of this company, you: are notified that the contract has been, and is hereby rescinded, and you will please bring about the return to us, without delay, the balance of the one thousand dollars deposit made under the contract, and all tools and property in your possession belonging to us. ' -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">\u201cIn our desire to \u00e1ssist you, the suggestion was made by the writer that we might buy from you certain presses and material, but the sum put upon same is so far beyond what would interest us, that the suggestion will have to be dropped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">\u201cWill you kindly acknowledge receipt of this letter, sending us a short form of order upon the Trust Company authorizing it to pay to us the balance of deposit above referred to, and please indicate a time when we may send for the material belonging to us. Very truly yours, Phila. Lamp Mfg. Co., Henry N. Kerr, Vice-President.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">This letter was duly received by the defendant\u2019 company.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">\u2022 [2] The effect of this letter was a distinct and unequivocal repudiation or rescission of the contract, and it not only relieved but prevented the defendant from further performance of the contract, leaving the latter to recover whatever damages, if any, it may have suffered. Whether the rescission of the contract was warranted on the part of the plaintiff is unimportant in this action. For if the rescission was warranted the right to immediate possession of the property unquestionably passed to the plaintiff, and if the rescission was not warranted the right to the immediate possession of the property passed, in this instance, equally to the plaintiff because the defendant had no lien upon the property and no further right to use it. In other words, even if the rescission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>was unwarranted, the defendant had no right to continue to produce the burners and thus add to its damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The purpose of the' bailment having been terminated by the rescission, the bailment itself thereupon ended, and the plaintiff\u2019s right of possession became immediate.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Gentlemen of the Jury:\u2014For the reasons assigned, we direct you to return a verdict for the plaintiff, which will be for six cents as for nominal damages, besides costs of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
