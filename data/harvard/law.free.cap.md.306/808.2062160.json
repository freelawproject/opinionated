We shall disbar.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The allegations of misconduct by Morehead arose from two complaints, the first submitted by Dr. Marc A. Berman and the second initiated by Mrs. Kathleen Anderson and Mrs. Mable Hall Clark. Regarding the first complaint, Bar Counsel alleged violation of Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A)(1), (3), (4), (5), and (6); 9-102(A)(l) and (2); and 9-102(B)(l), (2), (3), and (4), as well as a violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1981 Repl.Vol., 1985 Cum. Supp.) Art. 10, \u00a7 44.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As to the second complaint, Bar Counsel alleged violation of Discipli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>nary Rules 1-102(A)(1), (5), and (6); 2-106(A); 6-101(A)(3); and 7-101(A)(l), (2), and (3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">The matter was referred for hearing to one of the judges of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City pursuant to Rule BV9. Pertaining to the Berman complaint, he found that Morehead had been retained by Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Watkins in December 1981 to represent them in a personal injury matter. Mr. Watkins had been treated by Dr. Raymond D. Drapkin from December 1981 through May 1982. He had subsequently been treated by Dr. Marc A. Berman, a chiropractor, from January 1983 through May 1983. According to his agreement with his clients, Morehead was to pay these health care practitioners for their services from the proceeds of insurance checks issued to his clients by Nationwide Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">In late January or February 1983, the Respondent received a draft in the amount of $1,230.00, issued by Nationwide on January 24, 1983, $1,055.00 of which reflected a claim for payment of medical expenses billed for treatment rendered by Dr. Drapkin to Mr. Watkins. This draft was deposited in Respondent\u2019s escrow account on February 4, 1983. He received a second draft in the amount of $805.00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>on August 8, 1983, reflecting payment of a similar claim for treatment rendered by Dr. Berman to Mr. Watkins. Also on August 8, Respondent received a $5,000.00 check from Nationwide representing full settlement of Mr. Watkins\u2019 liability claim. On August 9, 1983, Respondent deposited the $5,000.00 draft and the $805.00 draft in his escrow account. He paid Mr. Watkins $3,335.00 and retained $1,665.00 as a legal fee for services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">The trial judge further found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-5\">\u201c[Djuring the months of September, October, and November through the date of November 16,1983, as a result of withdrawals made by Mr. Morehead from his escrow account for purposes other than to satisfy the payment of escrow bills, the balance of funds remaining in Mr. More-head\u2019s escrow account fell below that sufficient to insure the payment of outstanding obligations due to be paid from his escrow account. In fact, by November 16, 1983, Mr. Morehead had reached a negative balance of $36.99.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANb\">Morehead admitted that the checks drawn to himself out of his escrow account were for his own benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Dr. Drapkin was paid by the Respondent on March 20, 1984. Dr. Berman was finally paid on October 19, 1984, two months after he filed a complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission. With that remittance to Dr. Berman, Respondent included a letter explaining the reasons for the late payment. In paragraphs seven and eight of that letter, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-7\">\u201c(7) Our records indicate two (2) payments for medicals for Mr. Watkins, following settlement of his case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-8\">\u201c(8) We have finally been able to determine, from correlation of your corresponsence [sic], cancelled checks, etc., that both payments were made to Dr. Drapkin, thus, our problem in determining that your account remained open.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">When questioned by Bar Counsel, Morehead admitted that only one payment had actually been made to Dr. Drapkin on behalf of Mr. Watkins and that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>correspondence evidencing such a problem. After analyzing the various excuses given by Respondent for his failure to pay the doctors on time, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-4\">\u201cThe problem with Mr. Morehead\u2019s reasoning is that it has no effect and offers no explanation for his failure to pay Drs. Berman and Drapkin promptly from the monies received from settlement, which was held apparently on August 9,1983, with his clients, at which time the balance of monies received from Nationwide, including a check for $805.00 owing to Dr. Berman, was deposited in Mr.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Morehead\u2019s First National Bank escrow account____</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-6\">\u201cMore serious is Mr. Morehead\u2019s apparent inaccuracy contained in his letter of October 19, 1984, at which time he forwarded a check to Dr. Berman for the balance due him on behalf of Mr. Watkins. This Court has examined paragraphs 7 and 8 at length both in its final recital and in its analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-7\">\u201cAfter having heard Mr. Morehead testify at great length in the case at hand, this Court cannot state that Mr. Morehead clearly and deliberately lied to Dr. Berman in order to weave a web of conspiracy and defense to protect himself from future proceedings which might be on the horizon____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-8\">\u201cThis Court cannot say from clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Morehead deliberately lied to Dr. Berman in his letter of October 19, 1984.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">As to Bar Counsel\u2019s charges, the trial court found that violations of DR 1-102(A)(1) and DR 9-102(A)(2) as well as Art. 10, \u00a7 44 had been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">With respect to the second complaint, that of Kathleen Anderson and Mable Hall Clark, the trial judge found that the Respondent had been retained in January of 1983 by these women to investigate the suspicious circumstances surrounding the 1981 death of James E. Hall, Mrs. Clark\u2019s son and Mrs. Anderson\u2019s grandson. In return for a retainer of $3,500.00 and a fee of $85.00 an hour for his services, plus costs, Respondent agreed to investigate Hall\u2019s death, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>consult with witnesses, retain a private investigative service, collate facts, consult with his clients \u201cat all appropriate times\u201d throughout the investigation and forward a monthly accounting of expenses \u201cor as necessary.\u201d Morehead confirmed the terms of this agreement in a letter written January 17, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The trial judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-5\">\u201c[T]he services rendered by Mr. Morehead to Mrs. Anderson and Mrs. Clark were not only minimal in nature, but despite the prior training and experience of Mr. More-head, which will clearly indicate that he did or should have had knowledge of how to conduct such an investigation, was not only inadequate, but bordering on non-existent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">He characterized Morehead\u2019s testimony as \u201cexaggerated\u201d and \u201cnothing short of incredible.\u201d In fact, the court found \u201cthat the absence of notes or other evidentiary material, either in the file or in Mr. \u2022 Morehead\u2019s memory, is clearly evidence that little such work was actually accomplished.\u201d He further found that the \u201cExhibits clearly show that he did not conduct a proper investigation. In short, the file is a mess, unorganized, and lacking of any evidence of either consistent work or competent work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Therefore, the trial judge found that Bar Counsel had established violations of DR 1-102(A)(1) and (5); DR 2-106(A); and DR 6-101(A)(3) with respect to this complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Both Bar Counsel and Morehead have filed exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">a. (1)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">Bar Counsel excepts to the trial judge\u2019s failure to find that Respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(3) and (4) with respect to the Berman complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, Bar Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>sel argues that \u201cin light of the facts adduced at trial, the conclusion that he violated these rules is inescapable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7u2\">At trial, it was shown that by August 1983 Respondent had deposited his client\u2019s PIP funds totaling $1,860 into his own escrow account. Checks were written from the escrow account, payable to Respondent, from August 1983 until November 1983 by which time the balance in the account had been reduced to a negative figure. Respondent gave no explanation at trial and admitted that the bank records of transactions for that period were accurate. At oral argument, while indicating the possibility of a bookkeeping error, counsel for Respondent was still unable to explain the negative balance in the escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">This Court dealt with a similar case of misappropriation in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Boehm, </em>293 Md. 476, 446 A.2d 52 (1982). There Boehm deposited monies from an auction of the decedent\u2019s business property into his own general escrow account. There, too, the escrow account ultimately showed a negative balance. After examining the bank statements the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-5\">\u201cWe cannot conceive of any clearer or more convincing evidence of Boehm\u2019s misappropriation of Johns Estate funds than that supplied by the escrow account, bank records, and Boehm\u2019s failure to explain exactly how these funds were used.\u201d 293 Md. at 481, 446 A.2d at 54.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acue\">We agree with the contentions of Bar Counsel that Morehead\u2019s conduct in using the funds of his client for his own benefit constitutes misappropriation. As we stated of Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A)(3) in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Willemain, </em>305 Md. 665, 675, 506 A.2d 245, 250 (1986), \u201c[t]his rule pertains to engaging in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude. Misappropriation of the funds of others by an attorney is such conduct.\u201d Therefore, Bar Counsel\u2019s exception is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Bar Counsel also excepts to the trial judge\u2019s failure to find that Respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4) involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in connection with his transmittal of a letter dated October 19, 1984, to Dr. Berman in which he attempted to explain the reasons for the delay in payment of his client\u2019s medical bill. The letter stated that Respondent\u2019s \u201crecords indicate two (2) payments for medicals for Mr. Watkins, following settlement of his case,\u201d and \u201c... both payments were made to Dr. Drapkin----\u201d No such records exist and the Respondent admitted as much. A copy of this letter was also forwarded to assistant Bar Counsel in response to the complaint filed by Dr. Berman.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">The trial judge found that although respondent was \u201cless than candid with Dr. Berman,\u201d he could not state that Respondent had \u201cclearly and deliberately lied.\u201d We disagree with the trial judge\u2019s finding. To the contrary, we find that this conduct illustrates dishonesty. This exception is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Finally, Bar Counsel excepts to the trial judge\u2019s failure to find a violation of DR 9-102(B)(4), which requires an attorney to \u201cpromptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by a client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive.\u201d Bar Counsel\u2019s contention requires this Court to consider whether DR 9-102(B)(4) requires counsel promptly to remit a client\u2019s funds to third parties for the account of the client where the client has authorized the attorney so to remit. We believe it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Velasquez, </em>301 Md. 450, 483 A.2d 354 (1984), Velasquez had received a check in the amount of $2,522.40 from GEICO on November 22, 1982, representing settlement of a client\u2019s personal injury claim. He deposited the check into an escrow account and paid the client $1,301.27. He also wrote a $522.00 check to his client\u2019s sole treating physician, a Dr. Owens, and retained the remaining funds as a fee. Velasquez continued to write checks on the account for various business and personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>expenses. Dr. Owens was unable to cash the check on two occasions because of insufficient funds in the escrow account. Finally, on March 30, Valasquez sent Dr. Owens a treasurer\u2019s check in payment of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Bar Counsel excepted in that case to the trial judge\u2019s failure to find a DR 9-102(B)(4) violation, as he does here. This Court sustained the exception, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-5\">\u201cVelasquez obviously did not pay over when he was supposed to do so. Thus, there was a violation of this rule.\u201d 301 Md. at 458, 483 A.2d at 358.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Other jurisdictions have held that a lawyer\u2019s obligation extends to making payments to third parties out of client funds as directed by the client. <em>See, People v. Johnson, </em>627 P.2d 748 (Colo. 1981); <em>The Florida Bar v. Merritt, </em>394 So.2d 1018 (Fla.1981); <em>In re Robison, </em>519 S.W.2d 1 (Mo.1975); <em>Matter of Lee, </em>283 N.W.2d 179 (N.D.1979); and <em>Warner v. State Bar, </em>34 Cal.3d 36, 192 Cal.Rptr. 244, 664 P.2d 148 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">We conclude that Morehead\u2019s conduct here in failing to pay Dr. Drapkin and Dr. Berman for over a year constitutes a violation of DR 9-102(B)(4). Thus, Bar Counsel\u2019s exception is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Bar Counsel took no exceptions to the trial judge\u2019s findings or conclusions in the Anderson and Clark matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">Morehead has filed numerous exceptions to the trial judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings, findings of fact, and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">Morehead excepts to the refusal of the circuit court to permit into evidence several of the unanimous conclusions of the Inquiry Panel. In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. McBurney, </em>282 Md. 116, 122, 383 A.2d 58, 62 (1978), we stated that we regarded the Inquiry Panel procedure as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>similar to a grand jury presentment. We further noted that no provision existed by which the testimony taken before the Inquiry Panel was to be filed with us or used as evidence before us. There is no requirement that any conclusion drawn be binding on this Court as \u201cthe ultimate decision as to whether an attorney has or has not been guilty of misconduct is to be made by us.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122. Thus Morehead\u2019s exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Morehead similarly excepts to the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit Respondent to respond to his counsel\u2019s question as to whether a check, drawn on his client escrow account, had ever been dishonored. The trial judge refused to permit an inquiry into what Morehead had done in other cases because it was immaterial to these particular proceedings. We approve of such a ruling and overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Morehead excepts to the conclusion in the Watkins matter that he violated DR 9-102(A)(2) which requires an attorney to deposit all funds of a client into one or more identifiable bank accounts. This provision requires an attorney not only to deposit but also to maintain the identity of a client\u2019s funds therein. Thus, in accordance with our finding of misappropriation above, this exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Because we affirmed the trial judge\u2019s finding of a DR 9-102(A)(2) violation in b(3) above, we find no merit in Morehead\u2019s exception to the circuit court\u2019s finding in the Watkins matter of a violation of DR 1-102 which states that \u201ca lawyer shall not violate a Disciplinary Rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">(5)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">Morehead excepts to the trial judge\u2019s finding in the Watkins matter of a violation of Art. 10, \u00a7 44(b) to the extent that it involves intent and willfulness. To the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>trary, he contends, the \u201cuncontroverted evidence impels the conclusion that all checks negotiated by Respondent were for fees which he had earned.\u201d As Bar Counsel points out, Morehead testified that he examined his bank statements during the months of September, October and November and found no problems. He must therefore have been aware of the dwindling balance and must have willfully continued to draw checks to himself regardless. The escrow account reached a negative balance. The facts show a clear violation of Art. 10, \u00a7 44 (b). Morehead\u2019s exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">(6)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">With regard to the Anderson-Clark matter, Morehead has filed several exceptions. We have reviewed the record and find these exceptions to be without merit. Because we conclude that the trial judge did not clearly err in his findings of fact or in the conclusions he drew from the evidence, we overrule these exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">In cases of this nature, we have often quoted Judge Digges\u2019 opinion in <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 307 A.2d 677 (1973), where he said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-8\">\u201cWe, therefore, conclude that when a member of the bar of this Court is found to have betrayed the high trust imposed in him by appropriating to his own use funds of others entrusted to him, as Marshall did, then, absent the most compelling extenuating circumstances, which we do not find to be present here, disbarment should follow as a matter of course.\u201d 269 Md. at 520, 307 A.2d 682.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">The facts before us indicate conduct involving misappropriation of funds, dishonesty, and failure to pay over a client\u2019s funds to a third party as requested by the client. In addition, the trial judge found that Respondent had failed to act competently, had failed to preserve the identity of his clients\u2019 funds, and had charged an excessive fee. No evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>dence of any compelling extenuating circumstances have been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">In fulfilling our duty to protect the public, we conclude that disbarment is the appropriate sanction in this case. It follows that the name of Nathaniel Walter Morehead shall be stricken from the rolls of those entitled to practice law in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE BV15(c) FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST NATHANIEL WALTER MOREHEAD.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-6\">.
