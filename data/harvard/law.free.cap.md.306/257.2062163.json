The last day of the period so computed is to be included unless: (1) It is a Sunday or a legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day, which is neither a Sunday or a holiday; or, (2) the act to be done is the filing of some paper in court and the office of the clerk of said court on said last day of the period is not open, or is closed for a part of a day, in which event, the period runs until the end of the next day which is neither a Sunday, Saturday, a legal holiday, or a day on which the said office is not open the entire day during ordinary business hours.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">On April 16, 1981, Dr. David Jalowsky completed an application for life insurance with The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States (Equitable). Edward and Fay Jalowsky, his parents, were designated as beneficiaries. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Dr. Jalowsky indicated in his insurance application that he had never been treated for cancer and that he had not consulted a physician over the preceding five years. These representations were false as Dr. Jalowsky was undergoing treatment for Hodgkin\u2019s Disease, a form of cancer, at the time he completed the application. Moreover, in March of 1981, the month prior to his application, the insured underwent a supraclavicular node biopsy, a laparotomy, a splenectomy and iliac biopsies.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The insurance policy contained the following incontestability clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">\u201cINCONTESTABILITY. All statements made in the application are representations and not warranties. We have the right to contest the validity of this policy based on material misstatements made in the application. However, this policy will become incontestable after it has been in effect during the lifetime of the Insured for two years from the Date of Issue shown on page 3.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">April 16, 1981 was the date upon which the policy was issued. Dr. Jalowsky died on April 16, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The Jalowskys filed a claim for the policy proceeds which Equitable rejected because of the insured\u2019s misrepresentations as to the state of his health. Thereafter, the beneficiaries instituted suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to recover the policy proceeds. Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed on the issue of the calculation of the two-year period in the incontestability clause. The court (Cicone, J.) ruled that the life insurance policy was in effect on April 16, 1981 and as that day was included in the calculation of the two-year incontestability period, the beneficiaries were entitled to recover. The court held that Art. 94, \u00a7 2 could not override a provision in an insurance contract, especially in light of the provisions of Art. 48A, \u00a7 390, measuring the two-year incontestability period from the day of the policy\u2019s issuance. On appeal, the intermediate appellate court affirmed, placing reliance upon our decision in <em>Holtze v. Equitable Life Assurance, </em>276 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>681, 351 A.2d 139 (1976). We granted certiorari to consider the important issue raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Equitable contends that \u00a7 2 of Art. 94 is applicable in this case and operates to exclude April 16, 1981, the date of issue of the policy, and include April 16, 1983, the date of the insured\u2019s death, which was within the period of contest-ability. Pursuant to the statutory language of Art. 94, \u00a7 2, Equitable asserts that the two-year incontestability clause is \u201cprescribed by statute\u201d (Art. 48A, \u00a7 390) and consequently the date of issue is a day or event under \u00a7 2 which is \u201cnot to be included\u201d in the time computation. Conversely, the Jalowskys posit that Art. 94, \u00a7 2 is simply inapplicable in this case and that Art. 48A, \u00a7 390 is the controlling statute. Under this view, the two-year period, during which the policy was subject to contest, commenced on April 16, 1981 and concluded on April 15, 1983, one day prior to the death of the insured. The Jalowskys rely, as did the intermediate appellate court, upon <em>Holtze v. Equitable Life Assurance, supra, </em>as precedent for this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\"><em>Holtze </em>concerned the timing of an incontestability clause in a life insurance policy and required a determination as to which of two dates triggered the two-year period. Procedurally, <em>Holtze </em>originated in the federal district court and reached us <em>vis-a-vis </em>two certified questions, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">\u201c(i) What items in the record [of this case] constitute the \u2018written instrument in which the contract is set forth\u2019 for purposes of Code [(1957, 1972 Repl.Vol.) Art. 48A, \u00a7 364]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">(ii) What was the \u2018date of issue\u2019 of the involved policy <em>(i.e., </em>the \u2018written instrument in which the contract of insurance is set forth\u2019) for purposes of Code [(1957, 1972 Repl.Vol.) Art. 48A, \u00a7 390]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">276 Md. at 682-83, 351 A.2d 139.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The incontestability clause in <em>Holtze </em>provided that the policy would be incontestable, \u201cexcept for non-payment of premiums, after it [had] been in force during the lifetime of the Insured for two years from the Date of Issue shown on page three.\u201d Page three reflected November 28, 1969 as the date of issue. The conditional premium receipt was dated October 24, 1969 and the first premium was paid on that date. The insured died on November 19, 1971. When the insured\u2019s beneficiary attempted to collect the policy proceeds, the insurer rejected the claim on the basis of misrepresentation regarding the medical history contained in Holtze\u2019s application. The insurer contended that Holtze died within two years of November 28, 1969\u2014the date reflected in the policy\u2014and, hence, it had the right to contest the policy. The beneficiary maintained that the death did not occur within two years of October 24, 1969\u2014 the date of the conditional receipt\u2014and therefore the policy was incontestable.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">We held that the date of issue was the date of the conditional receipt. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\u201cOn the facts before us, we hold that (1) the conditional receipt, together with Parts I and II of the application, are part of the \u2018written instrument in which the contract is set forth,\u2019 (2) \u2018the date of issue\u2019 of \u2018the written instrument in which the contract of insurance is set forth\u2019 was October 24, 1969, and that the two-year period of contest-ability commenced to run on that date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688-89, 351 A.2d 139.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">The Jalowskys conclude that <em>Holtze </em>is a flat holding that the date of issuance is included when computing the two-year period of contestability. We think this reading is overbroad. A review of our opinion in <em>Holtze </em>and the briefs filed by the parties indicate that the applicability of Art. 94, \u00a7 2 was not before the Court. Hence, we did not conclude in <em>Holtze </em>that, notwithstanding Art. 94, \u00a7 2, the day upon which the policy was issued commenced the running of the incontestability period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">It is the general common law rule that when time is to be computed from a particular day, act or event, the designated first day is excluded and the last day of the period is included. 6 G. Couch, <em>Cyclopedia of Insurance Law </em>\u00a7 31:24, at 40 (2d ed. 1985). Early on, our predecessors observed that \u201cthe tendency of modern cases is to exclude the day of the act or event, unless for a special reason, it may be necessary to include it.\u201d <em>Calvert v. Williams, </em>34 Md. 672, 674 (1871). Statutes governing time computations, which call for exclusion of the first day and the inclusion of the last, are essentially codifications of the general common law rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Couch, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 31:24, at 40. Article 94, \u00a7 2, which was originally enacted as ch. 522 of the Acts of 1941, is thus a codification of the common law rule. Its purpose, as described in the Act\u2019s title, was to establish \u201ca <em>uniform </em>method of computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by the rules of any court, or by order of Court, or by any applicable statute.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Article 48A, \u00a7 390 was initially enacted by ch. 19 of the Acts of 1956, fifteen years after the Legislature codified its policy for the uniform computation of time \u201cprescribed or allowed by any applicable statute.\u201d Art. 94, \u00a7 2. Section 390 of Art. 48A specifically provides that an insurance company cannot in any way protest the payment of the proceeds of a life insurance policy after said policy \u201chas been in force during the lifetime of the insured for a period of two (2) years from its date of issue.\u201d Clearly, this provision was intended to protect the insured, together with the policy beneficiary, from either the nonpayment or dilatory payment of proceeds by the insurer. Of course, the purpose of incontestability provisions is \u201cto put a checkmate upon litigation; to prevent, after the lapse of a certain period of time, an expensive resort to the courts\u2014expensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>both from the point of view of the litigants and that of the citizens of the state.\u201d 1A J. Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 311, at 311 (rev. 1981); <em>see generally Suskind v. North American Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>607 F.2d 76 (3d Cir.1979) (discussing history of incontestability clauses).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">It is thus clear that Art. 48A, \u00a7 390 contains a two-year limitation for contesting an insurance policy while Art. 94, \u00a7 2 addresses the computation of time periods contained in applicable statutes. Both statutes relate, at least in part, to the same subject matter\u2014that of time. We have long held that \u201cin construing legislative enactments, all statutes relating to the same subject matter are to be considered and harmonized as far as possible.\u201d <em>May v. Warnick, </em>227 Md. 77, 83, 175 A.2d 413 (1961); <em>see also Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, </em>281 Md. 412, 418, 379 A.2d 1007 (1977) (citations omitted); <em>Smith v. Gray Concrete Pipe Co., </em>267 Md. 149, 155, 297 A.2d 721 (1972). In addition, there is a \u201cpolicy that statutes are not to be construed to alter the common-law by implication.\u201d <em>Hardy v. State, </em>301 Md. 124, 131, 482 A.2d 474 (1984); <em>see also Bradshaw v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>284 Md. 294, 302, 396 A.2d 255 (1979); <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, supra, </em>281 Md. at 419, 379 A.2d 1007 (citations omitted); <em>Lutz v. State, </em>167 Md. 12, 15, 172 A. 354 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">As previously indicated, Art. 94, \u00a7 2 codified the then existing common law rule for computing time. In this regard, the General Assembly \u201cis presumed to have had, and acted with respect to, full knowledge and information as to prior and existing law and legislation on the subject of the statute and the policy of the prior law.\u201d <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, supra, </em>281 Md. at 419, 379 A.2d 1007. Article 94, \u00a7 2 preceded Art. 48A, \u00a7 390; hence, the General Assembly is presumed to have had full knowledge of its content and underlying policy when it passed Art. 48A, \u00a7 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Pursuant to Art. 94, \u00a7 2, the policy of this State is to employ a uniform method of time computation. Indeed, this uniform statutory method has been applied in a variety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>of situations. <em>See, e.g., Yingling v. Smith, </em>259 Md. 260, 269 A.2d 612 (1970) (in determining six-month statute of limitations for filing suit against an executor, Art. 94, \u00a7 2 clearly requires that the date upon which the executor was appointed be excluded); <em>Durham v. Walters, </em>59 Md.App. 1, 474 A.2d 523 (1984) (applying Art. 94, \u00a7 2 to six-month period to file a caveat against a will); 64 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 20 (1979) (determining seven-day period required for notice of intent to exceed constant yield tax rate); 60 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 439 (1975) (determining one-year period to claim lottery prize).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">In the last Attorney General opinion cited, the date of the lottery drawing was December 6, 1973 and the one-year period, under Art. 94, \u00a7 2, was deemed to commence formally on December 7, 1973 and terminate on December 6, 1974. After noting that result, the following observation was made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\u201c[W]e realize that winning tickets are in fact presented for claim and processing on the day of the drawing itself____ [T]he holder of a winning ticket for the December 6, 1973, drawing could have presented such a ticket on that day. Section 16 of the State Lottery Law, however, appears primarily intended to put players on notice of the time at which the claim period expires, rather than to set a rigid time of commencement for the one year period. Obviously, claim may not be made until the drawing has been completed, and acceptance of claims on the date of the drawing is entirely consonant with this purpose.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Evidently, the State Lottery Commission put forth an argument similar to that of the Jalowskys; that is, if the date of the drawing is excluded, the winner receives one year and one day to claim the prize. The quoted language indicates that the Attorney General found no substance in the \u201cextra day\u201d argument. Like the lottery provisions, the primary intent of \u00a7 390 of Art. 48A is to put insurers and insureds on notice of the time during which a policy can be contested, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>rather than delineating a rigid time of commencement for the two-year incontestability period.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">In its opinion, the Court of Special Appeals pointed out that if the first day is excluded in the computation of the two-year period of contestability, the insurance company is permitted two years and one day to contest the policy. We think the \u201cextra day\u201d argument is of no import for it could be asserted each time a statute contains a notice provision and Art. 94, \u00a7 2 is applied to compute the time period. The short answer is that Art. 94, \u00a7 2\u2019s exclusion of \u201cthe day of the act, event, or default\u201d represents the uniform statutory policy of this State. By excluding \u201cthe day of the act, event, or default,\u201d the limitations period commences on the following first full day. We find this to be equitable for two reasons. First, a set method of time computation brings a degree of certainty to the law. Second, by excluding the first day and counting from the first whole day following the event, a party will not be prejudiced if the triggering event occurs toward the end of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Since both Art. 94, \u00a7 2 and Art. 48A, \u00a7 390 relate to the computation of time, and there is no indication that the General Assembly intended to exempt Art. 48A, \u00a7 390 from the general dictates of Art. 94, \u00a7 2, the two statutes must be construed in harmony and full effect accorded to each. Pursuant to this maxim of statutory construction, the date of issue\u2014April 16, 1981\u2014must be excluded from the computation of the two-year period in this case. Accordingly, April 16, 1983, the date on which the insured died, falls within the two-year period during which the insurer could contest the validity of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Some jurisdictions have reached results that tend to support the position of the Jalowskys in this case. <em>See generally </em>18 G. Couch, <em>Cyclopedia of Insurance Law </em>\u00a7 72:40 2d ed. 1985; 1A J. Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 312, at 329 (rev. 1981). We do not find the cases there cited to be persuasive or particularly applicable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>proceeding now before us. For instance, several of these cases held that a general statute as to time computation was not applicable to private contracts of insurance. <em>See, e.g., Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Alsop, </em>191 Ind. 638, 134 N.E. 290 (1922); <em>Ratcliff v. Louisiana Industrial Life Ins. Co., </em>185 La. 557, 169 So. 572 (1936); <em>Prudential Insurance Co. of America v. Rhodriquez, </em>285 So.2d 689 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.1973). But this reasoning is not applicable, as Equitable points out, because the incontestability provision in this case is not the result of arms-length contractual negotiations between the parties, but instead is mandated by statute\u2014Art. 48A, \u00a7 390. Moreover, if a conflict arose between the provisions of an insurance policy and a governing statute, the latter would control. <em>See generally Casualty Co. v. Hinds, </em>180 Md. 676, 679, 26 A.2d 761 (1942). Hence, the aforecited cases, as well as other cases which our research has uncovered, are inapposite. In at least three such cases, it was held that a general statute as to time computation did not apply because an insurance statute was more specific and indicated an intent to include the first day upon which coverage was effective. <em>See Nabor v. Occidental Life Ins. Co., Etc., </em>78 Ill.App.3d 288, 33 Ill.Dec. 543, 396 N.E.2d 1267 (1979); <em>Moore v. Industrial Life Ins. Co., </em>549 S.W.2d 47 (Tex.Civ.App.1977); <em>Acme Life Ins. Co. v. White, </em>99 S.W.2d 1059 (Tex.Civ.App.1936). However, as we have already indicated, this is simply not the law in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Cases in other jurisdictions which have considered the time computation for measuring the commencement of an incontestability provision have, as here, excluded the first day\u2014the day of issue. <em>See, e.g., Mutual Ins. Co. v. Hurni Co., </em>263 U.S. 167, 44 S.Ct. 90, 68 L.Ed. 235 (1923) (dicta); <em>Franklin Life Insurance Company v. Bieniek, </em>312 F.2d 365 (3d Cir.1962) (analogizing period delineated in an incontestability clause to a statute of limitations); <em>New York Life Ins. Co. v. Bullock, </em>26 F.2d 666 (5th Cir.1928) (following well-settled general rule to exclude first day); <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Lodzinski, </em>122 N.J.Eq. 404, 194 A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>79 (1937) (following general rule in New Jersey to exclude first day).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In sum, even though some jurisdictions have deviated from the general rule of excluding the first day in computing a period of time delineated in an incontestability provision, the legislature did not intend that Art. 48A, \u00a7 390 should be exempted from the policy of uniformity mandated by Art. 94, \u00a7 2. Accordingly, in this case, April 16, 1981\u2014 the date of issue\u2014must be excluded in computing the two-year period during which the life insurance policy remains contestable. Therefore, the period of contestability terminated on April 16, 1983, the date the insured died, and Equitable\u2019s contest was timely. The circuit court erred in granting the Jalowskys\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">JUDGMENT OF COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY FOR THE ENTRY OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR THE APPELLANT.
