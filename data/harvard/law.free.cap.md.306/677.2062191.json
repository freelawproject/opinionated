McCloskey, a member of the Maryland Bar since November 10,1954. The petition alleged violation of Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A)(1), (4), and (5); 2-101(A)(2), (3), and (4); 2-109(1); 6-101(A)(l), and (2); and 7-102(A)(8).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Pursuant to Rule BV9 b we referred the matter for hearing to a judge of the Third Judicial Circuit of Maryland. He has filed a comprehensive report with us. After setting forth the bases of the three complaints, the report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">\n<em>\u201cGeneral Findings of Fact</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFM\">\u201cPrefatory to addressing the three complaints individually, we first note findings of fact that are applicable generally to all the complaints and, therefore, provide a framework for the subsequent discussion. These findings of fact concern:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>\u201c1. The Respondent\u2019s role in running the business known as \u2018Divorce Services,\u2019 and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-4\">\u201c2. The applicability of the Disciplinary Rules to the Respondent in his role as \u2018Divorce Services.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">\u201cAs to the first concern, this Court finds that Respondent is solely responsible for conducting the business known as .\u2018Divorce Services.\u2019 The Court has also considered Respondent\u2019s work history since his admission to the Maryland Bar in 1954. The evidence clearly indicates that following his ten year partnership in a Baltimore law firm, Respondent gave up the general practice of law in order to pursue the business of appraising and buying antiques. Notwithstanding this, it is uncontroverted that Mr. McCloskey at no time changed his status as an attorney during his fifteen years as an antique dealer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court further finds that the actions and activities connected with the running of the business known as \u2018Divorce Services\u2019 clearly involved Respondent acting as a lawyer. The Respondent himself admitted on the stand that much of the advice given to clients on the telephone did clearly involve knowledge of the law. Mr. McCloskey stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">\u2018See, my problem is I did not consider the fact that I was practicing law. I\u2019m starting to realize now, after all of this, that perhaps I was, and I made a terrible, terrible mistake.\u2019 (T.26).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">\u201cThe Court also notes that even though the actual cases were handled by the foreign attorney, and even though Respondent acted under a trade name, McCloskey further represented himself as a qualified attorney by sending out business cards which read \u2018James B. McCloskey, Attorney-at-Law,\u2019 regardless of the fact that such cards may have been sent in some cases <em>after </em>the foreign divorces were procured. (T. 15, 74).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>\u201cAs to the applicability of the Disciplinary Rules to the Respondent in this case, the Court heard argument that in his role as owner of the referral business known as \u2018Divorce Services,\u2019 Mr. McCloskey was not subject to these rules. Clearly, the Disciplinary Rules set out what \u2018a lawyer\u2019 may or may not do. However, in light of the previous discussion, the Court concludes that Mr. McCloskey was clearly acting as a lawyer, and thus was subject at all times to these rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-4\">\n<em>\u201cFindings of Fact: \u2018O\u2019Meara Complaint\u2019</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2p\">\u201cPursuant to obtaining their respective divorces, Mr. and Mrs. O\u2019Meara responded to an advertisement in the <em>National Enquirer, </em>a nationwide publication, which was placed by Respondent and which read:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">\u2018DIVORCE, QUICKIE, Dominican Republic. From $275.00\u2014\u201cOne Day\u201d Qualified Attorney. James McCloskey, 800-638-1862. Validity varies by State.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsR\">Respondent admits responsibility for placing this ad, and for procuring and maintaining an \u2018800\u2019 telephone number. Respondent further admits that the phrase \u2018validity varies by State\u2019 was required by the <em>Enquirer, </em>and was not included in similar ads he placed in other local and national publications. It is further uncontroverted that Respondent advised Mrs. O\u2019Meara by telephone as to the procedure for obtaining a \u2018Dominican divorce,\u2019 sent her a packet of information, and received a fee for his services. Again, this Court rejects the contention that such fee was merely for \u2018referral,\u2019 due to the legal nature of the advice given. It is also noted, by Respondent\u2019s own admission on the stand, that proper research was not conducted as to Louisiana law and recognition <em>vel non </em>of foreign divorce decrees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">\u201cThe statutory law of Louisiana in fact provides that divorces obtained in foreign jurisdictions are invalid.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Louisiana law further illustrates that although one may be estopped from attacking the validity of a subsequent marriage, a prior divorce obtained by a spouse who trav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>eled to a foreign jurisdiction for the sole purpose of obtaining said divorce nevertheless would be deemed a nullity. <em>Super v. Burke, </em>(1979 La.App.) 367 So.2d 93, cert. gr. (La.) 369 So.2d 466.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-4\">\u201cIn this case, the Court finds that Respondent misrepresented to the O\u2019Mearas his knowledge of the law. As stated previously, Respondent did little or no research in the area of recognition of foreign divorce decrees in the various jurisdictions of the nation. Mr. McCloskey knew these callers were from Louisiana; he invited such out of state inquiries by advertising in national publications and using an \u2018800\u2019 number; and he proceeded to give legal advice to these Louisiana residents who were led to believe they were speaking with a \u2018qualified\u2019 and \u2018competent\u2019 attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">\u201cRespondent did testify that he told Mrs. O\u2019Meara on the telephone that the divorce she was to obtain was voidable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While there was no evidence presented to dispute this, the Court finds significant the fact that Respondent failed to include this information either in the ad, or in the printed information he sent to his customers (clients). To the contrary, the Court finds that Mr. McCloskey, in writing, led these people to believe that he totally \u2018stood behind\u2019 the foreign decrees obtained.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">\u201cThe Court finds it curious that if Respondent in fact was so careful to warn all of his customers (clients) that the decrees were voidable, surely such warning should also have been put in writing. The Court finds, notwithstanding the telephone warning, that individuals were misled by Respondent\u2019s recommendation of these divorces, and his statement in writing that \u2018... they are legal and binding in the United States.\u2019 (T. 81).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">\u201cThe Court further finds that the advertisement clearly created the unjustified expectation in the minds of the O\u2019Mearas that they would be getting competent advice based on the law of their own jurisdiction. While Respondent argues that the words \u2018Qualified Attorney\u2019 referred to the qualified attorney in the Dominican Republic, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>clear to this Court that a reasonable person reading the ad would be misled into believing that these words referred to the only name mentioned in the ad\u2014that of James B. McCloskey. The Court further finds as a fact that the O\u2019Mearas, and others who called the telephone number in the ad and actually spoke with Respondent, would reasonably conclude by the legal nature of the advice given, that they were in fact speaking with an attorney, and not merely with the \u2018president\u2019 of the company known as \u2018Divorce Services.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-4\">\u201cThe Court further finds that the words \u2018Validity Varies by State\u2019 were not sufficient to serve as a disclaimer. It was the <em>Enquirer, </em>and not the Respondent, that required the phrase. (T. 62). Furthermore, even after this ad appeared, Respondent did not put these words in other ads which he placed. The Court does accept the fact that these words did appear in the ad which the O\u2019Mearas read. Nevertheless, the Court finds that although the O\u2019Mearas may have understood that \u2018Validity Varies by State,\u2019 it was reasonable for them to believe that the person they telephoned, Mr. McCloskey, would know the validity of such decrees in their home state of Louisiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">\u201cThe Court in this case also finds facts relevant to Mr. McCloskey\u2019s violation of Disciplinary Rule 2-109. It is clear that by responding to the telephone inquiries, and receiving fees from these callers, Respondent was, in effect, accepting their employment. Respondent testified that he felt that his efforts in helping obtain foreign divorces would at least serve to \u2018harass\u2019 non-consenting spouses into acceding to the wishes of the spouse seeking the divorce. (T. 28, 31).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">\n<em>\u201cConclusions of Law: \u2018O\u2019Meara Complaint\u2019</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">\u201cThe Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated Disciplinary Rules 1-102, 2-101, 2-109, 6-101, and 7-102. He engaged in conduct involving misrepresentations of his status and his knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>the law, thus constituting the violations of Disciplinary Rules 1-102, 6-101, and 7-102.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-4\">\u201cThe Court notes that advertising by lawyers is a relatively recent development. There have not been sufficient guidelines set out, or Court rulings that prescribe proper conduct in this area. To that extent, Respondent may have inadvertently gotten himself into the present predicament. Notwithstanding this, the Court is convinced that these ads misled the public in various jurisdictions that they would be dealing with an attorney who was prepared with knowledge of foreign divorce law in every jurisdiction. Respondent is clearly in violation of Disciplinary Rule 2-101. The ads in question were deceptive, and created unjustified expectations in the minds of those who responded to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">\u201cThe Court is further convinced that Respondent violated Disciplinary Rule 2-109 by accepting employment \u2018merely for the purpose of harassing or maliciously injuring any person.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\"><em>\u201cFindings of Fact: \u2018Baxter </em>Complaint\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">\u201cThis Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent was instrumental in procuring a Mexican divorce for Complainant, Cynthia Lee Baxter, a resident of California. Ms. Baxter was referred to Mr. McCloskey through an arrangement he had made with a Legal Care Clinic in that State. Respondent advised Complainant as to the procedure for obtaining the \u2018quickie\u2019 divorce, and accepted a fee for his services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-8\">\u201cThis Court finds that Respondent was acting as an attorney and represented himself as one knowledgeable as to the law in California with respect to recognition of foreign divorces. However, Mr. McCloskey continued to be confused about the validity of Mexican divorces even after he learned of Mrs. Baxter\u2019s problem with the military.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\">\u201cIn fact, California does not recognize divorces obtained in any foreign jurisdiction, if the parties are domi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>died in California at the time of the foreign divorce.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the statutory law does provide protection for \u2018putative spouses\u2019 of subsequent marriages, those subsequent marriages are nevertheless void.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In any event, the Court finds that Complainant in this case was denied service benefits because the U.S. Marine Corps did not recognize the Mexican divorce obtained by Mrs. Baxter. Thus, Complainant was misled by Mr. McCloskey as to the genuineness of the divorce she obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-4\">\u201cThe Court also finds that Mrs. Baxter was never even verbally informed that her divorce may be \u2018voidable.\u2019 Mr. McCloskey testified, \u2018... No, I never spoke to Miss Baxter until after the complaint was filed, sir.\u2019 (T. 38). Yet, Respondent admitted that he acted as an attorney subsequently to Mrs. Baxter\u2019s problem with the military.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">\n<em>\u201cConclusions of Law: \u2018Baxter Complaint\u2019</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">\u201cThe Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent, acting as an attorney, violated Disciplinary Rules 1-102, 2-109, 6-101, and 7-102. The findings, like those in the \u2018O\u2019Meara Complaint,\u2019 show that Respondent failed to research the law of California, and misrepresented himself as an attorney whose advice was based on sound knowledge of the law. However, the Court, as to this complaint, does not find by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent engaged in misleading advertising (Disciplinary Rule 2-101). There is no evidence that Mrs. Baxter responded to an advertisement, but rather was led to Mr. McCloskey through a California Clinic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">\n<em>\u201cFindings of Fact: \u2018Williams Complaint\u2019</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">\u201cThe Court finds that Complainant is a Maryland resident, whose husband had procured a foreign divorce through \u2018Divorce Services\u2019 and James B. McCloskey, without the knowledge of the Complainant, Darlene K. Williams. It is clear in this case, as in the others, that Respondent had not researched, and was unfamiliar with, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>the law as to recognition of foreign divorces in the State of Maryland. (T. 34 and 35).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-4\">\u201cThe Court notes that the grievance in this complaint was brought to the attention of Bar Counsel by a person who was victimized by Respondent\u2019s actions, rather than by Respondent\u2019s customer (client) himself. Thus, Mr. McCloskey\u2019s representations to his \u2018client\u2019 are not at issue in this particular complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-5\">\u201cHowever, based on the evidence before the Court, it is uncontroverted that Mr. McCloskey did accept employment on behalf of Mr. Williams. Respondent also admitted that procurement of a foreign divorce would at least serve to harass spouses who would not consent to a divorce in their own jurisdiction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">\n<em>\u201cConclusions of Law: \u2018Williams Complaint\u2019</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201cThe Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Disciplinary Rules 1-102, 2-109, and 7-102. By accepting employment \u2018... merely for the purpose of harassing ... any person,\u2019 Mr. McCloskey violated Disciplinary Rule 2-109. It thus follows that Respondent also violated Disciplinary Rule 1-102 and Disciplinary Rule 7-102 by engaging in conduct contrary to a Disciplinary Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">\u201cThe Defendant presented David J. Preller, Sr. as a character witness. Mr. Preller testified that he had been associated with the Defendant for a period of ten years. During that time he found him to be competent, conscientious and honorable. Mr. Preller indicated that there had never been any difficulty or complaints about any of the work done by Mr. McCloskey. At the conclusion of the ten year period, the Defendant and the witness parted on good terms and, in fact, continued their relationship to the extent that cases from time to time would be referred to him by the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">\u201cBar Counsel did not indicate that there had been any previous complaints or grievances filed against the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>\u201cThe demeanor of the Defendant before the Court was that of a remorseful person. The Court notes that several of the complainants lived out of state and yet the Defendant was completely candid in testifying before the Court. He would have made Bar Counsel\u2019s case a lot more difficult had he insisted that Bar Counsel prove certain allegations that were difficult to prove without live testimony or at the very least additional documentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\">\u201cAccordingly, the Court must conclude that Mr. McCloskey has put himself in the predicament that he now finds himself because of poor judgment rather than any willful intent to violate the Canons of Professional Responsibility. It is regrettable that so many people have been hurt by Mr. McCloskey\u2019s conduct.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>McCloskey has filed no exceptions to the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">Bar Counsel alleged, but apparently did not prove, that \u201cRespondent operates a business obtaining over 1500 so-called \u2018divorces\u2019 a year for American citizens in the Dominican Republic.\u201d One may infer from the \u201c800\u201d telephone number in the national advertisement and from the printed material to which the trial judge alluded that the three incidents before the Court are not isolated cases. Be that as it may, what we have here is an attorney who has been found guilty of engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; of having published misleading or deceiving advertising; of having accepted employment so that a legal action might be brought for the purpose of harassing individuals; of having handled a legal matter which he knows or should know that he is not competent to handle without associating with him a lawyer who is competent to handle it; and of having acted contrary to a disciplinary rule in his representation of a client. We repeat that the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-14\">\u201c[T]he Court is convinced that these ads misled the public in various jurisdictions that they would be dealing with an attorney who was prepared with knowledge of foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>divorce law in every jurisdiction. Respondent is clearly in violation of Disciplinary Rule 2-101. The ads in question were deceptive, and created unjustified expectations in the minds of those who responded to them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">We have said many times that the purpose of disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public rather than to punish the erring attorney. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Willemain, </em>305 Md. 665, 680, 506 A.2d 245, 253 (1986); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Shaffer, </em>305 Md. 190, 204, 502 A.2d 502, 509 (1986); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Truette, </em>299 Md. 435, 446, 474 A.2d 211, 217 (1984); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kahn, </em>290 Md. 654, 684, 431 A.2d 1336, 1352 (1981). We are of the view that the public can best be protected from the type of conduct with which we are here concerned by permanently removing McCloskey from the Bar. It follows, therefore, that he shall be disbarred forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE BV15 c FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST JAMES B.

Our associates in the Dominican Republic' are bona fide attorneys of long standing and have excellent reputations. We stand 100% behind them. We have hereto attached the rate for a legal Dominican Republic divorce.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">\"The Court also notes additional testimony at T-81:</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">\u2018Q Did you stand behind the validity of the Dominican divorces?</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">\u2018A. Sure. At that particular point I had no problem with that.\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b776-11\">\"6 The Court refers to the transcript at page 46:</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">\u2019... A. Because I found out after the problem with Baxter.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">\u2018Q. You found out what?</p>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">\u2018A. That the Mexican divorces were not accepted anywhere and that there was specific statute in California against Mexican divorces.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-15\">\u2018Q. Did you ever read the California statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b776-16\">\u2018A.

[FAM.LAW] CODE Section 5002 (West).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-19\">\u201c7b The Court also lakes note of the following unofficial translation from the General Law of Population of the Republic of Mexico, Article 69:</p>\n<p id=\"b776-20\">\u2018Any divorce procedure filed by foreigners should not be admitted by a judicial authority if the application is not accompanied by the \"Certification of Legal Residence\u201d issued by the Mexican Immigration Office.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b776-21\">This information was received by the Court in a communication from the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C., Chief of the Consular Office, Juan Carlos Cue-Vega. In the correspondence, Mr. Cue-Vega further stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b776-22\">\u2018Legal residence means when the Mexican Immigration Office had issued to the applicant whether the papers as alien resident of Mexico <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>or a special permit to have the right to file in Court if he were temporary resident. By resident it is meant when he had established his home within the territory of the Republic of Mexico or had resided therein for a minimum of six months before he is entitled to file for a divorce.\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b777-4\">\"8 CAL.

Most significantly, the trial court found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHU\">\u201cthat Mr. McCloskey has put himself in the predicament that he now finds himself because of poor judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>rather than any willful intent to violate the Canons of Professional Responsibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">Bar counsel has taken no exception to these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In light of the trial court\u2019s findings in this case, I would impose a substantial suspension instead of disbarment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
