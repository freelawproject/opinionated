(Plaintiff or Chevy Chase), a state chartered association, sues to recover funds it had been assessed for insurance of its accounts through Maryland Savings-Share Insurance Corporation (MSSIC). The defendants are the State of Maryland and the State of Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund Corporation (MDIF), a State agency and successor by merger to the insolvent MSSIC. As a member of MSSIC, Plaintiff had. been required by MSSIC\u2019s rules to contribute to the capital used by MSSIC in carrying out its programs. Having withdrawn from membership shortly after the MSSIC-MDIF merger, Plaintiff contends that MSSIC\u2019s rules relating to the rights of withdrawing members literally oblige the defendants to repay the assessments paid by Chevy Chase. We shall principally hold that as to funds used for insurance purposes, there is no breach of contract and that, as to the funds used for liquidity purposes, the contract has been modified by a constitutional exercise of the State\u2019s powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">MSSIC</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">To understand Plaintiff\u2019s claim requires a review of MSSIC\u2019s purposes, structure, and operation. MSSIC was a product of the 1960 savings and loan crisis in Maryland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>W. Preston, <em>Report of the Special Counsel on the [1985] Savings and Loan Crisis, </em>33-35 and n. 5, 43-47 (1986) (Preston). Created by Ch. 131 of the Acts of 1962, MSSIC was a nonstock, nonprofit corporation. Its members were state chartered savings and loan associations that had been accepted for membership under statutes most recently codified as Md.Code (1980), Title 10 of the Financial Institutions Article (FI). The purposes of MSSIC were to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>(1) Promote the elasticity and flexibility of the resources of members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">(2) Provide for the liquidity of members through a central reserve fund; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">(3) Insure the savings accounts of members. [FI \u00a7 10-103.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Until Ch. 479 of the Acts of 1968, Maryland law had never required that state chartered associations be insured. Chapter 479 mandated that on and after July 1, 1973, all free share accounts be insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) or by MSSIC. <em>See </em>FI \u00a7 9-426 <em>(\u201cA </em>savings and loan association shall become and participate as a member in [MSSIC] or a federal home loan bank.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The powers of MSSIC were exercised by a board of directors composed of eleven persons, of whom three were appointed by the Governor and the remainder elected by the members. FI \u00a7\u00a7 10-108 and 10-109. The directors could adopt bylaws and rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of Title 10, but such action by the directors became effective only if approved by the director of the Division of Savings and Loan Associations, a State agency within the Department of Licensing and Regulation. FI \u00a7 10-111. MSSIC was not subject to Art. 48A of the Maryland Code, regulating insurance companies. FI \u00a7 10-114. It was exempt from taxation by Maryland or any of its political subdivisions. FI \u00a7 10-115. FI \u00a7 10-116 specifically provided that \u201c[t]his title does not, and [MSSIC] may not, pledge the faith or credit of this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The capital with which MSSIC carried out its corporate purposes was derived from its member associations. Each member was required to \u201cmake the investments and pay the assessments, premiums, and other charges that are required for participation in [MSSIC].\u201d FI \u00a7 10-107(c). In its internal accounting MSSIC segregated two funds, the central reserve fund (CRF) and the insurance fund. FI \u00a7 10-105 required MSSIC to \u201cestablish a central insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>fund and through the fund [to] insure the savings accounts of members.\u201d The statutory basis for CRF was FI \u00a7 10-103(2) by which MSSIC was to provide \u201cfor the liquidity of members through a central reserve fund.\u201d By an amendment to the MSSIC statutes first made in 1974 (Ch. 152), the CRF was \u201cnot subject to any insurance claim against [MSSIC].\u201d FI \u00a7 10-104(e)(4). These statutory provisions were fleshed out by bylaws, rules and regulations of MSSIC, discussed below. The full text of the MSSIC rules and regulations relied on by the Plaintiff is set forth in the appendix hereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Pursuant to MSSIC Rule \u00a7 3-301, each member, as a condition of membership and thus of insurance on accounts, was required to contribute \u201cas a capital deposit\u201d an amount equal to two percent of its free share accounts. Certificates of deposit evidencing these contributions were issued by MSSIC. Members could carry those certificates on their books as assets, but the certificates paid no interest or dividends. Rule \u00a7 3-306. In its accounting, MSSIC charged the liability on those certificates of deposit against the insurance fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Chevy Chase bases its claim to return of its capital contributions to the insurance fund on Rule \u00a7 3-503, which in relevant part provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">Any member withdrawing from [MSSIC] ... shall be entitled to receive from [MSSIC] payment of the certificate of deposit ... in the following manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">(a) A date shall be specified by [MSSIC] for the termination of insurance of free share accounts issued by the withdrawing members, which date shall not be later than twelve months from the date of the notice referred to in Section 3-501 (such date being referred to in these Rules as the \u201cterminal date\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Rule \u00a7 3-501 in substance provided that any member which was not in default of its obligations to MSSIC might \u201cwithdraw from membership in [MSSIC] upon giving to it twelve months notice in writing of [the member\u2019s] intention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>withdraw.\u201d On the terminal date the withdrawing member was to receive its <em>pro rata </em>share of the <em>cash </em>of MSSIC, <em>see </em>Rule \u00a7 3-503(B) and (C), and a certificate of fractional participation which entitled the terminating member \u201cto its proportionate share of any proceeds resulting from the liquidation of such remaining assets as they are liquidated by [MSSIC].\u201d A fractional participation certificate does \u201cnot entitle the holder thereof to any control over the manner, amount or date of liquidation of such assets.\u201d Rule \u00a7 3-503(D) and (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The CRF was treated in Rule \u00a7 3-901, which recited that MSSIC \u201cand its members authorize the formation of a Central Reserve Fund to provide for the liquidity of member associations subject to the following provisions[.]\u201d Membership in the fund was mandatory and was effected by subscribing to \u201cCapital Notes\u201d issued by MSSIC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The capital note subscription obligation of a member institution was one-half of one percent of assets for an association having less than $75 million in assets and one and one-half percent of assets for associations having greater assets. Subscriptions were adjusted semi-annually. Capital notes are interest bearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">There was a CRF committee appointed by MSSIC\u2019s board of directors which managed that fund. That committee, in its discretion, could make advances to members, with or without security, for a term of up to one year or, with the approval of the board of directors, for a longer term. Membership in CRF might be terminated by withdrawing from membership in MSSIC. Three months notice to the fund prior to termination of membership was required. \u201cIn the event of such termination ... the capital notes shall be surrendered and cancelled and payment shall be made of the investment in said notes plus accrued interest, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>any____\u201d Rule \u00a7 3-901(B)(6). Rule \u00a7 3-901(K) further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">Any member having given notice of its intention to withdraw from membership and requesting payment of its capital notes, in accordance with the provision of Section 3-901-B(6) shall be entitled to receive the face amount of the capital notes within six months after notice of its intention to withdraw; in the event the Central Reserve Fund does not have sufficient cash available to pay the withdrawing member the full amount of the capital note, then, in that event the Fund may make partial payments of funds received from maturing securities to the withdrawing member until the full amount due the member is paid. Any such deferred payments shall continue to bear interest as though the member were still an active participant in the Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">MSSIC\u2019s rules, following \u00a7 3-901(B)(8), stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">NOTE: The Central Reserve Fund shall not be subject to payment of insurance claims against the Corporation by member associations, or their Free Share holders, or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">For the year ending December 31, 1984, MSSIC\u2019s balance sheet<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reflected assets of $285,647,872, offset by $118,891,-754 of liabilities, by a $5,000,000 reserve for insurance losses, and by \u201cCapital funds\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of $144,260,100, leaving retained earnings of $17,496,018. The auditors\u2019 notes to the December 31, 1984, financials advise that \u201c[i]t is the policy of [MSSIC] to establish a reserve for insurance losses at the time an association requires financial assistance or when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>such assistance is anticipated. These reserves are reviewed periodically and adjusted as required----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">MDIF</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">MDIF is a product of the 1985 savings and loan crisis in Maryland. On May 14, 1985, at 4:47 p.m. the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency and suspended withdrawals from state chartered associations insured by MSSIC. The events leading to that proclamation are chronicled in Preston, at 19-29. Between February and mid-April of 1985, depositors withdrew approximately $875 million in a \u201csilent run\u201d on certain MSSIC insured associations. Those associations in turn were forced to borrow some $370 million from the Federal Reserve. On May 9, 1985, MSSIC\u2019s announcement of a change in management at Old Court Savings and Loan Association (Old Court) caused the runs to escalate and spread to other institutions. On May 10, depositors withdrew $3 million from Merritt Commercial Savings and Loan Association (Merritt). Old Court and Merritt were placed in conservatorship on May 13,1985, and on that day depositors withdrew $116 million from MSSIC insured savings and loans. By mid-May approximately $630 million had been withdrawn from MSSIC members in a three-month period.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Between May 17 and 28,1985, an extraordinary session of the Maryland General Assembly was held to respond to the crisis. One of the problems to be confronted was the MSSIC insolvency. The then Maryland law required state chartered associations to have their accounts insured either by FSLIC or by MSSIC, but because of the crisis solvent associations which were MSSIC members were not meaningfully insured. Public confidence in the state chartered savings and loan industry would be further shaken if MSSIC were placed in a liquidating receivership as had been done in 1960 with Security Financial Insurance Corporation when account insurance was not a state requirement. Public confidence would also be shaken if the requirement for insurance of accounts of state chartered associations were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>eliminated. The policy decision of the executive and legislative branches was that solvent state associations would have to obtain federal insurance in order to continue to operate as a savings and loan. It was also recognized that this could not be done immediately. It was decided that the State would take over MSSIC under statutorily defined circumstances. In this way continuity of insurance for associations which were not federally insured could be maintained for a limited time, and MSSIC could in effect be liquidated in an orderly manner while its members had the opportunity to procure federal insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The legal mechanism effecting these objectives was the special statutory merger of MSSIC into MDIF. Chapter 6 of the Acts of the First Special Session of 1985, effective June 1, 1985, created MDIF, a nonstock, nonprofit corporation and a State agency within the Department of Licensing and Regulation. Chapter 6 repealed FI Title 10 (MSSIC) and enacted a new title, codified as Md.Code (1980, 1985 Cum.Supp.), Title 10 (MDIF) of the Financial Institutions Article (FI Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The merger of MSSIC into MDIF was effected specifically by uncodified \u00a7 4 of Ch. 6. That section further provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">all of the assets, including but not limited to capital deposits, reserves, and other tax attributes, all of the liabilities, including but not limited to taxes, incurred losses, and other insurance liabilities, and all of the rights, powers, duties, obligations, and functions of [MSSIC] are hereby transferred to [MDIF], <em>to the extent consistent with this </em>Act____ [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Uncodified \u00a7 5 of Ch. 6 mandated that all MSSIC members \u201cimmediately prior to the enactment of this Act shall automatically become members of [MDIF] on the effective date of this Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The \u201cmoneys\u201d of MSSIC are required to be \u201cmaintained in a special nonlapsing fund, to be called the \u2018Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund.\u2019 \u201d Purposes of that fund are: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>insuring savings accounts of member associations; purchasing capital instruments issued by members to enable them to qualify for federal insurance on accounts; reimbursing savings account holders for loss incurred upon liquidation up to the amount of insurance; providing funds for liquidity and assisting in other specified ways in an emergency affecting a member; making capital contributions, under certain circumstances, to an entity acquiring a member association; and paying the net insured amount of accounts to receivers of members on final distribution. FI Supp. \u00a7 10-110(a) as amended by Chs. 3 and 4 of the Second Special Session of 1985, both effective October 25,1985. FI Supp. \u00a7 10-116 declares it to be \u201cthe policy of this State that funds will be appropriated to the Fund to the extent necessary to protect holders of savings accounts in member associations.\u201d Pursuant to FI Supp. \u00a7 10-112(b) the CRF assets \u201cshall continue to be segregated and maintained by the Fund to provide liquidity and are not subject to any insurance claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">FI Supp. \u00a7\u00a7 10-117 and 10-118 impose limits on membership in MDIF. In general, an association with total assets of $40 million or more could remain a member for not more than seven months after June 1, 1985, if it had applied for federal insurance on or before June 1, 1985. FI Supp. \u00a7 10-117(b)(l)(i). An association having total assets of at least $15 million but less than $40 million may not be a member on or after July 1, 1987. FI Supp. \u00a7 10-118(a)(l). An association having total assets of less than $15 million may not be a member on or after July 1, 1989. FI Supp. \u00a7 10-118(a)(2). MDIF insurance continues in effect for associations in receivership or in certain conservatorships. FI Supp. \u00a7 10-118(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The MDIF board of directors, consisting of eleven persons, six appointed by the Governor and five elected by members, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Licensing and Regulation, can adopt bylaws and rules and regulations for the fund. FI Supp. \u00a7 10-103. The Fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Director, subject to approval of the board, can also adopt rules and regulations. FI Supp. \u00a7 10-113.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">FI Supp. \u00a7 10-112(b) addresses the rights of withdrawing members from MDIF. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\"><em>Subject to the terms and conditions adopted by the Fund Director and approved by the Board, </em>a member association may withdraw at any time from the Fund and have returned all or part of any capital advanced to [MSSIC] and all or part of any capital deposit required for membership in the Fund. All moneys and other assets of the former [MSSIC] central reserve fund shall continue to be segregated and maintained by the Fund to provide liquidity and are not subject to any insurance claim. [Emphasis added.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The balance sheet for MDIF as of May 18, 1985, the date of its creation, carried an allowance for estimated insurance losses of $325,100,000. Capital deposits to the insurance fund of $144,223,900, liabilities and the estimated insurance losses exceeded assets by $305,985,874. On that date the assets segregated to CRF were $89,847,878. CRF liabilities consisted of $985,878 in accrued interest payable and $88,-862,000 of capital notes. However, $67,341,447 of CRF assets had been pledged by MSSIC as collateral to enable Old Court to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank in order to meet the run. Of the remaining, unencumbered CRF assets more that $19 million consisted of notes receivable evidencing loans made in May 1985 to Merritt and to First Maryland Savings and Loan Association. The latter association was placed in conservatorship on November 20, 1985. Consequently it appears that approximately $2 to $2.5 million was the maximum amount of CRF assets which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>could have been both unencumbered and invested in a solvent entity at the end of the spring of 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">As of June 30, 1985, MDIF had a negative net worth of $303,927,526 primarily due to estimated insurance losses of $325,100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">At the meeting of the MDIF board held on October 24, 1985, the directors reviewed the status of the CRF.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">The liquidity fund has been utilized for liquidity loans to member institutions as the crisis developed last May and through this summer. There was nothing in the MSSIC By-Laws to account for the type of crisis which we are presently experiencing. Due to this crisis, we ended up with major borrowing needs. About $51 million worth of securities from the liquidity fund have been pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank for our institutions. We have loaned $37,969,000. We have a total of $90 million in the liquidity fund and have available cash of $739,000. The rest of the assets are encumbered assets of the liquidity fund.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">At that meeting the MDIF board adopted resolution 85-1, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">A. Because of the extent of currently anticipated losses, MDIF will not return capital deposits in the insurance fund to withdrawing members until the amount of currently anticipated losses is determined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">B. Because of the current illiquid state of the central reserve fund, the consideration of member contributions as assets by [FSLIC] and the payment of interest to members on the contributions, MDIF will not return contributions to withdrawing members before it has determined that there will be no loss to the fund in liquidating its assets and that the eontribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>tions will not be needed to assist members who are experiencing liquidity problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">On January 10, 1986, the State Administration presented its plan for financing troubled savings and loan associations and for making depositors\u2019 funds more available. The plan contemplated using $80 million in then existing MDIF liquid assets from the insurance fund. The plan does not call for using any CRF assets. In addition, the State budget as adopted for fiscal 1987 contains an appropriation to MDIF of $92,416,480 for the central reserve fund. The explanation accompanying the budget is that MDIF \u201c[mjember deposits [to CRF] will be refunded by December 31, 1986.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Chevy Chase</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Chevy Chase is the state chartered association with the greatest assets. As a MSSIC -member for over fifteen years, Plaintiff had been required to contribute nearly $39 million to the insurance fund and nearly $43 million to the CRF. In August of 1984 Chevy Chase had applied for membership in FSLIC, and by letter of October 12, 1984, Chevy Chase had notified MSSIC of Chevy Chase\u2019s intention to withdraw as a member of MSSIC on the effective date of FSLIC\u2019s approval of that application. On May 22, 1985, FSLIC approved insuring Chevy Chase accounts. On May 24, Chevy Chase notified its depositors that MSSIC insurance had terminated May 23 and that their accounts were federally insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">By letter of May 28, Chevy Chase made demand on MDIF for immediate repayment of $21,630,106.85 from the insurance fund, representing the net after offsetting from Plaintiff\u2019s contributions to the insurance fund certain debts admittedly owed by Plaintiff to MSSIC. Plaintiff also demanded immediate repayment of $42,970,900, with interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>from April 1, 1985, representing its CRF contributions. Responding on June 13, 1985, MDIF took the position \u201cthat the Insurance Fund will be maintained to fulfill its purpose of insuring depositors against loss on their accounts\u201d and that \u201c[d]ue to the lack of liquidity of the Central Reserve Fund, there is presently no procedure to refund these monies to associations receiving federal insurance,\u201d but that the latter issue would \u201cbe resolved by MDIF at the appropriate time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AhB\">Litigation and Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The instant suit was filed on October 17, 1985, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In Count I, Plaintiff complained that the State and MDIF had breached the contracts relating to the repayments of insurance and of CRF contributions which had been formed between Plaintiff and MSSIC, the obligations of which had been assumed by MDIF. In Count II, Chevy Chase asserted that any abrogation of or change made in those contracts by the 1985 special session legislation was unconstitutional as an uncompensated taking of property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Chevy Chase requested relief by way of damages, an injunction against expenditures, a declaratory judgment, and mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">After the Administration\u2019s Plan of January 10, 1986, was announced, Chevy Chase moved in the instant case for an interlocutory injunction. It alleged that its contributions to the insurance fund were to be used as part of the $80 million contribution from MDIF to the plan. It further alleged that the remaining requirements of the plan would cause MDIF to invade, and perhaps totally deplete, assets available in the CRF. Chevy Chase asked that MDIF be required to segregate the Chevy Chase contributions to the insurance fund and that MDIF be enjoined from expending, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>or committing to expend, insurance fund monies which would cause that fund to drop below an amount needed to return in full Chevy Chase\u2019s contributions to the insurance fund. Plaintiff further asked for an injunction against any expenditures from the CRF until MDIF had escrowed an amount sufficient to repay Plaintiff\u2019s loans to the CRF.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">The request for an interlocutory injunction produced cross-motions for summary judgment on the claims in Counts I and II. The circuit court decided the matter on those motions. It principally held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">(1) \u201cChevy Chase is not entitled to a return of its Insurance Fund contributions unless money remains in the Fund after losses are paid\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">(2) \u201cChevy Chase is entitled to a return of its Central Reserve Fund contributions when the liquidity problems of member associations are resolved\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">(3) \u201c[N]o unconstitutional taking of Chevy Chase\u2019s assets has occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">We agree. The circuit court also held that \u201cthe doctrine of sovereign immunity is a bar to Chevy Chase\u2019s contract claims in this case[.]\u201d In view of our analysis, explicated below, we do not express any opinion on the defense of sovereign immunity asserted by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Cross-appeals were taken from the circuit court judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We issued the writ of certiorari prior to consideration of the matter by the Court of Special Appeals. The arguments will be considered separately as to each fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">Insurance Fund</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">Chevy Chase claims repayment of its contributions to the insurance fund with priority over the claims of depositors in MDIF member associations which have defaulted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>honoring depositor withdrawals. The argument is that the rules of MSSIC gave rise to a contract between Plaintiff and MSSIC. No party to this case argues that there is any difference, material to the outcome here, between corporate bylaws and what MSSIC labeled as rules. Corporate bylaws, particularly those of a mutual insurer, form part of the contract between the corporation and its policyholders or members. <em>See Condon v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association, </em>89 Md. 99, 123, 42 A. 944, 950 (1889); <em>John C. Grafflin Co. v. Woodside, </em>87 Md. 146, 39 A. 413 (1898); <em>Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Miller Lodge, I.O.O.F., </em>58 Md. 463 (1882); and <em>Anne Arundel General Hospital v. O\u2019Brien, </em>49 Md.App. 362, 432 A.2d 483 (1981). Another premise of the argument is that MDIF and the State are obliged to perform the contract made by MSSIC. We shall assume that is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Plaintiff suggests that it acquired a \u201cvested right\u201d to its insurance contributions as of October 12, 1984, when it gave MSSIC notice of its intention to withdraw from MSSIC membership. That notice by its terms was only to be effective upon Chevy Chase\u2019s qualifying for federal insurance. Further, MSSIC Rule \u00a7 3-503 limited a withdrawing member\u2019s first payment from the insurance fund to a <em>pro rata </em>share of the cash in the insurance fund as of the \u201cterminal date\u201d which was the date as of which MSSIC insurance terminated. The terminal date was to be specified by MSSIC, but it could be no later than twelve months after a member\u2019s written notice of intent to withdraw. There is no evidence that MSSIC or MDIF ever specified a terminal date for Chevy Chase; thus the terminal date in this case would seem to be October 13, 1985. In any event, no assets could be withdrawn by Chevy Chase until it had delivered to MSSIC proof of notice to the depositors of the termination of MSSIC insurance, as required by Rule \u00a7 3-504. Plaintiff gave that notice on May 23, 1985. Consequently, MSSIC had not been required to pay anything out of the insurance fund to Chevy Chase as of May 18, 1985, when Ch. 6 became effective. As of May 18, 1985, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Chevy Chase had not withdrawn from MSSIC. On that date it remained a member of the nonstock corporation. <em>See Coltrane v. Blake, </em>113 F. 785, 790 (4th Cir.1902), <em>aff'g Coltrane v. Baltimore Building and Loan Association, </em>110 F. 272 (C.C.Md.1901) (attempted withdrawal by shareholder not effected before corporate insolvency).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Principally, Chevy Chase contends that it has priority over depositors\u2019 claims to the insurance fund because its claim is payable earlier. Under the MSSIC bylaws, \u00a7\u00a7 2-704 and 2-705, MSSIC had no obligation to pay depositors\u2019 claims until the \u201cnet insurable loss\u201d of each free share account of a member in default had been determined. The bylaws contemplated determining net insurable loss after a sale of the assets of the MSSIC member in default had established the liquidating value of the assets. Chevy Chase says that monies became unconditionally payable to it by MDIF out of cash in the insurance fund on May 24, 1985, that participating certificates which should have been issued to it then would have been payable as the insurance fund assets were liquidated, and that the remaining assets in the insurance fund would not become payable to depositors until their net insurable losses on accounts' at defaulting MDIF member associations were determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">This argument ignores the fact that MSSIC had always established reserves for insurance losses and that the reserves for losses resulting from the 1985 run on certain MSSIC members had left MSSIC insolvent. Even though the depositors\u2019 claims were not liquidated and were not required to be paid on May 18, 1985, they were then fixed as to liability and they were substantial in amount. 2A <em>Couch on Insurance </em>2d (rev. ed. 1984) \u00a7 22:74, at 679 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">When a loss covered by the policy is sustained, the liability of the insurer is determined as of the date of the loss and according to the terms of the policy without regard to the fact that the insurer thereafter became insolvent or that the actual amount of the insured\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>was not determined until after the insurer had become insolvent. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The defaulting members\u2019 depositors were creditors of MSSIC as of May 18, 1985.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Because MSSIC was insolvent on May 18, 1985, and because the special statutory merger of that date was in part a technique for liquidating MSSIC, the priority claimed by Chevy Chase over the depositors as creditors should be tested by the law relating to insolvents. In insolvency distributions creditors have priority over shareholders. Applicability of this general principle to the facts here can be demonstrated by a number of analogies.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The ordinary rule applicable to a nonstock corporation such as MSSIC is that the provisions of Md.Code (1975, 1985 Repl.Vol.), Corporations and Associations Article (C &amp; A), Titles 2 and 3, governing corporations in general also govern nonstock corporations. <em>See </em>C &amp; A \u00a7 5-201; <em>Carter v. Glen Burnie Volunteer Fire Co., </em>292 Md. 165, 438 A.2d 278 (1981). Here the members of MSSIC are analogous to shareholders in an ordinary business corporation. The contributions to its capital which are required by MSSIC\u2019s rules in order to operate the insurance fund and which are refundable to a member who has withdrawn are analogous to redeemable stock in an ordinary business corporation. C &amp; A \u00a7 2-311 prohibits a Maryland corporation from purchasing or redeeming \u201cany of its stock if the corporation is insolvent or the transaction would cause the corporation to become insolvent.\u201d By a parity of reasoning, Chevy Chase\u2019s contributions to the insurance fund were not repayable by MSSIC after the latter became insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Inasmuch as MSSIC was insolvent before Chevy Chase satisfied the conditions for withdrawal from member<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>ship, Chevy Chase\u2019s demand for payment when it had satisfied those conditions did not convert Chevy Chase into a creditor, much less a creditor who enjoyed a priority in payment over insured depositors. Illustrative are the cases in which policyholders in <em>mutual </em>insurance companies or members of fraternal benefit societies seek death benefits or endowment payments from an insolvent insurer. These cases make a distinction based on whether the event which satisfies the policy condition for payment occurred before or after the mutual insurer became insolvent. The common law rule is that unless the policy \u201cmatured,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the right to benefits became fixed, before the insolvency, the claimant does not become a creditor who is to be paid in full before payment of other certificates maturing after insolvency or of certificates which have not matured. <em>See Failey v. Fee, </em>83 Md. 83, 95-96, 34 A. 839, 842 (1896); <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Employees\u2019 Relief Association, </em>77 Md. 566, 573, 26 A. 1045, 1047-48 (1893). <em>See also Gilbert v. Washington Beneficial Endowment Association, </em>21 App.D.C. 344 (1903); <em>In re Educational Endowment Association, </em>56 Minn. 171, 57 N.W. 463 (1894); <em>Vanatta v. New Jersey Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>31 N.J.Eq. 15 (1879); <em>Hagerling v. Pension Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>68 Pa.Super. 170 (1917); <em>In re Advance Beneficial Order\u2019s Assigned Estate, </em>48 Pa.Super. 197 (1911); 2A <em>Couch, supra, </em>\u00a7 22:73. The rationale of these cases is well expressed in <em>Mayer v. Attorney General, </em>32 N.J.Eq. 815, 820 (1880) which this Court cited favorably in <em>Failey, supra, </em>83 Md. at 96, 34 A. at 842. The New Jersey court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACo\">I agree with the chancellor in thinking that claims founded on policies that matured before insolvency, should be preferred to claims simply for reserves. This conclusion is clearly required, I think, in a mutual company, by the difference between the character of a matured claim and the character of a policy reserve. It is in substance the difference between the claim of an outside creditor against a firm for a debt, and a claim of a member of the firm for his share of the assets invested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>its business. It is true that the company, in this case, was not an ordinary partnership. It was a corporate body whose members were changing, and their liability for the company\u2019s losses was of limited extent; but as between the parties whose claims are now under consideration, the relation which the owner of a matured claim held to the corporation and to the remaining members, was, to the extent of the company\u2019s assets, the relation of an outside creditor to the partners of a firm. As partners can claim no part of the partnership assets on a settlement till the partnership debts have been paid, so here those who were members of the company when insolvency occurred, must be postponed to those who had previously become creditors, and ceased to be members. This results from the manner in which the company was organized and its business conducted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The rule is the same in the field of savings and loan corporations. <em>Wyman v. McKeever, </em>239 Md. 130, 210 A.2d 537 (1965) involved such a corporation which had been placed in receivership. Prior to the order for receivership, but while the corporation was in fact insolvent, various free shareholders had presented withdrawal requests and had received checks which were dishonored on presentment. Judge Hammond, writing for the Court, rejected the contention that those account holders were to be treated as creditors in the distribution and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">The general rule, now firmly established by the great majority of the cases on the subject, is that after a building association has become insolvent in fact, even though this is not known, the right of every shareholder to equality in the distribution attaches as a paramount equity and no shareholder has the right to defeat that equality by withdrawing, perfecting an incompleted attempt to withdraw, or retaining the fruits of a completed withdrawal. Sundheim, <em>[.Building and Loan Associations </em>(3d ed. 1933) ], Sec. 158 says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>... \u201cThe right of withdrawal, which is a peculiar feature of building and loan associations, is not given to the member for the purpose of enabling him to evade his just share of the losses incurred by an insolvent association.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 133, 210 A.2d at 539.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">In the matter <em>sub judice </em>Chevy Chase is in effect reading in a vacuum MSSIC Rule \u00a7 3-503 concerning withdrawing members\u2019 obtaining return of insurance fund contributions. The rule is subject to an implied condition that MSSIC is solvent. This equitable rule of construction is illustrated by <em>Lacy v. State Banking Board, </em>118 Tex. 91, 11 S.W.2d 496 (1928) (Tex.Comm\u2019n App. opinion adopted). Depositors in bank A which had failed on September 29, 1926, made claim against the guaranty fund for state banks administered by the banking commissioner. Their claims were ultimately approved. In the period between October 31, 1926, and January 7, 1927, banks B through I also failed, causing the guaranty fund to become insolvent to a degree beyond cure by assessments on other member banks which had not failed. Statutes governing the guaranty fund provided that \u201c[i]f the Commissioner takes possession of any bank\u201d its depositors should first be paid out of cash on hand in the insolvent bank \u201cand if not sufficient, the remainder shall be paid out of the Depositors\u2019 Guaranty Fund through the banking board.\u201d The claimants contended that their right to payment from the fund became vested when the commissioner took possession of bank A and that priority in time of accrual of the right to payment governed fund distribution. The Supreme Court of Texas rejected that argument by reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">[t]he provision that the remainder due to depositors shall be paid out of the depositors\u2019 guaranty fund through the banking board, of course means in the regular and orderly method of administering the law. This contemplated solvency, an ample reserve fund, and a liberal power of assessment of member banks. But, when the machinery by which these affairs are administered have broken down, the plan made impossible of further execution, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>available fund wholly insolvent, and the law creating the scheme itself repealed, that orderly process of payment is no longer practicable or even possible, according to the original contemplated means and method of performance, but rather is controlled by the principles of equity applicable to trust funds and administrations generally. <em>[Id. </em>at 103-04, 11 S.W.2d at 502.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Chevy Chase relies heavily on <em>Ruden v. Ruden, </em>60 S.D. 447, 244 N.W. 775 (1932) to support its asserted priority over creditors. That case is distinguishable from the one at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><em>Ruden\u2019s </em>facts were that in 1922 corporation A, a bank, had failed. Corporation B was organized as a bank using the same name as A. B and the South Dakota Bank Guaranty Fund agreed that B would honor the withdrawal demands of A\u2019s depositors, that B would reimburse itself first from the assets of A, and then, to the extent of any deficiency, the fund would reimburse B in cash. The fund disputed B\u2019s claim to reimbursement at a time when the fund was able to pay B\u2019s claim in full. That dispute was ultimately resolved by a 1930 judgment in B\u2019s favor. In the meanwhile a series of bank failures beginning in 1923 had caused the fund\u2019s liabilities to exceed its assets by 35 to 1. The fund had been issuing certificates of indebtedness to depositors of failed banks in anticipation of acquiring additional resources through assessments. In 1925 the South Dakota legislature enacted that money in the guaranty fund should be distributed by pro rating the same upon outstanding certificates of indebtedness in proportion to the unpaid principal amounts thereof after crediting proceeds of liquidation of the individual banks without priority by reason of due date. B claimed priority over holders of fund certificates and the court agreed, reasoning that \u201c[b]ank depositor claimants have no right to demand or expect that money which [B] advanced to the guaranty fund, and which should and could have been repaid, and was not, should be distributed to them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 244 N.W. at 778-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>In the <em>Ruden </em>case the monies claimed by B were not capital contributions made by B as a fund member. The monies claimed were advanced by B in lieu of payment by the fund directly to depositors and were used for the purpose of the fund in making depositors whole. Chevy Chase\u2019s contributions to the MSSIC insurance fund were likewise for the purpose of paying depositors\u2019 losses in failed member associations. Depositors in failed MSSIC insured associations have a right to expect that contributions by MSSIC members to the insurance fund will be applied to depositors\u2019 claims. But if Chevy Chase may presently withdraw its insurance contributions, in full, without regard to depositors\u2019 claims, the statutory purposes of the insurance fund will be defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The circuit court was correct when it declared that Chevy Chase was \u201cnot entitled to a return of its Insurance Fund contributions unless money remains in the Fund after losses are paid[.]\u201d Inasmuch as there has been no breach of contract by not refunding insurance fund contributions, relief for that claimed breach of contract was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Central Reserve Fund</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The circuit court held that \u201cChevy Chase is entitled to a return of its Central Reserve Fund contributions when the liquidity problems of member associations are resolved[.]\u201d The State does not dispute this conclusion so that we are not concerned with whether the contributions are refundable. The issue on this phase of the case is whether the delay in payment constitutes a taking of Chevy Chase\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The terms of the contract with MSSIC on which Plaintiff rests this claim are found in MSSIC Rule \u00a7 3-901. Subsection (B)(6) of that rule states that \u201c[membership in the [CRF] may be terminated should any member withdraw from membership in the Corporation[.]\u201d It provides that \u201c[i]n the event of such termination, whether as a result of withdrawal or expulsion ... payment shall be made of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>investment in said [capital] notes,\u201d and sets forth a notice requirement which is incorporated into subsection (K) of the rule. We shall assume that the required notice had been given. Subsection (K) then provides that a withdrawing member</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">shall be entitled to receive the face amount of the capital notes within six months after notice of its intention to withdraw; in the event the Central Reserve Fund does not have sufficient cash available to pay the withdrawing member the full amount of the capital note, then, in that event, the Fund may make partial payments of funds received from maturing securities to the withdrawing member until the full amount due the member is paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgY\">Chevy Chase suggests that all of its CRF contributions became immediately payable on April 13, 1985, six months after Plaintiffs October 12, 1984, notice of intention to withdraw from membership in MSSIC. But, because under subsection (B)(6) membership in MSSIC must first have been terminated before membership in the CRF could have been terminated, Chevy Chase had no right to immediate payment of CRF contributions prior to its effective withdrawal from membership in MSSIC. As we have seen, the earliest date on which that withdrawal could have been effective was May 24, 1985. Indeed, in its motion for summary judgment Chevy Chase took the position that its right to repayment of CRF funds became unconditional on May 24, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Rule \u00a7 3-901(K) bristles with questions of interpretation superimposed on questions of fact.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>shall assume, <em>arguendo, </em>the interpretation of Rule \u00a7 3-901(K) most favorable to Chevy Chase. That is to say, we shall assume that, but for Ch. 6, Chevy Chase would have been entitled to all of its contributions to the CRF as of May 24, 1985, without regard to the liquidity requirements of MDIF\u2019s members.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Chapter 6, effective May 18, 1985, changed that assumed contract. Under \u00a7 4 of Ch. 6, MDIF assumed MSSIC\u2019s obligations, including executory contracts, only to the extent that a given obligation was consistent with Ch. 6. That enactment also provided in FI Supp. \u00a7 10-112(b) that members\u2019 withdrawals of capital advanced to MSSIC, <em>i.e., </em>CRF funds, would be subject to the terms and conditions adopted by the Fund Director and approved by the board. Instead of a withdrawing member having an unqualified right of withdrawal of CRF funds, as claimed by Plaintiff, the General Assembly in Ch. 6 essentially rejected MSSIC Rule \u00a7 3-901 and delegated the responsibility of determining the conditions of withdrawal to MDIF\u2019s director and board.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The acting Fund Director on June 13, 1985, refused Chevy Chase\u2019s request for its CRF contributions \u201c[d]ue to the lack of liquidity of the Central Reserve Fund[.]\u201d There is no evidence or contention that that position was disap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>proved by the MDIF board, if the board had even been constituted by that date. The board\u2019s resolution of October 24, 1985, affirmatively approved the Director\u2019s position. The board concluded that MDIF would not return contributions to withdrawing members \u201cbefore it has determined that there will be no loss to the [CRF] in liquidating its assets and that the contributions will not be needed to assist members who are experiencing liquidity problems.\u201d That resolution gave as one reason the \u201ccurrent illiquid state of the [CRF].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">We need not here decide on the legal theory underlying the statutory merger\u2019s treatment of MSSIC rules generally. In an ordinary merger under the general corporation law the separate existence of each party to the merger, except the survivor, ceases. C &amp; A \u00a7 3-114(b). Because the corporate life of MSSIC was extinguished by merger, the MSSIC bylaws and rules would have been extinguished as well. On that analysis, the Director and MDIF board adopted a new rule different from the earlier extinguished rule on which Plaintiff\u2019s contract with MSSIC had been formed. On the other hand, the special statutory merger effected by Ch. 6 might be construed as not having extinguished all the MSSIC rules but to have transferred them to MDIF except to the extent contrary to Ch. 6. Under that analysis, the conflict between Ch. 6 and MSSIC Rule \u00a7 3-901 prevented Rule \u00a7 3-901 from being adopted by MDIF as part of the merger. In either event, Plaintiff\u2019s position is that its contract, even if executory at the time of the change, was constitutionally protected and that the change, whereby liquidity needs are considered before CRF contributions are repaid, is a taking of Plaintiff\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">After the circuit court filed its opinion in this case, the budget bill for fiscal 1987 was enacted and it appropriated funds to the CRF which will be available as of July 1, 1986. That enactment fixes December 31, 1986, as the outside date for repayment to MDIF members of their CRF contributions. Further, following the creation of MDIF, members\u2019 contributions to the CRF have continued to carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>interest. There is no contention in this case that the rate of interest MDIF pays is a factor indicating a taking has occurred. Consequently, the issue is whether the State has taken Chevy Chase\u2019s property by delaying return of its CRF contributions from May 24, 1985, to as late as December 31, 1986, while paying adequate interest on the funds in the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Although the United States Supreme Court has \u201ceschewed the development of any set formula for identifying a \u2018taking\u2019 forbidden by the Fifth Amendment,\u201d it has identified \u201cthree factors which have \u2018particular significance:\u2019 (1) \u2018the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant\u2019; (2) \u2018the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations\u2019; and (3) \u2018the character of the governmental action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1018, 1026, 89 L.Ed.2d 166, 178-79 (1986) (quoting <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 2659, 57 L.Ed.2d 631, 648 (1978)). The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 imposed a liability on an employer withdrawing from such a plan to pay into the plan an amount proportionate to the employer\u2019s share of the plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits. <em>Connolly </em>held that there was no taking despite the fact that under the contract between the plan and employers a withdrawing employer had no such obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In the case before us it should first be noted that MSSIC was a form of guaranty fund for state chartered savings and loan deposits. Since 1973, a corporation which desired to conduct a savings and loan business in Maryland and which chose not to, or could not, qualify for federal insurance was obliged to become a member of MSSIC. It has long been settled that a state constitutionally exercises its sovereignty by requiring financial institutions to contribute to a guaranty fund for the protection of depositors. <em>See Noble State Bank v. Haskell, </em>219 U.S. 104, 31 S.Ct. 186, 55 L.Ed. 112 (1911). And <em>see Assaria State Bank v. Dolley, </em>219 U.S. 121, 31 S.Ct. 189, 55 L.Ed. 123 (1911). In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>although a private corporation, MSSIC was chartered by special legislative act, and its charter could be changed by further legislative act without regard to the votes of MSSIC\u2019s members, subject only to constitutional limitations. Consequently, Chevy Chase\u2019s contract with MSSIC, when made, dealt with a regulated subject matter on which the State could act at any time in the future for the general welfare. \u201cThose who do business in the regulated field cannot object if the legislative scheme is buttressed by subsequent amendments to achieve the legislative end.\u201d <em>FHA v. The Darlington, Inc., </em>358 U.S. 84, 91, 79 S.Ct. 141, 146, 3 L.Ed.2d 132, 138 (1958). Chevy Chase\u2019s contract with MSSIC did not enjoy a high expectation of immutability.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Next, we observe that the nature of the change effected by Ch. 6 is not very substantial. MSSIC\u2019s CRF was always intended to assist members with liquidity. Chevy Chase\u2019s entire legal position rests on the fact that MSSIC Rule \u00a7 3-901 does not expressly condition the corporation\u2019s obligation to repay withdrawing members their CRF contributions on the availability of funds over the corporation\u2019s reasonably anticipated needs for liquidity. The change which we assume to have been effected by Ch. 6 is express on that score, but there is no change in the purpose for which the funds are being used as a result of the \u201cchange\u201d in the rule. <em>See Connolly, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 106 S.Ct. at 1027, 89 L.Ed.2d at 180 (\u201cPrudent employers [in 1980] had more than sufficient notice not only that pension plans were currently regulated, but also that withdrawal itself might trigger additional financial obligations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Nor does the degree of intrusion on Chevy Chase\u2019s right to receive repayment even approach the line separating a constitutional exercise of sovereignty from an unconstitutional taking. We have said that \u201c[f]or government restriction upon the use of property to constitute a taking in the constitutional sense, so that compensation must be paid, the restriction must be such that it essentially deprives the owner of all beneficial uses of his property.\u201d <em>Governor v. Exxon Corp., </em>279 Md. 410, 436-37, 370 A.2d 1102, 1117 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>(1977), a<em>ff'd, </em>437 U.S. 117, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 (1978) . Here, of course, compensation for the use of the money is being paid and at a rate which is unchallenged. Economic burdens far exceeding that which Ch. 6 and the implementing decision of MDIF\u2019s Director and board have placed on Chevy Chase have been held constitutional. For example, when California instituted an assigned risk plan for automobile liability insurance the plan was challenged by an insurer which had written only select risks at a lower cost than the prevailing rate. The fact that the complainant\u2019s business might be less prosperous as a result of the regulation did not amount to a taking in the constitutional sense. <em>See California State Automobile Association Inter-Insurance Bureau v. Maloney, </em>341 U.S. 105, 71 S.Ct. 601, 95 L.Ed. 788 (1951). That the Maryland General Assembly chose not to make MSSIC subject to the jurisdiction of the Insurance Commissioner of Maryland does not detract from the reasoning of the Supreme Court in the California assigned risk case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">The case in its broadest reach is one in which the state requires in the public interest each member of a business to assume a <em>pro rata </em>share of a burden which modern conditions have made incident to the business. It is therefore not unlike <em>Noble State Bank v. Haskell, </em>219 U.S. 104, 31 S.Ct. 186, 55 L.Ed. 112, which sustained a state law assessing each state bank for the creation of a depositors\u2019 guaranty fund. What was there said about the police power\u2014that it \u201cextends to all the great public needs\u201d and may be utilized in aid of what the legislative judgment deems necessary to the public welfare, 219 U.S. at page 111, 31 S.Ct. at page 188\u2014is peculiarly apt when the business of insurance is involved\u2014a business to which the government has long had a \u201cspecial relation.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 109, 71 S.Ct. at 603, 95 L.Ed. at 792 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac0\">An enforced contribution for the common good was also involved in <em>Allied American Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>219 Md. 607, 150 A.2d 421 (1959). Under the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Fund statutes, the board administering that fund was authorized to assign claims for investigation and defense to insurers in proportion to their respective Maryland premiums. The insurers were not reimbursed for the costs and expenses incurred in causing these services to be rendered. We held that the statutory imposition of those obligations was a constitutional exercise of the police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">An additional factor which weighs very heavily in the constitutional evaluation is the economic emergency which resulted in the spring of 1985 from the savings and loan crisis and which produced Ch. 6 and the contract change complained of by Chevy Chase. The first special session of 1985 also enacted Ch. 4, authorizing the creation of $100 million of state debt for the Savings and Loan Association Capital Stabilization Fund. The preamble to Ch. 4 contains the following legislative findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">Public confidence in the security of deposits in privately insured savings and loan associations has been severely eroded by recent events in Ohio; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">... The events in Ohio have led to heightened sensitivity in Maryland to the fiscal integrity and financial stability of privately insured savings and loan associations; and ... Two major State-chartered, privately insured savings and loan associations are under court ordered conservatorships; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">... These events and the consequent erosion of public confidence have led to the proclamation by the Governor of an emergency sufficiently grave to require his directing that withdrawals by depositors be limited to an aggregate $1,000 per account in each 30 consecutive day period commencing May 14, 1985, from any association insured by the Maryland Savings-Share Insurance Corporation not in conservatorship; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">... The General Assembly has been called into Special Session to take action to alleviate the impending financial crisis; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>... The continued fiscal integrity and financial stability of the thrift industry in Maryland is a vitally important concern to the State and all of its citizens; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">... The events in Maryland have been reported adversely to have affected the value of the United States dollar in international money markets; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">... Both the fiscal reputation of the government of the State of Maryland and the credit of the State of Maryland, including its ability in the future to finance vitally needed public projects and programs through ready access to the financial markets, may be adversely affected unless decisive action is taken to restore public confidence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">... The General Assembly hereby declares that a condition of public crisis and emergency exists in the State of Maryland and that the following enactment is necessary to protect the public safety, health, and welfare, to control the state of emergency, and to restore public confidence in, and the fiscal integrity and financial stability of, the thrift industry throughout Maryland[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGo6\">From the standpoint of an economic emergency the instant case is like <em>Home Building &amp; Loan Association v. Blaisdell, </em>290 U.S. 398, 54 S.Ct. 231, 78 L.Ed. 413 (1934). On April 18, 1933, Minnesota enacted its Mortgage Moratorium Law which permitted the extension of time for redemption by mortgagors of foreclosed property and granted the mortgagors the right to continue possession if they paid the foreclosing mortgagee the reasonable rental value of the property. <em>Blaisdell </em>involved a property which had gone to foreclosure sale on May 2, 1932, almost one year before the statute was enacted. A Minnesota court applied the statute to extend the mortgagor\u2019s redemption deadline and right of possession to May 1, 1935. The Supreme Court of the United States held there was no impairment of the mortgage contract. <em>See also Veix v. Sixth Ward Building &amp; Loan Association, </em>310 U.S. 32, 60 S.Ct. 792, 84 L.Ed. 1061 (1940) (no impairment of contract of depositor suing in 1939 where a statute enacted in 1932 to regulate withdraw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>als from distressed savings and loan associations had continuously prevented the complainant from obtaining his deposit). Thus, the delay in the instant case in repaying the principal of Plaintiffs CRF funds which are earning interest during the period of the delay cannot be an unconstitutional taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">In its brief in this Court, Chevy Chase argues that Ch. 6 unconstitutionally impaired the obligation of its contract. That ground of attack was not asserted in Chevy Chase\u2019s complaint and was not decided by the trial court. Even were it properly raised it has been answered adversely to Chevy Chase by the foregoing discussion. Under <em>Energy Reserves Group v. Kansas Power and Light Co., </em>459 U.S. 400, 411-13, 103 S.Ct. 697, 704-05, 74 L.Ed.2d 569, 580-81 (1983), an impairment analysis looks first to whether Ch. 6 in fact operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship. Here Ch. 6 did not so operate. But even if it had, the State can justify the impairment by a significant and legitimate public purpose behind the regulation. Here that purpose is to quell further panic by preventing illiquidity in member associations not in conservatorship or receivership. Finally, the adjustment of the rights and responsibilities of the contracting parties must be based upon reasonable conditions and be of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying the adoption of the legislation. Here in order to meet one aspect of the savings and loan emergency a delay of limited duration in refunding principal was imposed while paying adequate interest on the principal during the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Throughout its arguments Chevy Chase has emphasized the retrospective nature of the contract change made by the State, as if retroactivity alone invalidated Ch. 6\u2019s regulation of capital withdrawals. Obviously all legislatively imposed changes in existing contracts involve some retroactivity, but all such changes are not unconstitutional. On this aspect Chevy Chase relies on <em>Vytar Associates v. City of Annapolis, </em>301 Md. 558, 483 A.2d 1263 (1984). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>There the plaintiffs had become entitled to refunds of license fees which had been invalidly imposed by a municipality when the General Assembly attempted retroactively to validate the impositions and to block the plaintiffs\u2019 refund claims. We held the refund claims were protected property rights. <em>Vytar </em>relied upon <em>Washington National Arena v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>287 Md. 38, 410 A.2d 1060, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 834, 101 S.Ct. 106, 66 L.Ed.2d 40 (1980). Both <em>Vytar </em>and <em>Washington National Arena </em>are examples of a line of cases which \u201chave held that retroactive statutes, imposing taxes or other governmental charges and reaching voluntary transactions completed significantly before the enactment of the statutes, unconstitutionally deprive persons of property or contract rights.\u201d <em>Washington National Arena, supra, </em>287 Md. at 45 n.3, 410 A.2d at 1064 n. 3. Even if MDIF\u2019s use of the CRF contributions could be viewed as the imposition of a governmental charge, Chevy Chase\u2019s transaction with MSSIC had not been completed when Ch. 6 was enacted. Chapter 6 made MSSIC Rule \u00a7 3-901 no longer applicable before Chevy Chase had withdrawn from MSSIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The circuit court correctly declared the rights of the parties as to the CRF funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

Certificates of Deposit. Certificates of deposit shall be issued by the Corporation to its members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>for all capital deposits made with the Corporation in accordance with these Rules. Members may carry such certificates of deposit on their books as assets. No interest or dividends of any kind whatsoever shall be payable by the Corporation with respect to any certificate of deposit issued by it in accordance with these Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Section 3-501. <em>Withdrawal. </em>Any member which is not, either at the time of giving notice of intention to withdraw or at the time of withdrawal, in default in any of its obligations to the Corporation, including calls made before the date of withdrawal, and which has repaid any advance or loan made to it by the Corporation and has carried out the terms of any other agreement made with the Corporation, may withdraw from membership in the Corporation upon giving to it twelve months notice in writing of its intention to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Section 3-503. <em>Payment to Withdrawing Member. </em>Any member withdrawing from the Corporation pursuant to the provisions of this section of these Rules shall be entitled to receive from the Corporation payment of the certificate of deposit issued by the Corporation and owned by such member less any debts or obligations owed by such member to the Corporation (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the \u201cnet deposit\u201d) in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">(A) A date shall be specified by the Corporation for the termination of insurance of free share accounts issued by the withdrawing members, which date shall not be later than twelve months from the date of the notice referred to in Section 3-501 (such date being referred to in these Rules as the \u201cterminal date\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">(B) A fraction as of the terminal date shall be determined, the numerator thereof being the total cash owned by the Corporation and the denominator thereof being the total assets (including cash) of the Corporation.

Such certificate shall describe the assets to which it relates only by symbols, and the Corporation shall, after the issuance of such certificate, designate such assets on its records by like symbols. Such certificate shall not entitle the holder thereof to any control over the manner, amount or date of liquidation of such assets. The Corporation shall not reveal any information relative to such remaining assets other than the extent of liquidation of the assets to which such certificate relates. The Corporation in final settlement of a withdrawing member\u2019s net deposit may either pay to the withdrawing member in lieu of such certificate such sum in cash as may be agreed upon as the reasonable value thereof, or, at any time after the issuance of such certificate, may purchase the same for such sum in cash as may then be agreed upon as the reasonable value thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Section 3-504. <em>Termination and Notice. </em>No free share account issued by any member shall be insured after the termination date as defined in Section 3-503(A). Any member whose membership in the Corporation is terminated at any time shall notify each of its free share holders of such termination of membership and shall set forth in the notice the termination date as defined in Section 3-503(A). In no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>event shall the Corporation permit the withdrawal of any assets from the Corporation by any terminating member until such member has delivered to the Corporation proof of the giving of notice required by this section. In the event the withdrawing member fails to notify its free share holders of termination of insurance within sixty days of notification to the withdrawing member by the Corporation of the terminal date as provided in Section 3-503(A), the Corporation shall give such notice at the expense of the withdrawing member.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Section 3-901.

The Executive Vice President shall serve as secretary thereof. The committeemen may or may not be Directors of the Corporation or members of the Corporation and may be public representatives provided, however, a majority of the Committee shall be members of the Board. Members of the Committee shall hold office until the next annual meeting following their appointment and until their successors are appointed and qualified. The Committee shall be charged with the management of the Fund and shall have the power and authority consistent with this Rule, to determine the procedures to be followed to implement the provisions of this Rule.

The member applying for an advance shall enter into a primary and unconditional obligation to pay off all advances, together with interest and any unpaid costs and expenses in connection therewith according to the terms under which they were made, in such form as shall meet the requirements of the Fund. The Fund shall reserve the right to require at any time, when deemed necessary for its protection deposits of collateral security if the loan was originally an unsecured loan, or additional collateral security or substitution of security by the member, if the loan was originally secured.

Any capital notes purchased by a member shall be part of the liquidity fund required to be maintained under Section 3-210; provided however, the borrowing member has fulfilled all its obligations to the Fund. Monies deposited with the Fund may be considered part of the liquidity of the members.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">(I) Liquidation. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine to liquidate the fund in whole or in part. In such event, each member shall receive its share of the Fund, after deduction of any indebtedness due.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">(J) Any member or members of the Fund proposing to consolidate with one or more other associations to form a new consolidated association or to merge into another such association shall notify the Fund of such action and the liquidated association shall be authorized to transfer its capital note to the surviving association.

Any such deferred payments shall continue to bear interest as though the member were still an active participant in the Fund.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\">. At the time of the 1960 crisis a number of insolvent associations were \"insured\" by a private insurer, Security Financial Insurance Corporation, which was also placed in receivership. <em>See Security Financial Ins.

As we shall see that was one day before Chevy Chase obtained insurance through FSLIC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b484-10\">. On November 10, 1985, Chase Manhattan Corporation which had acquired Merritt and two other troubled savings and loan associations repaid MDIF $58.1 million of outstanding loans. The record before us does not make clear whether \"cash\" in the CRF was affected in any way at all by this payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b485-8\">. The date of December 31, 1986, had also been used in the October 10, 1985, agreement between MDIF and the Chase Manhattan Corporation as the outside date by which the entire amount of CRF contributions by the three associations involved in that transaction would be released by MDIF to the acquirer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b486-7\">.

Is the condition that the CRF have \"sufficient cash available\u201d satisfied if the \"cash\u201d equals or exceeds the \"face amount- of the capital notes,\" or does the concept, \"sufficient cash available,\u201d exclude from the sum to be paid to a withdrawing member the amount of \"cash\u201d which should be maintained on hand in order to meet reasonably anticipated liquidity requirements of the remaining members? Who makes the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>whether sufficient cash is available? Is that judgment subject to judicial review? If so, by what standard?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\">. By assuming Chevy Chase's construction of the MSSIC rule we do not violate the principle of judicial process under which a court ordinarily does not decide a constitutional question if the matter may be decided without reaching the constitutional issues. On the record presented for summary judgment, the circuit court did not decide whether under MSSIC Rule \u00a7 3-901 there was any breach of contract. The trial judge denied Chevy Chase\u2019s \u201ccontract claims\u201d by holding that the State and MDIF enjoyed sovereign immunity. It then held that there had been no taking effected by Ch. 6. Any analysis of the sovereign immunity defense under the circumstances of this case would in any event require us to consider the unconstitutional taking argument raised by Chevy Chase. By assuming that the State has unilaterally changed the contract as to CRF funds, we are simply using an express train to get to the same ultimate destination without local stops.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
