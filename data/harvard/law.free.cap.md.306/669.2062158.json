Baltimore City Code, Art. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 29-41A (1979, 1983 Repl.Vol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The facts giving rise to the present controversy are uncontroverted and may be stated briefly. All of the appellants were firefighters employed by the City of Baltimore. Each suffered an impairment of health as contemplated by Art. 101, \u00a7 64A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each filed a claim with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission (Commission) and was awarded permanent total disability compensation. However, each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>claimant\u2019s award was reduced by the entire amount of retirement allowances received by that claimant under the Fire and Police Employees Retirement System of Baltimore City. The amount of retirement allowances receivable by covered employees consisted of pension payments, annuity payments and investment variable payments. The pension constitutes the actuarial equivalent of money provided by the employer, the City of Baltimore. The annuity constitutes the actuarial equivalent of the accumulated contributions of the employee at the time of his retirement. The investment variable constitutes the excess investment earnings derived from both the pension and annuity funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Feeling aggrieved, each of the three appellants appealed the Commission\u2019s award to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, which affirmed the Commission\u2019s disposition of the claims. Similarly, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed in a reported opinion filed February 11, 1986. <em>Harris et al v. City of Baltimore, </em>66 Md.App. 397, 504 A.2d 657 (1986). We granted certiorari to consider a question of public importance. For reasons herein stated, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">By Chapter 695, Laws of Maryland, 1971, the legislature provided that certain occupational diseases sustained by certain firefighters in the line of duty and as a result of their employment are to be presumed compensable. <em>See </em>Art. 101, \u00a7 64A(a). It was further provided that such a claimant could receive certain benefits under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws in addition to receiving those benefits recoverable under the retirement system in which the claimant was a participant at the time his claim was made. <em>See </em>Art. 101, \u00a7 64A(b). These provisions came to be present section 64A of Article 101 of the Annotated Code of Maryland. Since its inception in 1971, the breadth of coverage provided by \u00a7 64A has been expanded and now includes state, municipal, Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, county and airport authority police offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>cers, as well as volunteer firefighters, fire fighting instructors and rescue squad members.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Of particular concern here, however, is the applicability and effect of subsection (b) of \u00a7 64A. In subsection (b), the legislature has provided in part that the benefits received by a covered claimant under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws \u201cshall be adjusted so that the total of all weekly benefits shall not exceed one hundred percent of the weekly salary which was paid to said fire fighter or police officer.\u201d It is this unambiguous language that disposes of appellants\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In resolving the question before us, we initially look to the language in the statute. If it is clear and unambiguous, then we need look no further. <em>Erwin and Shafer, Inc. v. Pabst Brewing Co., Inc., </em>304 Md. 302, 309, 498 A.2d 1188 (1985). In such a case, a plainly worded statute must be construed without forced or subtle interpretations designed to extend or limit the scope of its operation. Doing so merely provides the clearest indication of the legislative intent and is thus the primary source for all statutory construction. <em>State v. Berry, </em>287 Md. 491, 495, 413 A.2d 557 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">By its enactment of \u00a7 64A, the legislature has expressed its continued interest in providing wage-loss protection for the covered employees but, at the same time, recognized that an employee who sustains compensable injuries under the Workmen's Compensation laws experiences but one wage loss. This recognition by the legislature is in accord with that of the legal commentators and is consistent with similar provisions embodied in Article 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The desirability for coordination of an overall system of wage-loss protection is aptly discussed in Larson\u2019s <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 97.00:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>\u201cOnce it is recognized that workmen's compensation is one unit in an overall system of wage-loss protection, rather than something resembling a recovery in tort or on a private accident policy, the conclusion follows that duplication of benefits from different parts of the system should not ordinarily be allowed____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-5\"><em>See also Mazor v. State Dep\u2019t of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 369 A.2d 82 (1977). <em>Compare </em>Art. 101, \u00a7 33(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">We stated in <em>Feissner v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>282 Md. 413, 420-21, 384 A.2d 742 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">\u201cWe recently considered the offset provisions of \u00a7 33 in <em>Mazor v. State, Dep\u2019t of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 369 A.2d 82 (1977), <em>aff'g </em>30 Md.App. 394, 352 A.2d 918 (1976); <em>see also Nooe v. City of Baltimore, </em>28 Md.App. 348, 345 A.2d 134 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>276 Md. 748 (1976). In <em>Mazor, </em>taking note of the fact that a majority of American jurisdictions provide for some form of setoff in the area of wage-loss legislation, we said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">\u2018[Workmen's compensation is one facet of an overall system of wage-loss protection, and ... the underlying principle of the system is to restore to the worker a portion of wages lost by physical disability, unemploy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>ment, or old age. It follows that although two or more causes of wage loss may coincide, the benefits need not cumulate, for the worker experiences but one wage loss/ 279 Md. at 368, 369 A.2d 82 (citation omitted).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">A year later, we had occasion to discuss the offset provision of \u00a7 33 of Art. 101 in <em>Frank v. Baltimore County, </em>284 Md. 655, 659, 399 A.2d 250 (1979). There we said through Judge Digges:</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\u201cUpon reading section 33 the scheme that unmistakably emerges is that the General Assembly wished to provide only a single recovery for a single injury for government employees covered by both a pension plan and workmen\u2019s compensation. Consequently, this section not only provides that when disability pension benefits exceed workmen\u2019s compensation the latter shall be completely eliminated, but also directs that when pension benefits happen to be less than workmen\u2019s compensation, the employer is required to furnish additional benefits which, when added to it, will equal the compensation award. <em>See Feissner v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>282 Md. 413, 420-21, 384 A.2d 742, 747 (1978). This construction, besides being supported by the legislative history of section 33, <em>see Nooe v. City of Baltimore, </em>28 Md.App. 348, 352-53, 345 A.2d 134, 137 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>276 Md. 748 (1976), is also consistent with the generally recognized policy underlying all wage-loss legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">Wage-loss legislation is designed to restore to the worker a portion ... of wages lost due to the three major causes of wage-loss: physical disability, economic unemployment, and old age. The crucial operative fact is that of wage-loss____ Now if a workman undergoes a period of wage loss due to all three conditions, it does not follow that he should receive three sets of benefits simultaneously and thereby recover more than his actual wage. He is experiencing only one wage loss and, in any logical system, should receive only one wage-loss benefit. [4 A. Larson, <em>The Law of Work</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number><em>men\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 97.10, at 18-9 (1979) (footnote omitted).]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Significantly, the petitioner in <em>Frank </em>presented the same argument to the Court as the appellants, in part, present to us. In <em>Frank, </em>petitioner argued that since he had contributed to his pension plan, any benefit he received from the plan was not a \u201cbenefit provided by the employer\u201d under \u00a7 33(c) and, therefore, there could be no setoff. While the language of \u00a7 64A(b) is somewhat different from that of \u00a7 33(c), the rationale underlying its enactment is the same. Thus, what we said in <em>Frank </em>in regard to employee contribution is not only applicable, but dispositive as well. There we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">\u201cWhile we agree with petitioner that his pension is not a benefit <em>entirely </em>provided by his employer since, as an employee, he also contributed to the plan, such a finding does not dictate a conclusion that the board improperly applied the offset provision of section 33 in this case. In the first place, the statute does not mandate that the pension benefit be one \u2018entirely\u2019 supplied by the employer before the commission is required to make the comparison called for in section 33(d), and, in the second place, the addition of such a requirement would frustrate the legislature\u2019s intention to minimize the burden on the public treasury that would result from providing duplicate benefits to public employees. When, as in this case, \u2018the statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity and expresses a definite and sensible meaning, the courts are not at liberty to insert or delete words with a view toward making the statute express an intention which is different from its plain meaning.\u2019 <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>244 Md. 609, 617, 224 A.2d 677, 682 (1966) (citing cases).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJA\">284 Md. at 660-61, 399 A.2d 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the Commission was correct in adjusting the compensation benefits awarded to appellants and the Court of Special Appeals likewise was correct in affirming the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-6\">.
