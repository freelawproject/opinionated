Rule 2-322(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">On December 24,1983, Donald P. Zorbach was involved in an accident with an automobile insured by State Farm. Zorbach retained Ronald M. Sharrow, an attorney, for the purpose of pursuing a claim relating to personal injuries sustained in that accident. In a written agreement dated December 29, 1983, Sharrow agreed to represent Zorbach for a fee of one-third of any recovery obtained through settlement or 40% if suit was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">On March 16,1984, Sharrow filed a three count complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against State Farm and two of its employees, Mary A. Burns and William Rinehardt, alleging that they tortiously interfered with his contingent fee contract by negotiating and settling the claim directly with Zorbach. Count I of the complaint, entitled \u201cIntentional Interference with Contract Rights\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>State Farm,\u201d alleges the existence of the contingent fee contract; that Sharrow wrote Burns on January 4, 1984, advising State Farm of his representation of Zorbach; that State Farm, through Burns, acknowledged Sharrow\u2019s representation and mailed the appropriate claim form to him for completion by Zorbach; that Sharrow forwarded a completed \u201cState Farm Insurance Company Personal Injury Protection Form\u201d to the insurer which subsequently forwarded to Sharrow confirmation of payments which it made to various medical providers on Zorbach\u2019s behalf. The complaint then alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-4\">\u201c11. On or about February 20, 1984, Zorbach advised Sharrow he was in desperate financial condition and requested that Sharrow lend him money. Sharrow declined and advised Zorbach that it is unethical for an attorney to make a loan to a client. Zorbach was further advised that it was not the practice of an insurance carrier to advance money against a settlement and it would be unwise to approach State Farm with such a request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">12. Due to his dire financial condition, Zorbach, on or about February 21, 1984, contached State Farm and requested an advance. Zorbach acted without Sharrow\u2019s knowledge or acquiescence and contrary to Sharrow\u2019s advice. State Farm, through its agents, servants and employees, denied Zorbach\u2019s request and instead negotiated a settlement of Zorbach\u2019s claim for $2,500.00. Zorbach was directed to go to the Harford Road office to execute certain documents to finalize the settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">12. <em>[sic </em>] Zorbach went to State Farm\u2019s offices as directed and executed a release. Zorbach was also required by State Farm\u2019s agents, servants and employees to execute a document discharging Sharrow as his attorney and stating that he had advised Sharrow of his intention to settle directly with State Farm. This written statement was false and was known by State Farm to be false. (See Exhibit 7 attached hereto.)[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>13. State Farm through its agents, servants and employees, was aware of the existence of a contractual agreement between Sharrow and Zorbach and had full knowledge that the contractual agreement was in existence at the time of the settlement negotiations with Zorbach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-4\">14. State Farm, through its agents, servants and employees, intentionally, willfully and maliciously interfered with Sharrow\u2019s contractual rights by negotiating with Zorbach while he was still represented by Sharrow, by causing Zorbach to terminate Sharrow\u2019s representation without Sharrow\u2019s knowledge, and by requiring that Zorbach falsely state, in writing, that he had advised Sharrow of his intention to deal directly with State Farm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-5\">15. State Farm\u2019s actions in interfering with Sharrow\u2019s contract rights were perpetrated solely to injure Sharrow and wrongfully deprive it of the benefit of its contract with Zorbach.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Count II, entitled \u201cIntentional Interference with Contract Rights\u2014Mary A. Burns,\u201d reasserts the same allegations and adds that Burns was the claim adjuster assigned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Zorbach\u2019s claim; that she had full knowledge of the existence of Sharrow\u2019s contract with Zorbach; that she acted within the scope of her employment and that she</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-4\">\u201c18. ... intentionally, willfully and maliciously interfered with Sharrow\u2019s contract rights by negotiating with Zorbach while he was still represented by Sharrow, by causing Zorbach to terminate Sharrow\u2019s representation without Sharrow\u2019s knowledge, and by requiring that Zorbach falsely state in writing that he had advised Sharrow of his intention to deal directly with State Farm. Burns further interfered with Sharrow\u2019s contract rights by stating to Zorbach that since it was Zorbach, not Sharrow, that settled the claim, Sharrow should not receive a fee for legal services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Sharrow further alleged that Burns\u2019 actions were undertaken solely to injure and wrongfully deprive him of the benefit of his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Count III, entitled \u201cIntentional Interference with Contract Rights\u2014William Rinehardt,\u201d adopts the allegations of the prior two counts and focuses on Rinehardt\u2019s claimed tortious conduct. The count alleges that Rinehardt was acting within the scope of his employment as Burns\u2019 supervisor and had full knowledge of Sharrow\u2019s contract with Zorbach. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-8\">\u201c22. Subsequent to learning of the settlement with Zorbach, Sharrow contacted Rinehardt by telephone to discuss Burns\u2019 conduct and to demand that a fee be paid to Sharrow. Rinehardt refused to discuss the matter and abruptly terminated that conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-9\">23. Rinehardt was aware of the acts perpetrated by Burns and participated with Burns in maliciously interfering with Sharrow\u2019s contract rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-10\">24. Rinehardt failed to take appropriate action to correct the conduct of Burns despite being specifically informed of her conduct by Sharrow and further refused to honor Sharrow\u2019s demand that a fee be paid in accordance with the contractual agreement with Zorbach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>25. Rinehardt intentionally, willfully and maliciously interfered with Sharrow\u2019s contract rights by participating in, and refusing to correct, the acts of Burns and by refusing to honor Sharrow\u2019s claim to a fee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">It is further alleged that Rinehardt acted solely to injure and deprive Sharrow of the benefit of his contingent fee contract. With respect to all three counts, Sharrow alleged that as a direct and proximate result of the conduct of State Farm, Burns and Rinehardt, he was damaged; he claimed $50,000 compensatory and $1,000,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">State Farm demurred to Sharrow\u2019s complaint. Treating the demurrer as a motion to dismiss under Md. Rules 2-302 and 2-322(b), the trial court dismissed the complaint and Sharrow appealed. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment in <em>Sharrow v. State Farm Mutual, </em>63 Md. App. 412, 492 A.2d 977 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The intermediate appellate court held that an action for tortious interference with contractual relations is applicable to professional service contracts between attorneys and clients. In considering whether particular conduct by a third party is actionable, the court recognized that an attorney has a legitimate interest in a contingent fee contract. The court also recognized the good faith right of the client to settle his cause of action without the attorney\u2019s knowledge or consent. And, moreover, it observed that an insurance company \u201chas a right\u2014and whenever reasonable and possible, a duty\u2014to settle a claim made against its insured.\u201d 63 Md.App. at 424, 492 A.2d 977. But nothing in these respective rights and interests, the court said, constitutes justification for a third party to maliciously interfere with an attorney-client contract while it is in existence. Citing cases from other jurisdictions, the court, speaking through Judge Wilner, said that as a general rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJA4\">\u201cthe mere negotiation and settlement of a claim by an insurance company directly with the claimant, even when the company is aware of the attorney\u2019s employment, is not enough to create liability for malicious interference with the attorney\u2019s contingent fee contract. In most of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>the cases finding such liability, there has been the presence of some more egregious conduct on the part of the defendant, usually in the nature of fraudulent statements made to the claimant, which induces him to dismiss the attorney and settle with the company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, 492 A.2d 977.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">The court noted that the cases supporting this view have predicated liability \u201cupon fraudulent or unconscionable conduct that actually induced the claimant to dismiss his or her attorney and settle directly with the insurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421, 492 A.2d 977. The actionable conduct, according to the intermediate appellate court, \u201cwas not the settlement itself, or even the pursuit of direct negotiations, but rather the acts or statements that induced the claimant to discharge the attorney and conclude the settlement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That there be \u201cculpable conduct\u201d apart from the mere settlement or direct negotiation between the client and the insurer was said to be consistent with the nature of the tort. <em>Id. </em>at 422, 492 A.2d 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The court found additional support for its analysis in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766 (1977), which states that the tort consists of \u201cintentionally and improperly interfering] with the performance of a contract ... between another and a third person by inducing or otherwise causing the third person not to perform the contract.\u201d The court emphasized that under Comment a to this section, the interference, to be actionable, must be \u201cimproper\u201d; and that under \u00a7 767 a \u201cchief\u201d factor, to be balanced with other factors there specified, in deciding whether an actor\u2019s conduct is improper is the nature of the conduct, <em>e.g., </em>that \u201cphysical violence, fraudulent misrepresentation and threats of illegal conduct are ordinarily wrongful means\u201d and thus actionable. The court thereafter concluded that an insurer\u2019s conduct in settling a claim directly with a client known to be represented by counsel is actionable in these circumstances: \u201cIf, to achieve its own ends, an insurer deliberately induces the claimant to repudiate his retainer agreement by means of threats, misrepresentations, or oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>er coercive or unconscionable conduct, its \u2018right to settle\u2019 cannot save it from liability to the lawyer who has suffered economic detriment from the repudiation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 492 A.2d 977. On the other hand, the court said that if a claimant indicates that he is willing to settle without the intervention of his lawyer and the insurer \u201csimply responds to that and proceeds in good faith to settle the claim without engaging in any of the opprobrious conduct noted above,\u201d the insurer\u2019s conduct is not improper and is therefore not actionable. <em>Id. </em>at 424, 492 A.2d 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Applying these principles, the court then undertook to determine \u201cwhether, assuming the truth of all wellpleaded allegations of fact, appellant\u2019s complaint \u2018state[s] a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u2019 Md. Rules 2-322(b)(2).\u201d 63 Md.App. at 413, 492 A.2d 977. In affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment that Sharrow\u2019s allegations provided no basis for liability, the court noted, as to Count I, that Zorbach approached State Farm and reached a settlement agreement without \u201cblandishments or improper inducements\u201d on State Farm\u2019s part. <em>Id. </em>at 425, 492 A.2d 977. Furthermore, said the court, \u201c[t]he allegedly false statement required by State Farm [as to Zorbach having advised Sharrow of his intention to settle directly with State Farm and that he had discharged Sharrow] (1) came <em>after </em>the parties had already made their agreement to settle, and (2) was not entirely false\u201d in that the statement that Sharrow had been discharged became true the instant the document was signed. <em>Id. </em>at 425, 492 A.2d 977 (emphasis in original). The allegations of Counts II and III were also found to be insufficient. Burns\u2019 alleged statement that Zorbach did not have to pay Sharrow was construed as having been made only after a settlement was concluded and could not, therefore, have served to induce Zorbach to repudiate his agreement with Sharrow. Since Burns did nothing improper, the court reasoned that Rinehardt did nothing improper in refusing to disavow Burns\u2019 actions and to pay Sharrow. <em>Id. </em>at 425-26, 492 A.2d 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>We granted Sharrow\u2019s petition for certiorari to determine whether the allegations of his complaint were sufficient to state a cause of action and thus preclude the granting of a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Intentional or malicious interference with contract is a well-established tort in Maryland. <em>See, e.g., Vane v. Nocella, </em>303 Md. 362, 494 A.2d 181 (1985); <em>Natural Design, Inc. v. Rouse Co., </em>302 Md. 47, 485 A.2d 663 (1984); <em>Rite Aid Corp. v. Lake Shore Inv., </em>298 Md. 611, 471 A.2d 735 (1984); <em>Wilmington Trust Co. v. Clark, </em>289 Md. 313, 424 A.2d 744 (1981); <em>Stannard v. McCool, </em>198 Md. 609, 84 A.2d 862 (1951); <em>Goldman v. Building Assn., </em>150 Md. 677, 133 A. 843 (1926); <em>Cumberland Glass Mnf'g Co. v. DeWitt, </em>120 Md. 381, 87 A. 927 (1913), <em>aff'd, </em>237 U.S. 447, 35 S.Ct. 636, 59 L.Ed. 1042 (1915); <em>Knickerbocker Co. v. Gardiner Co., </em>107 Md. 556, 69 A. 405 (1887); <em>Gore v. Condon, </em>87 Md. 368, 39 A. 1042 (1898). As we said in <em>Natural Design, supra, </em>302 Md. at 69, 485 A.2d 663, the tort may arise where intentional interference by a third party with another in his business or occupation induces a breach of an existing contract or where, absent a breach of contract, there is malicious or wrongful interference with an economic relationship. <em>See also Lake Shore Investors v. Rite Aid Corp., </em>67 Md.App. 743, 509 A.2d 727 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The 1887 case of <em>Knickerbocker Co. v. Gardiner Co., supra, </em>is a leading authority in Maryland on the tort of intentional or malicious interference with contract. There, a dairy and the Sumwalt Ice and Coal Company entered into a contract whereby Sumwalt agreed to supply ice to the dairy. Sumwalt, however, was forced by the exigencies of its business to purchase ice from the Knickerbocker Ice Co. which threatened to cease supplying ice to Sumwalt if it continued to supply the dairy. The dairy was then forced to purchase ice from Knickerbocker at a greater price and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>sued Knickerbocker, alleging interference with its contract with Sumwalt. Relying largely on <em>Lumley v. Gye, </em>2 El. &amp; Bl. 216, 118 Eng. Rep. 749 (1853), Chief Judge Boyd noted for the court that the relevant authorities sustained the right to maintain a tort action upon the doctrine that a person who induces one of two parties to a contract to break it, intending thereby to injure the other, or to obtain a benefit for himself, does the other an actionable wrong. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 69 A. 405. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-4\">\u201cIt cannot be denied that it is unlawful for a party to a contract to break it, unless, of course, he has sufficient ground for doing so, and therefore when a third party procures or induces him to do so, he is causing him to do an unlawful act, which is itself unlawful, and the law ought to afford a remedy to the injured party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-5\"><em>Knickerbocker </em>pointed out, however, that a party may be the means of causing a contract to be broken and still not be liable. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 69 A. 405. Quoting from <em>Bowan v. Hall, </em>6 Q.B.D. 333, 338 (1881), the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-6\">\u201c \u2018Merely to persuade a person to break his contract may not be wrongful in law or fact____ But if the persuasion be used for the indirect purpose of injuring the plaintiff, or of benefiting the defendant at the expense of the plaintiff, it is a malicious act which is in law and in fact a wrong act, and therefore a wrongful act, and therefore an actionable act if injury ensues from it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565, 69 A. 405.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-9\"><em>Knickerbocker </em>explained that it was not necessary to prove express malice but only that the interference was wrongful and without justification. <em>Id. </em>at 568, 69 A. 405. As the later cases also make clear, malice in this form of action means legal malice, not ill will or spite, and need be only a wrongful or unlawful act done intentionally without cause or excuse. <em>Natural Design, supra, </em>302 Md. at 71, 485 A.2d 663; <em>Stannard, supra, </em>198 Md. at 617, 84 A.2d 862; <em>Cumberland Glass, supra, </em>120 Md. at 392-93, 87 A. 927; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number><em>also </em>Harper and James, <em>Torts, </em>ch. VI \u00a7 6.6 (1956); Prosser and Keeton, <em>Torts, </em>ch. 24, \u00a7 129 (5th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">It is thus clear from our cases that even though a third party may for his own benefit intentionally induce one party to terminate a contract with another, this alone will not render him liable in an action for tortious interference if he had a right to cause the breach since, in such circumstances, the conduct would not be wrongful or improper. <em>Stannard, supra, </em>198 Md. at 616, 84 A.2d 862; <em>Cumberland Glass, supra, </em>120 Md. at 394, 87 A. 927; <em>Knickerbocker, supra, </em>107 Md. at 566-67, 69 A. 405; Harper and James, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6.6; Prosser and Keeton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 129. But if the party causing the breach acts solely to benefit himself, or to cause injury to another, without a right to so act, such conduct is improper and may subject the party to liability for the injury suffered. <em>Knickerbocker, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals and the great majority of other jurisdictions that have considered the matter, that contracts between attorneys and clients, like other business contracts, are protected from tortious interference by third parties. <em>See </em>Annot. <em>Liability in Tort for Interference with Attorney-Client or Physician-Patient Relationship, </em>26 A.L.R.3d 679 (1969) and cases cited therein. As stated by the intermediate appellate court in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">\u201c[W]e see no reason why attorney-client agreements should be regarded as pariahs in the eyes of the law\u2014 why they, like most all other contracts, should not be protected against tortious interference by third parties. Whether viewed from the perspective of the lawyer or the client, it is not against public policy to preclude outsiders from improperly inducing either one to repudiate a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>contract he has made with the other; indeed, it would be contrary to public policy not to preclude such interference.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 63 Md.App. at 418, 492 A.2d 977.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">It is true, of course, that notwithstanding the existence of a contingent fee contract, the client may, in good faith, compromise, settle, or dismiss his cause of action without the attorney\u2019s intervention, knowledge, or consent. <em>Maddox v. District Supply, Inc., </em>222 Md. 31, 158 A.2d 650 (1960); <em>Palmer v. Brown, </em>184 Md. 309, 40 A.2d 514 (1945); <em>Boyd v. Johnson, </em>145 Md. 385, 125 A. 697 (1924). It is also true that an insurer has a right and duty to enter into good faith negotiations, where reasonable and feasible, to settle a claim against its insured within policy limits. <em>State Farm v. White, </em>248 Md. 324, 236 A.2d 269 (1967). But the insurer\u2019s duty in this regard does not afford it a right to interfere with the lawyer\u2019s legitimate interest in a contingent fee contract, while it exists, by improperly engaging in conduct calculated to induce or persuade the client to discharge the lawyer and settle his claim directly with the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">In its opinion, the Court of Special Appeals indicated that the conduct of the interfering third party, to be actionable, must be either egregious, opprobrious, fraudulent, coercive, or unconscionable and manifested by threats, misrepresentations, or other acts or statements made for the purpose of inducing the client to repudiate the contract and settle directly with the insurer. We think this standard is too restrictive and that the better rule would define as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>actionable any purposeful conduct, however subtle, by which an insurer improperly and intentionally induces or persuades a client to discharge his counsel and settle directly with it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">Consistent with this broader rule, a number of cases which have considered the tort of intentional interference with a contract between an attorney and his client have concluded, in effect, that to be actionable the conduct of the insurer need not necessarily be egregious in nature but only intentional for the improper purpose of inducing the client to repudiate his contract and settle directly with the insurer. <em>See, e.g., Edwards v. Travelers Insur. of Hartford, Conn., </em>563 F.2d 105 (6th Cir.1977) (interpreting Tennessee law); <em>Employers Liability Assurance Corp. v. Freeman, </em>229 F.2d 547 (10th Cir.1955) (interpreting Oklahoma law); <em>State Farm Fire Ins. v. Gregory, </em>184 F.2d 447 (4th Cir.1950) (interpreting South Carolina law); <em>Bennett v. Sinclair Nav. Co., </em>33 F. Supp. 14 (E.D. Penn. 1940); <em>State Farm Mutual Ins. Co. v. St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, </em>107 Ariz. 498, 489 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>837 (1971); <em>Weiss v. Marcus, </em>51 Cal. App. 3d 590, 124 Cal.Rptr. 297 (1975); <em>Herron v. State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, </em>56 Cal.2d 202, 14 Cal.Rptr. 294, 363 P.2d 310 (1961); <em>Lurie v. New Amsterdam Casualty, </em>270 N.Y. 379, 1 N.E.2d 472 (1936); <em>Ross v. Woyan, </em>1 Ohio App. 3d 39, 439 N.E.2d 428 (1980); <em>Keels v. Powell, </em>207 S. C. 97, 34 S.E.2d 482 (1945).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The pivotal issue in such cases is whether it was the purposeful conduct of the insurer, or of the client, that resulted in the discharge of the attorney and the direct settlement between the client and the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Under Md. Rule 2-322, a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim serves the same function as the demurrer under former Rules 345 and 371 b. <em>Broadwater v. State, </em>303 Md. 461, 494 A.2d 934 (1985); P. Niemeyer and L. Richards, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>at 149 (1984). Consequently, in considering the legal sufficiency of Sharrow\u2019s complaint to allege a cause of action for tortious interference, we must assume the truth of all relevant and material facts that are well pleaded and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from those pleadings. <em>Tadjer v. Montgomery County, </em>300 Md. 539, 542, 479 A.2d 1321 (1984); <em>Hoffman v. Key Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, </em>286 Md. 28, 416 A.2d 1265 (1979). On the other hand, any ambiguity or uncertainty in the allegations bearing on whether the complaint states a cause of action must be construed against the pleader. <em>Continental Masonry v. Verdel Constr., </em>279 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Md. 476, 869 A.2d 566 (1977); <em>Read Drug v. Colwill Constr., </em>250 Md. 406, 243 A.2d 548 (1968); <em>Carder v. Steiner, </em>225 Md. 271, 170 A.2d 220 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">Sharrow contends that he adequately stated a cause of action for tortious contract interference by alleging facts which, together with inferences properly to be drawn therefrom, averred that State Farm, knowing of Sharrow\u2019s representation of Zorbach, sensed Zorbach\u2019s desperate need for money when he contacted the insurer for an \u201cadvance\u201d on his pending claim; that the insurer \u201cseized the opportunity to exploit Zorbach\u2019s financial plight and induced a settlement\u201d; and that \u201cthe egregious nature of State Farm\u2019s conduct was compounded by its requirement that Zorbach execute documents it prepared which falsely stated that he had terminated Sharrow as his attorney and had advised Sharrow that he intended to deal directly with State Farm.\u201d Sharrow claims that this conduct was coercive and malicious; that Zorbach did not voluntarily and freely terminate his contract, but was induced to do so by State Farm\u2019s \u201copprobrious\u201d conduct and misrepresentations. Sharrow contends that the allegations of the complaint must be read as a whole and collectively viewed as a connected series of events which involved false documents and which ultimately served to induce and facilitate the settlement. Sharrow also suggests that a reasonable inference to be drawn from the facts alleged in his complaint is that the conversations between State Farm\u2019s agents and Zorbach were calculated to induce Zorbach\u2019s full and final acceptance of the settlement terms and to dispel any doubt he may have had regarding his potential liability to his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Absent from Sharrow\u2019s complaint is a specific averment that it was State Farm, rather than Zorbach, who actually initiated the settlement negotiations. Nor is there any allegation in the complaint that State Farm\u2019s purpose in negotiating directly with Zorbach was for its own benefit; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>indeed, the only allegation in the complaint is that State Farm\u2019s actions and those of its agents were solely to injure Sharrow and wrongfully deprive him of the benefit of his contract with Zorbach. Notwithstanding these shortcomings, we think that the allegations, and reasonable inferences therefrom, state a claim sufficient to withstand a dismissal of the. complaint under Md. Rule 2-322. With due deference to the rule that ambiguities and uncertainties in a pleading are to be construed against the pleader, the allegations of the complaint, taken collectively, can by a thin hair be read to aver as follows: that State Farm capitalized on Zorbach\u2019s need for money by first denying the requested \u201cadvance\u201d and thereafter by directly implicating him in settlement negotiations which it programmed to require, as a settlement condition precedent, that Zorbach avow in writing, falsely, that he had earlier advised Sharrow of his intention to settle directly with State Farm and had discharged Sharrow as his attorney\u2014all for the purpose of inducing Zorbach to repudiate his contract with Sharrow and thus enable State Farm to deprive Sharrow of his fee under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">There is, of course, a big difference between that which is necessary to prove the commission of the tort and that which is necessary merely to allege its commission. We think, therefore, in the circumstances that all three counts of the complaint, although lacking in desired specificity, are barely adequate to allege a claim for tortious interference with contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY WITH DIRECTIONS THAT THE ORDER DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT BE VACATED AND THE CASE SCHEDULED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\">.

The question whether an action for tortious interference with contractual relations is applicable to professional service contracts between attorneys and clients was before the Court, but not decided, in <em>Ensor v. Bolgiano, </em>67 Md. 190, 9 A. 529 (1887). Only a few courts, however, have found the doctrine of tortious interference with contract not applicable to attorney-client contracts. <em>See Walsh v. O\u2019Neill, </em>350 Mass. 586, 215 N.E.2d 915 (1966); <em>Orr v. Mutual Ben. Health &amp; Accident Ass\u2019n, </em>240 Mo.App. 236, 207 S.W.2d 511 (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b855-5\">. Comment k to \u00a7 766 of the Restatement notes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-6\">\"There is no technical requirement as to the kind of conduct that may result in interference with the third party\u2019s performance of the contract. The interference is often by inducement. The inducement may be any conduct conveying to the third person the actor\u2019s desire to influence him not to deal with the other. Thus it may be a simple request or persuasion exerting only moral pressure. Or it may be a statement unaccompanied by any specific request but having the same effect as if the request were specifically made. Or it may be a threat by the actor of physical or economic harm to the third person or to persons in whose welfare he is interested. Or it may be the promise of a benefit to the third person if he will refrain from dealing with the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-7\">\"On the other hand, it is not necessary to show that the third party was induced to break the contract. Interference with the third party\u2019s performance may be by prevention of the performance, as by physical force, by depriving him of the means of performance or by misdirecting the performance, as by giving him the wrong orders or information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Comments 1 and m to \u00a7 766 set forth other means of interference, <em>i.e., </em>inducement by refusal to deal and inducement by an offer of better terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b856-7\">. Some courts seem to require that the conduct of the insurer, to be actionable, must be egregious in nature. <em>See Volz v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, Inc., </em>498 F.2d 659 (5th Cir.1974) (interpreting Alabama law); <em>Herman v. Prudence Mutual Casualty Company, </em>41 Ill. 2d 468, 244 N.E.2d 809 (1969); <em>Krause v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>331 Mich. 19, 49 N.W.2d 41 (1951). The rule in these cases would appear to leave inactionable more subtle and sophisticated means of improperly inducing or persuading a client to discharge the lawyer and conclude a settlement directly with the insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
