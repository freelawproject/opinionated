Haynie, Jr., filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a \u201cBill For Declaratory Judgment.\u201d Named as defendant was Haynie\u2019s employer, Gold Bond Building Products. The pertinent factual allegations and issues raised were set forth in the Bill as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">\u201cThe Plaintiff alleges that in March, 1978, a defective piece of machinery at the production plant owned by the Defendant malfunctioned electrically igniting flammable fuel oil. The machinery was labeled a \u2018rock dryer,\u2019 a machine which flame dries gypsum rock to prepare it for processing in the Defendant\u2019s plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">\u201cThe manufacturer of the machine had recognized its potential for serious harm and had installed an automatic safety device which would shut down the flow of fuel oil in the event the electrical ignition system short circuited. This automatic cutoff would thereby prevent the occurrence of an extremely hazardous and life-threatening phenomenon known as \u2018reverse ignition\u2019 in which fuel oil splashes against the hot metal of the rock dryer igniting flames back into the area of the workmen. On several previous occasions, known only to the Defendant Corporation and its managerial personnel, the rock dryer ignition system had malfunctioned and the automatic safety device had immediately shut down the machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">\u201cThe Defendant Corporation recognized the potential danger of the rock dryer, but deliberately chose to disregard the risk of injury posed to its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">\u201cAt sometime prior to March 18, 1978, the managerial personnel of the Defendant Corporation rigged a bypass of the rock dryer\u2019s automatic safety device, telling no one about this attempt to maintain continuous operation of the assembly line system. The bypass of the rock dryer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>safety device was carried out by the Corporate Defendant so as to prevent the machine from shutting off, thereby reducing the \u2018down time\u2019 for the production assembly line.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">\u201cOnly hours after the bypass was put in place the electrical ignition system short circuited. This time, however, the rock dryer did not shut down and the continuous flow of fuel oil produced reverse ignition. The flammable fuel struck the super heated inner walls of the rock dryer and searing flames shot out from the mouth of the machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">\u201cForeseeably and predictably employees of the Defendant Corporation attempted to extinguish the fire with a fire extinguisher. In so doing, the Plaintiff, Samuel B. Haynie, Jr., was electrocuted when his metal fire extinguisher came in contact with the electrical system of the rock dryer. The Plaintiff survived, but suffered <em>inter alia </em>third degree internal burns which required extensive hospital, medical and surgical care and which have rendered him permanently disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\u201cThe Plaintiff asserts that the rule of law controlling this case is that articulated by the Court of Appeals of West Virginia in the case of <em>Mandolidis v. Elkins Industries, Inc., </em>161 W.Va. 695, 246 S.E.2d 907 (1978), ... which held that proof of outrageous misconduct by an employer plus proof of a strong probability that serious injury would result therefrom, constituted \u2018a deliberate intention to produce such injury,\u2019 under a section of West Virginia\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Statute which is nearly identical to Section 44 of the Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act____ The Defendant disagrees arguing that, even if the Maryland Court of Appeals were to adopt the West Virginia rule, Mr. Haynie has made an election of his remedies when he chose to first proceed under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Statute and collect benefits therefrom, [see, Md.Code (1957, 1979 Rep.Vol., 1982 Cum.Supp.) Art. 101, \u00a7 58 ...].</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">\u201cIt is alleged that, although Mr. Haynie did first file a claim and receive benefits under the Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, such was done without full knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>of his rights and remedies at common law. It is further asserted that without such necessary information, it is impossible for any party to make an <em>informed </em>election of remedies. There are no Maryland Court of Appeals cases which have addressed this issue directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">\u201cFinally, the Defendant alleges that the Plaintiff may not elect to pursue any law action against Gold Bond Building, Inc., since it was not his \u2018employer\u2019 for purposes of this incident as the term \u2018employer\u2019 is defined under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. That is to say, the Defendant argues that because the individuals allegedly responsible for any malfunction of the rock dryer were not the \u2018alter ego\u2019 of the Corporation, Mr. Haynie has failed to satisfy this threshold requirement for an election of any kind. The Plaintiff strenuously disputes this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">\u201cWHEREFORE, the Plaintiff prays that this Court by judgment declare:</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">\u201cThat the rule of law to be utilized in defining the term, \u2018deliberate intention,\u2019 in Section 44 of the Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is that rule announced by the West Virginia Court in the case of <em>Mandolidis v. Elkins Industries, Inc</em>.....</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">\u201cThat the Plaintiff\u2019s initial decision to file and accept Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits does not constitute a binding election of remedies under \u00a7 58 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act if such a decision was made without full knowledge of his alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">\u201cThat the Plaintiff\u2019s injuries were the result of acts taken with deliberate intention by the Plaintiff\u2019s \u2018employer,\u2019 as that term is defined under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">In its answer to the Bill, the defendant Gold Bond Building Products \u201cadmitted] that the plaintiff was injured in March 1978 while an employee of ... Gold Bond Building Products, and while performing job duties arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d Gold Bond asked the court to declare that the controlling rule of law \u201cis that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>the vast majority of states which have considered this matter which is that \u2018a deliberate intention to produce such injury\u2019 can only be found from a recognized intentional tort and not from negligence however gross.\u201d Gold Bond also asked the court to declare that \u201cMr. Haynie\u2019s decision to file and accept Workmen's Compensation benefits constitutes an election of remedies or waiver or estoppel or res judicata as to any right by Mr. Haynie to proceed against his employer at common law.\u201d Finally, Gold Bond requested the court to declare that Haynie\u2019s \u201cinjuries were not the result of any actions by his \u2018employer\u2019 as that term is used in Section 44 of Article 101.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Thereafter the circuit court filed an opinion and a declaratory judgment. The circuit court declined to follow the rule announced by the West Virginia court in the <em>Mandolidis </em>case, choosing instead to adopt the rule followed in other jurisdictions. The court also declared that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s initial decision to file and accept Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits <em>does </em>constitute a binding election of remedies under ... the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d and that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s injuries were <em>not </em>the result of acts taken with deliberate intention by the plaintiff\u2019s \u2018employer,\u2019 as that term is defined under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The plaintiff Haynie appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and the appellate court affirmed in an unreported opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Haynie then filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, presenting the legal issues forming the subject of the declaratory judgment. The petition also referred to the fact that \u201ca claim of common law in tort\u201d had been filed by Haynie against Gold Bond prior to the filing of the declaratory judgment action, that in the common law action Gold Bond had relied on the \u201cemployer-immunizing provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d that Gold Bond had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>filed three motions for summary judgment in that action, that the declaratory judgment action was filed \u201cto bring about a final ruling on ... the existence of a cause of action at common law,\u201d that the two actions had been \u201cconsolidated,\u201d and that the circuit court had ruled that \u201cthere was no common law cause of action.\u201d The inference from the petition for a writ of certiorari was that the common law action and the declaratory judgment action had both been resolved by final judgments. Gold Bond\u2019s opposition to the certiorari petition simply referred to the circuit court having \u201cfully and definitely disposed of petitioner\u2019s common-law suit____\u201d We granted the petition for a writ of certiorari in order to decide the important questions presented concerning the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">At oral argument before us, however, counsel for each side informed us that the tort suit is still pending in the trial court. The record, sent to us pursuant to the writ of certiorari, disclosed that the tort action was filed prior to the declaratory judgment action, in what was then the Baltimore City Court (now part of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City). There was a demurrer by Gold Bond, then an amended declaration, and thereafter three successive motions for summary judgment by Gold Bond. The first motion was withdrawn, and the second was denied. The third motion for summary judgment in the tort suit is still pending. The allegations and the issues raised in the amended tort declaration and third motion for summary judgment are identical to those in the later declaratory judgment action. The same defenses were asserted by Gold Bond in both actions. Nevertheless, the trial court judgment was limited to the declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The Declaratory Judgment Act, as amended by Ch. 724 of the Acts of 1945, provided that a party is not barred from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>obtaining a declaratory judgment merely because the controversy \u201cis susceptible of relief through a general common law remedy____\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the Act does not provide that, once the common law remedy is actually invoked to provide relief in the controversy, and the common law action is still pending, the parties may also institute a second lawsuit and obtain a declaratory judgment to resolve the same matter. Our cases have repeatedly held to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Recently in <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Kuhl, </em>296 Md. 446, 449 n. 1, 463 A.2d 822 (1983), Judge Cole noted for the Court that a declaratory judgment action \u201cis inappropriate where the same issue is pending in another proceeding---Here, declaratory judgment was improper because the issue sought to be resolved could have been determined in the pending tort action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">In <em>Brokawn v. Transamerica Insurance Company, </em>276 Md. 396, 406, 347 A.2d 842 (1975), after reviewing prior case law and E. Borchard, <em>Declaratory Judgments </em>(2d Ed.1941), we held that \u201cwhere, as here, the question to be resolved in the declaratory judgment action will be decided in pending actions, it is inappropriate to grant a declaratory judgment.\u201d We went on to point out that under the circumstances of that case, \u201cgranting a declaratory judgment would constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d 276 Md. at 406, 347 A.2d 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\"><em>Grimm v. Co. Comm \u2019rs of Wash. Co., </em>252 Md. 626, 250 A.2d 866 (1969), involved a declaratory judgment action brought to resolve issues which were also presented for resolution in a pending criminal prosecution. The plaintiff in the declaratory judgment action was the defendant in the criminal prosecution. In holding that the declaratory judgment action was properly dismissed, Judge Barnes for the Court reviewed cases in other jurisdictions and stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>\u201cin our opinion the better considered cases hold that once a criminal proceeding has been instituted in which the question of constitutionality of the statute or ordinance can be adequately decided, the courts properly exercise their discretion in declining to grant declaratory relief,\u201d 252 Md. at 633-634, 250 A.2d 866. After reviewing numerous cases, the Court in <em>Grimm </em>went on <em>(id. </em>at 637, 250 A.2d 866):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AchU\">\u201cIt will be noted ... that Professor Borchard in his <em>Declaratory Judgments </em>2d Ed., stated at p. 350:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\">\u2018Where an action or proceeding is already pending in another forum involving the same issues, it is manifestly unwise and unnecessary to permit a new petition for a declaration to be initiated by the defendant or the plaintiff in that suit.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aub\">and also</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">\u2018[T]he court will refuse a declaration where another court has jurisdiction of the issue, where a proceeding involving identical issues is already pending in another tribunal, where a special statutory remedy has been provided, or where another remedy will be more effective or appropriate under the circumstances. In these cases it is neither useful nor proper to issue the declaration. In some of these cases, * * * the declaration is refused on jurisdictional grounds. In others, the refusal is justified on discretionary grounds.\u2019 (Borchard, <em>Declaratory Judgments, </em>Ch. V <em>Discretion </em>at p. 302 (2d Ed.1941.))\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The <em>Grimm </em>opinion concluded that a policy, permitting declaratory judgment actions to resolve issues which could properly be raised and decided in pending cases, would be unfortunate as it would unduly burden the courts. <em>Id. </em>at 640-641, 250 A.2d 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The matter was also reviewed in detail by Judge Digges for the Court in A.S. <em>Abell Company v. Sweeney, </em>274 Md. 715, 337 A.2d 77 (1975), where the Court held that a party to a pending District Court action \u201cis not entitled to ... a declaration\u201d in a circuit court declaratory judgment action for the purpose of resolving an issue presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>District Court case. 274 Md. at 719, 337 A.2d 77. We quoted at length from <em>Grimm, </em>and held that the principles there set forth were applicable regardless of whether the pending case was a civil or criminal action. <em>Id. </em>at 719-720, 337 A.2d 77. <em>See, </em>in addition, <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Mar. Ins. v. Pryseski, </em>292 Md. 187, 196, 438 A.2d 282 (1981) (holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that the \u201cscope <em>of </em>employment\u201d issue was to be determined in a pending tort suit and not in a declaratory judgment action); <em>Truck Ins. Exch. v. Marks Rentals, </em>288 Md. 428, 430 n. 1, 418 A.2d 1187 (1980) (whether an employee was acting in the scope of employment is an issue \u201cwhich must be resolved in the [pending] tort suit\u201d and not in a declaratory judgment action); <em>Watson v. Dorsey, </em>265 Md. 509, 512 n. 1, 290 A.2d 530 (1972) (\u201c \u2018As a general rule, the courts will not entertain a declaratory judgment action if there is pending ... another action or proceeding to which the same persons are parties and in which may be adjudicated the same issues involved in the declaratory action,\u2019 \u201d quoting 22 Am.Jur.2d Declaratory Judgments \u00a7 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The rule precluding a declaratory judgment to resolve an issue when there is pending another action in which the same issue can properly be resolved, is neither jurisdictional nor absolute. <em>See Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Kuhl, supra, </em>296 Md. at 449 n. 1, 463 A.2d 822; <em>Watson v. Dorsey, supra, </em>265 Md. at 512 n. 1, 290 A.2d 530; <em>Grimm v. Co. Comm\u2019rs of Wash. Co., supra, </em>252 Md. at 638-639, 250 A.2d 866. A declaratory-judgment may be rendered to decide an issue, even though the issue is presented in another pending case between the parties, in \u201cvery unusual and compelling circumstances.\u201d <em>A.S. Abell Company v. Sweeney, supra, </em>274 Md. at 721, 337 A.2d 77. In the case at bar, however, there were no very unusual and compelling circumstances justifying the declaratory judgment. The circuit court could have simply decided the pending motion for summary judgment in the tort case.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">At times in the past, and under the circumstances presented in particular , cases, when a declaratory judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>has been rendered to resolve an issue that could have been decided in a pending common law action, we have noted that the declaratory judgment was improper but have, nonetheless, gone on to decide the merits of the issue. <em>See, e.g., Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Kuhl, supra, </em>296 Md. at 449 n. 1, 463 A.2d 822. Our repeated admonitions, however, have evidently failed to stop the improper procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Moreover, under circumstances like those in the present case, overlooking the inappropriate procedure might result in litigants misusing the declaratory judgment statute in order to circumvent the policy against appeals from interlocutory orders and against piecemeal appeals. For example, a defendant in a tort case might have several legal defenses in addition to the contention that he committed no wrongful act. The parties might desire to have a trial of only one such legal defense, instead of incurring the expense and time of trying the entire case, on the ground that a ruling favorable to the defendant would be dispositive of the case. Rule 2-502, permitting the trial of a single question, was designed for such situation. A \u201cproblem\u201d with the Rule 2-502 procedure, from the limited viewpoint of the parties in a particular case, might be that a ruling in the 2-502 proceeding unfavorable to the defendant could not, under the language of the rule, be appealed until \u201cafter entry of an appealable order or judgment.\u201d Consequently, unless the 2-502 decision disposes of an entire \u201cclaim\u201d and is certified as a final judgment in accordance with Rule 2-602, it could not be immediately appealed. <em>See, Harford Sands, Inc. v. Levitt &amp; Sons, </em>27 Md.App. 702, 707, 343 A.2d 544, <em>cert. denied, </em>276 Md. 744 (1975). In order to evade the final judgment requirement, the parties, instead of invoking the authorized procedure set forth in Rule 2-502, might make the question of law the subject of a separate declaratory judgment action. <em>Cf., East v. Gilchrist, </em>293 Md. 453, 445 A.2d 343 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Conceivably, in the hypothetical case we are discussing, each separate disputed issue in the tort case could be made the subject of a separate declaratory judgment action. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>this Court were to overlook the improper use of the declaratory judgment statute as long as no party to the litigation challenged the procedure, we would be allowing the parties, by consent, to bypass the final judgment requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">For the above reasons, therefore, we shall decline to decide the questions presented in the petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO VACATE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY WITH DIRECTIONS TO DISMISS THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION.
