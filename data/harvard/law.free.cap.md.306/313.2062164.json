Booth was convicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of the premeditated murder and armed robbery of James Edward (\u201cPie\u201d) Ross, and was sentenced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Judge Martin Greenfeld to consecutive terms of life and twenty years imprisonment. Booth appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, contending that the trial judge erred in admitting hearsay evidence, and in instructing the jury. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, <em>Booth v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 26, 488 A.2d 195 (1985), and we granted certiorari to consider the question of the admissibility of evidence under the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">At trial, the State proffered evidence that Regina Harrison telephoned Ross between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m. on the day of his murder. Harrison testified that Ross said he was getting ready to prepare dinner and was going to ask his company, a girl named Brenda, to leave. Harrison said she then heard the door at Ross\u2019 home open and questioned Ross as to who was there. Ross told Harrison that Brenda was talking to \u201csome guy\u201d behind the door. According to Harrison, the general tone of the conversation was normal and Ross did not sound nervous or anxious.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Booth objected to the testimony of Harrison on the ground that it was impermissible hearsay. The trial judge admitted the testimony, concluding that it fell within the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judge Greenfeld said in his well considered oral opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A11\">It seems to me that the present sense impression has as much reliability as the excited utterance exception or res gestae exception as it is sometimes called, and may even be more accurate, since the Maryland Court of Appeals permits excited utterances to be admitted under the proper circumstances as an exception to the hearsay rule. I see no reason why present sense impression should not also be admitted if reliability exists. So in the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>sense I find that reliability does exist here because there would be no reason for Mr. Ross to inaccurately state to Miss Harrison over the telephone that Brenda was there or that she was talking to somebody at the door. And, of course, the jury can evaluate her demeanor and the accuracy of, and reliability, and trustworthiness of the statement themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Booth argues that Maryland should not adopt the present sense impression exception because the mere contemporaneity of a statement and an allegedly perceived event does not establish trustworthiness. Alternatively, Booth contends that even if the exception is adopted this testimony should not be admitted because there was no corroboration by an \u201cequally percipient witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The present sense impression exception has its origins in what was known as the \u201cres gestae\u201d exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The term \u201cres gestae\u201d came into usage in discussion of admissibility of declarations in the early 1800\u2019s. <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 288, at 686 (2d ed. E. Cleary 1972); 6 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1767, at 253-59 (Chadbourn Rev.1976). As Professor McCormick points out, the term is more generic than particular and includes within its definition four distinct exceptions: declarations of present bodily condition; declarations of present mental states and emotions; excited utterances; and declarations of present sense impressions. <em>McCormick on Evidence, supra, </em>\u00a7 288, at 686. Although the term res gestae is now condemned in academic circles, the exceptions included within its definition are recognized by most scholars.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The present sense impression exception was first defined by the evidence scholar, James Bradley Thayer, when he reviewed res gestae cases in 1881.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thayer reported what he considered to be a longstanding rule of admissibility which grew out of the res gestae concept:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">The exception to the hearsay rule which is now mentioned takes notice of one of these strong elements of authenticity, contemporaneousness; it deals, however, not with memoranda signed by the parties, but with statements, oral or written, made by those present when a thing took place, made about it, and importing what is present at the very time,\u2014present, either in itself or in some fresh indications of it, to the faculties of the witness as well as of the declarant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\"># * $ # * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">The leading notion in the doctrine ... seems to have been that of withdrawing from the operation of the hearsay rule declarations of fact which were very near in time to that which they tended to prove, fill out, or illustrate,\u2014being at the same time not narrative, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>importing what was then present or but just gone by, and so was open, either immediately or in the indications of it, to the observation of the witness who testifies to the declaration, and who can be cross-examined as to these indications. Thayer, <em>Bedingfield\u2019s Case\u2014Declarations as a Part of the Res Gesta, </em>(Part III) 15 Am.L.Rev. 71, 83, 107 (1881).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">However, one of Thayer\u2019s most influential students, Dean Wigmore, in his 1904 evidence treatise refused to recognize the present sense impression exception, claiming that contemporaneousness of event and descriptive statement, without more, did not guarantee the statement\u2019s trustworthiness. 6 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1747, at 195-98 (Chadbourn Rev.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Thayer\u2019s formulation of the present sense impression exception was revived by Edmund Morgan. Professor Morgan pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">A statement by a person as to external events then and there being perceived by his senses is worthy of credence for two reasons. First, it is in essence a declaration of a presently existing state of mind, for it is nothing more than an assertion of his presently existing sense impressions. As such it has the quality of spontaneity____ Second, since the statement is contemporaneous with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>event, it is made at the place of the event. Consequently the event is open to perception by the senses of the person to whom the declaration is made and by whom it is usually reported on the witness stand. The witness is subject to cross-examination concerning that event as well as the fact and content of the utterance, so that the extra-judicial, statement does not depend solely upon the credit of the declarant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">Morgan, <em>A Suggested Classification of Utterances Admissible as Res Gestae, </em>31 Yale L.J. 229, 236 (1922).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Currently, a present sense impression is excepted from the operation of the hearsay rule by the Federal Rules of Evidence, and by a majority of states. Additionally, this exception is recognized by the Model Code of Evidence, Rule 512(a), and by the Uniform Rules of Evidence (1974), Rule 803(1). Fed.R.Evid. 803(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aku\">(1) <em>Present sense impression. </em>A statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The underlying theory of this exception is that \u201csubstantial contemporaneity of event and statement negative the likelihood of deliberate or conscious misrepresentation.\u201d Advisory Committee Note, Fed.R.Evid. 803(1). The Note further states that \u201cin many, if not most, instances precise contemporaneity is not possible, and hence a slight lapse is allowable.\u201d Although the Note does not state that the witness must be the declarant, it indicates that \u201cif the witness is not the declarant, he may be examined as to the circumstances as an aid in evaluating the statement.\u201d Finally, the Note limits the permissible subject matter under the exception to a \u201cdescription or explanation of the event or condition, the assumption being that spontaneity, in the absence of a startling event, may extend no farther.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>At least twenty-eight states recognize this exception to the hearsay rule in their codified evidence codes, most of which have been patterned after the Federal Rules of Evidence. <em>See, e.g., </em>Alaska R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1979); Ariz. R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1977); Ark.R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1976); Cal.Evid.Code \u00a7 1241 (eff. 1967); Colo.R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1980); Fla.Evid.Code \u00a7 90.803(1) (eff. 1979); Hawaii R.Evid. 803(b)(1) (eff. 1981); Idaho R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1985); Iowa R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1985); Kan.Code Civ.P. \u00a7 60-460(d)(l) (eff. 1963); Me.R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1976); Mont.R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1977); Nev.Rev.Stat. tit. 4, \u00a7 51.085 (eff. 1971); N.H.R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1985); (N.J.R.Evid. 63(4)(a) (eff. 1967); N.M.R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1976); N.C.R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1984); N.D.R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1977); Ohio R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1980); Okla.Evid.Code \u00a7 2803(1) (eff. 1978); S.D. R.Evid. \u00a7 19-16-5 (eff. 1978); Tex.R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1983); Utah R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1983); Vt.R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1983); Wash.R.Evid. 803(a)(1) (eff. 1979); W.Va.R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1985); Wis.R.Evid. 908.03(1) (eff. 1974); Wyo.R.Evid. 803(1) (eff. 1978). Colorado\u2019s rule requires precise contemporaneity and deletes the words \u201cor immediately thereafter\u201d found in the Federal Rule. Florida and Ohio add language that a present sense impression is admissible unless the statement is made under circumstances that indicate its lack of trustworthiness. Fla.Evid.Code \u00a7 90.803(1); Ohio R.Evid. 803(1). The Ohio Staff Note explains that the additional language serves to narrow the availability of the exception by vesting discretion in the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Most commentators, with the notable exception of Dean Wigmore, recognize the present sense impression exception. The exception was approved in <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 298, at 860 (3d ed. E. Cleary 1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">Although [present sense impression] statements lack whatever assurance of reliability there is in the effect of an exciting event, other factors offer safeguards. First, since the report concerns observations being made at the time of the statement it is safe from any error caused by a defect of the declarant\u2019s memory. Second, a require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>ment that the statement be made contemporaneously with the observation means that there will be little or no time for calculated misstatement. Third, the statement will usually have been made to a third person (the witness who subsequently testifies to it) who, being present at the \u25a0time and scene of the observation, will probably have an opportunity to observe the situation himself and thus provide a check on the accuracy of the declarant\u2019s statement, i.e. furnish corroboration. Moreover, since the declarant himself will often be available for cross-examination, his credibility will be subject to substantial verification before the trier of fact. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afqr\">In J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence </em>paragraph 803(1)[01] (1985), the Federal Rule was explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">Underlying Rule 803(1) is the assumption that statements of perception substantially contemporaneous with an event are highly trustworthy because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">(1) the statement being simultaneous with the event, there is no memory problem; (2) there is little or no time for calculated misstatement, and (3) the statement is usually made to one who has equal opportunity to observe and check misstatements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">This exception has been viewed with favor by those who fear that excitement\u2014such as that required by the excited utterance exception\u2014operates to impair the accuracy of perception. The exception is useful in admitting statements uttered minutes before the event in question and before the declarant was aware that something startling was about to happen. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">D. Binder, <em>Hearsay Handbook </em>89 (2d ed. 1983, 1985 Cum.Supp.) said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">An out-of-court assertion that describes or explains a present sense impression is excepted to the hearsay rule in the federal courts and in an increasing number of state courts, regardless of the availability of declarant at trial____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Declarant need not be excited or otherwise emotionally affected by the event or condition. The trustworthiness of the assertion arises from its timing. The requirement of contemporaneousness, or near contemporaneousness, reduces the chance of premeditated prevarication or loss of memory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">If you turn on your radio during a baseball game, you will be inundated by present sense impressions. The utterances of the sportscaster describing and explaining what he observes on the playing field as it is taking place are quintessential present sense impressions. But the sportcaster\u2019s between-innings or post-game analysis would not qualify for this hearsay exception, for lack of contemporaneity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">If a present sense impression is made under stress of excitement from the event or condition that it describes or explains, then it overlaps with the exception for an excited utterance (Exception 2). This is often the case. For example, if a sportscaster is excited by the sporting event that he is watching, his play-by-play description qualifies both as a present sense impression and an excited utterance. If he is bored by it, his description qualifies only as a present sense impression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Maryland has long recognized a \u201cres gestae\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Wright v. </em>State, 88 Md. 705, 41 A. 1060 (1898). <em>See also Mouzone v. State, </em>294 Md. 692, 452 A.2d 661 (1982). Adhering to the older usage of res gestae, Maryland has firmly endorsed the analogous \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exception. <em>See, e.g., Mouzone v. State, supra; Stevens v. State, </em>232 Md. 33, 192 A.2d 73, <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 886, 84 S.Ct. 160, 11 L.Ed.2d 115 (1963); <em>Grier v. Rosenberg, </em>213 Md. 248, 131 A.2d 737 (1957); <em>Tittlebaum v. Penna. R. Co., </em>167 Md. 397, 174 A. 89 (1934); <em>Neusbaum v. State, </em>156 Md. 149, 143 A. 872 (1928); <em>Wright v. State, supra. See also Moore v. State, </em>26 Md.App. 556, 338 A.2d 344 (1975); <em>Smith v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 581, 252 A.2d 277 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>As observed by the Advisory Committee to the Federal Rules, the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d and \u201cpresent sense impression\u201d exceptions \u201coverlap, though based on somewhat different theories.\u201d Advisory Committee Note, Fed. R.Evid. 803(1). The underlying rationale of the two exceptions are similar, <em>i.e., </em>both preserve the benefit of spontaniety in the narrow span of time before a declarant has an opportunity to reflect and fabricate. We conclude that the \u201cpresent sense impression\u201d exception to the hearsay rule rests upon a firm foundation of trustworthiness, and we adopt it in the form in which it appears at Fed.R.Evid. 803(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We turn to a consideration of practical problems that may be encountered in the application of this exception. Initially, we consider the question of requisite spontaneity. Although statements offered under this exception will usually be those made at the time an event is being perceived, we recognize that precise contemporaneity is not always possible, and at times there may be a slight delay in converting observations into speech. However, because the presumed reliability of a statement of present sense impression flows from the fact of spontaneity, the time interval between observation and utterance must be very short. The appropriate inquiry is whether, considering the surrounding circumstances, sufficient time elapsed to have permitted reflective thought. <em>See McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 298, at 862 (3d ed. E. Cleary 1984). In the words of Professor Jon Waltz, \u201cabsent some special corroborative circumstance, there should be no delay beyond an acceptable hiatus between perception and the cerebellum's construction of an uncalculated verbal description.\u201d Waltz, <em>The Present Sense Impression Exception to the Rule Against Hearsay: Origins and Attributes, </em>66 Iowa L.Rev. 869, 880 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Next, we consider the extent to which there must be proof that the declarant is speaking from personal knowledge before the statement may be admitted. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>though the declarant need not have been a participant in the perceived event, it is clear that the declarant must speak from personal knowledge, <em>i.e., </em>the declarant\u2019s own sensory perceptions. The more difficult question involves the quantity and quality of evidence required to demonstrate the existence of the requisite personal knowledge. We conclude that in some instances the content of the statement may itself be sufficient to demonstrate that it is more likely than not the product of personal perception, and in other instances extrinsic evidence may be required to satisfy this threshold requirement of admissibility.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Identification of the declarant, while often helpful in establishing that he or she was a percipient witness, is not a condition of admissibility. When the statement itself, or other circumstantial evidence demonstrates the percipiency of a declarant, whether identified or unidentified, this condition of competency is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">An additional problem often encountered in the consideration of this exception to the hearsay rule is the tendency of a spontaneous declarant to characterize that which is being observed in language that involves, or often appears to involve, the opinion of the speaker. As we noted in <em>Ellsworth v. Sherne Lingerie, Inc., </em>303 Md. 581, 609, 495 A.2d 348 (1985), the line between \u201cfact\u201d and \u201copinion\u201d is often difficult to draw. A statement that at first blush appears to represent the opinion of the speaker may prove upon more careful analysis to be non-judgmental in character, or it may represent a shorthand rendition of facts. Additionally, we recognize that evidence which enjoys a significant presumption of reliability, and which may be of significant assistance to the trier of fact in arriving at the truth of the matter may be lost if it is excluded because perceptions are cast in opinion form. Professor Morgan in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>Basic Problems of State and Federal Evidence </em>ch. 13, at 300 (5th ed. J. Weinstein 1976) commented upon the problem as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">And it is absurd to insist that the statement must not be phrased in terms of inference or opinion. People speaking without reflection usually talk in terms of inference in describing what they have seen or heard. So long as the language does not indicate a conscious deduction, rather than a shorthand method of statement, the opinion rule should have no application. But the cases are in conflict; the majority reject opinion if it expresses blame or fault; in other situations the cases are more nearly evenly divided. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">We concur generally with the views expressed by Professor Jon Waltz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">The indiscriminate generalization is often made that spontaneous utterances, excited or otherwise, in the form of an opinion or conclusion are inadmissible. This generalization has been branded \u201cabsurd\u201d by Morgan and it assuredly wants more careful analysis than it has gotten in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">It is useful to contrast, on one hand, contemporaneous declarations cast in the form of a conclusion and, on the other, later direct in-court testimony that is conclusory in form. In-court opinion testimony has been disfavored, although less so under the Federal Rules of Evidence than before, because it is often the speculative hindsight of one who, having been summoned as a witness in a litigated dispute, is obviously aware of the existence of the litigation and who has had ample time and perhaps identifiable motive to reflect and concoct. Except when backward-looking narrations of in-court witnesses are the inescapable shorthand of one who is attempting, as best he can, to reconstruct and articulate observed facts, they represent a choosing of sides by the witness and are to be excluded from evidence not so much because they \u201cinvade the province of the jury,\u201d as once was the standard judicial response, as because they simply are not helpful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>to the factfinder and may be positively confusing. The situation is similar, and induces a like judicial response, when an out-of-court declarant has made a backward-looking characterization of events, especially when it has not been demonstrated that he was himself an observer of those events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">However, these situations are markedly different from the situation in which a percipient observer has made a contemporaneous statement in conclusory form ... If the out-of-court declaration is not the sort of conscious deduction which the conditions attaching to the present sense impression exception would themselves prohibit, it should be receivable as a shorthand fact description. Waltz, <em>supra, </em>66 Iowa L.Rev. at 881-82 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Finally, there is the difficult question of whether a present sense impression must be corroborated by an independent and equally percipient observer. Examination of the Federal Rule reveals that nothing in the language of the rule purports to require corroboration. Furthermore, as pointed out by several commentators, the drafters of the Federal Rules knew how to word a requirement of corroboration, and did not do so. <em>See, e.g., McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 298, at 863 (3d ed. E. Cleary 1984); Waltz, <em>supra, </em>66 Iowa L.Rev. at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The federal and state courts are not in accord as to whether corroboration is required for admission of a statement. In the case most often cited on this question, <em>Houston Oxygen Co. v. Davis, </em>139 Tex. 1, 161 S.W.2d 474 (Tex.Comm\u2019n App.1942, Op.Adopted), reliance was placed on the fact that \u201cthe statement will usually be made to another (the witness who reports it) who would have equal opportunities to observe and hence to check a misstatement.\u201d 161 S.W.2d at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Since <em>Houston Oxygen, </em>some courts have rejected the contention that there must be corroboration by witnesses who were in the same position to observe the described event. <em>United States v. Medico, </em>557 F.2d 309 (2d Cir.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 986, 98 S.Ct. 614, 54 L.Ed.2d 480 (1977); <em>United States v. Obayagbona, </em>627 F.Supp. 329 (E.D.N.Y.1985); <em>State v. Flesher, </em>286 N.W.2d 215 (Iowa 1979); <em>Commonwealth v. Coleman, </em>458 Pa. 112, 326 A.2d 387 (1974). Others have considered corroboration of an equally percipient witness a factor in guaranteeing the trustworthiness of a statement. <em>United States v. Blakey, </em>607 F.2d 779 (7th Cir.1979); <em>Robinson v. Shapiro, </em>484 F.Supp. 91 (S.D.N.Y.1980); <em>United States v. Narciso, </em>446 F.Supp. 252 (D.C.Mich.1977); <em>MCA, Inc. v. Wilson, </em>425 F.Supp. 443 (S.D.N.Y.1976). At least two courts have refused to admit statements of present sense impression that were not corroborated. <em>In Re Japanese Electronic Products, </em>723 F.2d 238 (3d Cir.1983); <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Matsushita Elec. Ind. Co. v. Zenith Radio, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); <em>People v. Watson, </em>100 A.D.2d 452, 474 N.Y.S.2d 978 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Professor Waltz, in tracing the development of the present sense impression exception from Thayer\u2019s article to the present, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">[I]t will be recognized that Thayer never insisted on corroboration by an equally percipient witness. He certainly did not insist on it when the declarant was the in-court narrator of his own out-of-court declaration and, although Thayer did not address the point, he might not have insisted on it in those uncommon instances in which the out-of-court declarant is available but is not produced in court by the proponent of his declaration. And Thayer did not insist that an in-court witness serving as a testimonial conduit for an out-of-court sense impression declaration must have perceived everything which was apparently open to the declarant\u2019s faculties. Thayer believed in the pebble-in-the-pond principle. Every consequential act, like the stone thrown into water, produces ripples which extend outward after the stone has sunk from sight. These are the \u201cfresh indications\u201d of the event to which Thayer repeatedly referred in sketching the content of anticipated corroboration____ [Testimony attest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ing the existence of the corroborating ripples generated by the event, of that event\u2019s surrounding circumstances, may occasionally be adequately supplied by someone other than the witness who heard and transmits to the factfinder the sense impression which described the event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">Waltz, <em>supra, </em>66 Iowa L.Rev. at 898 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Another commentator on the exception stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">The suggestion has been made that corroboration by an \u201cequally percipient\u201d witness should be recognized as a further requirement for admitting statements of present sense impression into evidence. The proposal represents a radical departure from the general pattern of exceptions to the hearsay rule. The only instance in which a requirement of corroboration is found is where a statement against penal interest by a third person, e.g. a third party confession, is offered by way of exculpation of an accused person. There the common law had set its face strictly against admission in evidence. In order to increase the acceptability of a reversal of this position, the Advisory Committee incorporated in Federal Rule 804(b)(3) a requirement that the hearsay statement be corroborated. The present sense impression exception offers no such need; its underlying rationale offers sufficient assurances of reliability without the superaddition of a further requirement of corroboration____ It is true, of course, that the limits of the exception in terms of time and subject matter in and of themselves almost automatically insure that the witness who reports the making of the statement must have himself perceived the actual event or at least have perceived circumstances strongly suggesting the event. This aspect has been mentioned by the writers as an added assurance of accuracy, but a justification for admission is not the same as a requirement for admission. The matter had better be left for consideration as an aspect of weight and sufficiency of the evidence rather than becoming an added needlessly complicating requirement for admissibility. <em>McCormick </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>on Evidence </em>\u00a7 298, at 862-63 (3d ed. E. Cleary 1984) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We reject the contention that corroboration by an equally percipient witness is required as a condition to the admissibility of a statement of present sense impression. As we have noted, extrinsic evidence may sometimes be required to demonstrate the contemporaneity of the statement, or to show that it is the product of personal perception by the declarant. Accordingly, it may be correct in a particular case to say that \u201ccorroboration\u201d is required, but this does not mean that corroboration is required in every instance, or that the corroboration must be that of an equally percipient witness. Even when not required for admissibility, corroboration (or the lack thereof) may be important in determining the weight to be given the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In arguing against recognition of the present sense impression exception, Appellant has cited <em>Neusbaum v. State, supra. </em>He contends that in <em>Neusbaum </em>this Court rejected the concept of present sense impression. We do not agree, but we think it helpful to discuss in greater detail the features which distinguish that case from this. In <em>Neusbaum </em>the defendant had been convicted of manslaughter arising out of the criminally negligent operation of a motor vehicle that caused the death of a pedestrian. In order to identify the vehicle that struck the pedestrian and then left the scene, the State offered the testimony of Simms, an occupant of a car parked nearby, concerning statements made by Mrs. Schmidt, also an occupant of Simms\u2019 vehicle. According to Simms, just as the accident occurred, Schmidt cried out, \u201cOh, he ran right over that man\u201d and at that time she said, \u201cGet his number.\u201d Simms said Schmidt then wound down the window of the car and said, \u201c1-1-6-4\u20141-1-6-4\u2014and I think a 9.\u201d <em>Id., </em>156 Md. at 163-64,143 A. 872. Our predecessors held that this testimony should have been excluded as hearsay, and from that holding Appellant argues that this Court has rejected the concept of present sense impression as an exception to the hearsay rule. Appellant\u2019s argument is facially appealing because the facts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>Neusbaum </em>would seem to support the admissibility of Schmidt\u2019s statements as present sense impressions. However, a careful review of the brief filed by the Appellant in <em>Neusbaum </em>discloses that his argument was limited to whether the statements qualified as a part of the res gestae, and whether \u201cthe main transaction had been completed and [the] declaration amounted to [a] mere recital of events.\u201d Neusbaum brief, at 34. This Court accepted Neusbaum\u2019s argument, holding that \u201c[h]er statement did not relate to the accident, but was a narrative of what she had discovered after the accident.\u201d <em>Neusbaum, supra, </em>156 Md. at 164, 143 A. 872. Nowhere in the briefs filed in that case, nor in the opinion of the Court is there any indication that the Court was asked to, or did, consider the admissibility of the statements as present sense impressions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The content of the statement with which we are concerned in this case, at least when coupled with the evidence of what Harrison heard in the background, offered sufficient evidence that Ross was describing events he was personally witnessing, and that his description of those events was being given contemporaneously with their occurrence. There were no extrinsic circumstances indicating to the contrary. After directing the excision of that part of the statement which apparently represented a recitation of earlier events, the trial judge properly admitted the balance of the statement pursuant to the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\">.
