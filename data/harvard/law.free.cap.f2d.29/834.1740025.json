Interferences developed in the Patent Office which delayed the issue of a patent until October 15, 3 918. There was also litigation conducted at the expense of the tube company, and in the interim the invented apparatus was used by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">When the assignment was made, Saunders knew of a rule of the company which provided : \u201cIt should be understood that a sum of money will be paid to the inventor, the amount depending upon the circumstances.\u201d Pursuant to such rule, the tube- company in September, 1920, paid Saunders $25,000' \u201cas full compensation for the device invented by you covered by the United States Patent No. 1281668.\u201d The contention of Saunders is that this $25,000, although paid in 1920, is really money which was agreed to be paid and constituted the real consideration for his making the sale of his invention in May, 1911. The contention of the Tax Board is, and it so decreed that the $25,000 was taxable income of Saunders for the year 1920. The question involved is which of these two contentions is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-20\">As all parties disclaim the thought that the $25,000 was a gift or gratuity, it is clear that Saunders\u2019 right to it initially arose, by virtue of the company\u2019s rule, when Saunders made the absolute transfer in 1911. To our mind all that was afterwards done harks back to that date. Saunders\u2019 right and property was the invention he made, and the right to such an invention is property and is assignable. Stevenson v. Shalcross (C. C. A.) 205 F. 289, Hendrie v. Sayles, 98 U. S. 549, 25 L. Ed. 176, in which latter case it is said: \u201cSuch an assignment may be made before the patent is obtained. * * * Such an instrument, though executed before the patent is granted, transfers the legal title to the assignee,\u201d quoting Gayler v. Wilder, 10 How. 477, 13 L. Ed. 504; Rathbone v. Orr, Fed. Cas. No. 11585, 5 McLean, 131; Rich v. Lippincott, Fed. Cas. No. 11758, 2 Fish. Pat. Cas. 1, etc. From this it will be seen that the subsequent prosecution of the patent application, the interference litigation, the issue of the patent, and the determination by the tube company of \u201cthe amount depending on circumstances\u201d which it would pay him, were mere incidents; but the payment when finally made was the real consideration of the transfer of his property made in.1911. Such being the ease, and this transfer antedating the income law, it follows that when Saunders re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>ceived the $25,000 in 1920/ he was receiving, not income for that year, bnt the purchase price of capital sold in 1911. Such being the case, it follows the Board was in error in assessing this tax as income;</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">Its judgment is therefore reversed, and the reeord returned, with directions to enter a decree in accordance herewith.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
