The first question is as to the jurisdiction of the District Court upon the removal. Although plaintiff made no motion to remand and raised no question of jurisdiction during the trial, it would be our duty to reverse the decree and direct that the case be remanded to the state court, if the suit were one not removable under the statutes. See Martin v. Snyder, 148 U. S. 663, 13 S. Ct. 706, 37 L. Ed. 602; Tennessee v. Union &amp; Planters\u2019 Bank, 152 U. S. 454, 14 S. Ct. 654, 38 L. Ed. 511. We pass without examination the question whether the suit involved separable controversies against the two defendants, so as to justify removal on the ground of diversity of citizenship, and rest our decision upon section 256 of the Judicial Code (USCA tit. 28, \u00a7 371), which confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the federal courts \u201cof all eases arising under the patent right, or copyright laws of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">The nature of plaintiff\u2019s suit must be determined from the allegations of the bill of complaint. The Fair v. Kohler Die &amp; Specialty Co., 228 U. S. 22, 25, 33 S. Ct. 410, 57 L. Ed. 716; Pratt v. Paris Gaslight &amp; Coke Co., 168 U. S. 255, 259, 18 S. Ct. 62, 42 L. Ed. 458; Excelsior Wooden Pipe Co. v. Pacific Bridge Co., 185 U. S. 282, 22 S. Ct. 681, 46 L. Ed. 910. The bill makes the usual allegations of a bill for patent infringement; it asserts title to the patents by assignment, plaintiff\u2019s exclusive right to manufacture and sell the patented articles, and defendants\u2019 infringement. It prays for an injunction and accounting. True, it demands other relief, which is not given in a patent suit, such as the appointment of a receiver and the cancellation of the conveyance by Dickinson to the corporate defendant. But the prayer for inappropriate relief does not change the character of plaintiff\u2019s bill. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">The only cause of action asserted is the violation of plaintiff\u2019s rights under the patents; no defect in title is acknowledged, and no conveyance to plaintiff to complete its title is asked. The answer, it is true, asserts a revocation of any rights in the patents under plaintiff\u2019s agreement' with Dick<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>inson, and the controversy on the trial revolved about this issue. But this is no more than a denial of plaintiff\u2019s title. When the plaintiff bases his cause of action upon an act of Congress, jurisdiction cannot be defeated by a plea \u25a0which merely denies the merits of the claim. As said in the Fair Case, supra, \u201cjurisdiction is authority to decide the ease either way.\u201d Were it otherwise, a decision that a patent was invalid would oust the court of jurisdiction to render it.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Upon the argument it was questioned whether an assignee may sue as owner of the patent when the assignment is made before the patent issued and the patent is subsequently issued to the assignor. Even if the question were to be answered in the negative, plaintiff\u2019s claim of right to do so would seem to present a case arising under the patent laws within the principles of the authorities above cited. But it has been conclusively settled that the equitable assignee under a recorded assignment may sue the assignor patentee for infringement. Littlefield v. Perry, 21 Wall. 205, 22 L. Ed. 577; Excelsior Wooden-Pipe Co. v. Pacific Bridge Co., 185 U. S. 282, 295, 22 S. Ct. 681, 46 L. Ed. 910. Consequently there is no doubt that the court had jurisdiction of the original bill. Its jurisdiction to decide the counterclaim arising out of the subject-matter of the suit is equally clear. See Moore v. N. Y. Cotton Exch., 270 U. S. 593, 46 S. Ct. 367, 70 L. Ed. 750, 45 A. L. R. 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Of the merits little need be said. The District Court found that plaintiff broke its contract of November 4, 1914, thereby causing the condition of reverter in the assignments to become operative upon the expiration of a 30-day notice served on plaintiff April 3, 1916. Appellant concedes that, if it did break its contract, the deeree was right. The contract provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">\u201c* * * And you [plaintiff] are to as-, sume all future liability for expense in connection with the further development of said machinery, and for taking out of said letters patent upon the application heretofore made therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Coneededly, such money as plaintiff advanced was reasonably and economically expended; but was not enough, and plaintiff refused to advance more. Plaintiff attempted to prove that it was the understanding of the parties that the advances should be limited to .$25,000. The exclusion of such evidence is the error chiefly relied upon in appellant\u2019s brief, although not specified in the assignment of errors. Under the rules of this court, errors not assigned will not be considered, unless the court of its own motion so wishes. It suffices to say that we regard the exclusion of the offered evidence as correct, for the phrase \u201call future liability\u201d is inconsistent with an agreement to limit the amount of plaintiff\u2019s advances for obtaining the letters patent, and the written instrument appears to be a complete memorial of the agreement of the parties. The excluded letters and testimony, so far as they prove anything, tend to contradict the terms of the written contract as to advances, rather than to show that the writing was not intended to embody the whole agreement on that subject. It is elementary that, though the latter may be done, the former may not. 5 Wigmore, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 2430, 2444. Hence \u25a0the court\u2019s finding that plaintiff\u2019s rights in the patents were terminated by notice \u2022 in 1916 was correct. We are also satisfied that the finding of laches was amply sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">The deeree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
