The term \u201cchoco\u201d is suggestive of a preparation which contains chocolate, and to that extent is descriptive. Appellant, therefore, having adopted a descriptive word, cannot be accorded that broad protection which would prevent others from .using in other relations the same descriptive term. Before appellant is entitled to cancellation of other marks containing the descriptive term \u201cchoco,\u201d it must clearly appear that such marks as a whole are deceptively similar to the mark of appellant. We think the difference between the marks here involved is clearly such as to avoid likelihood of confusion. Hunter v. Russell, 57 App. D. C. 353, 23 F.(2d) 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
