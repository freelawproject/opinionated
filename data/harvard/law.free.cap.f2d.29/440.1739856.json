Wherefore plaintiff prayed that the court decree that the transfer of the insurance policy was obtained by the fraud and undue influence of defendant, employed when decedent was mentally incompetent to execute such a transaction; and that the transfer of the bank deposits was induced by the un,due influence of defendant when decedent was mentally incompetent; also, that the household furniture aforesaid be decreed to belong to the assets of decedent\u2019s estate, and that defendant be required to surrender them to plaintiff as administratrix; and that defendant be required to fully account for all moneys, personal effects, and goods that came into her possession as decedent\u2019s agent during the period of his mental incompeteney, and to execute all proper and necessary papers to authorize plaintiff to receive such moneys and property as may be owing to or belonging to decedent\u2019s estate, and which is under defendant\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-19\">The lower court held that according to the allegations of the bill plaintiff was entitled to replevin the personal property if wrongfully detained by defendant; and to bring an action at law against defendant to recover any sums of money due from her to the estate; and that plaintiff possessed a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law for the alleged grievances complained of, and accordingly failed to disclose a ease cognizable in equity. Hence a decree was entered dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>We think this ruling was erroneous. The bi\u00fc prays in part for an accounting concerning various transactions wherein defendant is alleged to have received and disbursed sums of money as agent for the decedent, the amounts whereof are to the plaintiff unknown. Jurisdiction over such cases has long been assumed by courts of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\u201cSo uniformly have courts of equity assumed jurisdiction of matters of account,, that the rule in general terms is now established that they have concurrent jurisdiction with courts of law in all matters of account, and this applies to cases involving accounts, whether arising ex contractu or quasi ex contractu.\u201d 1 C. J. 614. See Butler Bros. Shoe Co. v. U. S. Rubber Co. (C. C. A.) 156 F. 1, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">There are especial reasons, according to the allegations of the bill, why relief should be sought in equity in the present case. The plaintiff is a trustee without personal knowledge of .the various items entering into the desired accounting. Moreover, the item of money obtained by defendant from decedent\u2019s bank deposits and insurance policy, as alleged by plaintiff, may be proper and necessary items in such an accounting. In addition to this, the bill of complaint charges the defendant with fraud and overreaching in her transactions with the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u201cEquity will always entertain jurisdiction to relieve from fraud, notwithstanding that the law would afford relief, either by action or defense, where such remedy would be doubtful, incomplete or otherwise inadequate. Thus equity has jurisdiction where complete protection and relief to plaintiff requires * * * the cancellation of written instruments; the rescission of a transaction; * * *. The concurrent jurisdiction is also invoked by. the necessity of a discovery or of an accounting.\u201d 21 C. J. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">\u201cIt is objected that a court of equity has no jurisdiction of the case because the law affords a complete remedy in damages. This objection is groundless. Equity has always had jurisdiction of fraud, misrepresentation, and concealment; and it does not depend on discovery.\u201d Mr. Justice Bradley, in Jones v. Bolles, 9 Wall. 364, 369, 19 L. Ed. 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The issue involving the household furniture is less certain, but it too enters into the settlement between the estate and the defendant, and may be heard together with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">\u201cBut equity will decree the delivery of chattels when such relief is incidental to the exercise of an underlying equitable jurisdiction, as where it is required for the purpose of enforcing a trust, where plaintiff is entitled to an account, * * * or where a discovery is required and jurisdiction is retained to administer full relief or to prevent multiplicity of suits.\u201d 21 C. J. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">The decree of the lower court is reversed with costs, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
