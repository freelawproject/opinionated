Those fees were paid for services rendered by the petitioner to the municipalities mentioned, in four suits, one by the city of Houston to compel the separation of a railway grade crossing, and the others by public service corporations to enjoin the cities named from fixing rates to be charged by those corporations. It was not disputed that the cities named are .within the terms of a Texas statute conferring on cities and towns power to regulate rates to he charged by public service corporations within such municipalities (2 Yemen\u2019s Annotated Statutes of Texas, art. 1119), or that governmental functions were exercised by the municipalities in compelling a separation of railway grade crossings and in regulating rates mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">The petitioner\u2019s connection with the exercise by the municipalities of governmental functions was in no sense remote. His agency in each of the cases was one created and controlled by the municipality exclusively to enable the latter to perform a governmental function; that agency being the direct means used to enforce a governmental power. The conclusion that the amount of compensation paid to the petitioner for rendering such services is not subject to the federal income tax is in accordance with the decision now rendered in the case of Blair, Commissioner, v. Mathews, 29 F.(2d) 892, U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit. Following that decision, the petition is granted, and the order under review is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
