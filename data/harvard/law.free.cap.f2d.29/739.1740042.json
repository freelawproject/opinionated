When taken, in the course of a trial the sixty days shall begin from and after the last day of the trial. Adversary counsel shall be at liberty to.note objections to form or substance of such exceptions within ten days next after receiving the same and to ask the attention of the court thereto within the same time. If needful the court will appoint a time for hearing the exceptions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-20\">We find no difficulty in concluding that the purported settlement of the bill of exceptions was unauthorized and ineffectual to incorporate the trial proceedings in the record of this ease. Af ter a trial term expires, such exceptions may not be s\u00e9ttled, unless the time for presenting them has been extended by order or rule of court. Exporters v. Butterworth Judson Co., 258 U. S. 365, 42 S. Ct. 331, 66 L. Ed. 663; Farmers\u2019 Union Grain Co. v. Hallet &amp; Carey Co. (C. C. A.) 21 F.(2d) 42; Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Dixon (C. C. A.) 22 F.(2d) 655; .Cudahy Packing Co. v. City of Omaha (C. C. A.) 24 F.(2d) 3; Coleman v. U. S. (C. C. A.) 26 F. (2d) 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-21\">As no extension of time was granted to the plaintiff in error beyond the trial term by an order or rule of the court, we find it necessary to sustain the motion to strike the bill of exceptions from the record. It is so ordered. The further ground of the motion requires no consideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
