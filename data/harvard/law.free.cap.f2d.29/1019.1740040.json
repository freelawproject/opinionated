The Ronning and Ronning application was filed March 12, 1921, or about three years and four months prior to the filing date of Beatty, whose preliminary statement disclosed a date of conception about a year and a half, subsequent to the filing date of the senior parties. Whereupon Beatty moved to1 dissolve the interference, contending that Ronning and Ronning had no right to make the claims and that their application does not disclose an operative machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-17\">The Law Examiner, the Examiners in \u25a0Chief, and the Commissioner have in turn carefully and thoroughly considered every question raised by this appeal. After a review of their decisions, in the light of the oral argument and briefs filed by counsel, we have reached the conclusion that they were correct and that further discussion is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-19\">The decision is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajc-\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
