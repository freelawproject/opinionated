This contention must be sustained.  Appellate courts are entitled to definite and certain findings of the facts of the case where findings are required and involved. Indeed, findings, unless waived, are mandatory upon the trial of questions of fact. (See. 632, Code Civ. Proc.) A trial of questions of fact was had in this proceeding requiring findings to be made and filed. (Black v. <em>Board of Police Commrs., </em>17 Cal. App. 313 [119 Pac. 674].) \u201cThe system of express findings (sections 632 and 633, Code of Civil Procedure) which prevails in this state, requires a finding when there is a material issue.\u201d <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>192 Cal. 73 [51 A. L. R. 1074, 218 Pac. 760].)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">It has been held by both the supreme court and the district courts of appeal that the insertion of the word \u201cmaterial\u201d in a general finding, such as is here under consideration, makes the finding uncertain, and insufficient to sustain the judgment. <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>187 Cal. 632 [203 Pac. 109] ; <em>McKannay </em>v. <em>McKannay, </em>68 Cal. App. 709 [230 Pac. 218].) \u201cThe general omnibus finding\u201d that \u201call the <em>material </em>averments of the amended complaint herein are true ... is insufficient for any purpose.\u201d <em>(Holt Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>154 Cal. 276 [97 Pac. 520].)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">. The order appealed from is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Koford, P. J., and Sturtevant, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
