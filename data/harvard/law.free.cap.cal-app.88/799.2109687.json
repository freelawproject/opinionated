Shropshire </em>v. <em>Pickwick Stages, Northern Division, et al., </em>being L. A. No. 8559, reported in 85 Cal. App. 216 [258 Pac. 1107], and the same points here urged were there very carefully and fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>briefed and considered therein and no good purpose would be accomplished in a further review of the points.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Therefore, upon the authority of <em>Shropshire </em>v. <em>Pickwick Stages etc., supra, </em>the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Hart, J., and Finch, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">A petition by appellant to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on March 29, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">All the Justices concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
