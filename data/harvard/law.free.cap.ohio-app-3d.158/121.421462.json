He contends that the trial court abused its discretion in using the \u201chypothetical Social Security offset\u201d in determining the portion of Ms. Harshbarger\u2019s Civil Service pension that is subject to division. He further contends that the trial court erred in assigning any value to the marital business known as \u201cMacDuff s of Norman\u2019s Cay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">{\u00b6 2} We conclude that the record supports the error claimed by Mr. Harshbarger with regard to the pension valuation. We further find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining the value of the marital business.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">{\u00b63} Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">{\u00b6 4} Sally Harshbarger and Dewey Harshbarger were married in 1978. In May of 2000, Ms. Harshbarger filed a complaint for divorce. The trial court held hearings on the disposition of property in June, August, September, and November 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">{\u00b6 5} Of relevance to this appeal, marital property included a portion of an island called Norman\u2019s Cay near Nassau in the Bahamas. At the time of the divorce, Mr. Harshbarger lived on the island and operated a small resort known as \u201cMacDuff s of Norman\u2019s Cay.\u201d The parties stipulated that the fair market value of the land and buildings was $1,012,500. At the divorce hearing, Mr. Harshbarger presented the testimony of John R. Bosse, an accountant, regarding the value of the business. Bosse opined that the business had no value beyond the appraised value of the land and buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">{\u00b6 6} Ms. Harshbarger presented the testimony of David Saettel, a certified public accountant, who testified that the business had a value separate from the value of the land and buildings. Saettel testified that because Mr. Harshbarger\u2019s records did not contain all the information normally used in an appraisal, he had to use a methodology called the \u201ctreasury back-up\u201d to determine the value of the business. Saettel testified that the business had a value of between $221,000 and $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court found that the evidence supported a finding that the business had a fair market value of $360,500. The business and the property were awarded to Mr. Harshbarger, subject to the requirement that he execute all documents necessary to save Ms. Harshbarger \u201charmless from all accounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>payable or other expenses serving the subject business.\u201d The trial court also ordered Mr. Harshbarger to pay Ms. Harshbarger the sum of $299,768.52 to equalize the division of the marital estate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">{\u00b6 8} Also of relevance to this appeal, Ms. Harshbarger is an accountant with the Internal Revenue Service and is a participant in the Civil Service Retirement System. Mr. Harshbarger has no retirement plan or pension other than Social Security. According to the evidence adduced at trial, the marital portion of Ms. Harshbarger\u2019s pension is valued at $522,692.65, and the marital portion of Mr. Harshbarger\u2019s Social Security benefits is valued at $54,231. The trial court applied the \u201cSocial Security offset\u201d to Ms. Harshbarger\u2019s pension in order to make a fair and equitable division of her pension benefits. In doing so, the trial court noted: \u201cFederal employees who do not participate in the Social Security system are at a disadvantage in that their entire pension is considered marital property while a private employee\u2019s contributions to Social Security are [not subject to division]. * * * [Government plan participants lose some or all of their spousal Social Security. For every three dollars a government plan participant receives from their government retirement, they lose two dollars of their spousal Social Security benefit even though their monies went into procuring that asset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">{\u00b6 9} Therefore, the trial court found that \u201c[e]quity dictates that since a portion of Ms. Harshbarger\u2019s pension is in lieu of Social Security benefits, that portion should be shielded from an equitable distribution.\u201d To that end, the trial court used the \u201chypothetical Social Security offset\u201d approach, deducting the sum of $158,102.61 from the marital portion of Ms. Harshbarger\u2019s benefits, and determining that it would be equitable to divide the remaining sum of $364,590.04 equally between the parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">{\u00b6 10} Mr. Harshbarger appeals from the decree of divorce solely with regard to these two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">{\u00b6 11} Mr. Harshbarger\u2019s first assignment of error states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in its determination of the social security set off of husband\u2019s social security retirement against wife\u2019s civil service retirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Mr. Harshbarger contends that the trial court used an improper method of determining the value of the parties\u2019 retirement funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">{\u00b6 14} A reviewing court is limited to determining whether a trial court abused its discretion in making a property division. <em>Holcomb v. Holcomb </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 128, 131, 541 N.E.2d 597. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes a decision that is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">{\u00b6 15} In general, pension and retirement benefits acquired by a spouse during the marriage are deemed marital assets that are subject to division. <em>Erb v. Erb </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 18, 20, 661 N.E.2d 175. Although a party\u2019s interest in future Social Security benefits cannot be directly divided as a marital asset, the interest must be considered in reaching an equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 pension and retirement plans. <em>Neel v. Neel </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 24, 29-30, 680 N.E.2d 207. \u201cWhen considering a fair and equitable distribution of pension or retirement benefits in a divorce, the trial court must apply its discretion based upon the circumstances of the case, the status of the parties, the nature, terms and conditions of the pension or retirement plan, and the reasonableness of the result.\u201d <em>Hoyt v. Hoyt </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 177, 559 N.E.2d 1292, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">{\u00b6 16} In this case, Mr. Harshbarger has no retirement plan of any sort other than Social Security. Ms. Harshbarger is an employee of the Internal Revenue Service and is a participant in the Civil Service Retirement System. Since Mr. Harshbarger\u2019s benefits were not subject to division, the trial court utilized a hypothetical Social Security offset to equalize the amount of the Civil Service pension to be divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">{\u00b6 17} In Ohio, there is a split among the appellate courts with regard to the correct method for evaluating pension values in this type of situation. Some of the appellate districts have followed the method employed by the trial court, referred to as the hypothetical Social Security offset. This method was followed by the Eighth District Court of Appeals in <em>Neel v. Neel </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 24, 680 N.E.2d 207, in which the court opined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThus, the question which remains unanswered for the domestic relations practitioner is the manner in which one party\u2019s interest in Social Security is to be evaluated in relation to the other party\u2019s interest in a public pension. A number of possibilities have been presented. Considering that this matter has been to this court on two previous occasions, illumination of this issue is warranted. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cIn the leading case of <em>Cornbleth v. Cornbleth </em>(1990), 397 Pa.Super. 421, 427, 580 A.2d 369, 372, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>{\u00b6 20} \u201c \u2018To facilitate a process of equating [public pension participants] and Social Security participants we believe it will be necessary to compute the present value of a Social Security benefit had the [public plan] participant been participating in the Social Security system. This present value should then be deducted from the present value of the [public pension] at which time a figure for the marital portion of the pension could be derived and included in the marital estate for distribution purposes. This process should result in equating, as near as possible, the two classes of individuals for equitable distribution purposes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThis formula, which calculates a \u2018hypothetical Social Security benefit\u2019 for a party who has, in reality, participated in a public retirement plan, not Social Security, and then deducts that hypothetical amount from the public pension, has been adopted by several appellate districts in Ohio. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c[T]he <em>Cornbleth </em>method seems to be both the most thorough and the most equitable under the circumstances presented herein. Specifically, this method appears to give both parties comparable credit in terms of the years of participation in their respective programs, whereas, in practice, the other methods may well penalize the PERS participant by subjecting a larger proportionate share of that spouse\u2019s retirement to division as a marital asset. On remand, the trial court should apply the <em>Combleth </em>formula of calculation* * *.\u201d Id. at 30-32, 680 N.E.2d 207; accord <em>DeChristefero v. DeChristefero, </em>Trumbull App. No.2001T-0055, 2003-Ohio-3065, 2003 WL 21377611; <em>Stovall v. Stovall </em>(Sep. 23, 1992), Summit App. No. 15335, 1992 WL 236770.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">{\u00b6 23} Conversely, some courts have followed a method in which the Social Security benefits of a privately employed spouse are offset against the public retirement benefits of a spouse employed by the state. See, e.g. <em>Eickelberger v. Eickelberger </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 221, 228, 638 N.E.2d 130; <em>Bourjaily v. Bourjaily </em>(July 3, 2000), Licking App. No. 99 CA 120, 2000 WL 968509; <em>Bauer v. Bauer </em>(Mar. 17, 2000), Lucas App. No. L-99-1051, 2000 WL 281718.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">{\u00b6 24} We find the method employed by the Twelfth District Court of Appeals in <em>Eickelberger </em>more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">{\u00b6 25} Consider a situation in which one spouse has accrued retirement benefits during the marriage under a pension plan that exempts that spouse from Social Security, and the other spouse, for whatever reason, has no retirement benefits, either under a pension plan or under Social Security. Barring unusual circumstances, an equitable division of the retirement benefits accrued during the marriage would be an equal division of those benefits \u2014 in this case, the benefits accrued by the only spouse who has accrued retirement benefits. It would not seem to be equitable, and we are aware of no cases finding it to be equitable, to offset against the retirement benefits accrued during the marriage by the only spouse who has accrued retirement benefits of any kind an amount equal to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>hypothetical Social Security benefits that that spouse would have accrued had that spouse been under Social Security. For example, the husband has accrued during the marriage retirement benefits that will pay $5,000 a month, but would have accrued Social Security benefits paying $2,000 a month had he been under Social Security. Because all of the retirement benefits \u2014 $5,000 per month \u2014 were accrued during the marriage, it is obviously equitable to divide those benefits equally, so that each spouse receives $2,500 per month. But if the husband\u2019s hypothesized Social Security benefits in the amount of $2,000 per month are first deducted from his pension, leaving $3,000 to be divided, his wife will receive $1,500 per month, and he will receive $3,500 per month, which is not an equal division, and therefore an inequitable division, barring unusual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">{\u00b6 26} Using the non-Social Security spouse\u2019s hypothetical Social Security benefit instead of the Social Security spouse\u2019s actual Social Security benefit approaches this obviously inequitable result as the Social Security spouse\u2019s actual Social Security benefit approaches zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">{\u00b6 27} Where the non-Social Security spouse\u2019s retirement benefits accrued during the marriage exceed the Social Security spouse\u2019s Social Security benefits accrued during the marriage, using the Social Security spouse\u2019s actual social security benefits as an offset will always result in the equivalent of an equal division of the retirement benefits accrued during the marriage and is therefore the more equitable method of division, barring unusual circumstances justifying an unequal division.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">{\u00b6 28} We conclude that it is an abuse of discretion to apply the hypothetical Social Security offset instead of offsetting the actual amount of the Social Security spouse\u2019s Social Security benefits accrued during the marriage against the retirement benefits of the non-Social Security spouse accrued during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">{\u00b6 29} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">{\u00b6 30} The second assignment of error asserted by Mr. Harshbarger is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in assigning any value to the business known as \u2018MacDuff s of Norman\u2019s Cay\u2019; and the trial court\u2019s finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">{\u00b6 32} Mr. Harshbarger contends that the trial court erred by assigning any value to the business known as \u201cMacDuff s\u201d and that its valuation of the business is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>{\u00b6 33} In reaching its decision regarding the value of the business, the trial court specifically acknowledged the wide range of values advanced by Ms. Harshbarger\u2019s expert and found that the broad range \u201chas to do with the unique qualities involved in the business itself and the lack of comparable businesses in a similar market.\u201d The trial court went on to state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c[Ajdding to the difficulty in the appraisal process is Mr. Harshbarger\u2019s antiquated record keeping technique. Although he denies it, the credible evidence suggests that Mr. Harshbarger\u2019s less than sophisticated bookkeeping techniques are, in fact, by his own design and are not actually reflective of the income which he receives from the business. Mr. Harshbarger has not filed any Federal income tax returns after 1995, with the exception of the joint return which he filed with Ms. Harshbarger for the year 1998. He has not filed any State of Ohio tax returns since 1984 and even though his wife is employed by the IRS, he has openly admitted that he has no intentions of paying any taxes any more. To compound this problem further, [the evidence] seems to suggest that contrary to Mr. Harshbarger\u2019s contentions, he is, in fact, required to file tax returns and pay Social Security tax for the business which he has been running known as \u2018MacDuffs\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">{\u00b6 35} In reviewing a claim that a judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence, we are guided by the holding that \u201c[j]udgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus. Furthermore, we must presume that the findings of the trier of fact are correct, because the trier of fact is best able to observe the witnesses and use those observations in weighing the credibility of the testimony. <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 81, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">(\u00b6 36} In this case, it is clear that MacDuffs was, at the time of the trial, operated as an ongoing business that generates income and that attracts visitors who rent the rental units and use the bar and restaurant. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the testimony of Mr. Harshbarger\u2019s expert, who testified that the business had no value apart from the land and buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">{\u00b6 37} Furthermore, we conclude that a review of the record in this case supports the trial court\u2019s determination that Mr. Harshbarger\u2019s inadequate records hampered the determination of a value for the business. We also conclude that the record demonstrates that, based upon the information available for review, Ms. Harshbarger\u2019s expert used valid accounting methods to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>a range of values for the business. Finally, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s valuation of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">{\u00b6 38} The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">{\u00b6 39} Mr. Harshbarger\u2019s first assignment of error having been sustained and his second assignment of error having been overruled, that part of the judgment of the trial court dividing Ms. Harshbarger\u2019s Civil Service Retirement System benefits is reversed. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in all other respects, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"Axj\">Wolff and Frederick N.
