In April 1997, following his injury, appellant filed an application for payment of compensation and medical benefits with the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation and the Industrial Commission of Ohio. In July 2000, appellant filed an additional claim with the Industrial Commission, alleging that he was suffering from \u201cadjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.\u201d The hearing officer allowed appellant\u2019s additional claim, finding that compensation for temporary total disability was properly payable and that treatment and payment of medical bills was authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">{\u00b6 3} Appellee appealed from the order of the hearing officer. On appeal, the staff hearing officer affirmed the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision. Appellee filed another appeal with the Industrial Commission, which was denied. Appellee then filed an appeal with the Allen County Court of Common Pleas. In response, appellant, pursuant to R.C. 4123.512, filed a complaint to continue to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">{\u00b6 4} On April 9, 2001, appellant filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of the complaint, reserving leave to refile within one year. On April 4, 2002, appellant refiled his complaint, asking the court to find that he had the right to continue to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. On November 4 and 5, 2003, a jury trial was held on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">{\u00b6 5} Following the presentation of evidence, the jury returned a verdict that appellant was not entitled to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund for the condition of an \u201cadjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">{\u00b6 6} It is from this judgment that appellant appeals, setting forth two assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. I</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">The trial court erred in allowing Thomas A. Sherman, M.D. to testify without present independent knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">{\u00b6 7} Appellee introduced Dr. Thomas A. Sherman\u2019s testimony by videotape regarding an independent medical evaluation of appellant performed by Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Sherman in August 2000. Appellant contends that this was in error. Although Dr. Sherman was shown his evaluation report during his testimony, appellant claims that it did not serve to refresh his memory as required by Evid.R. 612 and that, at the time of testifying, Dr. Sherman lacked the present independent knowledge required of a witness. Concurrently, appellant contends that an insufficient foundation existed to admit Dr. Sherman\u2019s evaluation report as a past recollection recorded, pursuant to Evid.R. 803(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">{\u00b6 8} A trial court enjoys broad discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence. <em>State v. Hymore </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 122, 128, 38 O.O.2d 298, 224 N.E.2d 126. Therefore, our review is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Rigby v. Lake Cty. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 269, 271, 569 N.E.2d 1056. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes a judgment that is rendered with an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable attitude. <em>Cedar Bay Constr., Inc. v. Fremont </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 19, 22, 552 N.E.2d 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 9} Pursuant to Evid.R. 612, a witness may review a prior statement to refresh his memory and may then testify on the basis of his present knowledge of the relevant facts. If a witness reviews a prior statement and it fails to refresh his recollection, the statement may be admissible under Evid.R. 803(5) as a \u201cpast recollection recorded.\u201d This doctrine, however, applies only when \u201cthe witness \u2018has insufficient recollection to enable him to testify fully and accurately.\u2019 Evid.R. 803(5).\u201d <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 412, 613 N.E.2d 203. Specifically, to admit a statement as a past recollection recorded, a party must establish (1) that the witness has insufficient memory to accurately testify to crucial information, (2) that the witness can show through his testimony that the past recollection recorded was made or adopted when the matter was fresh in the witness\u2019s memory, and (3) that the past recollection recorded correctly reflects the knowledge the witness had at the time it was recorded. Evid.R. 803(5); <em>State v. Perry </em>(2002), 147 Ohio App.3d 164, 171, 768 N.E.2d 1259. If a writing is admitted pursuant to Evid.R. 803(5), the contents of the writing may be read into evidence, but the writing itself may not be received as an evidentiary exhibit unless offered by the adverse party.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">{\u00b6 10} In the case sub judice, Dr. Sherman testified that he did not specifically remember appellant and that he did not remember performing an independent medical evaluation on appellant in August 2000. He testified that he sees between 50 and 60 patients a week. Dr. Sherman further stated that he prepares reports of his evaluations to describe his findings while they are still fresh in his mind and that his testimony regarding appellant was based on the report prepared after appellant\u2019s examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant\u2019s trial counsel objected to Dr. Sherman\u2019s testimony, asserting that while the evaluation report was insufficient to refresh the doctor\u2019s memory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Dr. Sherman was attempting to read his report as if he remembered the evaluation. The trial court found that Dr. Sherman lacked a present recollection of the evaluation. However, the trial court determined that Dr. Sherman\u2019s evaluation report correctly reflected the knowledge he had at the time the report was made, in August 2000. Therefore, the trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objection and allowed Dr. Sherman\u2019s testimony. Dr. Sherman\u2019s written evaluation report was not offered as an exhibit and was not entered into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 12} We find that the trial court did not err in admitting Dr. Sherman\u2019s testimony. Although the evaluation report did not serve to refresh the doctor\u2019s testimony as required by Evid.R. 612, we find that the report met the criteria to be admissible as a past recollection recorded pursuant to Evid.R. 803(5), as Dr. Sherman had insufficient memory to accurately testify, he stated that he made the report when the findings were fresh in his mind, and he stated that he takes a lot of time with his reports to ensure their accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 13} After reviewing appellant\u2019s brief and listening to oral argument, it appears that appellant objects to the <em>manner </em>in which Dr. Sherman\u2019s testimony was given, not the <em>content </em>of that testimony. Rather than engage in an uninterrupted reading of the report from beginning to end without pause, Dr. Sherman would read a portion of his report then pause and respond to a question posed to him by appellee\u2019s counsel. These questions and answers occurring midstream in Dr. Sherman\u2019s reading of his report were generally limited to elaborating on the particular procedures and tests utilized for the evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant has cited no authority that forbids this manner of presentation, i.e., the reading by its author of the contents of a recollection recorded interspersed with real-time questions and answers serving to explain the procedures and tests employed in collecting the information that constitutes the recorded recollection. We hold, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Dr. Sherman to testify in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b6 15} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. II</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">The trial court erred in excluding the treatment records of Robert A. MacGuffie, Ph.D., dated June 16, 2000, September 10, 2001, and April 5, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">{\u00b6 16} In this assignment of error, appellant argues that some of the records of his treating physician, Dr. Robert MacGuffie, were improperly excluded from evidence by the trial court. The records in question were three letters, written by Dr. MacGuffie and addressed to appellant\u2019s counsel. The first letter, dated June 16, 2000, is 12 pages in length and details the psychological examination of appellant performed on May 23, 2000, by Dr. MacGuffie. The second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>letter, dated September 10, 2001, updates appellant\u2019s condition, and the third letter, dated April 5, 2002, discusses Dr. MacGuffie\u2019s disagreement with a diagnosis made by another doctor who had examined appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">{\u00b6 17} The trial court excluded these records from evidence. The court found that the letters were in response to an inquiry by appellant\u2019s counsel and did not qualify as official business records. The trial court further found that the letters referring to the opinions or reports of other doctors contained inadmissible hearsay. The trial court, however, admitted a personality assessment inventory performed on appellant by Dr. MacGuffie as well as all of Dr. MacGuffie\u2019s handwritten notes on the treatment of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant asserts that these letters were kept as part of Dr. MacGuffie\u2019s official business and qualify as business records pursuant to Evid.R. 803(6). Appellant additionally contends that the findings of other physicians contained in Dr. MacGuffie\u2019s records are excepted from the hearsay rule by Evid.R. 803(4) as statements made for purposes of medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">{\u00b6 19} Evid.R. 803(6) provides an exception to the hearsay rule for records made in the ordinary course of business, if authenticated by a qualified witness, unless \u201cthe method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.\u201d Dr. MacGuffie testified that he saw appellant for an initial psychological evaluation on May 23, 2000. Dr. MacGuffie testified that he began treating appellant regularly beginning in October 2000. Appellant filed his application with the Industrial Commission to allow a claim for the condition of \u201cadjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood\u201d in July 2000. Because Dr. MacGuffie\u2019s letters dated September 10, 2001, and April 5, 2002, were written to appellant\u2019s counsel while litigation was pending, it was not unreasonable for the trial court to conclude that the circumstances of their preparation indicated a lack of trustworthiness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding these letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">{\u00b6 20} The letter dated June 16, 2000, containing the results of Dr. MacGuffie\u2019s initial psychological evaluation of appellant, requires additional analysis. The trial court found that parts of the letter were inadmissible hearsay. The letter refers to a list of medical records from other physicians who had treated appellant and includes Dr. MacGuffie\u2019s summary of the diagnoses and conclusions contained in those records. Appellant contends that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>erred in the exclusion of this evidence, because the diagnoses of other physicians fall within the hearsay exception of Evid.R. 803(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">{\u00b6 21} Evid.R. 803(4) provides that statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment are an exception to the hearsay rule. This exception is generally applicable for the purpose of admitting statements made <em>by a patient, to a doctor, </em>for the purpose of treatment. These types of statements are excluded from the hearsay rule, as they have sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness. We find Evid.R. 803(4) to be inapplicable to the case sub judice. The June 16, 2000 letter does not contain appellant\u2019s statements to Dr. MacGuffie. Rather, the letter contains Dr. MacGuffie\u2019s personal summary of medical diagnoses made by 13 other physicians with whom Dr. MacGuffie had no personal contact. The admission of a report containing the diagnosis or opinion of a physician other than the one testifying is not permitted. <em>Hytha v. Schwendeman </em>(1974), 40 Ohio App.2d 478, 69 O.O.2d 419, 320 N.E.2d 312. Therefore, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding this portion of the June 16, 2000 letter, as the diagnoses of other physicians do not meet the hearsay exception of Evid.R. 803(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">{\u00b6 22} However, the remainder of the June 16, 2000 letter, with the exclusion of the diagnoses by other physicians, appears to have been relevant, admissible evidence. Assuming, without deciding, that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the remaining portion of the letter was in error, the exclusion of the evidence was, at most, harmless error. \u201cNo error in * * * the admission * * * of evidence * * * is ground for granting a new trial or for setting aside a verdict * * * unless * * * such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d Civ.R. 61. In order to support reversal of a judgment, the record must show affirmatively that the error was to the prejudice of the party seeking reversal. See <em>Smith v. Flesher </em>(1967), 12 Ohio St.2d 107, 41 O.O.2d 412, 233 N.E.2d 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">{\u00b6 23} Dr. MacGuffie testified by video deposition at trial. During his testimony he stated that he performed a personality assessment inventory of appellant. Dr. MacGuffie explained the process and results of the evaluation. This is the same information contained in the excluded letter. The admission of the June 16, 2000 letter summarizing the evaluation would have been merely cumulative to Dr. MacGuffie\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the June 12, 2000 letter from evidence, and we do not find that the trial court\u2019s ruling resulted in prejudice to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">{\u00b6 24} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Having found no error prejudicial to appellant herein in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AJV\">Shaw, P.J., and Thomas F. Bryant, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-9\">. The First District Court of Appeals observed in <em>State v. Lane </em>(1995), 108 Ohio App.3d 477, 488, 671 N.E.2d 272, that \"[w]here a document generally satisfies the elements of Evid.R. 803(6), but was prepared in anticipation of litigation, the underlying rationale of trustworthiness is supplanted by a natural motivation to color the facts in favor of the requesting entity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
