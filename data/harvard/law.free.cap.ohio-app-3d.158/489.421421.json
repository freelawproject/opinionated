On June 3, 1996, the Moores were granted a dissolution of their marriage. The dissolution decree provided that Robert would pay spousal support to Judith in the amount of $750 per month. The decree also provided the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-13\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThe issue of spousal support is not subject to the continuing jurisdiction of this Court as to permanency of duration, except that spousal support will terminate upon the death of either party or the remarriage of Wife, and spousal support is subject to review in the event Wife cohabits with a male not related by marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-14\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe amount of monthly spousal support is subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the Court in the event of significant change of financial circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>{\u00b6 5} On January 12, 2004, Robert Moore moved for relief from the final decree of dissolution pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B)(5). In his motion, Moore asserted that Judith had undergone a surgical sex-change procedure and is now a male. Further, Moore asserted that Judith was proceeding in society as a male and now has a girlfriend. Moore requested that the court terminate his spousal support because of Judith\u2019s sex change.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">{\u00b6 6} The trial court overruled Moore\u2019s motion and found that the sex change of Judith did not constitute grounds for relief from the decree of dissolution. The court noted that Moore had not asserted that there had been \u201can event of significant change of financial circumstances\u201d nor that Moore was cohabiting with another. The court denied Moore\u2019s motion without providing a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">{\u00b6 7} In three interrelated assignments of error, Moore contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion without a hearing and in determining that Judith Moore\u2019s sex-change operation standing alone was insufficient grounds for relief from the decree of dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">{\u00b6 8} Civ.R. 60(B)(5) is intended as a catchall provision reflecting the inherent power of a court to relieve a person from the unjust operation of a judgment, but it is not to be used as a substitute for any other provision of Civ.R. 60(B). The grounds for invoking Civ.R. 60(B)(5) should be substantial. The trial court\u2019s ruling upon the motion is subject to review on an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Caruso-Ciresi, Inc. v. Lohman </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 64, 5 OBR 120, 448 N.E.2d 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">{\u00b6 9} Moore argues that he did not contemplate that his former wife would have a sex change after they were divorced. He argues that the cohabitation provision in the continuing-jurisdiction provision in the decree is now meaningless in light of Judith\u2019s sex change. He notes that if Judith were to cohabit with a female the court would not retain jurisdiction to alter the spousal-support provision in the decree. He also argues that \u201cconsidering the disparity in earning power between the sexes,\u201d the court should have at least revisited the spousal-support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">{\u00b6 10} Judith argues that the trial court properly overruled Robert\u2019s motion without a hearing because the court properly found that standing alone Judith\u2019s alleged sex change was not grounds for Civ.R. 60(B) relief. She notes that the parties agreed to the spousal-support provision, and the trial court\u2019s decree reflects the lengthy nature of their marriage and their employment histories.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">{\u00b6 11} The trial court properly overruled Robert\u2019s motion. Judith\u2019s alleged sex change, without more, provides no basis for the court to revisit the spousal-support provisions of the parties\u2019 decree. Moore\u2019s allegation that Judith now has a girlfriend does not change matters. Should the girlfriend move in with Judith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>and begin contributing to the financial upkeep of Judith, this might form the basis for the court\u2019s revisiting the matter of spousal support because of a \u201csignificant change in Judith\u2019s financial circumstance.\u201d See Perri <em>v. Perri </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 845, 608 N.E.2d 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 12} The appellant\u2019s assignments of error are overruled. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AO0\">Grady and Frederick N. Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
