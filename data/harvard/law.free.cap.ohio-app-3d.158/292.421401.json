The following undisputed facts are relevant to our disposition of this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-18\">{\u00b6 2} On the evening of May 2, 2001, the decedent, Jared Akins, an employee of Simplified Employment Services, was operating a tractor-trailer leased by JMC Logistics (\u201cJMC\u201d) from Penske Truck Leasing (\u201cPenske\u201d). As Akins approached the exit ramp for southbound 1-475, his vehicle ran out of fuel. He therefore pulled over to the right side of the road in an area near another ramp that leads from U.S. 24 to southbound 1-475 and then called Hammer\u2019s Towing, Inc. (\u201cHammer\u2019s\u201d) for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-19\">{\u00b6 3} When Hammer\u2019s service van arrived, the driver, Ernie Nolan, parked approximately five feet in front of the tractor-trailer. After Nolan put fuel in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>tractor-trailer, he returned to his van to complete an invoice for the service. There was only one seat, the driver\u2019s seat, in the service van. Nolan used a pull-down table in the van for the purpose of preparing the invoice. As Nolan was working on the invoice, Akins came over to the passenger side of the van and stood next to it with one hand on each side of the open sliding door frame and told Nolan his vehicle\u2019s license plate number. At that point, an'underinsured tortfeasor, Karl Eickmann, who was inebriated, drove his vehicle across the area between the U.S. 24 ramp and the 1^75 southbound ramp and struck the service van and Akins. As a result of the injuries he received in the collision, Akins died.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">{\u00b6 4} Eickmann had a motor vehicle liability insurance policy with a limit of. only $12,500. Therefore, Garnett Giangicomo, the former administrator of Jared Akins\u2019s estate, instituted the instant declaratory judgment action seeking under-insured motorist coverage pursuant to the commercial motor vehicle policies issued to JMC, Penske, and Hammer\u2019s. Later, Giangicomo resigned her position as administrator and was succeeded by appellant and cross-appellee, Ellen Akins, the decedent\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">{\u00b6 5} During the relevant period, JMC was insured by appellee Harco National Insurance Company (\u201cHarco\u201d), Penske carried insurance provided by appellee Old Republic Insurance Company (\u201cOld Republic\u201d), and Hammer\u2019s was insured by cross-appellant, Owners Insurance Company (\u201cOwners\u201d). All three insurance companies filed motions for summary judgment. Appellant also filed cross-motions for summary judgment in each instance. The trial judge granted the summary judgment motions of Harco and Old Republic and denied appellant\u2019s cross-motions for summary judgment. Nevertheless, the judge ruled in favor of appellant on the motion for summary judgment filed against Owners and denied Owners\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The trial court later entered a decision that included the language found in Civ.R. 54(B), and this appeal followed. Appellant claims that the following errors occurred in the proceedings below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c1. The trial court erred as a matter of law when it ruled that the Old Republic Insurance Company policy did not provide underinsured motorist coverage for the wrongful death claim of Jared Akins, and granted the motion for summary judgment of appellee, Old Republic Insurance Company, and denied appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Old Republic Insurance Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">{\u00b6 7}\u201c2. The trial court erred as a matter of law when it ruled that the Harco National Insurance Company policy did not provide underinsured motorist coverage for the wrongful death claim of Jared Akins, and granted the motion for summary judgment of appellee, Harco National Insurance Company, and denied appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Old Republic Insurance Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Owners raises the following cross-assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of Owners Insurance Company by granting Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of Owners Insurance Company by denying Owners Insurance Company\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">{\u00b6 11} Our review of the trial court\u2019s decisions to grant summary judgment is de novo. See <em>Helton v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1997), 123 Ohio App.3d 158, 162, 703 N.E.2d 841. Civ.R. 56(C) provides that summary judgment may be granted when the moving party demonstrates that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. See, also, <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 65-66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">{\u00b6 12} We will consider appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, which relates to Harco, first. In that second assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Harco. Specifically, appellant asserts that the trial court erred as a matter of law in determining that Michigan law, rather than Ohio law, was applicable in determining whether the decedent was afforded underinsured motorist coverage under the Harco policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">{\u00b6 13} The law governing our resolution of the choice-of-law question raised by appellant is found in <em>Ohayon v. Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 474, 747 N.E.2d 206. In <em>Ohayon, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held, at paragraph two of the syllabus, \u201cQuestions involving the nature and extent of the parties\u2019 rights and duties under an insurance contract\u2019s underinsured motorist provisions shall be determined by the law of the state selected by applying the rules in Sections 187 and 188 of the Restatement of the Law 2d, Conflict of Laws (1971).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">{\u00b6 14} Thus, in the absence of an effective choice of law in an insurance contract, a court must resolve the choice-of-law issue by examining the factors found in Section 188 of the Restatement in order to decide which state has \u201cthe most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.\u201d Id. at 477, 747 N.E.2d 206, citing the Restatement at 575, Section 188(1). The <em>Ohayon </em>court found that this focus comported with the Restatement\u2019s \u201cview that the rights created by an insurance contract should be determined \u2018by the local law of the state which the parties understood was to be the principal location of the insured risk during the term of the policy, unless with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant relationship * * * to the transaction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>the parties.\u2019\u201d Id. at 479, 747 N.E.2d 206, quoting the Restatement at 610, Section 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">{\u00b6 15} The factors used to determine the most significant relationship are \u201cthe place of contracting, the place of negotiation, the place of performance, the location of the subject matter, and the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties.\u201d Id. These factors are \u201ckeyed to the justifiable expectations of the parties to the contract, not to the ultimate benefit of one party over another.\u201d Id., citing the Restatement at 15, Section 6, Comment <em>g.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">{\u00b6 16} In the present case, the following facts are undisputed. JMC is a Michigan corporation with its principal place of business located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. JMC obtained its commercial motor vehicle liability policy through an insurance agent who was also located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Thus, the contract was negotiated in the state of Michigan. In JMC\u2019s application for insurance coverage, it stated that it had 57 vehicles that were garaged in Grand Rapids, Michigan. There was no mention of the fact that 12 of its drivers, including the decedent, had routes out of Bellevue, Ohio, or that 12 of the 57 vehicles were usually garaged in Ohio. Consequently, Harco offered JMC uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage pursuant to Michigan law, but it did not offer such coverage pursuant to Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">{\u00b6 17} The place of performance of the contract was, in a large part, in the state of Michigan; however, in this particular case, it was in the state of Ohio. While it is undisputed that the tractor-trailer that Akins was operating at the time of the accident was garaged in Ohio, it is also undisputed that this vehicle was owned by Penske and was registered and licensed in the state of Michigan. Based on the foregoing, we find that reasonable minds could only conclude that the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties is the state of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant argues, however, that <em>Henderson v. Lincoln Natl. Specialty Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 303, 626 N.E.2d 657, requires that Ohio law be applied. The <em>Henderson </em>court, without setting forth any factual basis, answered the following certified question in the affirmative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c \u2018Does Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 3937.18 apply to an automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance covering vehicles <em>registered </em>and principally garaged in Ohio, when said policy was not delivered, or issued for delivery in Ohio by the insurer?\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">{\u00b6 20} As noted above, the tractor-trailer operated by the decedent was never registered in the state of Ohio. For this reason alone, <em>Henderson </em>is distinguishable and is, therefore, inapplicable to the present case. Accord <em>Detillion v. State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number><em>Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>4th Dist. No. 03CA2729, 2004-Ohio-949, 2004 WL 376931, at \u00b6 20 and \u00b6 21. Moreover, we agree with the trial court in finding that the fact that the location where the insured vehicle is principally garaged would, in the case under consideration, be but one factor in determining a choice-of-law question.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">{\u00b6 21} Appellant also urges that our decisions in <em>Garcia v. Green, </em>6th Dist. No. L-02-1351, 2003-Ohio-3841, 2003 WL 21674971, and <em>Woodward v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>6th Dist. No. H-02-043, 2003-Ohio-3838, 2003 WL 21675826, support the contention that Ohio law should apply in determining whether underinsured motorist coverage is available under the Harco policy. Again, these cases are distinguishable because their outcome rested, in significant part, on the additional fact that UM/UIM coverage was offered to the corporations involved in each case. <em>Garcia v. Green, </em>at \u00b6 24; <em>Woodward v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>at \u00b6 15. Here, there was no offer or rejection of Ohio UM/UIM coverage because JMC informed Harco that its vehicles were all garaged in the state of Michigan. Therefore, the trial court correctly determined that Michigan had the most significant relationship to the transaction and to the parties and, therefore, did not err in granting summary judgment to Harco as a matter of law. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Old Republic on the basis that the insurance company\u2019s offer of UM/UIM motorist coverage satisfied the requirements of <em>Linko v. Indemn. Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 445, 739 N.E.2d 338. Appellant insists that the trial court erred in allowing extrinsic evidence to show compliance. In reaching her decision in this case, the trial judge did consider extrinsic evidence in the form of the affidavit of George Frazier, the Vice-President of Insurance and Risk Management for Penske. In the affidavit, Frazier avowed that he was apprised of the premium cost for UM/UIM coverage \u201ceither orally or in writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Linko, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that a valid rejection of UM/UIM coverage must be in writing and that it therefore requires a meaningful written offer of such coverage. Id., 90 Ohio St.3d at 449, 739 N.E.2d 338. The court then set forth the following requirements of a meaningful written offer: (1) a brief description of the coverage, (2) the premium, and (3) an express statement of the UM/UIM coverage limits. Id. In addition, the <em>Linko </em>court held that the validity of the rejection of a written offer must be determined from the four corners of the insurance agreement. Id. at 450, 739 N.E.2d 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">{\u00b6 24} In 1997, and as applicable to the case before us, the General Assembly enacted H.B. No. 261, which amended R.C. 3937.18(C). 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2373. This statutory section provided that a written rejection is binding and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>effective when it is executed and creates a presumption that an offer of UM/UIM coverage was made by the insurer. A consequence of this legislation was to create some doubt as to whether the <em>Linko </em>requirements were still valid after the statute\u2019s effective date. See <em>Hartfield v. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, </em>6th Dist. Nos. L-02-1218 and L-02-1228, 2003-Ohio-2905, 2003 WL 21299928, at \u00b6 15, reversed on other grounds, <em>In re Uninsured &amp; Underinsured Motorist Coverage Cases, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 302, 2003-Ohio-5888, 798 N.E.2d 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">{\u00b6 25} Subsequently, the Ohio Supreme Court, in answering two questions certified by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division, held that the <em>Linko </em>requirements were still applicable to an insurance policy entered into after the effective date of H.B. 261 and before the effective date, October 31, 2001, of 2001 S.B. No. 97, which eliminated any mandatory offer of UM/UIM coverage. <em>Kemper v. Michigan Millers Mut. Ins. Co., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 162, 2002-Ohio-7101, 781 N.E.2d 196. Ohio\u2019s high court also answered the following second question in the negative: \u201cIf the <em>Linko </em>requirements are applicable, does, under H.B. 261, a signed rejection act as an effective declination of UM/UIM coverage where there is no other evidence, oral or documentary, of an offer of coverage?\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 26} As a result of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s answer to the second certified question in <em>Kemper, </em>there has been some confusion among appellate courts on the issue of whether a court is limited to examining the four corners of the insurance policy when determining compliance with <em>Linko. </em>See, e.g., <em>Manolo v. Lumberman\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>2nd Dist. No. 19391, 2003-Ohio-613, 2003 WL 264344 (allowing extrinsic evidence, an affidavit, to demonstrate that a valid offer of UM/UIM coverage was made); <em>McNeeley v. Pacific Employers Ins. Co., </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-1217, 2003-Ohio-2951, 2003 WL 21321469 (finding that <em>Kemper </em>did not alter the holding in <em>Linko </em>and, therefore, the affidavit of a claims manager was irrelevant in determining the validity of an offer of UM/UIM coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">{\u00b6 27} Although this court has intimated that extrinsic evidence may be used to establish a valid offer, we have not directly addressed this issue. See <em>Stubbins v. Nationwide Agribusiness Ins. Co., </em>6th Dist. No. F-02-031, 2003-Ohio-3456, 2003 WL 21500198, reversed on other grounds, <em>In re Uninsured &amp; Underinsured Motorist Coverage Cases, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 302, 2003-Ohio-5888, 798 N.E.2d 1077; <em>Hartfield v. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, </em>2003-Ohio-2905, 2003 WL 21299928, at \u00b625, fn. 4; <em>Raymond v. Sentry </em>(Mar. 8, 2002), 6th Dist. No. L-01-1357, 2002 WL 360736 (decided before <em>Kemper).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">{\u00b6 28} In directly considering the question of extrinsic evidence, we first note that the Second Appellate District overruled its holding in <em>Manato. </em>See <em>Hollon v. Clary, </em>155 Ohio App.3d 195, 2003-Ohio-5734, 800 N.E.2d 68, at \u00b6 16, discretion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>ary appeal allowed, 101 Ohio St.3d 1487, 805 N.E.2d 538. The <em>Hollon </em>court held that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s answer to a question drafted by a federal court could in no way undercut the <em>Linko </em>requirement that \u201cthe premium for insurance must be stated in a written offer.\u201d Id. Accord <em>Johnson v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP-674, 2004-Ohio-1979, 2004 WL 835875, at \u00b6 26; <em>McNeeley v. Pacific Employers Ins. Co., </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-1217, 2003-Ohio-2951, at \u00b6 15; <em>Kalista v. Pacific Emp. Ins., Co., </em>8th Dist. No. 82286, 2003-Ohio-3031, 2003 WL 21436169, at \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">{\u00b6 29} Our research fails to reveal any Ohio appellate cases that find that <em>Kemper </em>stands for the proposition that any evidence extrinsic to the insurance agreement may be used to decide whether the requirements of <em>Linko </em>are met. We therefore conclude that the mandate set forth in <em>Linko </em>is not abrogated by the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s answer to the second question posed in <em>Kemper, </em>and the trial court erred in considering evidence extrinsic to the insurance agreement itself. If this evidence is not considered, there is no statement of the premium for UM/UIM coverage in the Ohio endorsement to the Old Republic insurance policy. Thus, the requirements found in <em>Linko </em>are not satisfied, and UM/UIM coverage was afforded to the decedent by operation of law. For this reason, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Old Republic on this issue and denying appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the estate\u2019s claim against Old Republic. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is found well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">{\u00b6 30} Because they are inextricably intertwined, Owners\u2019 first and second cross-assignments of error shall be considered together. In those cross-assignments of error, Owners claims that the trial court erred in finding that Akins was entitled to underinsured motorist coverage pursuant to the following provisions in the \u201cOhio Underinsured Motorist Coverage Automobile Policy\u201d that Owners issued to Hammer\u2019s:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cCoverage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">{\u00b6 32}\u201ca. We will pay compensatory damages an injured person is legally entitled to recover:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(1) from the owner or operator of an underinsured automobile;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(2) for bodily injury sustained while occupying or getting into or out of an automobile that is covered by Section II-Liability Coverage of the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-11\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cb. If the first named person in the Declarations is an individual, this coverage is extended as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-12\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(1) We will pay compensatory damages you are legally entitled to recover:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>{\u00b6 37} \u201c(a) from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(b) for bodily injury you sustain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c1. when you are a pedestrian; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c2. while occupying an automobile you do not own which is not covered by Section II-LIABILITY COVERAGE OF THE POLICY.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">{\u00b6 41} Owners first asserts that the decedent did not have underinsured motorist coverage pursuant to section b of the foregoing provisions because he was not a named insured in the declarations. We agree. The issue before us, however, is whether the decedent, as an injured person, had underinsured motorist coverage under section a. We concur with the trial court in finding that the disposition of this issue turns upon the meaning of the word \u201coccupying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">{\u00b6 42} Owners maintains that the meaning of \u201coccupying\u201d is plain and unambiguous and requires a finding that Akins was, at some point, inside Hammer\u2019s service van. Because the decedent was never inside the van, Owners asks this court to conclude that he was never occupying that vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cOccupying\u201d is not defined in the Owners insurance policy. Finding that this word is ambiguous in this particular context, the common pleas court looked to the pertinent case law in determining the legal definition of \u201coccupying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">{\u00b6 44} Insurance contracts are construed in accordance with the same rules as other written contracts. <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 657, 665, 597 N.E.2d 1096. Thus, a court\u2019s goal when construing an insurance policy is to ascertain the intent of the parties. <em>Foster Wheeler Enviresponse, Inc. v. Franklin Cty. Convention Facilities Auth. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 353, 361, 678 N.E.2d 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c[Wlhere the terms in an existing contract are clear and unambiguous, this court cannot in effect create a new contract by finding an intent not expressed in the clear language employed by the parties.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 246, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146. Where, however, the provisions of a contract of insurance \u201care reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, they will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus. Under these circumstances, any reasonable construction which results in coverage of the insured must be adopted by the trial court. <em>Sterling Merchandise Co. v. Hartford Ins.

Travelers Ins. Cos. </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 325, 328, 657 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>N.E.2d 298, quoting <em>Robson v. Lightning Rod Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1978), 59 Ohio App.2d 261, 263, 13 O.O.3d 268, 393 N.E.2d 1053. Consequently, the general trend followed by Ohio appellate courts is to construe the word \u201coccupying\u201d liberally. Id. at 330, 657 N.E.2d 298. In doing so, these courts have adopted a number of related tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">{\u00b6 47} In <em>Joins v. Bonner </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 398, 401, 28 OBR 455, 504 N.E.2d 61, the Ohio Supreme Court held that in construing UM/UIM provisions in a motor vehicle policy that grants coverage to a person \u201coccupying\u201d an insured vehicle at the time of an accident, a court \u201cshould take into account the immediate relationship the claimant had to the vehicle, within a reasonable geographic area.\u201d Further, the performance of a task related to the operation of an insured vehicle provides a sufficient basis for the injured party\u2019s relationship to the vehicle for the purpose of defining \u201coccupying,\u201d even when that claimant has no other connection to that vehicle. <em>Morris v. Continental Ins. Cos. </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 581, 587, 594 N.E.2d 1106; <em>Renter v. Anthony, </em>8th Dist. No. 81233, 2003-Ohio-431, 2003 WL 194875, at \u00b6 51. In addition, if the injured party\u2019s \u201cconduct is foreseeably identifiable with the normal use of the vehicle, that also constitutes a sufficient relationship to the insured vehicle, for the purposes of determining coverage.\u201d <em>Yoerger v. Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. of Am. </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 505, 507, 648 N.E.2d 919, citing <em>Morris v. Continental Ins. Cos., </em>71 Ohio App.3d at 587, 594 N.E.2d 1106.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">{\u00b6 48} Akins was in the immediate geographical area of Hammer\u2019s service van at the time of the accident. At that time, the decedent was engaged in the performance of a task related to Hammer\u2019s service van by aiding in the completion of a service invoice. Moreover, Akins\u2019s conduct was \u201cforeseeably identifiable with the normal use\u201d of the service van. For these reasons, we conclude, as did the trial court, that the decedent had the requisite relationship with the insured motor vehicle to satisfy the meaning of \u201coccupying\u201d and was, therefore, entitled to underinsured motorist coverage under the Owners insurance policy. Accordingly, the common pleas court did not err in granting summary judgment to appellant and cross-appellee on its claim against Owners, and in denying Owners\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Owners\u2019 first and second cross-assignments of error are, therefore, found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">{\u00b6 49} The judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part and reversed in part. The parties are ordered to pay the costs of this appeal in equal shares. See App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b344-9\">Knepper, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b344-10\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Lanzinger, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AOs\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">{\u00b6 50} While I concur with the majority on the appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error, I respectfully dissent on the two cross-assignments of error and would reverse the trial court\u2019s decisions on both summary judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">{\u00b6 51} The Owners insurance policy states: \u201cWe will pay compensatory damages an injured person is legally entitled to recover * * * (2) for bodily injury sustained while <em>occupying or getting into or out of </em>an automobile that is covered * * (Boldface sic; italics added). The majority finds that this provision is susceptible of \u201cmore than one interpretation\u201d and then finds it \u201creasonable\u201d to say that Akins, by standing with his hands on the van door and telling the service driver his license plate number, was \u201coccupying\u201d the van and thus was covered by its underinsured motorist coverage. Coverage in circumstances such as these certainly could not have been the intent of the parties; otherwise, any customer who happened to touch the van in responding to the driver\u2019s questions would be covered by the van\u2019s insurance policy, since the customer would have been \u201coccupying\u201d the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">{\u00b6 52} The facts of this accident should not create an ambiguity in a plainly written policy. Someone is to be \u201coccupying, getting into or out of\u2019 the insured vehicle. The term is to have its ordinary meaning. In construing the word \u201coccupying\u201d liberally under the facts of this case, the majority considered Akins\u2019s proximity to the service van (he was geographically close to it) and his performance of a task related to the van\u2019s use (he was answering questions posed by the driver), and then found that his conduct was foreseeably identified with the van\u2019s normal use. But it missed an important first step: the claimant\u2019s actual relationship with the insured vehicle. Akins was not \u201coccupying\u201d the insured van because he never was its owner, its driver, or its passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">{\u00b6 53} Appellate cases that broaden the undefined contract term \u201coccupying\u201d to grant coverage to a claimant have, at least, required a fundamental relationship between injured party and insured vehicle: the injured party was the driver or passenger. See, e.g., <em>Etter v. Travelers Ins. Cos. </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 325, 657 N.E.2d 298 (driver injured pushing another vehicle while waiting for tow truck for insured vehicle); <em>Joins v. Bonner </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 398, 28 OBR 455, 504 N.E.2d 61 (child passenger leaving an insured vehicle, beginning to cross the street); <em>Robson v. Lightning Rod Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1978), 59 Ohio App.2d 261, 13 O.O.3d 268, 393 N.E.2d 1053 (passenger placing stereo into trunk of insured vehicle); <em>Morris v. Continental Ins. Cos. </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 581, 594 N.E.2d 1106 (assigned driver, then passenger of an insured tractor-trailer injured while standing on highway after an accident); <em>Yoerger v. Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. of Am. </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 505, 648 N.E.2d 919 (driver working on highway pavement near insured work vehicle); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Cincinnati Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><em>Co. </em>(June 17, 1993), 8th Dist. No. 62930, 1993 WL 215450 (passenger 100 feet away from insured vehicle picking up fallen bottles to return them to the insured vehicle); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Counts </em>(Nov. 7, 1990), 9th Dist. Nos. 14490, 14492, 1990 WL 177476 (driver underneath insured vehicle working on brakes).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">{\u00b6 54} We have faced a similar situation before. In <em>McCallum v. Am. States Ins. Co. </em>(Nov. 15, 1991), 6th Dist. No. L-90-354, 1991 WL 254150, a truck driver stopped to help another trucker who had wrecked his vehicle. While the driver of the insured truck was setting flares to warn other drivers of the hazard, he was struck by an uninsured motorist. We held that he was occupying the truck <em>he had been driving, </em>since he was a short distance away when hit, and that helping another driver by setting flares was reasonably anticipated conduct related to the use of the vehicle. Thus the same rules that the majority used in this case applied with an important distinction \u2014 McCallum was the driver of the insured truck from which he was claiming coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">{\u00b6 55} Akins did have underinsured motorist coverage under the Old Republic policy that insured the leased vehicle he had been driving. On the other hand, even under an expansive reading of the Owners policy, Akins was not \u201coccupying\u201d the service van. He neither owned the service van nor was ever inside it as a passenger or driver. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent and would reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment on both assignments of the cross-appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
