Greathouse appeals from a judgment of the Greene County Court of Common Pleas, which convicted him of grand theft auto upon his guilty plea, and sentenced him to eleven months of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>The prosecutor\u2019s statement of facts established that on May 30, 2003, Greathouse had borrowed a car from someone in Xenia, with that person\u2019s permission. The owner of the car understood that Greathouse would go to Dayton to get some clothing and then would return. The car was not returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">{\u00b6 3} Greathouse was charged with grand theft auto, in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(3). In exchange for his guilty plea, the state agreed not to oppose a sentence of community control with drug treatment and restitution. The trial court sentenced him to an 11-month term of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">{\u00b6 4} Greathouse raises one assignment of error on appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-16\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error by accepting a plea of guilty to grand theft on a statement of facts which comprises only the elements for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-17\">{\u00b6 6} Greathouse claims that the prosecutor\u2019s statement of facts at the plea hearing described the unauthorized use of an automobile, but not grand theft auto. Greathouse also claims that there was \u201cat least an ambiguity that [he] did not understand one element of the charge of grand theft auto and so did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>knowingly enter a plea thereto.\u201d Therefore, he claims that the trial court erred in accepting his plea of guilty to grand theft auto.</p>\n<p id=\"Afh\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c \u2018[A] plea of guilty, from an early period in the history of criminal procedure, * * * has been regarded as an admission of every material fact well pleaded in the indictment, dispensing with the necessity of proving them, and authorizing the court to proceed to judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Moore </em>(May 13, 1993), Montgomery App. No. 13564, 1993 WL 169111, citing <em>Craig v. State </em>(1892), 49 Ohio St. 415, 418, 30 N.E. 1120. It is a full and complete admission of criminal liability. Crim.R. 11(B)(1); <em>State v. Jones, </em>Greene App. No. 03CA7, 2003-Ohio-4843, 2003 WL 22110319. Crim.R. 11(C) sets forth the trial court\u2019s responsibilities in accepting a no-contest or guilty plea to a felony offense. The rule does not require the trial court to establish the factual basis for the offense before accepting a plea. <em>Moore, </em>supra. See, also, <em>State v. Post </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 386-387, 513 N.E.2d 754; <em>State v. King </em>(Nov. 4, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 74932, 1999 WL 1000672. Rather, it instructs the trial court to determine that the defendant understands the nature of the charges. Substantial compliance with this requirement satisfies the rule. <em>Moore, </em>supra, citing <em>State v. Stewart </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 86, 5 O.O.3d 52, 364 N.E.2d 1163, and <em>State v. Nero </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 106, 564 N.E.2d 474. \u201cSubstantial compliance means that under the totality of the circumstances the defendant subjectively understands the implications of his plea and the rights he is waiving.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">{\u00b6 8} A guilty plea admits the facts set forth in the indictment, not the facts set forth at the plea hearing. See <em>Moore, </em>supra. In this case, the indictment provided that Greathouse, with purpose to deprive the owner of property, i.e., a motor vehicle, had knowingly obtained or exerted control over the vehicle by deception, contrary to and in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(3). This section charges theft, a felony of the fourth degree. These are the facts admitted by Greathouse when he pleaded guilty, and he thereby relieved the state of the necessity of proving them. <em>Moore, </em>supra. We reject Greathouse\u2019s suggestion that, when, as here, a defendant has been informed of the charge in the indictment and has had a full opportunity to discuss that charge with his attorney, slight variations in the description of the offense at the plea hearing will create a presumption that the defendant did not understand the nature of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">{\u00b6 9} Moreover, we do not agree with Greathouse\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor\u2019s statement of facts at the plea hearing failed to adequately describe the offense of grand theft auto. The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c[T]he Defendant did borrow an automobile belonging to a resident of the City of Xenia, Greene County, Ohio. Initially that borrowing was with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>permission. However, the understanding was the Defendant was to go to Dayton, get some clothing, come back to Xenia. The motor vehicle was not returned, thus constituting a taking and with purpose to deprive the owner of property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">{\u00b6 11} In our view, this statement of facts, albeit sparse, comports with the indictment, which charged that Greathouse had obtained or exerted control over the vehicle by deception, with purpose to deprive the owner of property. The prosecutor\u2019s statement that the \u201cmotor vehicle was not returned\u201d permits inferences of deception and of purpose to deprive the owner of property, and it is inconsistent with the offense of which Greathouse claims he should have been convicted \u2014 unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, R.C. 2913.03. That offense contemplates the eventual return of the vehicle to its owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">{\u00b6 12} Nevertheless, the colloquy between the trial court and Greathouse demonstrates a genuine possibility that Greathouse did not truly understand that he was admitting that he had a purpose to deprive the owner of the car of his property and that he had obtained control of the car by deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">{\u00b6 13} After the prosecutor recited the facts, as quoted above, the trial court and Greathouse had a discussion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Greathouse, did you hear and understand the facts that the Prosecutor just read into the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cTHE COURT: Are those the facts to which you wish to enter a plea of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-12\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cTHE COURT: You\u2019re entering this plea of guilty because that is what you did, you are guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-13\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cA. I mean, the car got stolen from me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-14\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cTHE COURT: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-15\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cA. Okay. But I guess I\u2019m wrong for not coming right back, so yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-16\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cTHE COURT: All right. Well, the facts that the Assistant Prosecutor just stated on the record, are those the facts to which you wish to enter a plea of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-17\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cA. Yes, sir. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-18\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cTHE COURT: That is actually what happened; you are guilty based upon those facts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-19\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Despite the sufficiency of the indictment in charging a violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(3) and the sufficiency of the prosecutor\u2019s narrative to embrace the essential elements of the offense, the prosecutor\u2019s narrative was not so thorough as to foreclose any reasonable possibility that Greathouse believed he was guilty merely for failing to timely return the car, whatever the reason for his failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">{\u00b6 27} Crim. R. 11(C)(2)(a) requires the trial court \u2014 before it may accept a guilty or no-contest plea \u2014 to determine that a defendant understands the nature of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">{\u00b6 28} Because (1) the prosecutor\u2019s narration, while sufficient, did not expressly mention deception or purpose to deprive the owner of property and (2) the trial court asked Greathouse if the facts in the prosecutor\u2019s narrative were what he was pleading guilty to, we think that Greathouse\u2019s responses were a red flag to the trial court that further inquiry was necessary to ensure that he understood the deception and purpose-to-deprive elements of the offense and that he was admitting these elements of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">{\u00b6 29} Absent that further inquiry, we are constrained to reverse the judgment, and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">{\u00b6 30} The assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">{\u00b6 31} The judgment will be reversed and the case will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"A1kd\">Fain, P.J., and Grady, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
