The right to a jury trial is a fundament of American law. We will not permit a trial court to threaten a defendant with a harsher sentence if he exercises a fundamental right.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\n<em>I. A Tragic Accident</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">{\u00b6 3} In November 2001, Stafford and Frederick Shipman, a coworker and friend, decided to attend a Cincinnati Bengals football game. They lived in Evansville, Indiana, which is a several hours\u2019 drive from Cincinnati. The two got into Shipman\u2019s Kia Sportage, and Shipman started driving to Cincinnati the morning of the game.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">{\u00b6 4} Stafford is a paraplegic who cannot voluntarily move his legs. He was licensed to drive, but only if the vehicle was equipped with special adaptations such as hand controls for the accelerator and brake. But Stafford\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been suspended under Indiana law earlier that year because he had failed to appear in court for a traffic violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">{\u00b6 5} On the road near Louisville, Shipman was having trouble driving because he had been drinking heavily the night before. So Stafford and Shipman switched places and Stafford continued to drive to Cincinnati. He drove along Interstate 71 and Interstate 75, over the Brent Spence Bridge, and exited at Second Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">{\u00b6 6} As the Kia approached an intersection on Second Street, the vehicle went through a red light. Unfortunately, there were many pedestrians crossing the street who were also headed to the Bengals game. The Kia struck Scott Asbrock, Stewart Williams, Kyle Fields, and Officer Jon Harris. Asbrock died as a result of his injuries. Williams was knocked unconscious, but was revived and taken to the hospital. He suffered multiple skull fractures and brain trauma and was in a coma for several months before finally regaining consciousness. Williams has had to undergo extensive rehabilitation. Fields suffered a broken leg, along with various cuts and bruises. The Kia clipped Officer Harris, who was assisting pedestrians across the street, and injured his wrist. Other pedestrians may have sustained minor injuries, but none of those injuries led to criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Officer Harris ran after the Kia, which came to a stop after a block or two. Officer Harris, with his gun drawn, opened the driver-side door to see Stafford in the driver\u2019s seat, bent over with his hands on the brake pedal. Stafford screamed, \u201cPlease don\u2019t shoot me. I\u2019m handicapped.\u201d And Shipman added, \u201cI told his ass to stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">{\u00b6 8} Officer Gregory Toyeas, who arrived at the scene within 30 to 45 minutes after the accident, took and recorded Stafford\u2019s statement about the accident. On the tape, Stafford stated that he had begun driving the Kia near Louisville and that he was the one driving when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">{\u00b6 9} Officer Melissa Cummins was dispatched to the scene with a police scout car, which is a large vehicle similar to a Ford Explorer. Sometime after Officer Toyeas had questioned Stafford, Officer Cummins helped Stafford into the back of her vehicle. She then asked him what had happened. At a pretrial hearing, Officer Cummins testified that she had not read Stafford his <em>Miranda </em>rights. But at trial, she testified that she had since remembered that she had, in fact, read Stafford his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Officer Cummins then testified that Stafford told her that he had begun driving the Kia just outside Louisville.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">{\u00b6 10} Stafford was arrested and later charged with one count of aggravated vehicular homicide and three counts of vehicular assault. At trial, Stafford argued that he had not been driving the Kia at the time of the accident. Instead, he said that Shipman had been driving at the time of the accident. Stafford claimed (and still claims) that Shipman forced him to switch places after the accident but before Officer Harris arrived at the vehicle. Stafford argued that his statements to the police were to protect Shipman and that he was not aware of the seriousness of the accident until after the questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">{\u00b6 11} The jury did not believe Stafford\u2019s story and found him guilty of all four counts. The trial court sentenced him to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">{\u00b6 12} On appeal, Stafford assigns seven errors: (1) the trial court should have granted his motion to modify the indictment and his motion in limine regarding his Indiana license suspension, (2) Stafford\u2019s statements to the police should have been suppressed, (3) it was error to allow the jury to view the Kia without authenticating it, (4) he was denied due process when the trial court threatened him with the choice of pleading guilty or facing the maximum sentence, (5) Shipman\u2019s hearsay statement should not have been admitted, (6) the verdict was against the sufficiency and the manifest weight of the evidence, and (7) the 20-year sentence was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">\n<em>II. The Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">{\u00b6 13} In his seventh and final assignment of error, Stafford argues that his sentence violated his due-process rights. We agree. The trial court imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>a harsher sentence because Stafford had asserted his right to a jury trial. This was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">{\u00b6 14} A criminal defendant is guaranteed the right to a jury trial and should never be punished for exercising that right or for refusing to plead guilty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">{\u00b6 15} Once the record shows that (1) the trial court engaged in plea or sentence bargaining, (2) a tentative sentence was discussed, and (3) a harsher sentence followed a breakdown in negotiations, there is a presumption that the harsher sentence was a result of the defendant\u2019s failure to plead guilty. To overcome this presumption, the record must show that no improper weight was given to the failure to plead guilty, and it must also affirmatively show that the court sentenced the defendant solely upon the facts of his case and his personal history \u2014 not as punishment for asserting his right to a jury trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">{\u00b6 16} A harsher sentence following a trial is sometimes justified because the trial court usually has access to more relevant sentencing information after a trial than it had before the trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But that was not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">{\u00b6 17} After the state had made its opening statement, the trial court excused the jury from the courtroom and had a plea discussion with Stafford on the record. The trial court urged Stafford to plead guilty, suggesting, \u201cI would probably sentence you to a term in the Department of Corrections of 11 years.\u201d The court continued, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you should gamble 12 years of your life on what [criminals and jail-house lawyers] try and tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">{\u00b6 18} Possibly the most damning statements clearly informed Stafford that he would be rewarded for pleading guilty even though the trial court felt his sentence should be heavier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">(\u00b6 19} \u201cPm aware of the facts and I understand the law. I\u2019m trying to envision a defense; one or two things may be possible. I\u2019m having a hard time envisioning a defense. As we are here today and I told your counsel when I had this discussion in my chambers, based upon the opening statement of the prosecutor, my feeling concerning possible sentence is different than it was the other day because I\u2019ve been made aware of other facts that have been alleged and that were detailed by the prosecution in their opening statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>{\u00b6 20} \u201cAnd the only reason I\u2019m even discussing this with you, really, has nothing to do with you, but has to do with the families of the people involved, of the victims, and if I can somehow circumvent having them to have to sit through and listen to the trial and have the witnesses testify, I told your attorney today that if, in fact, you would plead guilty to these charges, I\u2019d probably still impose the same sentence that we discussed the other day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cIf, in fact, you\u2019re found guilty, and the evidence is presented at a trial as detailed by the prosecutor in their opening statement, again, I\u2019m not going to prejudge the sentence, but <em>I would really be inclined to give you the maximum consecutively on all four counts.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">{\u00b6 23} We cannot say what facts the trial court already knew at the time it offered Stafford the plea. The trial court admitted that it was aware of certain facts that warranted a heavier sentence than the one offered in the plea bargain. We cannot ascertain what these facts were, and it would be imprudent to attempt a guess. But the trial court said that it would be inclined to give Stafford the maximum based on what it knew at the time of the plea negotiations. When Stafford did not agree to the 11-year deal, the trial court gave him 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">{\u00b6 24} The trial court clearly threatened Stafford \u2014 plead and get 11 years or go to trial and probably get 23 years. This was grossly improper. And it demonstrated a reasonable likelihood that the trial court punished Stafford with nine extra years in prison (the 20 years he actually received minus the 11 he was offered) for asserting his right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">{\u00b6 25} The trial court went to great lengths to attempt to justify its 20-year sentence, even adding a supplement to its felony sentencing findings. And the trial court did not actually impose the maximum 23-year sentence. But none of this disguised the fact that the trial court sentenced Stafford to nine extra years of imprisonment for asserting his right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">{\u00b6 26} Even though Stafford\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the trial court\u2019s discussion with Stafford, the blatant threat and the 20-year sentence gave rise to plain error. Although a trial court\u2019s sentencing discretion is broad, the trial court engaged in plea discussions and threatened that it would give Stafford a heavier sentence if he exercised his jury-trial right. The trial court therefore violated Stafford\u2019s due-process rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">{\u00b6 27} The record demonstrates actual vindictiveness \u2014 or at least a presumption of vindictiveness that the state has not rebutted \u2014 on the trial court\u2019s part. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The right to a jury trial is a foundation of American law. We will not allow it to be infringed. We must vacate Stafford\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. We do not reverse the finding of guilt, because, even after the threat, Stafford went to trial. If he had pleaded guilty, we would have reversed that finding because of the intimidation. Stafford had his jury trial \u2014 but he must not be punished for that choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">{\u00b6 28} We therefore sustain Stafford\u2019s seventh assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\n<em>III. The Motion to Amend the Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">{\u00b6 29} In his first assignment, Stafford argues that the trial court should have granted his motion to modify the indictment and his motion in limine to keep his Indiana license suspension out of evidence. Stafford contends that his Indiana license suspension should not have enhanced the penalties for his crimes because such enhancement was proper only when the defendant was suspended under an Ohio law. Stafford is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">{\u00b6 30} Stafford does not dispute that his license was suspended under Indiana law. So he bases his argument on the Ohio statutory language and the language in the indictment. Aggravated vehicular homicide is a second-degree felony when the offender was \u201cdriving under a suspension imposed under Chapter 4507. of the Revised Coded or any other provision of the Revised Code.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And vehicular assault is a third-degree felony \u201cif, at the time of the offense, the offender was driving under a suspension imposed under Chapter 4507. of the Revised Code or any other provision of the Revised Code.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The suspension provisions of the Revised Code have since been moved to R.C. Chapter 4510.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">{\u00b6 31} Had Stafford not been driving under suspension, his aggravated-vehicular-homicide charge would have carried a maximum penalty of five years\u2019 imprisonment. And the vehicular-assault charges would have been fourth-degree felonies, which would have involved a maximum of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment and would not have included a presumptive prison sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Had he not been driving under suspension, the most time that Stafford could have spent in prison would have been nine and one-half years. Instead, Stafford faced 23 years, at least some of which was mandatory.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>{\u00b6 32} Stafford now argues that an Ohio court \u2014 not an Indiana court \u2014 had to suspend his driver\u2019s license in order for the enhancement to apply. Under the applicable law at the time of the accident, \u201cwhen a penalty or suspension is enhanced because of a prior or current violation of a specified law or a prior or current specified offense, the reference to the violation of the specified law or the specified offense includes any violation of any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, former law of this state, or current or former law of another state or the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> So for the purposes of both aggravated vehicular homicide and vehicular assault, an out-of-state suspension enhanced the penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 33} Stafford is correct in asserting that an essential-element variance in an indictment can be fatal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But the indictment was not in error concerning an essential element of the crimes, because his Indiana license suspension was also a suspension under Ohio law. The trial court therefore properly denied Stafford\u2019s motion to modify the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 34} Further, the trial court properly instructed the jury that \u201c[djriving under a suspension imposed under Chapter 4507 of the Revised Code includes driving under a suspension imposed by a substantially equivalent current or former law of another state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 35} We therefore overrule Stafford\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">\n<em>TV. Stafford\u2019s Statements to the Police</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">{\u00b6 36} In his second assignment, Stafford argues that the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress his two statements to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">{\u00b6 37} The first statement, which Officer Toyeas obtained on a recording, was made approximately 45 minutes after the accident. Officer Toyeas and Officer Jerry Lathery asked Stafford a number of questions relating to the accident. Stafford admitted that he had been driving the Kia at the time of the accident. He said that he had started driving near Louisville and that he should never have let Shipman switch places with him. Once Stafford asked to speak to a lawyer, the officers stopped questioning him.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">{\u00b6 38} Stafford made the second statement to Officer Cummins while she was with him in the police scout vehicle. Officer Cummins testified that Stafford had admitted that he had been driving the Kia.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">{\u00b6 39} Stafford now argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to suppress these statements violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights under the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. He claims that the trial court should have suppressed the statements because he never received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> .</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 40} To trigger the need for <em>Miranda </em>warnings, a defendant must be subject to a custodial interrogation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Whether a custodial interrogation has occurred depends on how a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position would have understood the situation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Determining what constitutes custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes depends on the facts of each case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 41} Roadside questioning of a motorist by police, either for a routine traffic stop or because of an accident, is typically not considered a custodial interrogation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But an interrogation conducted inside a police vehicle is usually a custodial interrogation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">{\u00b6 42} When Officer Toyeas recorded Stafford\u2019s statement, they were still on the road near the Kia. Stafford emphasizes the fact that it was a police-dominated atmosphere and that it was not the type of routine interrogation associated with a traffic stop or the average accident. Whether a location is a police-dominated atmosphere is one of the factors to consider when determining whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings are necessary.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">{\u00b6 43} But Officer Toyeas testified that, at the time of the recording, the only officers in the vicinity were himself and Officer Lathery. While Officer Toyeas estimated that there were 20 officers at the scene, only two of them were actually questioning Stafford. One of the reasons that a routine interrogation is permitted without <em>Miranda </em>warnings following traffic stops and accidents is that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>conducted in public.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Even though there were many police around the scene, Officer Toyeas interviewed Stafford on a public street. Even if the ear and the surrounding area were cordoned off at the time, all of Officers Toyeas\u2019s and Lathery\u2019s actions occurred in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 44} Officers Toyeas and Lathery were simply asking Stafford questions about the accident to determine what exactly had happened. The officers did not place Stafford in handcuffs before or during the questioning. He was not under arrest when Officer Toyeas questioned him. Nor was Stafford free to leave the scene because the police had to question him about the accident.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But this was not a custodial interrogation. The trial court properly denied Stafford\u2019s motion to suppress and his motion in limine regarding his recorded statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 45} The statements that Stafford made to Officer Cummins present a closer question. Routine traffic stops can escalate to the point where they require <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> While this was not a traffic stop, the same logic applies. Officer Cummins did not arrive until after Officer Toyeas had finished questioning Stafford. Further, Stafford was in the back of the police scout vehicle when he was speaking with Officer Cummins. Any conversation that Stafford had with Officer Cummins was a custodial interrogation. Stafford therefore should have been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to any questioning. In fact, Officer Cummins later testified that she did read Stafford his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 46} The jury heard Officer Cummins\u2019s testimony and also heard that she had testified to the contrary in a prior hearing. The jury had the opportunity to weigh this testimony accordingly and to give it whatever weight it deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 47} And any error that may have resulted from Officer Cummins\u2019s testimony was harmless. The same basic statements were already in evidence\u2014 in Stafford\u2019s own words \u2014 because of Officer Toyeas\u2019s recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 48} Stafford relies on <em>State v. </em>Henderson<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and <em>State v. Ham</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for the proposition that defendants should be given their <em>Miranda </em>rights after serious auto collisions. But <em>Henderson </em>addressed <em>Miranda </em>mainly as it related to the nonverbal results of a defendant\u2019s breath-alcohol and field-sobriety tests. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>Ham </em>held that the defendant was not free to go at any time after the accident because it was clear that the defendant had been driving under the influence of alcohol. But, again, a person subject to on-scene investigative questioning following a detention involving a traffic matter is not in custody for the purposes of <em>Miranda.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That Stafford had been involved in an accident did not change the fact that the officers initially had the right to detain and question him about the accident before actually arresting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 49} At the time that he gave his statement to Officer Toyeas, Stafford was not under arrest, nor had there been a restraint on his freedom of movement to the degree associated with formal arrest. Officer Toyeas was therefore not required to read Stafford his <em>Miranda </em>rights at that time. And any problem resulting from Officer Cummins\u2019s testimony was, at worst, harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 50} We therefore overrule Stafford\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\n<em>V. The Jury\u2019s Viewing of the Kia</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">{\u00b6 51} In his third assignment, Stafford argues that the jury should not have been allowed to view the Kia. Stafford is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">{\u00b6 52} When it is proper, jurors may view the place where a material fact in a crime occurred.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> And a trial court has broad discretion whether to allow the jury to view the crime scene.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Before we can reverse, we must be persuaded that the jury view plainly subjected Stafford to an injustice.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> A jury view is neither evidence nor a crucial stage in the proceedings.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">{\u00b6 53} Stafford is correct that all evidence must be properly authenticated or identified.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> But the Kia itself was neither offered as nor admitted into evidence. The trial court specifically instructed the jury that what it saw in the Kia was not evidence. The trial court stated that the only purpose of the jurors\u2019 viewing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the Kia was \u201cto help [them] understand the evidence as it was presented in the courtroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 54} While the Kia was not the crime scene itself, it was a place where a material fact occurred \u2014 namely, it was where Stafford was located at the time of the accident. Stafford testified that Shipman had forced him to switch seats in the seconds after the accident. A jury view, while not evidence, arguably helped the jury more clearly comprehend Stafford\u2019s testimony and the entire case.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 55} While a jury view usually concerns the actual location of a crime, we cannot say that allowing the jurors to view the Kia was an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Further, Stafford has not demonstrated how the jury\u2019s viewing of the Kia prejudiced him in any way, so any error that may potentially have arisen would have been harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 56} We therefore overrule Stafford\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">\n<em>VI. Bias and the Trial Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 57} In his fourth assignment, Stafford argues that the trial court denied him his due-process rights because the trial court was biased. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">{\u00b6 58} A biased trial court is a structural constitutional error and, if shown, requires reversal without resorting to a harmless-error analysis.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> A trial court should not engage in plea negotiations.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Once it appears on the record that a trial court has participated in plea bargaining, that a tentative sentence has been discussed, and that a harsher sentence has followed a breakdown in negotiations, the record must show that no improper weight was given to the failure to plead guilty and that the trial court sentenced the defendant solely on the facts of his case and his history.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">{\u00b6 59} The trial court did threaten Stafford with the maximum prison term if he did not plead guilty. This was wholly improper. But it did not demonstrate that the trial court was biased against Stafford.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">{\u00b6 60} Stafford also noted that the trial court stated, \u201cI\u2019m trying to envision a defense; one or two things may be possible. I\u2019m having a hard time envisioning a defense.\u201d This did not demonstrate the trial court\u2019s bias, as it left open the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>possibility that a defense might exist. Further, the record as a whole contains no indicia of judicial bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">{\u00b6 61} Stafford\u2019s argument in this regard is more properly couched in terms of a jury-trial issue, which he has done in his seventh assignment of error. But the cure for this situation is not to grant a new trial, and we cannot say that the trial court was biased against Stafford.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 62} We therefore overrule Stafford\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">\n<em>VII. Shipman\u2019s Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 63} In his fifth assignment, Stafford argues that the trial court erred in admitting Shipman\u2019s statement to the police at the scene of the crime. But Shipman\u2019s statement was not inadmissible under the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 64} When Officer Harris reached the Kia after the accident, he drew his gun and opened the driver-side door. According to Officer Harris, Shipman was in the passenger seat, sweating, with his eyes dilated. Shipman leaned forward and said, \u201cI told his ass to stop.\u201d The trial court admitted Shipman\u2019s statement as a present sense impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">{\u00b6 65} A statement, even if the declarant is available to testify, is not excluded by the hearsay rule under certain circumstances.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> One such circumstance is when the statement is a present sense impression, which includes a statement describing an event immediately after the event is perceived unless circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Another situation where the hearsay rule does not apply is an excited utterance: a statement relating to a startling event made while the declarant is under the stress of excitement caused by the event.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> A trial court ordinarily has broad discretion in admitting or excluding evidence.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">{\u00b6 66} Shipman made the statement as soon as Officer Harris arrived at the Kia, which was only a matter of seconds after the accident. He was describing Stafford\u2019s actions (or, more accurately, lack thereof) in the Kia. The trial court allowed both sides to argue their cases regarding the admission of this statement at a sidebar. And the trial court properly determined that Shipman\u2019s statement could come in as a present sense impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>{\u00b6 67} Further, Shipman\u2019s statement could also have come in as an excited utterance. Officer Harris had his gun drawn. Shipman had just been in a car involved in a serious accident. And he was sweating and his eyes appeared dilated.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 68} This was not a spur-of-the-moment decision: the trial court held a sidebar conference and discussed the issue with counsel. The prosecutor laid a proper foundation for the admission of this statement as either a present sense impression or an excited utterance. We therefore cannot say that the trial court erred in admitting Shipman\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 69} Even if Shipman\u2019s statement was not an excited utterance or a present sense impression, its admission would have been harmless error. For trial purposes, Shipman\u2019s statement only served to identify Stafford as the Kia\u2019s driver. But there was substantial evidence that already put Stafford in the driver\u2019s seat at the time of the accident, including Stafford\u2019s own statements and Officer Harris\u2019s testimony that Stafford was in the driver\u2019s seat when he reached the Kia.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">{\u00b6 70} We therefore overrule Stafford\u2019s fifth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">\n<em>VIII. Sufficiency and Weight of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">{\u00b6 71} In his sixth assignment, Stafford argues that his conviction was unsupported by sufficient evidence and against the manifest weight of the evidence. Stafford is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">{\u00b6 72} In reviewing a record for sufficiency, we must determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">{\u00b6 73} A review of the manifest weight of the evidence puts the appellate court in the role of a thirteenth juror.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The court must weigh the evidence, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether the trier of fact lost its way in finding the defendant guilty. A new trial should be granted on the weight of the evidence only in exceptional cases.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> And \u201c[n]o judgment resulting from a trial by jury shall be reversed on the weight of the evidence except by the concurrence of all three judges hearing the cause.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>{\u00b6 74} The jury found Stafford guilty of four crimes: the second-degree-felony aggravated vehicular homicide of Asbrock and the three third-degree-felony vehicular assaults on Williams, Fields, and Officer Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 75} A person is guilty of second-degree-felony aggravated vehicular homicide when he operates or participates in the operation of a motor vehicle while driving under a suspension and recklessly causes the death of another.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 76} A person is guilty of third-degree-felony vehicular assault when he operates or participates in the operation of a motor vehicle while driving under a suspension and recklessly causes serious physical harm to another.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 77} The first element of all four counts was that Stafford was operating or participating in the operation of the Kia. Officer Harris witnessed Stafford in the driver\u2019s seat, pushing on the brake with his hands, moments after the accident. And Stafford admitted that he had been driving the Kia.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 78} The state also had to prove that Stafford was driving under a suspension under R.C. Chapter 4507. As we have already discussed, Stafford\u2019s Indiana license suspension was effective as a suspension under R.C. Chapter 4507 for the purposes of these crimes. Again, Stafford did not contest that his license was under suspension in Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">{\u00b6 79} Further, the state had to show that Stafford was operating the Kia recklessly. The record shows that Stafford did not have the use of his legs. While he had been licensed to drive prior to his suspension, his license required that he drive a vehicle equipped with specific adaptations that would allow him to drive without using his legs. The Kia did not have any such adaptations. While driving the Kia, Stafford was unable to stop, ran a red light, and plowed through a crowd of people.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">{\u00b6 80} Asbrock died as a result of his injuries. Williams went into a coma and had to undergo significant rehabilitation. Fields suffered a badly broken leg. And Officer Harris injured his wrist, which still occasionally required pain medication more than a year after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">{\u00b6 81} Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have found the elements of all four crimes proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Stafford\u2019s conviction was therefore not against the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">{\u00b6 82} We have reviewed the entire record, weighed the evidence, and considered the credibility of the witnesses. And we cannot say that the jury lost its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>way or created a manifest miscarriage of justice in finding Stafford guilty. Stafford was driving the Kia recklessly simply by the fact that he was driving it at all. His license had been in effect suspended. And all of the victims suffered the unfortunate statutory harm required for a conviction. The only question of fact that was really in doubt was whether Officer Harris\u2019s wrist injury was \u201cserious physical harm.\u201d But, again, having reviewed the record, we cannot say that this determination indicated that the jury lost its way. Stafford\u2019s conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">{\u00b6 83} We overrule Stafford\u2019s sixth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 84} Accordingly, we affirm the jury and the trial court\u2019s guilty finding and judgment, but we vacate the sentence and remand the cause for resentencing in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b6 85} Because the original trial judge has left the bench, Stafford will be sentenced by a different judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Judgment affirmed in part, sentence vacated, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"AlZp\">Winkler, P.J., and Hildebrandt, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-10\">. <em>State v.
