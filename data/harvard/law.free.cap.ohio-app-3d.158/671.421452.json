Hurt was found guilty by a jury in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, a felony of the third degree. The trial court sentenced him to community-control sanctions and ordered the forfeiture of his computer to the Riverside Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">{\u00b6 2} The state\u2019s evidence established the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">{\u00b6 3} Hurt, a 43-year-old gay male, and Stephen Howell, a 19-year-old gay male, met over the Internet in late September 2002. After talking several times on the telephone, they first met in person on September 22, 2002. On Friday, September 27, 2002, Hurt and Howell again met. Howell stayed at Hurt\u2019s apartment on Friday night and spent Saturday with him. On that Saturday, Howell informed Hurt that he was not interested in a romantic relationship with him. Despite that conversation, Howell spent Saturday night with Hurt, as well. On Sunday morning, while Hurt was taking a shower, Howell used Hurt\u2019s computer and logged onto the Internet as hotass69_1983. While online, Howell communicated with N.F., a 15-year-old gay male, and they arranged to meet that day as friends. According to Howell, he informed Hurt that he was going to see a 15-year-old friend in Greenville. Hurt responded, \u201cAre you sure he\u2019s not an undercover cop?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">{\u00b6 4} During the early afternoon, Howell picked up N.F. at his home, and they drove to the Dayton Mall. After window-shopping and eating dinner, Howell received a telephone call from Hurt. Hurt indicated that Howell had left some clothes at his apartment, and he invited them to visit, watch a movie, and go to the music store. With N.F.\u2019s agreement, Howell and N.F. went to Hurt\u2019s residence. When they arrived, Howell and N.F. sat down on Hurt\u2019s couch to watch the end of <em>Grease, </em>which was airing on the television. Hurt brought Howell\u2019s clothes to the living room. After <em>Grease </em>had ended, Hurt invited the two into his bedroom, where his computer was located, to search online for ring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>tones for Howell\u2019s cellular telephone. Howell sat in the computer chair, Hurt milled around the room, and N.F. sat on the bed. After searching unsuccessfully, Hurt put an all-male pornographic video, entitled <em>Mine\u2019s Bigger Than Yours, </em>into his VCR and began to play it. Howell moved onto the bed beside N.F., and Hurt sat on a chair in front of the bedroom door.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">{\u00b6 5} N.F. was aroused by the video, and he asked Hurt if he could go to the bathroom. Hurt and Howell understood that N.F. wanted to masturbate. Hurt responded, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here; we\u2019re all friends.\u201d N.F. pulled down his pants to his thigh and began to masturbate on the bed. Hurt touched N.F.\u2019s inner thigh and penis and stroked N.F.\u2019s penis. Hurt then instructed Howell to perform oral sex on N.F., which he did for several seconds. In addition, Hurt performed oral sex on N.F. and then kissed him. After the oral sex had ceased, N.F. masturbated until he ejaculated. Hurt provided him with towels, and N.F. cleaned up. Howell and N.F. left Hurt\u2019s apartment shortly thereafter. Howell and N.F. subsequently reported the incident to the Riverside police.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">{\u00b6 6} Hurt asserts four assignments of error on appeal. Because we conclude that the third assignment of error is dispositive, we address that assignment only.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c3. The trial court\u2019s continuous pattern of permitting the prosecutor to introduce evidence more prejudicial than probative served to deny appellant due process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">{\u00b6 8} In his third assignment of error, Hurt asserts that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of Hurt\u2019s failure to report his roommate\u2019s income and workers\u2019 compensation income to his subsidized rental authority, of the pictures of male genitalia on his computer, of N.F.\u2019s reaction to the incident, and of Hurt\u2019s sexual activity with Howell.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">{\u00b6 9} Evid.R. 403(A) provides, \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d \u201cResolution of the question of whether the probative value of evidence is <em>substantially </em>outweighed by the danger of <em>unfair </em>prejudice, confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury is necessarily commended to the discretion of the trial court.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Petty </em>(June 4, 1992), Montgomery App. No. 13002, 1992 WL 120503; <em>State v. Rogers, </em>Miami App. No. 2003-CA-30, 2004-Ohio-2746, 2004 WL 1178764.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">{\u00b6 10} First, Hurt argues that \u201cthe allusion and innuendo that Hurt may be exaggerating his workers\u2019 compensation disability and may be failing to report income or roommates for his subsidized rent\u201d were inadmissible, because they were offered solely to demonstrate that he was dishonest, in violation of Evid.R. 404(B) and R.C. 2945.59. Hurt states that evidence of other acts is limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>those that are closely related in time, nature, and place to the offense charged. The state responds that \u201cEvid.R. 608(B) allows a party to question a witness on cross-examination about specific instances of conduct for the purpose of attacking credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe Ohio Rules of Evidence clearly delineate the methods by which a party may impeach a witness. Credibility may be attacked by evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime (Evid.R.609), or by evidence of the witness\u2019s character for untruthfulness (Evid.R.608).\u201d <em>State v. Rodriquez </em>(1986), 31 Ohio App.3d 174, 176, 31 OBR 339, 509 N.E.2d 952; <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>Montgomery App. No. 15848, 2003-Ohio-516, 2003 WL 490549. Under Evid.R. 608(B), a party may, in the court\u2019s discretion, cross-examine a victim regarding false statements if they are clearly probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness. See <em>State v. Fredrick, </em>Montgomery App. No. 18996, 2002-Ohio-1195, 2002 WL 360643; <em>State v. Boggs </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 418, 421, 588 N.E.2d 813. \u201cOther than the Evid.R. 609 exception for certain criminal convictions, a witness\u2019s credibility may not be impeached by extrinsic proof of special instances of his conduct; such conduct may be inquired into only by the intrinsic means of cross-examination within the guidelines set forth in Evid.R. 608(B). Criminal activities not resulting in conviction cannot ordinarily form the basis for an attack upon a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Skatzes, </em>supra, at \u00b6 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">{\u00b6 12} In the present case, the state argues, and Hurt acknowledges, that the sole purpose of the evidence regarding his alleged exaggeration of his disability and his apparent failures to place his nephew on his lease and to report his nephew\u2019s income to his subsidized housing authority was to imply that he is dishonest. We agree with the state that this evidence is probative of Hurt\u2019s truthfulness, and thus the evidence is permitted, in the court\u2019s discretion, pursuant to Evid.R. 608(B). Accordingly, the trial court did not err in permitting the state to cross-examine Hurt as to this conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">{\u00b6 13} Next, Hurt claims that the trial court erred in overruling his objections to questions about photographs of penises on his computer and in allowing the prosecution \u201cto show pictures of naked male genitals[,] including one of Howell},] to the jury.\u201d Hurt notes that none of those photos included N.F. or any other minors, and there were no allegations that they had been shown to N.F. Thus, Hurt argues that the prejudicial effect of the pictures far outweighs their probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">{\u00b6 14} The state responds as follows: \u201cThe assistant prosecutor\u2019s questioning and use of the pictures was permissible under Evid.R. 613(C). That rule allows extrinsic evidence of conduct inconsistent with the testimony of a witness to be admitted when it is offered solely for impeachment, a proper foundation is laid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>and the evidence is of consequence to the determination of the case. Defendant\u2019s possession of images of men and male genitalia on his computer was inconsistent with his testimony at trial that he was not a sexual person. Defendant\u2019s assertion that he was not sexually active and not interested in sex went to the heart of the case, since it amounted to a denial that he had engaged in sexual conduct with N.F. The assistant prosecutor was entitled to use the images found on Defendant\u2019s computer to impeach his statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">{\u00b6 15} We disagree. During Hurt\u2019s direct examination, he testified that he was not sexually active. In response to a question as to how long he had not been sexually active, Hurt responded, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been seeing basically one person up until around Christmas of this year. He moved away but before that I was not sexually active for years.\u201d The prosecutor addressed this testimony in her cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cQ: And you are not denying that you had sex with males?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cA: No, I\u2019m not denying that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cQ: And you said you had a boyfriend until Christmas?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cA: I had a friend that I was seeing, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cQ: Was that a boyfriend?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-11\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cA: That would be a male, a male friend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-12\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cQ: Sexual partner?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-13\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cA: I would say that, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-14\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cQ: And he moved at Christmas time?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-15\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cA: Yes, around Christmas time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-16\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cQ: How long was that relationship?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-17\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cA: It was approximately 6 months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-18\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cQ: Six months?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-19\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cA: Approximately, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-20\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cQ: So when Stephen was over sleeping in your bed two nights in a row you were in a serious relationship with a man?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-21\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cA: Not a serious one. It was a relationship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-22\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cQ: You said you haven\u2019t been sexually active since that person left at Christmas? So you were sexually active with him, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-23\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cA: Yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-24\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cQ: Not serious, just sexually active?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-25\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cA: Right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>{\u00b6 36} \u201cQ: You said that you are not interested in sex since he left, is that correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA: Not really.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">{\u00b6 38} Through the above questioning, the prosecutor made clear that Hurt was sexually active during the relevant time period, i.e., during September 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">{\u00b6 39} The prosecution continued, however, by asking, \u201cDoes that mean that on your computer you would not have anything sexual that you downloaded and saved?\u201d The state then inquired of Hurt whether he had pictures of penises on his computer and asked about specific photographs of naked men and male genitalia that had been found on his computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">{\u00b6 40} We see no reasonable basis for the prosecution to have proceeded along these lines. The photographs have no probative value as to whether Hurt engaged in sexual conduct with N.F. or any other person. Although at least one of the photographs was of Howell, Howell had testified that he had used Hurt\u2019s computer during his visits to Hurt\u2019s apartment. Moreover, these pictures had been taken during a time when Hurt had admitted that he had been sexually active; Hurt had testified that he was not sexually active prior to his six-month relationship and since that relationship ended in December 2002, not during September 2002. Moreover, Hurt has not been charged with any offense based on his use of his computer. In short, the pictures are not inconsistent with Hurt\u2019s testimony, and they have no relevance to the determination of this case regarding N.F. Accordingly, the pictures were not admissible under Evid.R. 613. Because the verdict was based primarily on the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and because the improper admission of the pictures could have negatively affected the jurors\u2019 determination of Hurt\u2019s credibility, we cannot find this error to have been harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\"> {\u00b6 41} Hurt further asserts that the trial court improperly admitted testimony \u201cof how Hurt aggressed on young adult Howell \u2018unzipping his pants and performing oral sex,\u2019 the nature of (homosexual) kisses between Hurt and Howell, and the fact that [N.F.] cried later and \u2018was sobbing hysterically in the car.\u2019 \u201d Hurt emphasizes that he was not charged with rape, nor did the charge involve force or coercion. He further argues that his sexual conduct with Howell was inadmissible to prove motive or intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">{\u00b6 42} Beginning with N.F.\u2019s crying, the trial court did not err in permitting that testimony. As noted by the state, N.F.\u2019s demeanor upon leaving the apartment was relevant as to whether the sexual conduct had occurred and whether N.F. had initiated that conduct, as Hurt alleged. Likewise, we find no error in the admission of evidence of Howell and Hurt\u2019s kisses. That conduct does not constitute a \u201cprior bad act,\u201d and the state was permitted to demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the relationship between Hurt and Howell in light of the fact that N.F. was introduced to Hurt due to that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">{\u00b6 43} Turning to the sexual conduct between Howell and Hurt, Howell testified: \u201cI was very tired from driving all day and I wanted to sleep. I was laying on my back and he [Hurt] was sitting next to me and was groping me, touching me, and ended up unzipping my pants and performing oral sex on me. I kept trying to roll over and trying to get away but I was tired and I let him go. I felt a loss of control[;] I just didn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d At trial, Hurt did not object to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">{\u00b6 44} The state argues that the evidence of sexual activity between Howell and Hurt \u201cwas admissible to show Defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in committing the offense of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor. Defendant accomplished his criminal acts by exploiting his relationship with Stephen and Stephen\u2019s relationship with N.F. * * * Indeed, it was Stephen\u2019s relationship with Defendant that facilitated Defendant\u2019s crime against N.F. The jurors were entitled to know the history and nature of the relationship between Stephen and Defendant so that they could consider the evidence in context. * * * Because Defendant\u2019s sexual relationship with Stephen formed a part of the immediate background of the case and provided the jury with a logical explanation for how Defendant was able to impose his will on Stephen and N.F. without any opposition, the court\u2019s admission of the evidence did not constitute error, much less plain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">{\u00b6 45} We agree that the state was permitted to set the stage for the events of September 29, 2002. However, the evidence of Hurt\u2019s unwanted performance of oral sex on Howell on the previous night falls squarely within Evid.R. 404(B), which provides, \u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.\u201d Howell was not a minor, and this conduct does not demonstrate a pattern of behavior of unlawful sexual contact with a minor. In addition, we question whether the evidence is probative of how Hurt allegedly \u201cimposed his will\u201d on Howell and N.F. Rather, the only obvious purpose of Howell\u2019s evidence of Hurt having performed oral sex on him was to demonstrate that Hurt had acted similarly with N.F. on the following day. Accordingly, we find the admission of this evidence to have been improper under Evid.R. 404(B). Because we have concluded above that the admission of pictures was prejudicial error, we need not decide whether the admission of evidence of Hurt\u2019s sexual encounter with Howell rises to the level of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">{\u00b6 46} The third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>{\u00b6 47} Because the third assignment of error is dispositive, Hurt\u2019s first, second, and fourth assignments of error are overruled as moot. With regard to the first and second assignments of <em>error </em>concerning the forfeiture of his computer, the trial court originally included as part of its termination entry, dated September 25, 2003, that Hurt \u201cforfeit his computer, printer and monitor that was used in the commission of this offense, to the Riverside Police Department.\u201d However, that sanction was not included in the trial court\u2019s revised termination entry, dated October 1, 2003. Because \u201c[a] court of record speaks only through its journal and not by oral pronouncement or mere written minute or memorandum,\u201d e.g., <em>Schenley v. Kauth </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 109, 51 O.O. 30, 113 N.E.2d 625, paragraph one of the syllabus, Hurt\u2019s ultimate sentence did not include the alleged forfeiture, and the assignments of error are moot on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">{\u00b6 48} The judgment of conviction will be reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"AWA\">Fain, P.J., and Grady, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
