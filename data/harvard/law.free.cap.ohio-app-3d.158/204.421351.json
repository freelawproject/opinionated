Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116. Because we conclude that summary judgment is proper in this case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">{\u00b62} Appellant Cynthia Floering, filed UM/UIM claims pursuant to <em>ScottPontzer </em>against appellee, Hamilton Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cHamilton\u201d), her son\u2019s employer\u2019s insurer. The claims stemmed from a motor vehicle accident and resulting death of Floering\u2019s son, Austin, a passenger in motor vehicle driven by his friend, Jordan Huering. The trial court initially found that Austin was an insured under his employer\u2019s policy pursuant to <em>Scott-Pontzer. </em>Nevertheless, the court later granted summary judgment in favor of Hamilton, stating that at the time of the accident, he was not in a \u201ccovered auto\u201d as defined under the insurance policy. Both parties filed appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">{\u00b6 3} Austin was riding around with friends in Huering\u2019s van when the vehicle struck a tree at approximately 1:30 a.m. Therefore, Austin was not acting within the scope of his employer\u2019s business when the accident related to his UM/UIM claims occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">{\u00b6 4} Pursuant to <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, we conclude that Austin was not an insured under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Hamilton policy, negating any coverage for his UM7UIM claims. Therefore, since no material issues of fact remain in dispute and Hamilton is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of Hamilton.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 5} Cynthia Floering\u2019s sole assignment of error is not well taken. Hamilton\u2019s cross-assignments of error are rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 6} The judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Pursuant to App.R. 24, court costs of this appeal are assessed to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AKr\">Pietrykowski and Singer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
