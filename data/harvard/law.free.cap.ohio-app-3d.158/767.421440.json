McMonagle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiffs-appellants, Denise and David Treadway, appeal the judgment of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court granting summary judgment to defendant-appellee, Citizens Insurance Company of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">{\u00b6 2} This case arises out of two separate motor vehicle accidents in which appellant Denise Treadway was injured. Denise and her husband, David Tread-way, filed suit against the drivers involved in the accidents, and those claims were subsequently settled and dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">{\u00b6 3} In the same suit, the Treadways also sought declaratory judgment against Citizens Insurance, seeking uninsured- and underinsured-motorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) coverage under commercial general and commercial automobile policies of insurance Citizens had issued to David Treadway\u2019s employer, Noble Norman, Inc. Citizens then filed a claim for indemnity and contribution against third-party defendant Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Company, which had issued policies of insurance to Grace Church, Denise Treadway\u2019s employer at the time of both accidents. (The trial court denied the Treadways\u2019 motion for leave to file a second amended complaint to assert a direct claim against Brotherhood Mutual.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">{\u00b6 4} Both Citizens and Brotherhood Mutual filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted Citizens\u2019 motion for summary judgment and, in light of its ruling, denied Brotherhood Mutual\u2019s motion for summary judgment as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">{\u00b6 5} Appellants now contend that the trial court erred in granting Citizens\u2019 motion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">{\u00b6 6} We review the grant of summary judgment de novo in accordance with the standards set forth in Civ.R. 56(C). <em>N. Coast Cable v. Hanneman </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 434, 440, 648 N.E.2d 875. Summary judgment is appropriate if, after construing the evidence most favorably for the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can reach only a conclusion that is adverse to that party. <em>Zivich v. Mentor Soccer Club </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 367, 369-370, 696 N.E.2d 201; <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">{\u00b6 7} The Treadways premised their UM/\u00dcIM claims against Citizens on <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116, and <em>Ezawa v. Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. of Am. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 557, 715 N.E.2d 1142. In its recent decision in <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, however, the Ohio Supreme Court limited its decision in <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>to apply only where an employee\u2019s loss is within the course and scope of employment and overruled <em>Ezawa.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Under <em>Galatis, </em>\u201ca policy of insurance that names a corporation as an insured for uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage covers a loss sustained by an employee of the corporation only if the loss occurs within the course and scope of employment.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">{\u00b6 9} In this case, Denise Treadway\u2019s automobile accidents were unrelated to her husband\u2019s employment with Noble Norman. Therefore, the Citizens insurance policies issued to Noble Norman do not provide coverage here. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">{\u00b6 10} Moreover, even if <em>Galatis </em>had not limited <em>ScotGPontzer </em>as discussed above, it is apparent that the rationale behind the decision in <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>does not apply here. As demonstrated in Citizens\u2019 motion for summary judgment, all of the Citizens\u2019 policies at issue contain a \u201cNamed Insured Declaration\u201d that clearly identifies specific individuals as \u201cOther Named Insureds,\u201d thereby removing the ambiguity found in <em>ScotGPontzer. </em>Accordingly, the policies are outside the scope of <em>ScotGPontzer, </em>even before its limitation by <em>Galatis, </em>and, therefore, appellants do not qualify as \u201cinsureds\u201d under the terms of the policies. Therefore, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"Af_\">Rocco, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Alj\">Kilbane, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
