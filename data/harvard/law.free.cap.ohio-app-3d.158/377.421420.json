Shortly after 10 P.M. on August 4, 2000, Steven Petersheim was driving on County Road 40 when an Angus bull owned by appellees entered the roadway in the path of Steven\u2019s vehicle. The ensuing collision resulted in Steven\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against appellees on July 5, 2002, alleging that appellees had \u201cunlawfully and/or negligently caused and/or allowed the bull to run at large.\u201d Appellees thereafter answered and filed a motion for summary judgment. In June 2003, appellant filed a memorandum in opposition. Appellees thereafter filed a motion to strike portions of appellant\u2019s memorandum. The trial court conducted a hearing on all pretrial motions on August 12, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">{\u00b64} In a judgment entry dated August 28, 2003, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees and struck those portions of appellant\u2019s memorandum in opposition to summary judgment that argued that there existed a presumption of negligence pursuant to R.C. 951.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Appellant timely appealed and raises the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cI. The trial court erred in striking portions of plaintiff-appellant Laura Petersheim\u2019s (\u2018Petersheim\u2019) brief in opposition to summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cII. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendantsappellees Taylor and Catherine Corum (\u2018Corum\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">{\u00b6 8} We will address the assigned errors in reverse order. In her second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 9} Summary judgment proceedings present the appellate court with the unique opportunity of reviewing the evidence in the same manner as the trial court. <em>Smiddy v. Wedding Party, Inc. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 35, 36, 30 OBR 78, 506 N.E.2d 212. Civ.R. 56(C) provides: \u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. * * * A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from the evidence or stipulation, and only from the evidence or stipulation, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in the party\u2019s favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">{\u00b6 10} Pursuant to that rule, a trial court may not enter summary judgment if it appears that a material fact is genuinely disputed. The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. The moving party may not make a conclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. The moving party must specifically point to some evidence that demonstrates that the nonmoving party cannot support its claim. If the moving party satisfies this requirement, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth specific facts demonstrating that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial. <em>Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 429, 674 N.E.2d 1164, citing <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">{\u00b6 11} There is no dispute that appellee Taylor Corum was the owner of the escaped bull. Corum recalled that he purchased the animal at an auction on August 2, 2000, two days before the accident. The Corum farm contained two pertinent areas: a fenced-in wooden corral near the house and barn and a larger pasture bordered by a wire-and-wood-post perimeter fence. According to Co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>rum, he last saw the bull alive on 4 p.m. on August 4, 2000, when he took a break from baling hay and observed it in the corral. Corum testified that the corral gate was secure. Corum noted that the corral fence was not damaged and the corral gates were not open. After he was notified by the State Highway Patrol about the accident on August 5, 2000, and he discovered the bull missing, Corum discovered a cut 30-foot span of the pasture fence (as opposed to the corral fence), on the north side. The cut fence had been rolled up near a railroad viaduct over the creek located at this spot. Corum did not know who had done this cutting. Corum testified that he observed bull tracks and fresh manure near the creek bank. Appellees contend that \u201c[n]o one can state with any reliability how the bull exited the corral,\u201d but theorize that the bull went through the severed section of perimeter fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">{\u00b6 12} When livestock escape from a farm and do damage upon a public highway, the owner\u2019s liability sounds in negligence for permitting the escape. <em>Reed v. Molnar </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 76, 21 O.O.3d 48, 423 N.E.2d 140. \u201cIn order to recover on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must prove (1) that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty, (2) that the defendant breached that duty, and (3) that the breach of the duty proximately caused the plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Chambers v. St. Mary\u2019s School </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 563, 565, 697 N.E.2d 198, citing <em>Wellman v. E. Ohio Gas Co. </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 103, 108-109, 51 O.O. 27, 113 N.E.2d 629. The focus of our summary judgment analysis is thus the evidence as to the reasonableness of appellees\u2019 fence maintenance and other precautions to prevent the bull from escaping. Corum asserted that the bull was of a gentler disposition than most and was not observed kicking in the trailer at the time of purchase or rubbing against other objects. The farm\u2019s perimeter fence was made of wire mesh, topped with two strands of barbed wire. According to Corum, he generally visually checked this fence every one to two weeks, riding along the perimeter on his ATV for one to one and one-half hours. However, Thomas Carpenter, Ph.D., P.E., appellant\u2019s agricultural-engineering expert, reviewed photographs of the farm and testified that it would be impossible to adequately inspect the entire fence on the 268 acres in that amount of time, given the amount of trees, brush, and debris in the area. Dr. Carpenter thus stated, \u201cMr. Corum\u2019s claimed inspection methods were unreasonable and inadequate.\u201d Dr. Carpenter also concluded that \u201cthis fence was cut well before the Saturday or Sunday before August 4, 2000, when Mr. Corum claims he was out there and that the fence was intact.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">{\u00b6 13} In regard to the corral issue, in contradiction to Corum\u2019s testimony, appellant averred that Corum admitted to her in conversation that he knowingly allowed the bull out of the corral the day of the accident. Based on this, Dr. Carpenter added that allowing a newly purchased bull, unfamiliar with its new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>surroundings, to go out of a fenced corral would be improper and unreasonable. He otherwise was of the opinion that failure to check on a new bull for nearly 18 hours in a corral so close to the owner\u2019s home was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">{\u00b6 14} We therefore find that summary judgment was improper, as reasonable minds could come to different conclusions regarding whether Corum\u2019s maintenance and monitoring of the perimeter fence, as well as his actions or omissions regarding the use of the corral, resulted in a violation of appellees\u2019 duty to take reasonable precautions to prevent the animal\u2019s escape onto a public roadway and whether appellees\u2019 potential breach was the proximate cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 15} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 16} In her first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in striking portions of her memorandum in opposition to summary judgment pertaining to R.C. 951.02, which reads as follows: \u201cNo person, who is the owner or keeper of horses, mules, cattle, sheep, goats, swine, or geese, shall permit them to run at large in the public road, highway, street, lane, or alley, or upon unenclosed land, or cause such animals to be herded, kept, or detained for the purpose of grazing on premises other than those owned or lawfully occupied by the owner or keeper of such animals. The running at large of any such animal in or upon any of the places mentioned in this section is prima-facie evidence that it is running at large in violation of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">{\u00b6 17} Based on our holding that summary judgment was improper pursuant to appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, any alleged errors in the trial court\u2019s striking of portions of appellant\u2019s memorandum rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is hereby found to be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">{\u00b6 19} For the reasons stated in the foregoing opinion, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Licking County, Ohio, is hereby reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-12\">Edwards and Boggins, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
