The plea was the product of a bargain between defendant and the state. When it accepted her plea, the court engaged in the following colloquy with defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-13\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cTHE COURT: Now, the prosecutor has also agreed to be silent regarding the issue of sentence. The prosecutor is not going to make any statement to the court. He\u2019s going to leave it up to the court on whether to grant probation or not. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-14\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cMS. SIMPSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-15\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cTHE COURT: But the agreement is that if \u2014 not the agreement, but the prosecutor has said that if you are sentenced, then the prosecutor is going to recommend to the court that you receive out of all of these charges, you receive the lowest possible sentence which would be one year. That would be the recommendation of the prosecutor. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-16\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cMS. SIMPSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-17\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cTHE COURT: But the court is going to decide whether, if the court decides to impose a prison sentence, the court will decide whether or not to go along with the recommendation of a one-year sentence. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>{\u00b6 8} \u201cMS. SIMPSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cTHE COURT: So that the range of possible sentence, when you put this all together, if you receive a prison sentence, the lowest possible sentence you could receive would be one year and the highest possible sentence would be three years under this plea bargain. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cMS. SIMPSON: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">{\u00b6 11} When the case came on for sentencing, defendant\u2019s attorney acknowledged an understanding that the court was disposed to impose a term of incarceration, and he reminded the court that \u201cthis plea was done on the recommendation from the state for a one-year maximum.\u201d The prosecuting attorney expressed no recommendation at all, however. The court then imposed the maximum available term of three years. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court as well as the state of Ohio violated the constitutional rights of the appellant when the plea agreement was not honored.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">{\u00b6 13} Defendant argues that her conviction should be reversed because the state breached the plea agreement when it failed to perform on its promise to recommend at sentencing that defendant receive an aggregate sentence of but one year on all of her pending eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">{\u00b6 14} When a prosecutor induces a defendant to plead guilty based upon certain promises, the prosecutor has a duty to keep those promises. <em>Santobello v. New York </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427; <em>State v. Quinn </em>(Oct. 24, 2003), Miami App. No. 02-CA-54, 2003-Ohio-5743, 2003 WL 22429483. Therefore, when the prosecutor remained silent at the sentencing hearing and did not recommend that defendant receive an aggregate sentence of but one year, the state failed to perform on its promise and thereby breached the plea agreement. Under those circumstances the trial court ordinarily should either require specific performance by the state or allow defendant to withdraw the plea. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">{\u00b6 15} The technical breach of promise notwithstanding, we see no basis to reverse. The court, as evidenced by its own statements at the plea colloquy, was fully aware of the state\u2019s promised recommendation. Further, defendant\u2019s counsel reminded the court of the promise at sentencing, before sentence was imposed. Therefore, the record reflects that when it imposed its sentence, the court did so with a full understanding of the position of the state with respect to a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Implicit in any finding of prejudice, and necessary to that finding, is an inference that the prosecutor\u2019s failure to perform on the state\u2019s promise demonstrates that the state\u2019s position concerning the sentence the court should impose had changed, possibly as the result of information in the three presentence investigation reports that were prepared for the court. However, the inference is not one that is reasonable. Had the state\u2019s position changed, it is more likely that the state would have said so. Indeed, the more likely reason for the prosecutor\u2019s silence appears to be that the court, having been reminded of the state\u2019s position on the matter of a sentence, simply acted on that understanding and failed to call on the prosecutor to repeat the recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">{\u00b6 17} The state would have done better to express its recommendation, as it had promised it would. But, on this record, the defendant suffered no prejudice on account of the state\u2019s failure. Any error on the court\u2019s part in imposing the sentence is therefore harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">{\u00b6 18} The assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AyL\">Brogan and Frederick N. Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
