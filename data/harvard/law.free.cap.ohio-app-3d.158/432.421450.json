Scheer appeals his sentence to the maximum, consecutive term of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment for each of two counts of passing bad checks. First, Scheer argues that the trial court erred in finding that he is not amenable to community-control sanctions and that a prison term is appropriate. We conclude that the court\u2019s finding is supported by the record because the court was free to reject Scheer\u2019s claim of remorse, to consider the terms of imprisonment Scheer faced if convicted on the charges dismissed under the plea agreement, and to rely on Scheer\u2019s criminal history in determining that a prison term was warranted. Scheer also argues that the court erred in imposing maximum and consecutive sentences. We find that the court made the requisite statutory findings before imposing the maximum and consecutive sentences; however, because the court failed to state the reasons that support those findings, we must sustain Scheer\u2019s assignment of error. We reverse and remand this matter to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">{\u00b6 2} The Highland County Grand Jury indicted Scheer on one count of theft by deception (a third-degree felony), two counts of passing bad checks (fifth-degree felonies), and one count of passing bad checks (a third-degree felony). The charges arose from Scheer\u2019s purchase of real property from Lowell Chambers of Chambers Realty with three checks written on a nonexistent bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Scheer pled guilty to two counts of passing bad checks (fifth-degree felonies). In exchange, the state dismissed the remaining two counts of the indictment and agreed to recommend a sentence of community-control sanctions if Scheer made full restitution to the victim in the amount of $89,698.81 prior to the sentencing hearing. If Scheer did not make restitution prior to sentencing, the state agreed to recommend a six-month term of incarceration on each count and to ask the court to order full restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 4} Scheer failed to appear at the original sentencing hearing and was subsequently arrested on a warrant issued by the court. At the time of the sentencing hearing, Scheer had not made restitution. The court sentenced Scheer to 12 months\u2019 incarceration on each count, the maximum sentence for a fifth-degree felony, and ordered that the sentences run consecutively. The court also ordered Scheer to make full restitution to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 5} Scheer filed a timely appeal, assigning the following error: \u201cAppellant/Defendant has been deprived of his liberty without due process of law by the maximum sentence and the consecutive sentences in the case at bar, because it did not comport with Ohio\u2019s sentencing scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">{\u00b6 6} A defendant who pleads guilty to two or more offenses arising out of a single incident may appeal the imposition of the maximum sentence as a matter of right if the court imposed the maximum sentence for the offense of the highest degree. R.C. 2953.08(A)(1)(b). Additionally, if the court imposes a prison term for a fourth- or fifth-degree felony without specifying at sentencing that it found one or more of the factors delineated in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a) to (i) to apply, a defendant may appeal his sentence as a matter of right. R.C. 2953.08(A)(2). Finally, a defendant may appeal as a matter of right when his sentence is contrary to law. R.C. 2953.08(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">{\u00b6 7} We may not reverse a sentence unless we find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the sentence is not supported by the record or that it is contrary to law. R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). See, also, <em>State v. Holsinger </em>(Nov. 20, 1998), Pike App. No. 97CA605, 1998 WL 820035. In this context, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court, nor do we defer to its discretion. <em>State v. Keerps, </em>Washington App. No. 02CA2, 2002-Ohio-4806, 2002 WL 31040679. Rather, we look to the record to determine whether the sentencing court (1) considered the statutory factors, (2) made the required findings, (3) relied on substantial evidence in the record to support those findings, and (4) properly applied the statutory guidelines. See <em>State v. Dunwoody </em>(Aug. 5, 1998), Meigs App. No. 97CA11, 1998 WL 513606, citing Griffin &amp; Katz, Ohio Felony Sentencing Law (1998), Section 9.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>{\u00b6 8} First, Scheer contends that the court erred in concluding that he was not amenable to community-control sanctions and imposing a prison sentence. Although there is no statutory presumption that a defendant convicted of a fifth-degree felony be sentenced to community control rather than prison, R.C. 2929.13(B) gives the courts general guidance and a \u201cdisposition against imprisonment\u201d for fourth- and fifth-degree felonies. <em>State v. Caldwell, </em>Lake App. No. 2002-L-142, 2003-Ohio-6964, 2003 WL 22994556, citing Griffin &amp; Katz, Ohio Felony Sentencing Law (1996) 61-63, 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 9} Under R.C. 2929.13(B)(1), the court must determine whether any of the nine enumerated factors apply.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If any of those factors are present, the trial court must impose a prison term if the court also finds that a prison term is consistent with the principles and purposes of sentencing. R.C. 2929.13(B)(2)(a). However, if none of the factors are present and community control is consistent with the principles and purposes of sentencing, the court must impose a community-control sanction. R.C. 2929.13(B)(2)(b). When neither prison nor community control is specifically mandated, the trial court should exercise sentencing discretion in determining whether a prison sentence or community-control sanctions are appropriate. <em>State v. Baird, </em>Hocking App. No. 02CA24, 2003-Ohio-1055, 2003 WL 853734, at \u00b6 12; <em>Caldwell, </em>2003-Ohio-6964, at \u00b6 13. In making this determination, the trial court should comply with the purposes and principles of sentencing under R.C. 2929.11 and consider the seriousness and recidivism factors set forth in R.C. 2929.12. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 10} At the sentencing hearing, the trial court stated: \u201cThe Court has considered the statements, also the pre-sentence investigation and I have been provided the victim impact statements as well as all other factors required under Section 2929.12 of the Revised Code. The Court notes further that the Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>has been convicted of two counts in the indictment, specifically counts two and three, both involving passing bad checks, both involving a felony of the fifth degree. Count one was nolled and dismissed by way of plea bargain as well as count four, and collectively those two counts, had the Defendant been tried and convicted of those, a total of up to six years could have been ordered for incarceration on the counts one and four, one of those being a felony three and the other a felony five. * * * The Court finds at this time pursuant to Section 2929.13(B)(1)(b), (c), (d) and (e) that the victim in this case has suffered substantial economic harm as a result of the actions of the defendant. The Defendant has a lengthy and extensive criminal history as outlined in the presentence investigation and that the Defendant has clearly minimized his role in these offenses and shows no genuine remorse concerning his actions herein. And the Court agrees with the victim one hundred percent that this was calculated according to the evidence that I have had a chance to review before the Court, a calculated act by the Defendant to defraud the victim in this case. After weighing all the seriousness and recidivism factors the Court does find that prison is consistent with the purposes and principles under 2929.11 of the Ohio Revised Code and the Court further finds that the Defendant is not amenable to available community control sanction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 11} It appears that the court misspoke when it stated that subsection 2929.13(B),(C),(D), and (E) applied in this case, as subsections (C),(D), and (E) apply only to more serious felony charges. Although R.C. 2929.13(B)(1) applies to fifth-degree felonies, economic harm \u2014 which the court found applicable \u2014 is not one of the enumerated factors the court must consider when determining whether a prison sentence is appropriate for a fifth-degree felony conviction. Moreover, it appears that none of the R.C. 2929.13(B)(1) factors actually apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">{\u00b6 12} However, even though none of the R.C. 2929.13(B)(1) factors applied, the court was free to impose a prison term if it concluded that the imposition of community-control sanctions would not be consistent with the general purposes and principles of felony sentencing found in R.C. 2929.11 and that prison was consistent with those principles. The court made this finding and stated its reasons for imposing a prison term \u2014 Scheer caused substantial economic harm to the victim, he committed other crimes that would have led to a longer prison sentence had he been convicted, he had an extensive criminal history, he minimized his role in the offenses, and he showed no genuine remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 13} Scheer contends that the court erred in considering the length of the possible prison sentences for the dismissed charges when imposing sentence. We have previously held that a court may consider a defendant\u2019s uncharged yet undisputed conduct when determining an appropriate sentence. <em>State v. Steward, </em>Washington App. No. 02CA43, 2003-Ohio-4082, 2003 WL 21767088. See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>also, <em>State v. Shahan, </em>Washington App. No. 02CA63, 2003-Ohio-6945, 2003 WL 22977321 (as in sentencing hearings, the Rules of Evidence do not apply to sexual-predator-determination hearings, so the trial court may consider reliable hearsay contained in a presentence investigation report). Although there has been much speculation in the legal community about the effect the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403, will have on a trial court\u2019s authority to rely on unproven facts when sentencing a defendant, we conclude that it does not alter our holding in <em>Steward.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Blakely, </em>the defendant pled guilty to kidnapping his estranged wife. Under the facts admitted during his plea, the defendant was subject to a maximum sentence of 53 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, under the state of Washington\u2019s sentencing scheme, the trial court could upwardly depart from the standard sentencing range if it found that the defendant had acted with deliberate cruelty. The trial court made this finding based on the victim-impact statement and imposed a 90-month sentence of imprisonment on the defendant. The United States Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case, holding that because the facts supporting the defendant\u2019s exceptional sentence were neither admitted by him nor found by a jury, the sentence violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">{\u00b6 15} <em>Blakely </em>holds that a trial court cannot enhance a sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on factors other than those found by the jury or admitted by the defendant. Here, Scheer was sentenced to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, a term within the standard sentencing range for his crimes. In fact, the Ohio sentencing scheme does not mirror Washington\u2019s provisions for enhancements. Therefore, <em>Blakely </em>is inapplicable. Moreover, in reaching its decision in <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court specifically distinguished its holding from that of <em>Williams v. New York </em>(1949), 337 U.S. 241, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant objected to the trial court\u2019s reliance on his involvement in several uncharged burglaries when imposing a death sentence rather than the jury\u2019s recommended sentence of life imprisonment. Williams argued that the court\u2019s reliance on this information violated his due process rights because it allowed the court to consider information from witnesses he had not had an opportunity to cross-examine. 337 U.S. at 243, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337. The court rejected Williams\u2019s argument, noting that disallowing such information would render much of the information judges consider during sentencing unavailable and would be impractical to implement. Id. at 249, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337. Based upon the importance of determining an appropriate sentence <em>after </em>a factual determination of guilt, the court concluded that this type of information was essential to the process. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Although the trial court stated that it was considering the length of the sentences Scheer originally faced, not the underlying facts of the dismissed charges, the difference between the two considerations is minimal. Since Scheer did not dispute that he wrote three checks to the victim on a nonexistent bank account and the presentence investigation report contained reliable information concerning these charges, the court was free to consider the dismissed charges when determining an appropriate sentence for Scheer.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 18} Scheer also argues that the court erred in concluding that he did not demonstrate genuine remorse for his crimes. Although the transcript reveals that Scheer apologized for his crimes, he also stated that \u201cthis whole house purchase started out with the best of intentions, it wasn\u2019t any type of scam or fraud, it snowballed into why we\u2019re here today.\u201d The court was free to reject Scheer\u2019s demonstration of remorse and conclude that Scheer was minimizing his actions and had intended to perpetrate a scam or a fraud. The fact that Scheer wrote three checks, which totaled $298,000, on a nonexistent account belies his claim that he did not intend to perpetrate a fraud. Therefore, the court\u2019s finding that Scheer lacked genuine remorse is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 19} Finally, Scheer contends that the court placed undue reliance on his past criminal history in deciding to sentence him to a prison term. Although Scheer contends that the presentence investigation revealed only three misdemeanor juvenile convictions, this contention is inaccurate. In fact, the presentence investigation report states that Scheer has no juvenile record but four arrests in New York with unknown dispositions, several pending charges of passing bad checks, and a conviction for check fraud in Washington Courthouse. The court\u2019s finding that Scheer is not amenable to community-control sanctions because of his criminal history is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b620} Although the court erred in concluding that any R.C. 2929.13(B)(1) factors applied in this case, it is clear that the court carefully weighed whether Scheer was amenable to community-control sanctions before deciding that a prison sentence was necessary. The court did not err in sentencing Scheer to a term of imprisonment. See <em>State v. Coleman </em>(Mar. 27, 2001), Meigs App. No. 00CA010, 2001 WL 315046 (although the trial court erred in concluding that R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) applied, prison sentence upheld where court found that the defendant was not amenable to community-control sanctions).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">{\u00b6 21} Next, Scheer challenges the trial court\u2019s imposition of the maximum and consecutive sentences for his convictions. R.C. 2929.14(C) limits a trial court\u2019s authority to impose the maximum term of imprisonment. Under R.C. 2929.14(C), maximum sentences are reserved for those offenders who (1) committed the worst forms of the offense, (2) pose the greatest likelihood of committing future crimes, (3) committed certain major drug offenses, and (4) who are repeat violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>offenders. If the trial court imposes the maximum sentence, it must not only make one of the required findings but also give its reasons for doing so orally on the record at the sentencing hearing. R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(d); <em>State v. Comer, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-4165, 793 N.E.2d 473, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">{\u00b6 22} Generally, trial courts in Ohio must impose concurrent prison sentences. R.C. 2929.41(A). However, a trial court may impose consecutive prison sentences under R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), which sets forth a tripartite procedure that the court must follow. First, a trial court must find that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public or to punish the offender. Second, a court must find that the proposed consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct and the danger that the offender poses. Third, a court must find the existence of one of the three enumerated circumstances in subparts (a) through (c): \u201c(a) The offender committed the multiple offenses while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing, was under a sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code, or was under post-release control for a prior offense, (b) The harm caused by the multiple offenses was so great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of a single course of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct, (c) The offender\u2019s history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender.\u201d The court must make its three statutorily enumerated findings, and state the reasons supporting those findings, at the sentencing hearing. <em>Comer, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-4165, 793 N.E.2d 473 at paragraph one of the syllabus (R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and 2929.19(B)(2)(c) interpreted).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">{\u00b6 23} The trial court stated the following at the sentencing hearing pertaining to its imposition of maximum and consecutive sentences: \u201c[T]he Court does find, and is ordering that you be sentenced, the Defendant be sentenced to a definite determinate term for a maximum sentence that I am allowed to give you of twelve months on each count to run consecutively to each other, for a total of 24 months to be served at the prison system of Ohio Correction Receptions Center at Orient. The Court finds the shortest prison term would demean the seriousness of the offense and not adequately protect the public. The Court finds further consecutive sentencing [sic] are necessary to protect the public and punish the offender in this case and that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the conduct and to the danger the Defendant poses and finds that the Defendant does pose the greatest likelihood of committing future crimes. That the economic harm suffered by the victim here was so great and so unusual that a single term or concurrent sentencing would not adequately reflect the seriousness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>of the Defendant\u2019s conduct. As I stated earlier, sir, you\u2019re very lucky, young man, at this point that the other two charges were dismissed by way of plea bargain, then we would be talking about another six years on top of what you already got, and I cannot give you any more than two years, but that is what you\u2019re getting. Also, the Defendant\u2019s criminal history shows consecutive terms are needed to protect the public from future crimes that would be committed by the Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">{\u00b6 24} The trial court made the requisite findings for imposing both maximum and consecutive sentences. As required by R.C. 2929.14(C) when imposing a maximum sentence, the court found that Scheer posed the greatest likelihood of committing future crimes. Under R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), the court found that consecutive sentences were necessary to protect the public and punish the offender, that consecutive sentences were not disproportionate to Scheer\u2019s conduct and to the danger Scheer posed, that the economic harm Scheer caused the victim was so great and unusual that a single prison term would not adequately reflect the seriousness of Scheer\u2019s conduct, and that Scheer\u2019s criminal history shows that consecutive sentences were necessary to protect the public from future crimes by Scheer.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\"> {\u00b6 25} Although the court made the requisite findings, it did not state the rationale or reasons that support those findings for either the maximum or consecutive sentences. The court made certain factual findings when it determined that community-control sanctions were inappropriate and imposed a prison sentence; however, the court never indicated that it was relying on some or all of these findings in imposing maximum or consecutive sentences. See <em>Comer, </em>supra, 99 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-4165, 793 N.E.2d 473, at \u00b621 (\u201cWhile consecutive sentences are permissible under law, a trial court must clearly align each rationale with the specific finding to support its decision to impose consecutive sentences\u201d). Cf. <em>State v. Mosher, </em>Athens App. No. 02CA49, 2003-Ohio-4439, 2003 WL 21995225 (court\u2019s statement that it based its decision to impose consecutive sentences on its earlier factual findings sufficient to satisfy requirement that court state its reasons for sentence). Because the trial court did not state its reasons for imposing maximum or consecutive sentences, we must sustain Scheer\u2019s assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">{\u00b6 26} While we recognize that it might seem that we are elevating form over substance, as the court\u2019s reasons for imposing the sentences might be gleaned from the transcript as a whole, the Supreme Court of Ohio has indicated that it will require strict compliance with the sentencing statutes. See <em>Comer, </em>supra, and <em>State v. Edmonson </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 324, 328, 715 N.E.2d 131. Since the trial court did not specify which of its findings it relied upon in imposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>maximum and consecutive sentences, we must reverse and remand this matter to the trial court for further action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"Aqs\">Kline, P.J., and Peter B.
