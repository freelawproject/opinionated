Wise, appeals from the judgment of the Crawford County Common Pleas Court, dismissing for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction his appeal from a decision of the Industrial Commission of Ohio. Wise contends that the Commission\u2019s decision not to vacate a previously authorized settlement agreement constitutes an appealable right-to-participate question under R.C. 4123.512. After reviewing the applicable statutory and case law, we find that this is not an appealable right-to-participate question and that the appeal was properly dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-16\">{\u00b6 2} In November 1995, Wise suffered an injury to his left leg while working at Urban Industries of Ohio, Inc. (\u201cUrban\u201d). Based upon the leg injury, Wise filed a claim seeking to participate in Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation program. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Defendant-appellee Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d) allowed Wise\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim for \u201cfracture, left-tibia \u2014 closed.\u201d Subsequently, in June 1997, Wise and Urban applied to BWC, seeking approval of a proposed settlement in the amount of $2,000. On July 30, 1997, BWC approved the settlement proposal and terminated Wise\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">{\u00b6 3} In March 2002, Wise brought a motion before a district hearing officer, seeking to have his settlement agreement with Urban vacated and his original workers\u2019 compensation claim reinstated. Wise maintained that the settlement agreement was invalid because he lacked the capacity to enter into a contract at the time it was signed and because the settlement application did not comply with the statutory requirements of R.C. 4123.65. The district hearing officer denied Wise\u2019s motion, and he appealed the decision to a staff hearing officer. The staff hearing officer denied Wise\u2019s appeal, and Wise brought the matter for further appeal before the Industrial Commission of Ohio. The Industrial Commission also denied Wise\u2019s appeal, with one Commissioner dissenting. Wise then brought an R.C. 4123.512 appeal of the Commission\u2019s ruling in the Crawford County Common Pleas Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">{\u00b6 4} BWC filed a motion to dismiss Wise\u2019s R.C. 4123.512 appeal based upon a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. BWC argued that the validity of a workers\u2019 compensation settlement agreement was not an appealable right-to-participate question under R.C. 4123.512. BWC also argued that R.C. 4123.65 prevented the appeal of workers\u2019 compensation settlement agreements to courts of common pleas. The trial court originally denied BWC\u2019s motion but later reconsidered the motion sua sponte and dismissed the appeal based upon a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The trial court based the dismissal on the language in R.C. 4123.65(F) preventing the appeal of settlements entered into under R.C. 4123.512. From this judgment Wise appeals, presenting the following three assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Assignment of Error I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">The trial court committed prejudicial error when it granted the Appellee BWC\u2019s motion to dismiss without first holding an evidentiary hearing on the question of whether the June 2, 1997 workers\u2019 compensation settlement agreement had been properly entered into under ORC 4123.65.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Assignment of Error II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">The trial court committed prejudicial error in finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to ORC 4123.65(F), when the settlement agreement entered into by the parties did not meet the strict requirements of ORC 4123.65.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Assignment of Error III</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\">The trial court committed prejudicial error in failing to grant summary judgment in favor of Appellant when there existed no genuine issues of material fact in dispute concerning the legal deficiency of the parties\u2019 June 2, 1997 settlement agreement and the Appellant\u2019s lack of capacity to enter into the June 2,1997 settlement agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">{\u00b6 5} In his first two assignments of error, Wise challenges the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal on jurisdictional grounds. Wise contends that the trial court should have held an evidentiary hearing to determine the validity of the settlement agreement prior to dismissing the case based upon R.C. 4123.65. Because we find that the trial court should have dismissed Wise\u2019s appeal for a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction based on other grounds, we will not address the issues that Wise raises in his first two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">{\u00b6 6} It is well established that a common pleas court has jurisdiction over an appeal from an order of the Industrial Commission only when the order denies a claimant\u2019s right to participate in Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation program. <em>State ex rel. Liposchak v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 276, 278-279, 737 N.E.2d 519. Determinations by the Industrial Commission going to the extent of the claimant\u2019s disability are not appealable and must be challenged through a mandamus action. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">{\u00b6 7} Wise maintains that because a settlement agreement acts as a waiver of participation in the workers\u2019 compensation program, any inquiry into the validity of the settlement agreement concerns an appealable right-to-participate issue. In support of this contention, Wise cites <em>Butler v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>(1960), 171 Ohio St. 19, 12 O.O.2d 40, 168 N.E.2d 150; <em>Stow v. Clem </em>(1985), 25 Ohio App.3d 50, 25 OBR 217, 495 N.E.2d 960; and <em>Wagner v. Krouse </em>(1983), 7 Ohio App.3d 378, 7 OBR 479, 455 N.E.2d 717. However, Wise ignores the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s more recent case, <em>State ex rel. Liposchak v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 276, 737 N.E.2d 519, which extensively discusses the definition of the right to participate under Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">{\u00b6 8} In determining what is an appealable right-to-participate question, the Ohio Supreme Court has defined the right to participate as \u201cwhether an employee\u2019s injury, disease, or death occurred in the course of and arising out of his or her employment.\u201d <em>Liposchak, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 279, 737 N.E.2d 519. Specifically addressing inconsistencies and irregularities in past definitions of the right to participate, the court stated that \u201cunder our most recent precedent, any issue other than whether the injury, disease, or death resulted from employment does not constitute a right-to-participate issue.\u201d Id. at 280, 737 N.E.2d 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Herein, it is uncontested that Wise\u2019s injury occurred during the course of his employment with Urban. BWC acknowledged Wise\u2019s right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation program in a separate proceeding prior to the existence of even the proposed settlement. Neither side challenges the fact that Wise had a right to participate in workers\u2019 compensation. Nor is either side claiming that an additional injury has arisen related to the original accident. Rather, Wise merely wants his settlement vacated so that he can increase the amount of compensation he originally received. This issue clearly goes to the extent of the disability and is unappealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">{\u00b6 10} Therefore, following the most recent precedent established by the Supreme Court, we find that a decision of the Industrial Commission determining the validity of a settlement agreement does not concern an appealable right-to-participate question. Accordingly, the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and it was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">{\u00b6 11} Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein, in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"Ar7\">Cupp and Thomas F.
