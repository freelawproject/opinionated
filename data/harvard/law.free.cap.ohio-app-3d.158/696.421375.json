(\u201cFidelity\u201d). On or about June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>7, 1996, Renee Reese and her son, Austin, sustained personal injuries as the result of an uninsured motorist.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The accident occurred when Renee was cut off by an unidentified driver.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Renee was driving her own car. In order to avoid a collision, she swerved and then traveled up an embankment, rolled over, and landed upside down. At the time of the accident, Renee was on her way to train her replacement at Sarcom, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">{\u00b6 2} After the Reeses settled with their personal uninsured-motorist insurance carrier,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> they sought uninsured-motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) coverage from Fidelity, Sarcom\u2019s insurer. After Fidelity rejected the Reeses\u2019 claims, they filed the instant suit for declaratory judgment on the coverage issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">{\u00b6 3} Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. Without opinion, the trial court granted Fidelity\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiffs timely filed this appeal in which they present one assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">The trial court erred in granting defendant-appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">{\u00b6 4} An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. Summary judgment is appropriate when, after the reviewing court construes the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, \u201c(1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Zivich v. Mentor Soccer </em>Club, <em>Inc. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 367, 369-370, 1998-Ohio-1389, 696 N.E.2d 201; see, also, Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">{\u00b6 5} In Ohio, \u201can insurance policy is a contract, and * * * the relationship between the insurer and the insured is purely contractual in nature.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Marsh </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 107, 109, 15 OBR 261, 472 N.E.2d 1061; <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256. If the contract is clear and unambiguous, \u201cthe court need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>not concern itself with rules of construction or go beyond the plain language of the agreement to determine the rights and obligations of the parties.\u201d <em>Seringetti Constr. Co. v. Cincinnati </em>(1988), 51 Ohio App.3d 1, 4, 553 N.E.2d 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">{\u00b6 6} Plaintiffs argue that they are insureds under each one of three different insurance policies Fidelity issued to Sarcom. Those policies include insurance coverage for business auto, umbrella, and commercial general liability coverage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We address the issue of whether plaintiffs are entitled to UM coverage under each of the policies separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">FIDELITY\u2019S BUSINESS AUTO POLICY ISSUED TO SARCOM</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">{\u00b6 7} The declarations page of Fidelity\u2019s auto policy identifies the named insureds as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">Sarcom, Inc., J.R. Wilcox <em>&amp; </em>Associates DBA: Inacomp Computer Rentals Sarcom Properties, Inc., J.J.S. Wilcox, Ltd.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">{\u00b6 8} Three additional insureds for liability coverage are added through endorsements. These additional insureds are designated as lessors and are identified as \u201cFifth Third Bank of Columbus [sic],\u201d \u201cAssociates Leasing,\u201d and \u201cSociety National Bank.\u201d Fidelity Commercial Auto Policy at Form CA 20 01 12 93(1), (2), and (3). The policy includes coverage designated as \u201cOhio Uninsured Motorists Coverage Bodily Injury.\u201d The named insured is identified as \u201cSarcom, Inc.\u201d The question of \u201cWho Is An Insured\u201d is answered in part as \u201cYou\u201d and \u201cIf you are an individual, any family member.\u201d This is identical to the language construed by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">{\u00b6 9} When we apply the court\u2019s construction of \u201cYou\u201d in <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>to the case at bar, therefore, we conclude that Renee is an insured for purposes of UM coverage under the auto policy. Moreover, Robert and Austin are also insureds as Renee\u2019s family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">{\u00b6 10} Fidelity argues, however, that the additional language \u201cadd as additional insured: James R. Wilcox\u201d changes the meaning of \u201cYou\u201d as interpreted by the court in <em>Scott-Pontzer. </em>We disagree. First, James R. Wilcox is not designated as an additional insured in the auto policy at all. He is listed as an additional insured in the umbrella policy only. We are unpersuaded that the inclusion of James R. Wilcox\u2019s name in the umbrella policy in any way diminishes the ambiguity of \u201cYou\u201d in the auto policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Second, simply adding specific individuals, whether in the common policy declarations or in a separate endorsement, does not, by itself, place the policy outside the scope of <em>Scott-Pontzer. </em>In a case in which the declarations page listed two corporations and two specific individuals as the named insureds, the Sixth Appellate District explained that the inclusion of the individuals \u201cdoes not remove the ambiguity created by the inclusion of corporate insureds.\u201d <em>Kasson v. Goodman, </em>Lucas App. No. L-01-1432, 2002-Ohio-3022, 2002 WL 1800997 at \u00b6 28. See, also, <em>Burkhart v. CNA Ins. Co., </em>5th Dist. No. 2001CA00265, 2002-Ohio-903, 2002 WL 316224 (holding that although specific individuals were named insureds under the Continental policies, that fact does not cure the ambiguity created when \u201cyou\u201d refers to the corporation as the named insured). <em>Hall v. Kemper Ins. Co., </em>Pickaway App. No. 02CA17, 2003-Ohio-5457, 2003 WL 22336027, at \u00b6 50. The inclusion of the word \u201cYou\u201d in the UM section of the auto policy in this case remains ambiguous. Accordingly, under the authority of <em>Scott-Pontzer, </em>Renee meets the first requirement in the analysis of an insured under Fidelity\u2019s auto policy. The next question is whether the decision in <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, affects Renee\u2019s status as an insured under the auto policy. In <em>Galatis, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court limited <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>and reversed its prior decision in <em>Ezawa v. Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. of Am. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 557, 715 N.E.2d 1142. <em>Galatis </em>holds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">2. Absent specific language to the contrary, a policy of insurance that names a corporation as an insured for uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage covers a loss sustained by an employee of the corporation only if the loss occurs within the course and scope of employment. <em>(King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>[1988], 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, applied; <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>[1999], 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116, limited.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">3. Where a policy of insurance designates a corporation as a named insured, the designation of \u201cfamily members\u201d of the named insured as other insureds does not extend insurance coverage to a family member of an employee of the corporation, unless that employee is also a named insured. <em>(Ezawa v. Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. of Am. </em>[1999], 86 Ohio St.3d 557, 715 N.E.2d 1142, overruled.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Id., syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">{\u00b6 12} In order for Renee to remain an insured under the auto policy and <em>Galatis, </em>she must also show that when the accident occurred, she was an employee acting within the course and scope of her employment with Sarcom.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>{\u00b6 13} The parties disagree about whether Renee was an employee or an independent contractor at the time of the accident. Plaintiff concedes that she would not be an insured under Fidelity\u2019s policy if she were an independent contractor when the accident occurred. Even if this court construes the evidence most strongly in favor of Renee and finds that she was an employee when the collision occurred, she would still have to show she was acting within the scope of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">{\u00b6 14} Whether employees are acting within the scope of their employment is a question of fact to be decided by the jury. <em>Posin v. A.B.C. Motor Court Hotel </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 271, 74 O.O.2d 427, 344 N.E.2d 334. Only when reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion does the issue regarding scope of employment become a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">{If 15} It is undisputed that Renee was on her way to work for Sarcom when the accident occurred. An employee \u201cdriving to work at a fixed place of employment,\u201d however, is not acting in the course of her employment. <em>Boch v. New York Life Ins. Co. </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 458, 26 O.O.2d 47, 196 N.E.2d 90, at paragraph two of the syllabus. There is an exception to this general rule that requires evidence of \u201cspecial benefit to the master other than the making of the servant\u2019s services available to the master at the place where they are needed.\u201d Id.; <em>Butler v. Baker </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 143, 628 N.E.2d 98; <em>Faber v. Metalweld, Inc. </em>(1992), 89 Ohio App.3d 794, 627 N.E.2d 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">{\u00b6 16} There is no evidence that Renee falls under this exception. The rule of law on traveling to and from a fixed place of work applies to cases in the context of uninsured-motorist coverage,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> respondeat superior,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and workers\u2019 compensation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Renee was on her way to work when she was injured; therefore, she is not an insured under Fidelity\u2019s policy and is not entitled to uninsured coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">{\u00b6 17} Because Renee does not qualify as an insured under Fidelity\u2019s policy, we do not address her remaining argument that she and Austin were in a \u201ccovered auto\u201d at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">FIDELITY\u2019S COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">{\u00b6 18} The next question is whether plaintiffs are entitled to UM coverage under Fidelity\u2019s Commercial General Liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) policy. The relevant section of Fidelity\u2019s CGL policy includes the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE FORM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\">* * * Throughout this policy the words \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">* :|: *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">COVERAGE A \u2014 BODILY INJURY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">This insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">Aircraft, Auto or Watercraft</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">* * * This exclusion does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">Parking an \u201cauto\u201d on, or on the ways next to, premises you own or rent, provided the \u201cauto\u201d in not owned or rented or loaned to you or the insured;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">{\u00b6 19} Plaintiffs argue that the parking provision converts the policy into one that includes motor vehicle liability coverage and that is therefore subject to R.C. 3937.18, thus requiring Fidelity to include UM coverage. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">{\u00b6 20} This court has construed this provision several times and has consistently held that this one provision does not convert what is otherwise a nonmotorvehicle insurance policy into a motor-vehicle insurance policy. See <em>McCullar v. Barth Indus. Co., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82354, 2003-Ohio-4194, 2003 WL 21805803; <em>Ribeiro v. John Doe Ins. Cos., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81396, 2003-Ohio-433, 2003 WL 194878; <em>Mazzocki v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81274, 2003-Ohio-745, 2003 WL 360931; <em>Lee-Lipstreu v. Chubb Group of Ins. Cos. </em>(C.A.6, 2003), 329 F.3d 898; see, also, <em>Szekeres v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>Licking App. No. 02CA00004, 2002-Ohio-5989, 2002 WL 31439821.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">{\u00b6 21} Because Fidelity\u2019s CGL policy is not a motor-vehicle policy, Renee is not entitled to UM coverage under it. As pointed out by Fidelity, however, the CGL policy does expressly offer coverage to employees \u201cwithin the scope of their employment * * * or while performing duties related to the conduct of your business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">{\u00b6 22} Because she has failed to show she was within the scope of employment, Renee still would not qualify for coverage even if the CGL were a motor-vehicle policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>FIDELITY\u2019S COMMERCIAL UMBRELLA POLICY ISSUED TO SARCOM</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">{\u00b6 23} Fidelity\u2019s Commercial Umbrella Liability policy<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> also includes a \u201cscope of employment\u201d provision. We have already determined that Renee is not an insured under the express language of the Business Auto or the CGL policy because she was not within the scope of her employment when the accident occurred. Accordingly, we conclude that Renee does not qualify as an insured under Fidelity\u2019s umbrella policy, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">{\u00b6 24} From the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to Fidelity as a matter of law. Further, the court did not err in denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">{\u00b6 25} Plaintiffs sole assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b746-8\">James J. Sweeney, P.J., and Kenneth A. Rocco, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-15\">.

On March 28, 2002, the case was remanded to the court of common pleas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-11\">.
