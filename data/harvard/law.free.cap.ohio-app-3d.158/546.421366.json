Christley, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, LCP Holding Company, appeals from a judgment of the Portage County Court of Common Pleas that denied its request for a preliminary injunction against appellee, David M. Taylor. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant is a corporation that engages in the manufacture and sale of commercial truck equipment. Appellee was formerly employed by appellant and worked in various managerial sales positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">{\u00b6 3} Appellee began his employment with Great Lakes Truck Equipment in 1977. At that time, he was employed as a driver of commercial trucks. Soon thereafter, Great Lakes Truck Equipment became America\u2019s Body Company (\u201cABC\u201d), and appellee transitioned into a sales position.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">{\u00b6 4} Subsequently, appellee\u2019s responsibilities began to increase and expand to areas outside of Northeast Ohio. From 1991 until 1998, appellee acted as Vice President of Sales and Vice President and General Manager of ABC. In 1998, appellee was promoted to Vice President of National Dealer Sales. In this position, appellee\u2019s sales territory included the entire United States, excluding those areas where an ABC division was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">{\u00b6 5} In 1998, ABC\u2019s former owner sold the company to appellant. As part of the sale, certain employees, including appellee, were given the opportunity to purchase shares of appellant\u2019s stock. Appellee purchased appellant\u2019s stock and, in doing so, executed a standard Security Holders\u2019 Agreement. The agreement contained a noncompetition provision, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-11\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cEach Employed Security Holder acknowledges and agrees that * * * during the period Employed Security Holder is employed by the Company and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, he will not, except in furtherance of his employment with the Company, either directly or indirectly (a) solicit business from, or compete with the Company for the business of any customer of the Company or (b) operate, control, advise, be engaged by, perform any consulting services for, invest in (other than less than one percent of the outstanding stock in a publicly held corporation which is traded over-the-counter or on a recognized securities exchange) or otherwise become associated in any capacity with, any business, company, partnership, organization, proprietorship, or other entity'who or which manufactures, sells or distributes products in competition with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>business of the Company in those geographical areas in which the Company conducts or has conducted such business during the Employment Period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">{\u00b6 7} The agreement also included a nondisclosure provision, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cEach Employed Security Holder agrees at all times to hold as secret and confidential * * * any and all knowledge, information, developments, manufacturing and trade secrets, know-how and confidences of the Company or its business of which he has knowledge as of the date hereof, or of which he may acquire knowledge during the Employment Period, to the extent such matters have not previously been made public (\u2018Confidential Information\u2019). The phrase \u2018made public\u2019 as used in this Agreement shall apply to matters within the domain of (a) the general public or (b) the Company\u2019s industry. Each Employed Security Holder agrees not to use such knowledge for his own benefit or for the benefit of others or, except as provided above, disclose any of such Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall make express reference to this Agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">{\u00b6 9} Moreover, the agreement contained a noninterference provision that stated, \u201cEach Employed Security Holder agrees that during * * * employment * * * and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, he will not * * * directly or indirectly solicit, induce or attempt to solicit or induce any employee, agent or other representative or associate of the Company to terminate its relationship with the Company or in any way interfere with such a relationship or a relationship between the Company and any of its suppliers or distributors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">{\u00b6 10} In November 2002, appellee, as part of a divorce settlement, transferred his shares of appellant\u2019s stock to his minor children. The stock was simultaneously placed in a trust for the benefit of his children. Subsequently, on or about November 15, 2002, appellee resigned from his employment with appellant. Shortly thereafter, appellee was employed by Supreme Corporation (\u201cSupreme\u201d). Supreme is engaged in essentially the same business as appellant and is a direct competitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">{\u00b6 11} On March 7, 2003, appellant filed a verified complaint for injunctive relief and money damages. The complaint alleged that appellee had breached the agreement and, therefore, that appellant was entitled to a preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, appellant alleged that based upon appellee\u2019s employment with Supreme and his \u201ccalling on, selling to, or providing services to current, former or potential customers of [appellant] subsequent to his leaving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>employment with [appellant] within that same geographic area, [appellee had] breached the terms of the Agreement, including the noncompetition, nondisclosure, and noninterference provisions thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">{\u00b6 12} A hearing on the complaint\u2019s request for injunctive relief commenced on March 27, 2003. Following the hearing, the trial court issued a judgment entry denying appellant\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction. The court made the following determinations: (1) appellant and Supreme are competitors and do business throughout the United States; (2) appellant\u2019s and Supreme\u2019s pricing of products varies between buyer dealerships, but such pricing is \u201cwidely known throughout the industry as the dealerships will play off against each company to get the best deal possible for themselves\u201d; (3) \u201c[t]he existence of accounts are basically that each company can go to the phone book and look up auto dealers and call on them to see if they can sell their product\u201d; and (4) appellee, through a divorce decree, has placed his shares of appellant\u2019s stock in trust for his children; thus, he is no longer a shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">{\u00b6 13} Based upon these determinations, the court concluded that the noncom-petition provision was overly broad because it had no geographical limits and it prohibited appellee from working for two years in the only field he knows. The court farther determined that because appellee was no longer a shareholder, appellant had no legitimate business interest to protect. Accordingly, the trial court denied appellant a preliminary injunction that would forbid appellee\u2019s employment with Supreme. Furthermore, the court noted that because its \u201cjudgment will affect a substantial right of Plaintiff, * * * this is a final appealable order, and there is no just reason for delay of appeal of this entry of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">{\u00b6 14} From this judgment, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal and now sets forth the following assignment of error for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of Plaintiff-Appellant in denying its Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">{\u00b6 16} Under its sole assignment of error, appellant presents the following three separate issues for our review: (1) whether the trial court erred in deciding that the noncompetition provision was overly broad, (2) whether the trial court erred by refusing to exercise its power to modify the agreement\u2019s noncompetition, nonsolicitation, and nondisclosure provisions, and (3) whether the trial court erred in determining that appellee\u2019s transfer of his shares relieved him of his obligations under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">{\u00b6 17} We must first determine whether the court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief was a final appealable order. It is well established that the determination as to whether an appeal is immediately appealable is a threshold issue that must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>be resolved, conceptually at least, before the determination of the appeal on its merits. <em>Premier Health Care Services, Inc. v. Schneiderman </em>(Aug. 21, 2001), 2nd Dist. No. 18795, 2001 WL 1479241, at * 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">{\u00b6 18} Ordinarily, an order issuing or denying a preliminary injunction is not a final appealable order. <em>Hemberger v. LaBrae Bd. of Edn. </em>(Dec. 5, 1997), 11th Dist. No. 96-T-5567, 1997 WL 772939. However, an order denying a request for a preliminary injunction will be considered a final order if it meets the requirements of the two-prong test established by R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 2505.02 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(B) An order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(4) An order that grants or denies a provisional remedy and to which both of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(a) The order in effect determines the action with respect to the provisional remedy and prevents a judgment in the action in favor of the appealing party with respect to the provisional remedy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(b) The appealing party would not be afforded a meaningful or effective remedy by an appeal following final judgment as to all proceedings, issues, claims, and parties in the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">{\u00b6 25} A \u201cprovisional remedy\u201d is defined as \u201ca proceeding ancillary to an action\u201d and expressly includes an order for a preliminary injunction. R.C. 2505.02(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">{\u00b6 26} The first prong of the test has been satisfied, as the court has issued an order determining the action with respect to the provisional remedy of a preliminary injunction, and this order prevents a judgment in favor of appellant with regard to the preliminary injunction. Accordingly, we will now examine the second prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">{\u00b627} The second prong of the test requires a determination as to whether the court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s preliminary injunction precludes a meaningful or effective remedy via appeal, following a final judgment as to all the claims in the action. R.C. 2505.02(B)(4)(b). In deciding this question, we \u201cdo not construe R.C. 2505.02(B)(4)(b) to require the absence of every theoretical remedy in order to find that appellant would be denied a \u2018meaningful\u2019 or \u2018effective\u2019 remedy following final judgment. This is particularly so when * * * the court will be unable to fashion a remedy which would replace a potential loss of business * * *, or repair business relationships with third parties.\u201d <em>Bob Krih</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>wan Pontiac-GMC Truck, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(2001), 141 Ohio App.3d 777, 781, 753 N.E.2d 864. See, also, <em>Premier Health Care Services, Inc. </em>at * 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">{\u00b6 28} Here, appellant\u2019s complaint stated claims for both monetary damages and injunctive relief. Appellant\u2019s claim for injunctive relief centered upon the theory that without a preliminary injunction, it will lose market share, be forced to compete with a former employee, and be subject to the possible dissemination of trade secrets. Accordingly, a reversal following a final judgment would not remedy those damages arising from the foregoing during the time the injunction would have been in effect. See, e.g., <em>Premier Health Care Services, Inc. </em>\u201cThe appellant would essentially be deprived of a remedy because the passage of time would render moot any review sought.\u201d Id., at * 3, citing <em>Penko v. Eastlake </em>(Dec. 11, 1998), 11th Dist. No. 98-L-186, 1998 WL 1145267. Thus, the court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s preliminary injunction was a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ_\">{\u00b6 29} We will now examine the merits of appellant\u2019s assignment of error. Although the trial court failed to specifically mention either the noninterference provision or the nondisclosure provision, the court\u2019s determination that appellee was no longer a shareholder disposed of all three relevant provisions of the agreement. After careful examination of the record before us, we agree with the trial court that the noncompetition, noninterference, and nondisclosure provisions were not applicable, because appellee was not a shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s decision to grant injunctive relief only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Meade v. Beverly Enterprises-Ohio, Inc., </em>154 Ohio App.3d 521, 2003-Ohio-5231, 797 N.E.2d 1040, at \u00b6 11. \u201cAbuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than a mere error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude was arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">{\u00b6 31} The trial court may consider the following factors when determining whether injunctive relief is appropriate:</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(1) [T]he likelihood of the plaintiffs success on the merits, (2) whether there exists an adequate remedy at law, (3) whether the injunction would prevent irreparable harm, (4) a balancing of the potential injury to the defendant and the general public, and (5) whether the injunctive relief sought is for the purpose of maintaining the status quo pending a trial on the merits.\u201d <em>Rein Constr. Co. v. Trumbull Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 622, 630-631, 741 N.E.2d 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">{\u00b6 33} In an action for a temporary or permanent injunction, the plaintiff must prove his or her case by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Franklin Cty. Bd. of Health v. Paxson, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 193, 2003-Ohio-1331, 787 N.E.2d 59, at \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>{\u00b6 34} That being said, \u201c[i]n construing any written instrument, the primary and paramount objective is to ascertain the intent of the parties.\u201d <em>Aultman Hosp. Assn. v. Hosp. Care Corp. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 51, 53, 544 N.E.2d 920. When the language of the written instrument is clear and unambiguous, the interpretation of the instrument is a matter of law, and the court must determine the intent of the parties through the language employed. <em>Seminatore v. Med. Mut. of Ohio </em>(2000), 136 Ohio App.3d 758, 763, 737 N.E.2d 1016. \u201cA court must give effect to the contract\u2019s express terms in determining the rights and obligations of the parties and cannot, in effect, create a new contract by finding an intent not expressed in the clear language used by the parties.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">{\u00b6 35} The unambiguous language of the noncompetition, noninterference, and nondisclosure provisions clearly limits their application to an \u201cEmployed Security Holder.\u201d In its definition section, the agreement defines \u201cEmployed Security Holder\u201d as \u201can individual Security Holder.\u201d Under the agreement, a \u201cSecurity Holder\u201d is a \u201cShareholder.\u201d Finally, \u201cShareholder\u201d is defined as \u201ceach registered holder of issued and outstanding Shares, each other Person who becomes bound by this Agreement as a Shareholder after the date hereof, and any executor, administrator, guardian, custodian, trustee, receiver, or other legal representative of a Person who obtains legal or beneficial ownership of any Shares and the ability to transfer the same in the event of another\u2019s death, Disability or other incapacity; <em>provided, in any event, that a Person who no longer owns any Shares shall be deemed not to be a \u2018Shareholder.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">{\u00b6 36} During the hearing on appellant\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction, appellee gave the following testimony on direct-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cQ: Do you still own the stock?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cA: No I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cQ: And why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cA: I had a lengthy divorce that took over a couple of years. It was all, the value of the stock, my wife wanted full value that was paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-11\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cQ: Is that your ex-wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-12\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cA: My ex-wife, correct. And the only way the settlement could be made was to transfer the stock into my three children\u2019s names equally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-13\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cQ: When was that transfer accomplished?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-14\">(\u00b6 44} \u201cA: I signed the shares of stock along with the legal department. I believe it was November 13th or November 14th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-15\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cQ: And was this stock transfer approved by the board of LCP holding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>{\u00b6 46} \u201cA: Yes, it was. And that took some time to occur, but yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cQ: As we sit here today do you have any control whatsoever over the stock that you have just testified about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cA: No, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cQ: I believe you testified that the stock is currently in a trust?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cA: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cQ: And I take it you are not the trustee of the trust?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cA: No, I am not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">{\u00b6 53} The foregoing shows appellee\u2019s relinquishment of any ownership interest in the stock, resulting from his gift to, and transfer of, the shares to his three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">{\u00b6 54} An appropriate transfer of a security requires delivery. See, e.g., R.C. 1308.27; U.C.C. 8-301. Here, delivery occurred when appellee surrendered possession of the stock and endorsed the stock to his children as owners. R.C. 1308.27. Thus, appellee\u2019s children became the registered holders of appellant\u2019s stock. Because appellee\u2019s children became the sole registered holders of appellee\u2019s shares of stock, appellee was no longer a shareholder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">{\u00b6 55} Likewise, appellant\u2019s transfer of the stock to a trust also confirmed that he was not a shareholder. When a trust is created the settlor must transfer and deliver the property to a trustee. See, e.g., <em>Nozik v. McDonald </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 353, 650 N.E.2d 923. Delivery necessitates the settlor\u2019s \u201crelinquishment of ownership, dominion and control over [the property].\u201d <em>Bolles v. Toledo Trust Co. </em>(1936), 132 Ohio St. 21, 27, 7 O.O. 60, 4 N.E.2d 917. Thus, appellant\u2019s transfer and delivery of the stock to a trust to be held by a trustee relinquished his ownership, dominion, and control over the stock. For this additional reason, appellant was not a \u201cshareholder\u201d as defined by the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">{\u00b6 56} Appellant failed to provide any evidence that would contradict the testimony that established appellee\u2019s transfer and delivery of his shares of stock to his three children and the subsequent placement of those shares in a valid trust. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that appellee was no longer a shareholder of appellant\u2019s stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">{\u00b6 57} Nevertheless, appellant argues that despite appellee\u2019s transfer of ownership, the trial court erred in refusing to grant a preliminary injunction. Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>cally, appellant argues that the language of the agreement clearly shows the parties\u2019 intent to apply the noncompetition, noninterference, and nondisclosure provisions to a <em>former </em>shareholder. In support of its contention, appellant points to section 2.7 of the agreement, which sets forth terms allowing security holders to transfer shares to their children, or to create a trust for the benefit of their children. Appellant argues that section 2.7 demonstrates the parties\u2019 intent \u201cto bind Appellee to postemployment covenants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">{\u00b6 58} As mentioned previously, the pertinent language of the agreement is clear and unambiguous. The noncompetition, noninterference, and nondisclosure provisions pertain exclusively to an \u201cEmployed Security Holder.\u201d The agreement then excludes any individual who does not own appellant\u2019s stock from being an \u201cEmployed Security Holder.\u201d Absent is any language establishing that an \u201cEmployed Security Holder\u201d is bound by the terms of the agreement when the \u201cEmployed Security Holder\u201d is no longer a shareholder of appellant\u2019s stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">{\u00b6 59} Moreover, section 2.7, when read in its complete context, merely provides an exception to the agreement\u2019s general prohibition against the transfer of stock, as stated in section 2.1. In other words, the sole purpose of section 2.7 simply fails to show the parties\u2019 intent to bind appellee to postemployment covenants. Thus, this portion of appellant\u2019s assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">{\u00b6 60} Appellant\u2019s assignment of error further argues that the trial court erred by failing to modify the restrictive covenants of the agreement to protect its legitimate business interests. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">{\u00b6 61} Although a trial court may modify an unreasonable restrictive covenant to make it reasonable and enforceable, it is not required to do so. <em>Professional Investigations &amp; Consulting Agency, Inc. v. Kingsland </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 753, 761, 591 N.E.2d 1265, (holding that modification of an unreasonable restrictive covenant is within the discretion of the trial court). Because the decision to modify the noncompetition, noninterference, and nondisclosure provisions was within the trial court\u2019s discretion, the court did not abuse its discretion by declining to modify the restrictive covenants. The modifications requested by appellant would entail substantial changes to the agreement. Thus, this portion of appellant\u2019s assignment of error is also not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">{\u00b6 62} Based upon the foregoing analysis, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is without merit. The terms of the noncompetition, nondisclosure, and noninterference provisions of the agreement were not applicable to appellant as he was not a shareholder. Accordingly, we hereby affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b598-11\">William M. O\u2019Neill and Diane V.
