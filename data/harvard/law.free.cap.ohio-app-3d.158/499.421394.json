Rocco, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b542-18\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant New World Communications of Ohio, Inc. (\u201cNew World\u201d) appeals a common pleas court order awarding it attorney fees in the amount of $2,000. Appellant asserts that the court should have awarded it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>$27,164.50. The common pleas court did not abuse its discretion by awarding appellant $2000 in fees. Therefore, we affirm the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In June and July 2000, plaintiffs Donna, Cliff, and Christopher Stohlmann filed complaints alleging that the defendants had made false and defamatory statements about them. It appears that the parties litigated claims maintained in an amended complaint that was never filed with the court, although it was served upon opposing counsel. In an order entered June 5, 2002, the court deemed the amended complaint, which it said had been mailed to the defendants on September 29, 2001,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to have been filed with the clerk on that same date, but no copy was ever included in the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">{\u00b6 3} Defendant-appellant New World claimed to have been improperly identified in the amended complaint as WJW-TV8. It filed a motion to dismiss some of plaintiffs\u2019 claims against it. Specifically, New World argued that the court should dismiss all claims made more than one year after the allegedly defamatory publications. The complaint alleged that New World made three defamatory statements in March and June 1998; New World contended that claims relating to these statements were time-barred. In addition, New World argued that another allegedly defamatory statement was true as a matter of law. The court granted New World\u2019s motion on November 20, 2000, stating that \u201cparagraph 105 of the amended complaint is stricken.\u201d The court subsequently held that \u201cparagraph 105 is deemed to have been only partially dismissed as to the issues raised in New World\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d As a result, two alleged defamatory statements remained at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 4} New World answered then filed a motion for summary judgment on March 5, 2002. The court granted this motion in part on August 22, 2002. It found that one of the two statements was subject to an innocent construction and therefore was not defamatory as a matter of law. However, the court found sufficient evidence to submit to a jury Donna Stohlmann\u2019s defamation claim concerning a news report by New World about the substance of a criminal charge to which Stohlmann pleaded guilty. The court explained the basis for this ruling more fully in an order denying New World\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">{\u00b6 5} The case was set for trial on February 24, 2003. Just a few days before the scheduled trial, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her complaint, without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>{\u00b6 6} New World then moved the court to impose sanctions upon plaintiffs and their counsel for \u201cfrivolous conduct\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2323.51. The court held a hearing on this motion then granted the motion in part and denied it in part. It found that a reasonable attorney should have recognized that the claims that were dismissed were not actionable. However, the court found no evidence that the plaintiffs themselves intended to harass or maliciously injure New World. It therefore concluded that the sanctions should be levied against plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, not plaintiffs. The court found no other frivolous conduct in this litigation. The court ordered New World Communications to submit a statement of reasonable costs and fees for the preparation and filing of the motion to dismiss and for seeking sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 7} New World responded to this order with a \u201cStatement of Fees and Expenses\u201d based upon billing statements that were allegedly introduced by an attorney-witness at the hearing on the motion for sanctions; these billing statements have not been included in the record, apparently at New World\u2019s request.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Statement of Fees and Expenses concluded that New World had incurred $11,665.50 in attorney fees plus $24 in expenses on the motion to dismiss, and an additional $15,475 for attorney fees on the motion for sanctions, for a total of $27,164.50. The court determined that New World had \u201cfailed to demonstrate with particularity how their claim for fees relates to services necessary to the aspect of the motion to dismiss for which judgment was granted, or why the amounts charged were reasonable.\u201d However, the court awarded New World attorney fees of $2,000 against plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, because plaintiffs conceded that $2,000 was a reasonable fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 8} New World now argues that the court abused its discretion by awarding fees of only $2,000 as sanctions against plaintiffs\u2019 counsel pursuant to R.C. 2323.51. \u201cWhile we recognize that the frivolous conduct statute provides for an award of attorney\u2019s fees as the lone remedy for those \u2018adversely affected\u2019 by such conduct, we reject the notion that a party is necessarily or -presumptively \u2018adversely affected\u2019 based <em>solely </em>upon the fundamental necessity to expend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees to defend a lawsuit in general. Where a determination has been made that * * * a certain claim or claims, or a defense or defenses asserted in a civil action were frivolous, the party seeking R.C. 2323.51 attorney\u2019s fees must affirmatively demonstrate that he or she incurred additional attorney\u2019s fees as a direct, identifiable result of defending the frivolous conduct in particular.\u201d <em>Wiltberger v. Davis </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 46, 54, 673 N.E.2d 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 9} Even though much of its brief is devoted to an explanation of how the entire prosecution of this case was frivolous, New World does not challenge the common pleas court\u2019s decision that the only frivolous conduct in this case occurred when plaintiffs\u2019 counsel filed claims that were not warranted by existing law and that were dismissed on New World\u2019s motion. This conduct sets the parameters for the court\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 10} The common pleas court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that New World had failed to demonstrate that this frivolous conduct caused it to incur all of the fees it claimed it incurred for preparation of the motion to dismiss. First, the statement of fees<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> includes more than two pages of items that predate the amended complaint in which New World was allegedly named. The total of these items- \u2014 -which cannot possibly relate to the motion to dismiss filed on New World\u2019s behalf \u2014 exceeds $3600 and includes charges for motions prepared for another defendant<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and charges relating to a proposed motion for a more definite statement and analysis of \u201ccounterclaim issues\u201d that were never filed on New World\u2019s behalf and had nothing to do with the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 11} There are $1,279 in charges for various attorneys\u2019 review and analysis of the amended complaint between October 2 and 25, 2000; the purpose of this review is not directly related to the dismissal motion. Another $266 in charges for conferences concerning plaintiffs\u2019 request for an extension of time to respond to the motion to dismiss, and for review of the court\u2019s ruling, also were not clearly incurred in defending against the claims that were found to be frivolous. Nearly $900 of the requested fees relate to the transcription of certain broadcasts. This service cannot be characterized as an attorney\u2019s fee. Based upon our own review of New-World\u2019s statement of fees, we agree with the common pleas court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>New World failed to show that the fees and other amounts it sought were \u201ca direct, identifiable result of defending the frivolous conduct in particular.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">{\u00b6 12} The issues upon which New World sought to dismiss some of the claims against it were hardly novel. The statute-of-limitations defense for defamation claims is clear and well defined; this aspect of its motion to dismiss did not require extensive research. Nor was the truth defense based upon the plaintiffs guilty plea in a criminal proceeding a particularly challenging issue. Consequently, we find it difficult to justify the $969 in fees for preliminary memoranda and more than $4,500 in fees charged by four different attorneys to draft, review, and revise this simple eight-page motion. We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that a $2,000 fee for this motion was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 13} New World further asserts that it was entitled to an award of fees for its prosecution of the motion for sanctions. Although a court has the discretion to award fees incurred in prosecuting a motion for sanctions, there is no requirement that the court include such fees in its award under R.C. 2323.51. See <em>Ron Scheiderer &amp; Assoc, v. London </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 94, 689 N.E.2d 552. The court\u2019s request for evidence of these fees is not the equivalent of having allowed New World to recover for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-8\">Frank D. Celebrezze, Jr., J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b546-9\">Michael J. Corrigan, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-10\">. The June 2002 order refers to an amended complaint mailed September 29, 2001. However, the pleadings and motions relating to the amended complaint that were filed beginning in October 2000 suggest that the amended complaint was actually mailed sometime in September 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b544-8\">. {\u00b6 a} At the hearing, New World\u2019s attorney posed the following request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">{\u00b6 b} MR. CLAY: Your Honor, before I forget, we would ask that Defendant's Exhibits 2 [a \"summary of adverse effects\u201d of this litigation on New World] and 3 [attorney billing records] be designated confidential and placed under seal by the Court and not included in the public record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">{\u00b6 c} THE COURT: That's all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-11\">{\u00b6 d} MR. CLAY: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-12\">{\u00b6 e} THE COURT: You make sure they are handled in that way because I\u2019m not going to do anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-13\">{\u00b6 f} MR. CLAY: Fine, Judge.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\">. There is no way to determine whether the charges included on the statement of fees correspond to charges actually made to New World by their counsel. The billing records were not offered or admitted into evidence at the hearing on the motion for sanctions, and were not included in the record of this case, apparently at New World\u2019s request. There was also no affidavit accompanying the statement of fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\">. Fox Broadcasting, d.b.a. WTW-TV, Inc., was named in the original complaint. The claims against this defendant were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice in October 2000. One item in the statement of fees is a $280 charge to \u201ccomplete draft of Motion to Strike of Fox Broadcasting and Motion to Dismiss of WJW Television.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b546-10\">Michael J. Corrigan, Administrative Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AJqq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">{\u00b6 14} I respectfully dissent from the majority and would reverse the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees of $2,000 to New World in connection with its successful motions to dismiss and for sanctions. There is no evidentiary correlation between the attorney fees New World presented at the hearing, which amounted to $27,164.50, and the $2,000 the trial court awarded. Because the trial court acted arbitrarily and abused its discretion, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s whimsical award of $2,000.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
