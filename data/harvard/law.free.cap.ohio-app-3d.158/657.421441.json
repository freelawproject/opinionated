Painter, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b700-16\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant Jayson Levine appeals his conviction for speeding in violation of Cincinnati Municipal Code 506-8. We reverse the conviction and discharge Levine.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-17\">{\u00b6 2} Levine was driving on the West Sixth Street viaduct in Hamilton County in February 2004. Cincinnati Police Specialist Al Gober witnessed Levine traveling faster than another car. He then used an LTI 20-20 laser device to determine that Levine was traveling at 69 miles per hour. The posted speed limit was 50 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Gober had checked the laser unit\u2019s calibration earlier that morning, including performing four different calibration tests. The laser unit passed all of these tests. But the city did not offer any expert testimony concerning the accuracy and dependability of the LTI 20-20 laser device.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">{\u00b6 4} At trial, Levine objected to the introduction of Gober\u2019s laser-device testimony, claiming that the prosecution had not laid a proper foundation to establish the device\u2019s accuracy. But the trial court accepted Gober\u2019s testimony about the laser unit anyway. The trial court then found Levine guilty and fined him the court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">{\u00b6 5} On appeal, Levine assigns four errors: (1) the trial court erred by taking judicial notice of the accuracy and dependability of the laser device, (2) the acceptance of the laser-device testimony deprived Levine of his due-process and confrontation-of-witnesses rights, (3) not all the elements of the offense were proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and (4) the trial court should have granted Levine\u2019s motion for acquittal. Because the first and fourth assignments are dispositive, we need not address the other two.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">\n<em>I. The LTI 20-20 Device and Judicial Notice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">{\u00b6 6} Levine\u2019s first assignment is that the trial court should not have taken judicial notice of the accuracy and dependability of the LTI 20-20 laser device. The trial court claimed that this was not a matter of judicial notice, but merely a matter of evidence. The trial court was mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cA judicially noticed fact must not be one subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably] be questioned.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">{\u00b6 8} The scientific reliability of a laser device is the type of fact that a trial court may judicially notice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And LTI 20-20 devices have been afforded such judicial notice in several jurisdictions in Ohio.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the fact that a court has taken judicial notice in one jurisdiction cannot serve as the basis for taking judicial notice in another jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>{\u00b6 9} In <em>State v. </em>Doles,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Tenth Appellate District reversed the defendant\u2019s speeding conviction where the trial court could not have judicially recognized the scientific reliability of a K-55 radar unit. The court held that where there was no testimony concerning the construction and method of operation of a speed-measuring device not the subject of judicial notice, the testimony that the officer used the device properly was insufficient to sustain a conviction for speeding. The court also noted that in order for judicial notice to be taken, the fact must be one of common knowledge throughout the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 10} Establishing the reliability of a speed-measuring device can be accomplished for future cases by (1) a reported municipal court decision,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) a reported or unreported case from the appellate court,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or (3) the previous consideration of expert testimony about a specific device where the trial court notes it on the record.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">{\u00b6 11} None of those verifying criteria are present here. In fact, the trial court suggested that it was merely a matter of the introduction of evidence. We can find no case \u2014 municipal or otherwise \u2014 from this jurisdiction that even mentions the LTI 20-20 laser device. And the trial court did not mention that it was aware of the accuracy and dependability of the device because of any previous expert testimony that it had heard. Gober testified that he had performed the necessary calibration tests, but he did not and could not testify about the construction and accuracy of the entire class of LTI 20-20 devices. It was therefore improper for the trial court to admit his testimony about the LTI 20-20 and the reading that he obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">{\u00b6 12} This holding does not mean that the prosecution must present expert testimony every time it presents evidence from an LTI 20-20 (or any other) laser device. Rather, it merely means that the prosecution must do it at least once. And the trial court may then take judicial notice of the device\u2019s accuracy and dependability, as well as hear testimony concerning any reading obtained from the device.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">{\u00b6 13} But the city here took none of the necessary steps. Absent expert testimony, the trial court could not take judicial notice of the LTI 20-20\u2019s accuracy and dependability. Even though the trial court stated that it was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>simple matter of evidence, it was really a matter of judicial notice. And all of Gober\u2019s testimony concerning the LTI 20-20 was therefore inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 14} We therefore sustain Levine\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\n<em>II. The Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">{\u00b6 15} In his fourth assignment, Levine argues that the trial court erred in overruling his motion for a judgment of acquittal. Levine is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">{\u00b6 16} A motion for an acquittal may be granted if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction on the offense charged.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The standard for reviewing sufficiency is whether any rational trier of fact, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">{\u00b6 17} Cincinnati Municipal Code 506-8 prohibits any person from operating a motor vehicle \u201cat a greater speed or less than is reasonable or proper, having due regard to the traffic, surface and width of the street or highway and of any other conditions then existing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">{\u00b6 18} Gober was the only person to testify at trial. He testified that he witnessed Levine driving and that he \u201cappeared to be going faster than another vehicle on the street.\u201d Gober also stated that he believed Levine\u2019s speed was unreasonable and unacceptable. He stated that Levine\u2019s speed was unreasonable because 69 miles per hour was 19 miles per hour over the posted speed limit, because the viaduct was a heavily traveled roadway, and because the speed limit dropped to 35 miles per hour about a quarter mile past where he had first observed Levine. He also testified about the laser device\u2019s calibration and the 69-mile-per-hour reading. No other evidence was introduced. Levine then moved for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">{\u00b6 19} As we have already stated, any testimony concerning the reading from the laser device was inadmissible. It is conceivable that a police officer\u2019s observations may be the sole basis to sustain a finding of guilt for a speeding violation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But Gober\u2019s testimony that Levine\u2019s speed was unreasonable and unacceptable for the road conditions was based on inadmissible evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>{\u00b6 20} In a similar case, testimony that a defendant was traveling \u201cin excess\u201d of the posted speed limit, standing alone, was insufficient to sustain a conviction for speeding.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The only admissible testimony that remained here was Gober\u2019s statement that Levine \u201cappeared to be going faster than another vehicle on the street.\u201d Going faster than another car was not alone a violation of Cincinnati Municipal Code 506-8; Gober\u2019s testimony was insufficient to sustain a conviction. The trial court should have granted Levine\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b6 21} Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and discharge Levine.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Judgment reversed and appellant discharged.</p>\n<judges id=\"AnG\">Doan, P.J., and Hildebrandt, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-10\">.
