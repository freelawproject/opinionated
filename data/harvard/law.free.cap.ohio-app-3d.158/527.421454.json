Plaintiff-appellant, Ahsan Ahmed, appeals the decision of the Belmont County Common Pleas Court, Probate Division, that granted summary judgment to defendant-appellee, Ibtisam Tariq Ahmed. This was a declaratory judgment action regarding who was entitled to the life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>insurance proceeds of Ahsan and Ibtisam\u2019s mother, Lubaina Bhatti Ahmed. Ahsan argues that the life insurance proceeds must be placed in a constructive trust for the benefit of both children. Ibtisam argues that he is entitled to all the proceeds, since he is the sole contingent beneficiary listed under the policy. Neither party is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 2} Although Ibtisam would receive all the proceeds from the life insurance contract under Ohio law, federal law preempts Ohio law in this case, since the life insurance policy in question is an ERISA-related plan. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) preempts all state law \u201crelated to\u201d ERISA plans. Under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s most recent decision, ERISA preempts R.C. 2105.19, since plan administrators would otherwise be obliged to master the relevant laws of the 50 states and contend with litigation, thus undermining the goals of ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 3} Since ERISA preempts R.C. 2105.19, we must apply federal common law to determine who receives the proceeds. Federal common law states that Nawaz Ahmed, Lubaina\u2019s husband, cannot receive the proceeds, because he murdered Lubaina. The plain language of the contract does not allow the insurance company to give the insurance proceeds to the contingent beneficiary because the contingency, that the primary beneficiary predecease the insured, has not occurred. Accordingly, the proceeds at issue must go to Lubaina\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 4} At this point in the proceedings, it is unclear how Lubaina\u2019s estate would distribute the proceeds. Accordingly, we must reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">{\u00b6 5} Lubaina and Nawaz are the natural parents of Ibtisam and Ahsan. Lubaina was employed as a physician at the Ohio Valley Health Services and Education Corporation. As a benefit of that employment, Ohio Valley enrolled Lubaina in a life insurance policy. Before Ahsan was born, Lubaina designated Nawaz as her primary and secondary beneficiary and Ibtisam as the contingent beneficiary. After Ahsan\u2019s birth, Lubaina never designated Ahsan as a second contingent beneficiary to her life insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">{\u00b6 6} Under the policy, the contingent beneficiary would receive the proceeds from the contract if the primary beneficiary predeceased the insured. The policy also contained a general provision for distribution of the proceeds if there were no surviving beneficiaries at the time of Lubaina\u2019s death. The policy had no provision describing how the proceeds should be distributed if the primary beneficiary was alive at the time of Lubaina\u2019s death, but was not legally entitled to receive the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Tragically, Nawaz murdered Lubaina. He has since been sentenced to death for his crimes. The Belmont County Probate Court found that Nawaz was convicted of murdering Lubaina and, pursuant to R.C. 2105.19(A), declared that all property and insurance proceeds should be paid as if Nawaz predeceased Lubaina.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">{\u00b6 8} After her death, the company insuring Lubaina\u2019s life paid half of the benefits due under the policy to Ibtisam as the contingent beneficiary. It did not distribute the other half of the proceeds because of a dispute regarding whether Ahsan or Ibtisam was entitled to those benefits. Ahsan filed a complaint against Ibtisam, Lubaina\u2019s estate, and the insurance company, seeking a declaration that he was entitled to the remaining life insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 9} Subsequently, Ahsan moved for summary judgment, arguing that neither ERISA nor Ohio contract law governed the outcome of this case. According to Ahsan, R.C. 2105.19(B) required that the insurance proceeds be placed in a constructive trust for the benefit of both Ahsan and Ibtisam. Ibtisam filed his own motion for summary judgment, arguing that Nawaz never received the insurance proceeds, so R.C. 2105.19(A) rather than R.C. 2105.19(B) applied in this case. The trial court granted summary judgment to Ibtisam.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 10} In his sole assignment of error, Ahsan argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe probate court erred in awarding Ibtisam Tariq Ahmed the entire proceeds of the insurance policy at issue and thereby committed reversible error in refusing to order that a constructive trust be established for the benefit of both the decedent\u2019s children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b6 12} When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment, this court applies the same standard as the trial court and, therefore, engages in a de novo review. <em>Parenti v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 826, 829, 586 N.E.2d 1121. Under Civ.R. 56, summary judgment is proper only when the movant demonstrates that, viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmovant, reasonable minds must conclude that no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Doe v. Shaffer </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 388, 390, 738 N.E.2d 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">{\u00b6 13} In a motion for summary judgment, \u201cthe moving party bears the initial responsibility of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, and identifying those portions of the record which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact on a material element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 296, 662 N.E.2d 264. The nonmoving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>party has the reciprocal burden of specificity and cannot rest on mere allegations or denials in the pleadings. Id. at 293, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Slayer Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 14} In each of the arguments he makes in support of his assignment of error, Ahsan contends that Nawaz should receive the life insurance proceeds and that the proceeds should benefit both of the children in a constructive trust. He first argues that ERISA mandates that Nawaz receive the proceeds of the life insurance policy and that those proceeds should be placed in a constructive trust pursuant to R.C. 2105.19(B) for the benefit of both the children. Ahsan then argues that the Ohio Supreme Court does not allow a person to be treated as dead for the purposes of determining who benefits from a life insurance policy if that person is actually alive. So he again claims that Nawaz should receive the proceeds but that those proceeds should be placed in a constructive trust for the benefit of both the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 15} Under Ohio\u2019s common law, the beneficiary of a life insurance policy cannot be treated as legally dead as long as he is actually alive. <em>Neff v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1952), 158 Ohio St. 45, 48 O.O. 24, 107 N.E.2d 100, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cThe so-called doctrine of \u2018civil death\u2019 in this country is generally based upon statute and does not prevail in Ohio.\u201d Id. at 48-49, 48 O.O. 24, 107 N.E.2d 100. Accordingly, if the primary beneficiary of such a contract murders the insured, \u201c[t]he disposition of the proceeds of [the] life insurance policy is controlled by the terms of the policy relating to such matter.\u201d Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">{\u00b6 16} The legislature subsequently modified that common-law rule by enacting R.C. 2105.19, Ohio\u2019s \u201cslayer statute.\u201d That kind of statute prevents a murdering heir from receiving property because of the killing. See <em>Egelhoff v. Egelhoff </em>(2001), 532 U.S. 141, 152, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264. Under that statute, no one who is convicted of murder, aggravated murder, or voluntary manslaughter \u201cshall in any way benefit by the death.\u201d It continues, \u201cAll property of the decedent, and all money, insurance proceeds, or other property or benefits payable or distributable in respect of the decedent\u2019s death, shall pass or be paid or distributed as if the person who caused the death of the decedent had predeceased the decedent.\u201d R.C. 2105.19(A). If the murderer has benefited from the death, then he or she \u201cis a constructive trustee for the benefit of those entitled to any property or benefit that the person has obtained, or over which he has exerted control, because of the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d R.C. 2105.19(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">{\u00b6 17} Thus, under current Ohio law, we must treat Nawaz as if he predeceased Lubaina. If we were applying Ohio law, the proceeds would go to the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>beneficiary of the policy, Ibtisam. But we cannot apply Ohio law, since ERISA preempts the application of R.C. 2105.19 in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">ERISA</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">{\u00b6 18} The life insurance policy in this case is subject to ERISA, Section 1001 et seq., Title 29, U.S.Code. That act applies to \u201cany employee benefit plan if it is established or maintained\u201d by, among other things, \u201cany employer engaged in commerce,\u201d with certain exceptions that do not apply in this case. Section 1003(a)(1) and (b), Title 29, U.S.Code. Any plan, fund, or program that is established or maintained to provide death benefits to its participants or their beneficiaries \u201cthrough the purchase of insurance or otherwise\u201d is an employee-benefit plan. Section 1002(1) and (3). Since Lubaina\u2019s employer bought the life insurance policy for Lubaina as a benefit of her employment, it is an employee-benefit plan governed by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 19} ERISA allows a beneficiary to a plan, such as Ahsan, to bring a civil action \u201cto recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\u201d Section 1132(a)(1)(B). ERISA provides an exclusive federal cause of action for resolution of disputes filed under Section 1132(a)(1)(B). <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor </em>(1987), 481 U.S. 58, 62-63, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 95 L.Ed.2d 55. Nevertheless, state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over actions filed pursuant to Section 1132(a)(1)(B). Section 1132(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 20} Congress intended for ERISA to \u201cestablish pension plan regulation as exclusively a federal concern.\u201d <em>FMC Corp. v. Holliday </em>(1990), 498 U.S. 52, 64, 111 S.Ct. 403, 112 L.Ed.2d 356. With certain exceptions that do not apply in this case, ERISA\u2019s provisions \u201csupersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in Section 1003(a) of this title and not exempt under Section 1003(b) of this title.\u201d Section 1144(a). The phrase \u201crelate to\u201d is \u201cbroadly worded,\u201d and a law relates to an employee-benefit plan \u201cif it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u201d <em>Egelhoff, </em>532 U.S. at 146-147, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264; <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 85, 97, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 77 L.Ed.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">{\u00b6 21} New cases address whether slayer statutes such as R.C. 2105.19 are preempted by ERISA. This is fortunate \u201cfor the state of marital relations in America,\u201d since each case involving this discussion is a case \u201cof tragic proportions.\u201d <em>Admin. Comm. for H.E.B. Invest. &amp; Retirement Plan v. Harris </em>(E.D.Tex.2002), 217 F.Supp.2d 759, 761; <em>Addison v. Metro. Life Ins. Co. </em>(W.D.Va. 1998), 5 F.Supp.2d 392. But the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Egelhoff </em>leads us to conclude that ERISA preempts state slayer statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>{\u00b6 22} In <em>Egelhoff, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that ERISA preempts a statute that automatically revoked any designation of a spouse as a beneficiary of a nonprobate asset upon divorce to the extent that the statute applies to ERISA plans. Id., 532 U.S. at 143, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264. It recognized that its decision might affect whether slayer statutes are preempted by ERISA, but it refused to answer that question at that time. Id. at 152, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264. But given the court\u2019s rationale, we cannot distinguish slayer statutes from the statute at issue in <em>Egelhoff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Egelhoff, </em>the parties were married, the husband\u2019s employer provided him with a life insurance policy, and he designated his wife as the beneficiary under the policy. The two then divorced, but the wife remained the listed beneficiary on the policy. Two months after the divorce, the husband died. Washington law provided that if a marriage was dissolved, then any designation prior to the divorce of the former spouse as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy was automatically revoked unless the parties specifically stated otherwise. The husband\u2019s statutory heirs argued that they were entitled to the proceeds from the life insurance policy. His former wife argued that this statute was preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 24} The court began its analysis by noting that courts must \u201c \u2018look both to \u201cthe objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive,\u201d as well as to the nature of the effect of the state law on ERISA plans\u2019 \u201d when determining whether a statute \u201crelates to\u201d an ERISA plan. Id., 532 U.S. at 147, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264, quoting <em>California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N.A., Inc. </em>(1997), 519 U.S. 316, 325, 117 S.Ct. 832, 136 L.Ed.2d 791. (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe statute binds ERISA plan administrators to a particular choice of rules for determining beneficiary status. The administrators must pay benefits to the beneficiaries chosen by state law, rather than those identified in the plan documents. The statute thus implicates an area of core ERISA concern. In particular, it runs counter to ERISA\u2019s commands that a plan shall \u2018specify the basis on which payments are made to and from the plan,\u2019 \u00a7 1102(b)(4), and that the fiduciary shall administer the plan \u2018in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan,\u2019 \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(D), making payments to a \u2018beneficiary\u2019 who is \u2018designated by a participant, or by the terms of [the] plan.\u2019 \u00a7 1002(8).\u201d <em>Egelhoff, </em>532 U.S. at 147, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 26} The statute also interfered \u201cwith nationally uniform plan administration,\u201d one of ERISA\u2019s goals. Id. at 148, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264. \u201cRequiring ERISA administrators to master the relevant laws of 50 States and to contend with litigation would undermine the congressional goal of \u2018minimizing] the administrative and financial burden[s]\u2019 on plan administrators \u2014 burdens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ultimately borne by the beneficiaries.\u201d Id. at 149-150, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264, quoting <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon </em>(1990), 498 U.S. 133, 142, 111 S.Ct. 478, 112 L.Ed.2d 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">{\u00b6 27} As the court recognized, applying slayer statutes to ERISA-related plans implicates those same goals and concerns. <em>Egelhoff, </em>532 U.S. at 152, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264. \u201cIn the ERISA context, these \u2018slayer\u2019 statutes could revoke the beneficiary status of someone who murdered a plan participant.\u201d Id. However, since <em>Egelhojf </em>did not involve a slayer statute, the court refused to decide the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 28} The cases that have addressed the issue after <em>Egelhoff </em>have carefully sidestepped the question the court avoided answering in <em>Egelhojf. </em>For instance, in <em>H.E.B. Invest., </em>the court concluded that the murderer would not be entitled to the insurance proceeds regardless of whether ERISA preempted a state slayer statute. 217 F.Supp.2d at 761-762. Thus, it did not determine whether ERISA actually preempted the state slayer statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 29} We cannot sidestep the question in the same manner. We must determine whether to award the proceeds to Ibtisam, to Ibtisam and Ahsan, or to some third party. Accordingly, we must determine whether ERISA preempts R.C. 2105.19(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">{\u00b6 30} For all intents and purposes, slayer statutes affect the administration of ERISA plans in the same manner as the statute discussed in <em>Egelhojf.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">{\u00b6 31} As of 1993, 44 states and the District of Columbia had enacted slayer statutes, four states had a general common-law rule prohibiting a killer from benefiting from his crimes, one had a common-law rule barring a beneficiary who kills an insured from recovering from a life insurance policy, and the law in the one remaining state is unclear. Sherman, Mercy Killing and the Right to Inherit (1993), 61 U.Cin.L.Rev. 803, 805, 876, fn.12. These laws differ in many respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">{\u00b6 32} First, the states differ over the nature of the killing that disqualifies the beneficiary. Id. at 848-849; Schuman, Life Insurance and the Homicidal Beneficiary: The Insurer\u2019s Responsibilities Under State Slayer Laws and Statutes (2001), 51 Fedn. Ins. &amp; Corp. Counsel. Q. 197, 202-205. Every statute disqualifies beneficiaries who have committed the equivalent of either murder or aggravated murder, but some include offenses like voluntary manslaughter or causing suicide, while others do not. Compare R.C. 2105.19 (disqualifying a beneficiary for committing either aggravated murder, murder, or voluntary manslaughter); Ind.Code Ann. 29-1-2-12.1 (disqualifying a beneficiary for committing either aggravated murder, murder, voluntary manslaughter, or causing suicide); Ark. Code Ann. 28-11-204 (disqualifying a beneficiary for committing either first- or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>second-degree murder). And many states disqualify a beneficiary who has \u201cfeloniously and intentionally\u201d killed the insured without defining what they mean by felonious and intentional killings. See Ariz.Rev.State.Ann. 14-2803; Haw.Rev. Stat. 560:2-803.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 33} Second, states require varying burdens of proof upon the person seeking to disqualify the killer as a beneficiary. For instance, in the absence of a conviction some states will disqualify a beneficiary if the trial court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201cthe person would be found criminally accountable for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent.\u201d Ariz.Rev. State.Ann. 14-2803(F); Haw.Rev.Stat. 560:2-803(g). In contrast, other states require that the killing be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Ga.Code Ann. 53 \u20141\u20145(d). Ohio disqualifies the beneficiary only after he is convicted of or pleads guilty to one of the stated violations. R.C. 2105.19(A). Still other states disqualify a beneficiary who has been convicted only after all the beneficiary\u2019s appellate rights \u201chave been exhausted.\u201d Haw.Rev.Stat. 560:2-803(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 34} Further complicating the matter is that some states, like Ohio, declare that a slayer statute only supplements, rather than supersedes, common law, while others come to the contrary conclusion. Contrast <em>Shrader v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of United States </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 41, 44, 20 OBR 343, 485 N.E.2d 1031; <em>Holliday v. McMullen </em>(1988), 104 Nev. 294, 756 P.2d 1179, 1180. According to others, a criminal conviction does not conclusively prove that a beneficiary is prohibited from recovering life insurance proceeds, some going so far as to bar evidence of a conviction. See <em>Johnson v. Hebb </em>(D.Md.1990), 729 F.Supp. 1524; <em>Smith v. Dean </em>(1956), 226 Ark. 438, 290 S.W.2d 439; <em>Lillie v. Modern Woodmen of Am. </em>(1911), 89 Neb. 1, 130 N.W. 1004. In contrast, Ohio bars a beneficiary from recovering only <em>after </em>a criminal conviction. R.C. 2105.19(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 35} Given the variety of ways in which the different states enforce the general principle behind slayer statutes, the court\u2019s description of the statute in <em>Egelhoff </em>perfectly describes R.C. 2105.19(A)\u2019s effect on ERISA plans and plan administrators. It \u201cimplicates an area of core ERISA concern\u201d by obliging ERISA plan administrators to \u201cpay benefits to the beneficiaries chosen by state law, rather than those identified in the plan documents.\u201d 532 U.S. at 147, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264. Thus, slayer statutes interfere \u201cwith nationally uniform plan administration,\u201d one of ERISA\u2019s goals. Id. at 148, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264. Forcing plan administrators \u201cto master the relevant laws of 50 States and to contend with litigation\u201d does not foster \u201cthe congressional goal of \u2018minimiz[ing] the administrative and financial burden[s]\u2019 \u201d on those administrators. Id. at 149-150, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264. Accordingly, we must conclude that ERISA preempts Ohio\u2019s slayer statute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Distribution of the Proceeds Under Federal Common Law</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">{\u00b6 36} Since ERISA preempts R.C. 2105.19, the determination of who is a beneficiary of the life insurance policy is a question of federal law that must be determined using federal common law. <em>Tinsley v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 227 F.3d 700, 704; <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Pressley </em>(C.A.6, 1996), 82 F.3d 126, 129. After federal law determines who the beneficiary under an insurance policy is, state law may govern whether that beneficiary can recover the proceeds. <em>Cent. States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Howell </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 227 F.3d 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 37} Under federal common law, Nawaz cannot recover the insurance proceeds. \u201cIt would be a reproach to the jurisprudence of the country, if [a beneficiary] could recover insurance money payable on the death of a party whose life he had feloniously taken.\u201d <em>New York Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Armstrong </em>(1886), 117 U.S. 591, 600, 6 S.Ct. 877, 29 L.Ed. 997. But this fact begs the question: \u201cUnder federal law, do the proceeds go to the named contingent beneficiary or are they distributed in another manner?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 38} Unfortunately, none of the federal cases dealing with how ERISA relates to slayer statutes answered this question because, for the most part, it did not matter. For instance, some of those cases involved insureds who did not name a contingent beneficiary, see, e.g., <em>H.E.B. Invest., </em>217 F.Supp.2d 759; <em>Addison, New Orleans Elec. Pension Fund v. Roberts Newman </em>(E.D.La.1992), 784 F.Supp. 1233, while others have concluded that they were not adequately briefed to resolve the issue. <em>Mendez-Bellido v. Bd. of Trustees of Div. 1181, A.T.U. New York Employees Pension Fund &amp; Plan </em>(E.D.N.Y.1989), 709 F.Supp. 329, 333-334.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 39} In the absence of established federal common law on an issue, federal courts commonly borrow from state common law to determine the federal common law. <em>H.E.B. </em>Investment, 217 F.Supp.2d at 761; <em>Emard v. Hughes Aircraft Co. </em>(C.A.9 1998), 153 F.3d 949, 959-960. We recognize that some courts would award the policy proceeds to an innocent contingent beneficiary, see <em>Diep v. Rivas </em>(Md.App.2000), 357 Md. 668, 745 A.2d 1098, 1104; see, also, Schuman, Life Insurance and the Homicidal Beneficiary at 213; Sherman, Mercy Killing and the Right to Inherit at 853. But we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 40} The courts that award the proceeds to the contingent beneficiary speculate on the intent of the insured rather than applying the plain language of the contract. In doing so, those courts assume that the insured would have intended for proceeds to go to the contingent beneficiary if the insured was faced with that precise question. Schuman, Life Insurance and the Homicidal Beneficiary, 51 Fedn. Ins. &amp; Corp. Counsel Q., at 2B. But courts have long recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>that the manifest intention of contracting parties is found in the language they use in the contract. \u201cWhen the language of a written contract is clear, a court may look no further than the writing itself to find the intent of the parties.\u201d <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, \u00b6 11, citing <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Neff, </em>158 Ohio St. 45, 48 O.O. 24, 107 N.E.2d 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 41} In this case, we will apply the plain language of the contract rather than speculating about who Lubaina might have named as the beneficiary if she was murdered by the primary beneficiary. The contract is clear, and the fact that it does not address this situation does not make it ambiguous. We will not manufacture a result that may or may not be fair in a particular case. Contract law mandates that we follow the language of the contract, not our sense of what the parties might have intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 42} Under the plain language of the contract, Ibtisam cannot recover as the contingent beneficiary. The contingency arises only if Nawaz predeceases Lubaina, and that did not happen. The contract also contains a \u201cNo Surviving Beneficiary\u201d clause. But that clause takes effect only when the insured neither names nor is survived by a beneficiary. That also has not happened. Accordingly, neither clause has been triggered, and the proceeds must be distributed through Lubaina\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">{\u00b6 43} Under Ohio law, Ibtisam would receive all the life insurance proceeds, since courts would treat Nawaz as if he predeceased Lubaina. But ERISA preempts R.C. 2105.19, and federal common law, rather than Ohio statutory law, applies. Under the common law, we must apply the plain language of the contract. WTien applying that plain language, neither the contingent-beneficiary clause nor the no-surviving-beneficiary clause is triggered. Therefore, the proceeds must be awarded to Lubaina\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">{\u00b6 44} We can reach no final resolution of this case at this point in the proceedings. We do not know how the proceeds must be distributed by Lubaina\u2019s estate, so we cannot know how the proceeds should ultimately be distributed. The only thing we can say with certainty now is that the insurance proceeds at issue in this case should be distributed to Lubaina\u2019s estate and that the trial court erred by awarding them to Ibtisam. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and this cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b580-11\">Gene Donofrio and Vukovich, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
