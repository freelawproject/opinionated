The victim was a seven-year-old child we will refer to in this opinion as J.N. Harr was originally indicted for two counts of gross sexual imposition and one count of attempted gross sexual imposition. The additional charges of which he was acquitted involved J.N.\u2019s older sister B.N. The charges stemmed from accusations made by B.N. that Harr inappropriately touched her when she was in Harr\u2019s apartment on March 20, 2002. While investigating B.N.\u2019s complaint, Sergeant Steven Crabbe of the South Charleston Police Department was informed that a second child was seen leaving Harr\u2019s apartment, who Crabbe learned was B.N.\u2019s younger sister, J.N.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">{\u00b6 2} On April 1, 2002, Officer Crabbe spoke with J.N.\u2019s mother, Brenda, about the allegation that J.N. might have been in Harr\u2019s apartment and might have been abused by him. Brenda confronted J.N. about being in Harr\u2019s apartment, since she had been admonished not to go there. J.N. admitted to her mother that she had gone to Harr\u2019s apartment to get candy and that Harr had touched her breasts. Crabbe arrested Harr and charged him with the offenses for which he was later indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">{\u00b6 3} At trial, J.N. took the stand and broke down crying in response to questions by the prosecution. The trial court permitted J.N.\u2019s father to take the stand with her to make her more comfortable, but J.N. was unable to speak without sobbing. The trial court then excused J.N. from testifying. The defense moved for a mistrial, which was denied by the trial court. The state called Brenda to testify about J.N.\u2019s accusation against Harr. The defense objected to Brenda\u2019s hearsay testimony, but the trial court overruled the objection.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cQ. All right. And was it earlier that day that you had talked to Sergeant Crabbe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cA. Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cQ. What questions \u2014 -what was the first question that you asked your daughters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cA. I asked them if they had ever been in his apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cQ. In whose apartment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-13\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cA.

And at that point in time again without going into statements that they made, did either of your daughters react in any kind of an unusual manner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cA. J.N. did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cQ. Okay. How did she act at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cA. Nervous and scared, like she didn\u2019t want to talk in front of her sister.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cQ. All right. Tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what you mean \u2014 I mean give us some descriptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cA. She just kept on moving her eyes back and forth from her sister to me like she didn\u2019t want to say anything in front of her sister. I knew something was wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cQ. At that point in time did you separate them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-12\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cQ. Okay. And who did you continue to talk to at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-13\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cA. J.N. I took her into my bedroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-14\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cQ. All right. So it was just the two of you in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-15\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-16\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cQ. All right. Do you recall what the first question was that you asked her in your bedroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-17\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cA. I sat her down and I asked her if she has been in his apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-18\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cQ. Okay. Now, ask you describe for the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what her demeanor was like at that point in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-19\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cA. She started crying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-20\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cQ. All right. If you could, just answer this with a yes or no. Did she say anything at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-21\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cA. Yes, she did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-22\">{\u00b628} \u201cQ. Did \u2014 did anything she said to you at that point prompt further questioning by you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-23\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-24\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cQ. Okay. So she may have said something and then you followed up with some questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-25\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-26\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cQ. How long would you say you talked to J.N. by herself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>{\u00b6 33} \u201cA. 10, 15 minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cQ. All right. And can you describe what her demeanor was like during that entire 10 to 15 minutes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cA. She was crying hysterically the whole time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cQ. Okay. When you say hysterically, was she able to communicate to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cQ. Okay. Had you ever seen her in a state of hysteria like that before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-10\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-11\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cMR. RASTATTER: Your Honor, can we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-12\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cTHE COURT: Yes, you may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-13\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-14\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c(WHEREUPON, a conference was held at the bench between Court and Counsel out of the hearing of the jury but made a part of the record as follows.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-15\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cMR. RASTATTER: At this point in time what I would like to do is ask the witness what the substance of the victim\u2019s statements were to her, and I would argue to the Court that said statements would be admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. I\u2019ve got a couple cases that I would like to cite, both of which talk about the fact that there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s a trend in liberalizing the use of the excited utterance exception when you\u2019re talking about out-of-court statements by children who have been victimized by child abuse that typically the amount of time that passes from the incident to the statements, even though there\u2019s no set time, that the requirement is whether or not the declarant is still under the stress or excitement of the incident; and there\u2019s been a trend to lengthen that with respect to children because the courts have found that children don\u2019t really have the mental capacity to reflect on what\u2019s happened and that the nervousness and the excitement remains with them longer than it would for an adult. I\u2019ve got a case that says, you know, that that time period can be days or even weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-16\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cIn this particular case we\u2019re talking about a number of weeks after the alleged incident. I do have a case that says the Court was not able to determine exactly when the incident happened in relationship to when the statements were made, but they decided that was not the determining factor. What was dispositive was the fact that the declarant was a child, was crying, was upset, and was not able to reflect on what happened. So at this point in time I\u2019d ask for permission to ask this witness what the substance of those statements were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>{\u00b6 46} \u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Thomas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cMR. THOMAS: Well, Your Honor, I don\u2019t know that a foundation\u2019s been properly laid that the crying or that even could be laid that she is reacting to the stress of a criminal event as opposed to what has been laid, which is that she\u2019d earlier been told not to go over there at all and that she was now being confronted with the fact that, you know, had you been over there again and she knew \u2014 it was just like she was reacting under the stress of having to admit a disobeyance [sic] of her mother. You know, as to any event that might have occurred at that time. I don\u2019t know that a foundation\u2019s been laid that this is an excited utterance based on, on which event, on the event that you know, that she uttered it happened or if it was that she was admitting or confronted with the fact that she had disobeyed her mother and she was under that influence or feeling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cMR. RASTATTER: I think that\u2019s a good point. I would ask for maybe a little bit of leeway to go into that with her. Because it\u2019s kind of hard to establish a foundation without asking her some questions about what her responses were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cTHE COURT: All right. I\u2019ll give you some leeway. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cMR. RASTATTER: Okay. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cMR.

She tried to jerk away and ran out the door.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-20\">{\u00b6 120} In his first assignment of error, Harr contends that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of Brenda because it was hearsay and not admissible under the excited-utterance exception to the hearsay rule. He also contends that Brenda\u2019s hearsay testimony violated his constitutional right to confront J.N., who was his accuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-21\">{\u00b6 121} The excited-utterance exception to the hearsay rule provides that a statement is not excluded by the hearsay rule even though the declarant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>available as a witness if the statement relates to a startling event or condition while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. Evid.R. 803(2). The exception derives its guaranty of trustworthiness from the fact the declarant is under such a state of emotional shock that his reflective processes have been stilled. Therefore, statements made under these circumstances are not likely to be fabricated. 2 McCormick, Evidence (5th Ed.1999), Section 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">{\u00b6 122} It may generally be said that the trial court must focus on the declarant\u2019s state of mind at the time the statement was made and that the shock of the event must be present at the time in order for the hearsay exception to apply. McCormick has observed that where a time interval between the event and the statement is long enough to permit reflective thought, the statement will be excluded in the absence of some proof that the declarant did not in fact engage in a reflective thought process. 2 McCormick at 207, Section 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">{\u00b6 123} The Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Potter v. Baker </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 488, 55 O.O. 389, 124 N.E.2d 140, set forth a four-part test to determine whether or not a statement falls within the excited-utterance exception, holding that the statement may be admissible if the court finds <em>\u201c(si) </em>that there was some occurrence startling enough to produce a nervous excitement in the declarant, which was sufficient to still his reflective faculties and thereby make his statements and declarations the unreflective and sincere expression of his actual impressions and beliefs, and thus render his statement or declaration spontaneous and unreflective, (b) that the statement or declaration, even if not strictly contemporaneous with its exciting cause, was made before there had been time for such nervous excitement to lose a domination over his reflective faculties, so that such domination <em>continued </em>to remain sufficient to make his statements and declarations the unreflective and sincere expression of his actual impressions and beliefs, (c) that the statement or declaration related to such startling occurrence or the circumstances of such startling occurrence, and (d) that the declarant had an opportunity to observe personally the matters asserted in his statement or declaration.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">{\u00b6 124} The Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Potter </em>that flexibility is required in applying the test when the declarant is still under the domination of the exciting event. In <em>State v. Duncan </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 215, 7 O.O.3d 380, 373 N.E.2d 1234, the court addressed the exception in the context of an abused child. In <em>Duncan, </em>a six-year-old girl was left at home by her mother. When the defendant stepfather came home, he sexually abused the child. Two hours after the incident, the mother returned home and found the child shaking violently while emerging from a closet. Upon questioning by the mother, the child described the incident. Id. at 218, 7 O.O.3d 380, 373 N.E.2d 1234. The <em>Duncan </em>court stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>that when excited utterances by child declarants are offered into evidence, \u201cthe strict requirements of the res gestae rule should be relaxed or liberalized.\u201d Id. at 220, 7 O.O.3d 380, 373 N.E.2d 1234. The court noted that the child had related the incident at the earliest possible time and there was no indication that the child had \u201cengaged in reflective thought.\u201d Id. at 221, 7 O.O.3d 380, 373 N.E.2d 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">{\u00b6 125} In <em>State v. Wallace </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 87, 524 N.E.2d 466, the Ohio Supreme Court held that a child\u2019s statements made 15 hours after she was attacked were admissible as excited utterances. Before making the statements, the child had been drifting in and out of consciousness. The court stated, \u201cA period of unconsciousness, even an extended period, does not necessarily destroy the effect of a startling event upon the mind of the declarant for the purpose of satisfying the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d Id., at 90, 524 N.E.2d 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">{\u00b6 126} In <em>Wallace, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court also established guidelines under which declarations made in response to questioning could be admissible as excited utterances. It held that admission is not precluded by questioning that \u201c(1) is neither coercive nor leading, (2) facilitates the declarant\u2019s expression of what is already the natural focus of the declarant\u2019s thoughts, and (3) does not destroy the domination of the nervous excitement over the declarant\u2019s reflective faculties.\u201d Id. at 93, 524 N.E.2d 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">{\u00b6 127} In <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 545 N.E.2d 1220, the Ohio Supreme Court held that it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to admit the statement of a two-and-one-half-year-old child to her mother several hours after the alleged assault occurred. The court determined that considering the surprise of the assault, its shocking nature, and the age of the declarant, it was reasonable for the trial court to determine that the child was still in a state of excitement when the statement was made. Justice Douglas stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">{\u00b6 128} \u201cIn this case, although time had elapsed between the alleged abusive act and Cynthia\u2019s statement to her mother, the mother was the first person in whom the victim confided and this occurred at the earliest opportunity. <em>There is nothing in the record to indicate that Cynthia had engaged in reflective thought in the intervening time period. </em>According to the record, Cynthia fell asleep in her mother\u2019s car on the return trip to her mother\u2019s home. The girl did not awaken until the middle of the night when, according to the mother, the girl awoke crying and screaming. As Deidre took Cynthia to the bathroom and placed her on the toilet, Cynthia continued to cry and was in pain when she tried to urinate. Deidre questioned Cynthia concerning her agitation and Cynthia said: \u2018Daddy put something up my bucket. * * * [It was] [a] telephone.\u2019 Deidre testified that Cynthia cried during this conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>{\u00b6 129} \u201cWe find this out-of-court statement testified to by the mother, Deidre, was properly admitted by the trial court pursuant to Evid.R. 803(2).\u201d (Emphasis added.)' 46 Ohio St.3d at 118, 545 N.E.2d 1220.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">{\u00b6 130} In <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, the United States Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause did not bar the admission of an unavailable witness\u2019s statement against a criminal defendant if the statement bore \u201cadequate indicia of reliability.\u201d To meet that test, the court held that the evidence must either fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or bear particularized guaranties of trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">{\u00b6 131} The state focuses in its brief on the recent trend of Ohio courts to rely more on \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d rather than contemporaneousness with the event, when dealing with children. The state cites <em>State v. Wagner </em>(1986), 30 Ohio App.3d 261, 30 OBR 458, 508 N.E.2d 164. In <em>Wagner, </em>the defendant was convicted of molesting a three-year-old child. The victim\u2019s mother testified that her son told her his \u201cbootie\u201d hurt and that the defendant \u201cate him up.\u201d A police investigator testified as to actions the victim demonstrated to her using anatomically correct dolls. The trial court allowed the mother and investigator\u2019s testimony based on the excited-utterance exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">{\u00b6 132} The Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions. The court rejected appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court committed reversible error when it allowed the victim\u2019s hearsay into evidence. The court recognized a trend toward expanding the scope of the influence of an exciting event in child-molestation cases because of the unique nature of communications by young victims of sex abuse. In addition, the court said that maximum discretion should be given to the trial court in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">{\u00b6 133} The court found two requirements for evidence to be allowed under the excited-utterance exception. The first, that the communication be spontaneous, was satisfied because the victim\u2019s limited vocabulary prevented him from communicating anything about the event until he was offered the medium of anatomically correct dolls by the police investigator. The second requirement, that the communication be trustworthy, was also fulfilled because the child lacked the reflective powers to comprehend the seriousness of the incident and therefore had no motive to concoct a story.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">{\u00b6 134} The court also determined that the admission of the child\u2019s hearsay did not violate the accused\u2019s right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment. Citing <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>supra, the court emphasized that the Confrontation Clause is satisfied where the hearsay satisfies a firmly rooted hearsay exception. Moreover, the court found the statements to be trustworthy in light of surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>{\u00b6 135} Recently, in <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124. S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, the United States Supreme Court held that out-of-court statements that are testimonial are barred, under the Confrontation Clause, unless the witnesses are unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, regardless of whether the statements are deemed reliable by the trial court, abrogating <em>Ohio v. Roberts. </em>Justice Scalia explained the rationale of the court\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">{\u00b6 136} \u201cWhere testimonial statements are involved, we do not think the Framers meant to leave the Sixth Amendment\u2019s protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence, much less to amorphous notions of \u2018reliability.\u2019 Certainly none of the authorities discussed above acknowledges any general reliability exception to the common-law rule. Admitting statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right of confrontation. To be sure, the Clause\u2019s ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination. The Clause thus reflects a judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little dissent), but about how reliability can best be determined. Cf. 3 Blackstone, Commentaries, at 373 (\u2018This open examination of witnesses * * * is much more conducive to the clearing up of truth\u2019); M. Hale, History and Analysis of the Common Law of England 258 (1713) (adversarial testing \u2018beats and bolts out the Truth much better\u2019).\u201d 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. at 1370, 158 L.Ed.2d 177.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">{\u00b6 137} In <em>State v. Bowles </em>(April 28, 1998), Franklin App. No. 97APA09-1213, 1998 WL 212868, the Franklin County Court of Appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the hearsay testimony of the 12-year-old victim\u2019s statements to her grandmother and friend a few days after the alleged sexual abuse. Judge Tyack wrote on behalf of the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">{\u00b6 138} \u201cThe testimony of both L.K.\u2019s friend and L.K\u2019s grandmother amounted to blanket recitations of L.K.\u2019s detailed, reflective statements, made to both witnesses by L.K. from days to at least a week after the alleged incident. The record does not support a finding that the statements made by L.K. were the product of the requisite impulse and spontaneity; in fact, some of the statements made by L.K. in the days following the alleged incident were responses elicited by direct questions from the friend and grandmother. As noted by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 332, 338, 643 N.E.2d 1098. \u2018 \u201cA statement naturally becomes more reflective with repetition.\u201d \u2019 [Quoting <em>State v. Justice </em>(1994), 92 Ohio App.3d 740, 748, 637 N.E.2d 85.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">{\u00b6 139} \u201cAlthough both witnesses indicated that L.K. was \u2018upset,\u2019 the record does not support a finding that she was divulging these details in any fashion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>other than after deliberation and reflection. As unequivocally stated by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Taylor </em>[ (1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 295] at 303, 612 N.E.2d 316, \u2018[m]erely being \u201cupset\u201d clearly does not meet the standard for admissibility under Evid.R. 803(2) * * *.\u2019 Thus, the testimony of these witnesses constituted narrative hearsay accounts beyond the purview of the excited utterance exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">{\u00b6 140} The question in this case is whether J.N.\u2019s statements to her mother were testimonial or were excited utterances. Whenever the prosecution offers hearsay evidence in a criminal case, the accused\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers is directly implicated. Hearsay exceptions should be narrowly construed by the trial court when the constitutional rights of the accused are directly affected by the admission of the hearsay testimony. We And that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the hearsay testimony of Brenda. The child\u2019s statements to her mother were given nearly two weeks after the startling event and after the child was confronted by her mother for disobeying her order not to enter a stranger\u2019s apartment, and only after she interrogated the child with leading questions. A trial court abuses its discretion when it unreasonably applies the law to undisputed facts. <em>AAAA Enterprises Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 553 N.E.2d 597. The trial court abused its discretion in finding that J.N.\u2019s statements to her mother were admissible as excited utterances. The error was not harmless because the hearsay statements were virtually the only evidence presented by the state to support the charge in the indictment. Accordingly, the first assignment of error is sustained. In his second assignment Harr contends the trial court erred in refusing to grant him a mistrial when J.N. began weeping uncontrollably in front of the jury. This assignment has been rendered moot due to our resolution of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">{\u00b6 141} In his third assignment, Harr contends that the trial court erred in imposing a greater than minimum sentence upon him as a first offender without first making the required findings. This assignment is also moot for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">{\u00b6 142} In his last assignment, Harr contends that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence and was based on insufficient evidence as a matter of law. Harr\u2019s manifest-weight argument has been rendered moot by our resolution of the appellant\u2019s first assignment. Because a defendant may not be retried after a judgment has been determined to be based on insufficient evidence, we must consider that argument in the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">{\u00b6 143} The state was required to prove that Harr had sexual contact with a person less than 13 years old who was not his spouse. See R.C. 2907.05(A)(4). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Sexual contact is defined as any touching of an erogenous zone of another, including the breasts of a female, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person. R.C. 2907.01(B). Harr argues that even if he had touched J.N.\u2019s breasts, the state presented no evidence that he did so for the purpose of sexual gratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">{\u00b6 144} On review for sufficiency, courts are to assess not whether the state\u2019s evidence is to be believed, but whether, if believed, the evidence against the defendant would support a conviction. <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. Although close, we believe a jury could infer from Brenda\u2019s hearsay testimony that Harr ran his hands across her daughter\u2019s breasts for the purpose of sexually gratifying himself. The appellant\u2019s last assignment raising insufficiency of evidence is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">{\u00b6 145} The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial court for purposes of providing Paul Harr a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b760-8\">Grady and Frederick N.
