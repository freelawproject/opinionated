Doe (\u201cDoe\u201d), appeals from the trial court\u2019s transfer and reassignment of her case to two different judges, claiming that the orders transferring the case failed to state the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>reason for the transfers. She also appeals from the trial court\u2019s subsequent decision to dismiss the case based on the statute of limitations. She further appeals from two nunc pro tunc journal entries, wherein the administrative judge provided reasons for the reassignments and the denial of Doe\u2019s motion for relief from judgment. Finding no merit to the appeals, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In her complaint, Doe alleged that she was sexually abused by Father Wernet between 1962 and 1966. She moved out of state as a child and heard nothing more about Father Wernet until she watched \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2002, when she claims she discovered that Father Wernet had molested other children. Based on this information, she claims she learned that the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland (\u201cthe Diocese\u201d) and St. Joseph Church (\u201cthe Church\u201d) knew or should have known that Wernet was likely to abuse her. Thus, she argues that the statute of limitations on her claims against the Diocese and the Church did not start to run until she discovered this information in 2002. Accordingly, she seeks to hold the Diocese and the Church liable on a negligence theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">{\u00b6 3} Doe filed her complaint on November 12, 2002, and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Nancy Fuerst. On January 28, 2003, Judge Fuerst conducted a case management conference, at which time counsel for the Diocese disclosed th\u00e1t he had had an attorney-client relationship with Judge Fuerst\u2019s husband and his firm Burke, Rosen <em>&amp; </em>Associates. Judge Fuerst indicated that she would, therefore, grant a motion for recusal. After Doe\u2019s counsel filed a motion for recusal, Judge Fuerst recused herself, and the administrative judge reassigned the case to Judge Nancy McDonnell \u201cfor good cause.\u201d Judge McDonnell, however, also recused herself, and the underlying case was reassigned to Judge Nancy Margaret Russo, again with an entry by the administrative judge stating the transfer was \u201cfor good cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">{\u00b6 4} In the meantime, the Diocese filed a motion to dismiss, which Judge Russo granted and Doe appealed. However, on May 7, 2003, this court remanded the case (case No. 82542) to the common pleas court to allow a ruling on Doe\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B)(5) motion, which she had filed with Administrative Judge Richard McMonagle.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">{\u00b6 5} Doe\u2019s counsel informed Judge McMonagle that the case had been remanded and asserted that the case should be reassigned to a judge who was not a member of the Diocese. Judge McMonagle met with counsel for both parties, heard arguments, and indicated that (1) because he was not the assigned judge, he could not rule on Doe\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion, (2) he could not reassign the case from the assigned judge to a non-Catholic judge, (3) the case had been randomly assigned to Judge Fuerst and then Judge McDonnell, and (4) he was going to enter nunc pro tunc journal entries providing specific reasons for the reassignments. The nunc pro tunc entries were journalized on May 15, 2003. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>May 20, 2003, Judge Russo filed a journal entry striking Doe\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion because it was not filed with the assigned judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">{\u00b6 6} Doe then appealed Judge McMonagle\u2019s journal entries and Judge Russo\u2019s order (case No. 83021). She also filed her second motion for remand to return case No. 82542 to the trial court. This court again remanded the case, but the trial court found that there were no active motions to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">{\u00b6 7} This court consolidated the two appeals, in which Doe raises five assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Nunc Pro Tune Entries</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">{\u00b6 8} In her first assignment of error in case No. 83021, Doe argues that the administrative judge erred when he issued nunc pro tunc journal entries providing explanations for the previously entered orders reassigning the case. Doe argues that the trial court had no jurisdiction to issue the nunc pro tunc journal entries because Doe\u2019s appeal divested the trial court of all jurisdiction inconsistent with that of the appeals court to modify, reverse, affirm, or review its judgment. Doe also argues that the nunc pro tunc journal entries did not eliminate the improprieties of the two earlier journal entries because Civ.R. 60(A) authorizes only the correction of clerical mistakes and does not permit substantive changes in orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>McGowan v. Giles </em>(Mar. 16, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 76332, 2000 WL 284174, this court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe purpose of a nunc pro tunc entry \u2018is restricted to placing upon the record evidence of judicial action which has been actually taken\u2019 and \u2018it can be exercised only to supply omissions in the exercise of functions that are clerical merely.\u2019 <em>Jacks v. Adamson </em>(1897), 56 Ohio St. 397, 402 [47 N.E. 48]; \u2018The function of nunc pro tunc is not to change, modify, or correct erroneous judgments, but merely to have the record speak the truth.\u2019 <em>Ruby v. Wolf </em>(1931), 39 Ohio App. 144 [177 N.E. 240] (Emphasis added.); <em>Dentsply Internatl., Inc. v. Kostas </em>(1985), 26 Ohio App.3d 116 [26 OBR 327, 498 N.E.2d 1079]. See, also, <em>Pepera v. Pepera </em>(March 26, 1987), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 51989, 52024, unreported [1987 WL 8586] (A court may not by way of a nunc pro tunc entry, enter of record that which it intended or might have made but which in fact was not made.)\u201d Id., quoting <em>Myers v. Shaker Hts. </em>(June 7, 1990), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 57005 and 58056, 1990 WL 75236.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">{\u00b6 11} Civ.R. 60(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(A) Clerical Mistakes. Clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time on its own initiative or on the motion of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>party and after such notice, if any, as the court orders. During the pendency of an appeal, such mistakes may be so corrected before the appeal is docketed in the appellate court, and thereafter while the appeal is pending may be so corrected with leave of the appellate court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">{\u00b6 13} The proper application of Civ.R. 60(A), along with a definition of \u201cclerical mistake,\u201d can be found in the case of <em>Dentsply v. Internatl., Inc. v. Kostas </em>(1985), 26 Ohio App.3d 116, 26 OBR 327, 498 N.E.2d 1079, wherein this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIt is axiomatic that a court has the power to correct a clerical error pursuant to Civ.R. 60(A). However, this rule is applied to- inadvertent clerical errors only, * * * and cannot be used to change something which was deliberately done. * * * [T]he nunc pro tunc entry does not reflect a modification of an erroneous judgment but rather supplies omissions of a clerical nature which serve to have the record speak the truth.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">{\u00b6 15} As used in Civ.R. 60(A), a \u201cclerical mistake\u201d is a type of mistake or omission mechanical in nature that is apparent on the record and that does not involve a legal decision or judgment by an attorney. In other words, a correction may add additional information to clarify a prior order but should not change the substance of the original journal entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">{\u00b6 16} Further, App.R. 9(E) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cIf any difference arises as to whether the record truly discloses what occurred in the trial court, the difference shall be * * * settled by that court and the record made to conform to the truth. If anything material to either party is omitted from the record by error or accident or is misstated therein, the parties by stipulation, or the trial court, either before or after the record is transmitted to the court of appeals, * * * may direct that the omission or misstatement be corrected * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">{\u00b6 18} Thus, even while a case is pending on appeal, the trial court retains jurisdiction to enter nunc pro tunc orders so that the record will conform to what occurred in the trial court. <em>State v. Hankerson </em>(Aug. 5, 1981), Hamilton App. No. C-800542, 1981 WL 9939.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">{\u00b6 19} In the instant case, the nunc pro tunc entries do not change the substance of the previous orders that reassigned the case from one judge to another due to recusal. The nunc pro tunc entries simply add additional information concerning what happened in the trial court that necessitated the reassignments. Doe does not dispute that the entries accurately reflect what happened. She sought the first recusal and provided the reason for the first reassignment. Therefore, the trial court had jurisdiction to enter the nunc pro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>tunc entries, and we find the entries were proper. Accordingly, Doe\u2019s first assignment of error in case No. 88021 is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">{\u00b6 20} In her first assignment of error in case No. 82542, Doe argues that the administrative judge erred in reassigning the case without stating a justifiable reason for the transfers. Our disposition of the previous assignment of error renders this argument moot. Because the nunc pro tunc entries stated the reason for the transfer, we overrule this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">{\u00b6 21} In her second and third assignments of error in case No. 82542, Doe argues that the court erred in granting the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\"> {\u00b6 22} In order for a court to dismiss a complaint under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, it must appear beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Univ. Community Tenants Union, Inc. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 242, 245, 71 O.O.2d 223, 327 N.E.2d 753. Additionally, in construing a complaint upon a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, we must presume that all factual allegations of the complaint are true and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Mitchell v. Lawson Milk Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 190, 192, 532 N.E.2d 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c \u2018A Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss based upon a statute of limitations should be granted only where the complaint conclusively shows on its face that the action is so barred.\u2019 <em>Helman v. EPL Prolong, Inc., </em>139 Ohio App.3d 231, 241, 743 N.E.2d 484, quoting <em>Velotta v. Leo Petronzio Landscaping, Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 376, 379, 23 O.O.3d 346, 433 N.E.2d 147.\u201d <em>Kennedy v. Heckard, </em>Cuyahoga No. 80234, 2002-Ohio-6805, 2002 WL 31770490.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">{\u00b6 24} The Diocese and the Church argued in their motion to dismiss that Doe\u2019s claims were barred by the two-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.10. However, Doe asserts that her claim is not time-barred because the statute of limitations was tolled until she learned that she had a negligence claim after watching an episode of \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Thus, she maintains that the statute of limitations was tolled until she acquired actual knowledge that she had a claim against the Church and the Diocese. Claims of negligence for failing to protect a child victim from \u201csexual behavior\u201d are subject to R.C. 2305.10, i.e., a two-year statute of limitations. <em>Doe v. First United Methodist Church </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 531, 537, 629 N.E.2d 402. However, pursuant to R.C. 2305.16, this statute is not triggered until the child victim reaches the age of 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>First United, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 538, 629 N.E.2d 402, the Ohio Supreme Court held that as long as a plaintiff \u201cknows the identity of the perpetrator and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>fully aware of the fact that a battery has occurred,\u201d the statute of limitations for a sexual-abuse case begins to run when the plaintiff reaches age 18. Because the plaintiff in <em>First United </em>knew the identity of the perpetrator and was aware that a battery occurred, the court held that his claims against the church and the school that employed the abuser were barred because the plaintiff failed to bring his action within two years after he reached the age of majority. Id. at 539-540, 629 N.E.2d 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">{\u00b6 26} In the instant case, Doe alleged in her complaint that she knew the identity of the perpetrator, was aware that a battery had occurred, and knew that she could have taken legal action against the perpetrator. According to the complaint, she reached the age of majority 28 years ago. However, she argues that because she alleged that she did not have actual knowledge that she had any legal claim against the Church and the Diocese until she watched \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d the statute of limitations was tolled. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">{\u00b6 27} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe discovery rule applies in Ohio to toll the statute of limitations where a victim of childhood sexual abuse represses memories of that abuse until a later time.\u201d <em>Ault v. Jasko </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 114, 117, 637 N.E.2d 870. Thus, in the absence of repressed memory, the limitations period begins to run when a plaintiff reaches 18 years of age. <em>Livingston v. Diocese of Cleveland </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 299, 303, 710 N.E.2d 330, appeal not allowed (1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 1412, 694 N.E.2d 75 (holding that discovery rule tolls statute of limitations in child sexual abuse cases only where plaintiff represses memories of abuse); <em>Doe v. Rupp </em>(Jan. 29, 1998), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 71938 and 72966, 1998 WL 32774 (holding that where plaintiff knew he had been abused, knew the identity of the perpetrator, and thus knew the possibility of Diocesan negligence in failing to protect him, statute of limitations is not tolled).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">{\u00b6 28} In the instant case, because Doe does not allege that she repressed memories of the alleged abuse, the statute of limitations was not tolled but expired over 26 years ago. Therefore, the trial court properly dismissed the complaint as barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">{\u00b6 29} Additionally, this court considered a similar case involving the same defendants and alleging the same type of abuse by the same individual during relatively the same time period. See <em>Livingston, </em>supra. This court determined that the action was time-barred because there was no evidence of repressed memory and thus the statute of limitations was not tolled. Similarly, Doe makes no claim of repressed memory in her complaint and ignores that she had a duty to exercise reasonable diligence to determine whether she had a claim. Accordingly, we are obliged to follow <em>Livingston </em>and thus conclude that Doe\u2019s claims are time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>{\u00b6 80} Doe places great reliance on <em>Norgard v. Brush Wellman, Inc., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 165, 2002-Ohio-2007, 766 N.E.2d 977. In <em>Norgard, </em>the plaintiff developed a rash while at work and years later was diagnosed with chronic beryllium disease a debilitating and sometimes fatal lung disease caused by exposure to beryllium. Three years later, Norgard read an article about beryllium lawsuits against his employer and filed a lawsuit alleging that the employer withheld information about the causes of beryllium-related diseases, knew its air samples were inaccurate, and had faulty ventilation equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">{\u00b6 31} The Ohio Supreme Court held that the cause of action based upon the employer\u2019s intentional tort accrued when the employee discovered, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the workplace injury and the wrongful conduct of the employer. Thus, the court found that the statute of limitations had tolled because it found the employee did not know and had no reason to know that any wrongful conduct had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">{\u00b6 32} Moreover, the <em>Norgard </em>court further explained that any discovery rule \u201cmust be specially tailored to the particular context to which it is to be applied.\u201d <em>Norgard </em>at \u00b6 10. The <em>Norgard </em>court found that if the victim is aware that wrongful conduct has occurred, the limitations period is not tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">{\u00b6 33} Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Norgard, </em>Doe knew that wrongful conduct had occurred because she admitted in her complaint that she knew she was abused and she knew the identity of the perpetrator. However, she failed to exercise reasonable diligence to discover whether the Church and the Diocese were also guilty of wrongful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">{\u00b6 34} Accordingly, the second and third assignments of error in case No. 82542 are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Civ.R. 60(B)(5) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">{\u00b6 35} In her second assignment of error in case No. 83021, Doe argues that the trial court erred when it struck her Civ.R. 60(B) motion and denied it as moot. Judge Russo struck the Civ.R. 60(B) motion as \u201cimproperly filed\u201d because it \u201cwas filed with the non-assigned judge.\u201d Doe explained that she filed the motion with the administrative judge\u2019s name in the caption because it was her position that the two reassignments were improper and that the case was still pending before the administrative judge as a result of the subsequent recusal of Judge Fuerst.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">{\u00b6 36} Clearly, Judge Russo had the authority to rule on the motion. Merely because the caption contains a different judge\u2019s name does not mean the motion is \u201cnot properly before the assigned judge.\u201d Thus, Judge Russo could have ruled on the motion and could have denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>{\u00b6 37} Nonetheless, because the motion to dismiss was properly granted, any error by Judge Russo in failing to rule on the Civ.R. 60(B) motion was harmless. This court\u2019s affirmance of the court\u2019s dismissal renders this assignment of error moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b100-6\">James D. Sweeney, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b100-7\">Diane Kaepinski, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b100-8\">James D. Sweeney, J., retired, of the Eighth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b100-9\">Kaepinski, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A1V\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">{\u00b6 38} I respectfully dissent because I believe that the majority has not applied the proper standard in its analysis of whether plaintiffs claims against defendants are time-barred by the two-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.10. I also disagree with the majority about the validity of the administrative judge\u2019s transfers of this case below and the two subsequent nunc pro tunc entries related to those transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">{\u00b6 39} In their motion to dismiss, defendants claimed that the statute began to run when Wernet began sexually abusing plaintiff and that she had continuous knowledge of that abuse from 1962 through 1966 when she claims the molestation stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">{\u00b6 40} According to defendants, the last instance of abuse would have occurred in 1966. Defendants agree that since plaintiff was a minor when the abuse occurred, the period of limitations was tolled at least until she reached the age of majority. After that, defendants claim, and the majority agrees, that plaintiff would have had two years within which to file her complaint. Since plaintiff did not commence suit until November 2002, when she was 46 years old, the majority says that her action against defendants is now barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">{\u00b6 41} Plaintiff argues that the statute of limitations began to run in the spring of 2002, when she first discovered defendants had harmed her by not protecting her from Wernet. I agree with plaintiff that the \u201cdiscovery\u201d test applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">{\u00b6 42} The Ohio Supreme Court declared that the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d applied to sexual abuse cases in <em>Ault v. Jasko </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 114, 637 N.E.2d 870. In that case, plaintiff had for years repressed any memory of her childhood abuse. In the case at bar plaintiff does not claim repressed memory. Relying on <em>Ault, </em>the majority states that \u201cin the absence of repressed memory, the limitations period begins to run when a plaintiff reaches 18 years of age.\u201d The majority then goes on to conclude that because this case does not involve repressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>memory, the limitations period expired two years after plaintiff reached 18, and her claims are barred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">{\u00b6 43} <em>Ault, </em>however, does not control in this case. <em>Doe v. First United Methodist Church </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 531, 629 N.E.2d 402, is the relevant authority. In <em>Doe, </em>plaintiff alleged sexual abuse by Masten, a choir director within the defendant school district and a musical director at defendant church. Plaintiff also brought \u201cindependent claims against the church and school district arising from the alleged negligence of these defendants in failing to take some action to protect [plaintiff] from Masten\u2019s conduct.\u201d Id. at 539, 629 N.E.2d 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">{\u00b6 44} Addressing the viability of plaintiffs claims against the school district and the church, the Supreme Court of Ohio clarified the different standards:</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cThese claims are based upon the church\u2019s and the school district\u2019s own acts or omissions and have nothing to do with any theory of derivative liability. Thus, we recognize that the facts and events which triggered the statute of limitations on appellant\u2019s claims for sexual abuse did not necessarily trigger the R.C. 2305.10 two-year period of limitations on appellant\u2019s independent negligence claims against the church and the school district.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">{\u00b6 46} The court, however, dismissed plaintiffs claims against the school district and the church because plaintiff never claimed or argued that his knowledge of the sexual abuse was insufficient to apprise him of the possibility that the church or the school district had been negligent in failing to protect him from Masten. Under these circumstances, we are left to assume that the events that triggered the one-year statute of limitations for assault and battery were no different from the events that triggered the two-year statute of limitations that applies to appellant\u2019s negligence causes of action against the church and the school district. Therefore, the two-year period of limitations commenced in July 1984, and appellant\u2019s negligence claims against the church and the school district are barred by R.C. 2305.10. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">{\u00b6 47} Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Doe, </em>plaintiff in the case at bar specifically alleges that before the spring of 2002, her knowledge about the breadth and scope of Wernet\u2019s sexual abuse of others was insufficient to put her on notice that defendants may have been negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">{\u00b6 48} In another case in 2002, the Ohio Supreme Court explained further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c[Discovery of an injury alone is insufficient to start the statute of limitations running if at that time there is no indication of <em>wrongful conduct </em>of the defendant. Moreover, the court has been careful to note that the discovery rule must be specially tailored to the particular context to which it is to be applied. <em>Browning v. Burt </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 544, 559, 613 N.E.2d 993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-12\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>{\u00b6 51} \u201cThis holding is consistent with the rationale underlying a statute of limitations and the discovery rule. Its underlying purpose is fairness to both sides. Once a plaintiff knows of an injury and the cause of the injury, the law gives the plaintiff a reasonable time to file suit. Yet if a plaintiff is <em>unaware that his or her rights have been infringed, </em>how can it be said that he or she slept on those rights? To deny an employee the right to file an action before he or she discovers that the injury was caused by the employer\u2019s <em>wrongful conduct </em>is to deny the employee the right to bring any claim at all. By applying the discovery rule as we do, we take away the advantage of employers who conceal harmful information until it is too late for their employees to use it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Norgard v. Brush Wellman, Inc., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 165, 2002-Ohio-2007, 766 N.E.2d 977, at \u00b6 10 and 19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">{\u00b6 52} The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Norgard </em>clearly establishes the discovery standard that should be applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">{\u00b6 53} In the case at bar, plaintiff filed her complaint in November 2002, after watching a television show in which she learned that others had also been abused by Wernet. Plaintiff says this was the very first time she learned defendants may have known that Wernet had been sexually abusing children both before 1962 and thereafter. At paragraph 8 of her complaint, plaintiff states, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cPrior to the spring of this year, plaintiff never knew, and never discovered that either the Church or the Diocese had any knowledge that Wernet had fondled, molested or inappropriately touched any other child prior to or during his sexual abuse of the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">{\u00b6 55} According to the majority, because plaintiff knew that she was harmed by Wernet in the years between 1962 and 1966, she also knew or should have discovered any wrongdoing by defendants. This conclusion is too big a leap and goes beyond a question of law. This question is essentially for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">{\u00b6 56} Moreover, the conclusion the majority reaches misses the crucial distinction between when, according to plaintiff, she first learned she had been harmed by Wernet and when she first became aware her harm was a result of the allegedly wrongful conduct of the Diocese and St. Joseph Church. In other words, she says, only later did she realize that the Diocese and St. Joseph Church knew or should have known Wernet was abusing other victims before 1962 or during the time Wernet was sexually abusing plaintiff and therefore should have known to protect her and did not. The facts and events that triggered the statute of limitations on plaintiffs claims against Wernet for sexual abuse did not necessarily trigger the R.C. 2305.10 two-year period of limitations because this claim is based on independent negligence claims against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>{\u00b6 57} Under <em>Doe </em>and <em>Norgard, </em>the period of limitations against defendants could not arise until plaintiff discovered that the Diocese and the Church may have engaged in wrongful conduct, that is, that they had knowledge about Wernet\u2019s injurious conduct but did nothing in order to protect her. The majority focuses on Wernet as the perpetrator, which he is under the theory of respondeat superior. Under the negligence claim, however, defendants are the alleged wrongdoers, not Wernet.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">{\u00b6 58} Unlike the situation in <em>Livingston, </em>cited by the majority, the case at bar does not involve a claim against any of the defendants for respondeat superior. Plaintiff has \u201calleged negligence, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and breach of fiduciary duty against appellee.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">{\u00b6 59} Even though the plaintiffs in <em>Livingston </em>alleged the Diocese\u2019s negligence in failing to protect plaintiffs, the court never addressed that claim. Moreover, unlike the situation in this case, the plaintiffs in <em>Livingston </em>never claimed to have discovered the separate harm committed by one of the defendants years later. Thus <em>Livingston </em>is distinguishable from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">{\u00b6 60} To apply the proper discovery rule, that is, the rule enunciated in <em>Doe, </em>requires deciding who allegedly committed the wrongful conduct at issue: (1) the person who directly abused the child or (2) those who she claims neglected to protect her from the abuse. Plaintiff claims defendants\u2019 negligence caused her injury. This claim, for purposes of the discovery rule and the applicable period of limitations, is separate and distinct from the injuries she suffered from Wernet. Plaintiff is <em>not </em>alleging defendants have derivative liability (respondeat superior) for Wernet\u2019s misconduct. Instead, plaintiff alleges that she was harmed not only by Wernet, which harm would be one cause of action,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but also separately by defendants because of their own misfeasance in failing to warn her about Wernet or by failing to remove him from his duties in order to remove the opportunity he had to abuse plaintiff. For pleading purposes, this is a separate cause of action having less to do with what Wernet did to plaintiff between 1962 and 1966, although the abuse itself would still have to be proven in the negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">{\u00b6 61} Construing the allegations of the complaint in plaintiffs favor, as we must, I conclude that her complaint survives defendants\u2019 12(B)(6) motion because she sufficiently alleged that the period of limitations against defendants began to run in the spring of 2002, when she first became aware that defendants\u2019 negligence harmed her. Plaintiffs complaint, therefore, was timely filed, and the trial court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. I would therefore sustain plaintiffs second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>{\u00b6 62} I also disagree with the majority\u2019s disposition of plaintiffs sole assignment of error in case No. 82542<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and her first assignment of error in case No. 83021.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">{\u00b6 63} In these two assignments of error, plaintiff argues that the administrative judge\u2019s initial transfers<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from Judge Fuerst to Judge McDonnell and then to Judge Russo are voidable. Plaintiff claims that, when Judge Russo granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, she did not have jurisdiction over the case because the transfer orders were incomplete. Plaintiff also claims that the court\u2019s two subsequent nunc pro tunc orders<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are equally invalid. According to plaintiff, because of these errors, Judge Russo\u2019s dismissal of her complaint is, therefore, a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">{\u00b6 64} Plaintiff relies on the authority of <em>Berger v. Berger </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 125, 3 OBR 141, 443 N.E.2d 1375, which holds that the Common Pleas Superin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>tendence Rule<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requires the administrative judge to give a reason for the transfer on the judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cThe administrative judge\u2019s broad power of docket control and case assignment in C.P. Sup. R. 8 must be read together with the assignment system prescribed by C.P. Sup. R. 4 * * *. In view of the language of those rules and earlier case interpretations, we hold that reassignment of any case must be accompanied by a journal entry executed by the administrative judge <em>which states a justifiable reason for transferring responsibility for the case to another judge. </em>Absent such an entry, the judge assuming [sic] to act has no authority and his rulings are voidable on timely objection by any party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 130, 3 OBR 141, 443 N.E.2d 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">{\u00b6 66} On February 5th, the administrative judge transferred plaintiffs case from Judge Fuerst to Judge McDonnell. The next day, the case was transferred again, this time to Judge Russo. Both entries say the transfers were \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d Then, only days later, on February 11th, Judge Russo granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">{\u00b6 67} Because of the truncated time frame between the court\u2019s transfers and the dismissal of plaintiffs complaint, we conclude that plaintiff did not have an opportunity to timely object to the transfers before her case was dismissed. Plaintiff did, however, timely appeal the improper nature of those transfers to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">{\u00b6 68} This court has repeatedly held that \u201ca justifiable reason for the transfer of a case to another judge must be stated in a written entry that leaves no doubt as to what the entry means.\u201d <em>Mlinarcik v. E.E. Wehrung Parking </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 134, 142, 620 N.E.2d 181. See also, <em>Jurek v. Jurek </em>(Oct. 13, 1988), Cuyahoga App. No. 54438, 1988 WL 112967; <em>In the Matter of Robbins </em>(Oct. 3, 1985), Cuyahoga App. No. 49542, 1985 WL 8096; <em>Lapp v. Lapp </em>(May 5, 1983), Cuyahoga App. No. 45456, 1983 WL 2955; <em>White v. Summit Cty. </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 116, 740 N.E.2d 688. Case law from this court has interpreted the rules as requiring the administrative judge to <em>state </em>a justifiable reason. The phrase the administrative judge used \u2014 \u201cfor good cause shown\u201d \u2014 is merely an <em>assertion </em>that the reason is \u201cjustifiable.\u201d Such an assertion is not the same as <em>stating </em>a justifiable reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>{\u00b6 69} In the case at bar, the administrative judge\u2019s entry does not state a specific reason. This court in <em>Mlinarcik </em>found inadequate the administrative judge\u2019s entry, which stated \u201cASSIGNED JUDGE UNAVAILABLE.\u201d Rather than provide a justifiable reason for transferring the case to another judge, the court\u2019s entry merely stated \u201ca conclusion and not a reason as contemplated by the rules and case decision * * \u201cTherefore,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cit fail[ed] for lack of proper reason.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 86 Ohio App.3d at 143, 620 N.E.2d 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">{\u00b6 70} I agree with this reasoning. See, also, <em>Howard v. East Ohio Gas Co. </em>(Mar. 21, 1985), Cuyahoga App. No. 48725, 1985 WL 9792; <em>Dorsky v. Dorsky </em>(Dec. 10, 1981), Cuyahoga App. No. 43587, 1981 WL 4675. As we said recently in <em>Brickman &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Natl. City Bank, Trustee, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81428, 2004-Ohio-1447, 2004 WL 583856:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cEssential to any system of justice * * * is the principle that cases be assigned among judges objectively and without preference. The Rule permits an administrative judge to change the judge assigned to a case. It is not an onerous burden for the administrative judge to state a justifiable reason. This requirement, moreover, protects the integrity of that exception. As a result, the judges affected have a chance to understand the basis for the change. More importantly, this procedure requires a \u2018transparency\u2019 \u2014 to use a current word \u2014 to discourage preferential reassignments, as well as the appearance of preference. As Judge Markus explained in <em>Berger, </em>supra, at 128, 3 OBR 141, 443 N.E.2d 1375, &lt;* * * restrictions on discretionary case assignments or transfers serve to inhibit real or perceived \u201cjudge shopping\u201d and judicial favoritism.\u2019 Such restrictions are a check on the system. Checks are not always economical, but they are necessary. Thus there is an important consideration behind the holding in <em>Berger </em>that the administrative judge be required to state a justifiable reason. To ignore this requirement is to provide a future opportunity to undermine an even more important judicial principle than judicial economy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">{\u00b6 72} Apparently realizing the deficiency of his explanation, the administrative judge subsequently provided a proper explanation in his nunc pro tunc entries. Because the notice of appeal was already filed, however, and the case remanded solely for the purpose of ruling on the 60(B) motion, the lower court lacked jurisdiction to file the nunc pro tunc entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">{\u00b6 73} The majority argues, on the other hand, that \u201ceven while a case is pending on appeal, the trial court retains jurisdiction to enter nunc pro tunc orders so that the record will conform to what occurred in the trial court. <em>State v. Hankerson </em>(Aug. 5, 1981), Hamilton App. No. C-800542, 1981 WL 9939.\u201d The rule authorizing specifically nunc pro tunc orders is Civ.R. 60(A), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>{\u00b6 74} \u201cClerical mistakes in judgments, orders, or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time on its own initiative * * *. During pendency of an appeal such mistakes may be so corrected before the appeal is docketed in the appellate court, and thereafter while the appeal is pending may be so corrected <em>with leave of the appellate court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) See <em>Weinstock v. Yeshivath Adath B\u2019nai Israel </em>(May 11, 1995), Cuyahoga App. No. 67413, 1995 WL 277067, citing <em>Majnaric v. Majnaric </em>(1975), 46 Ohio App.2d 157, 75 O.O.2d 250, 347 N.E.2d 552; <em>Vavrina v. Greczanik </em>(1974), 40 Ohio App.2d 129, 69 O.O.2d 146, 318 N.E.2d 408; Civ.R. 60; and <em>State ex rel. Henry v. Britt </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 71, 21 O.O.3d 45, 424 N.E.2d 297.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">{\u00b6 75} \u201c* * * The term \u2018clerical mistake\u2019 does not mean that it must be made by a clerk. The phrase merely describes the type of error identified with mistakes in transcription, alteration or omission of any papers and documents which are traditionally or customarily handled or controlled by clerks but which papers or documents may be handled by others. It is a type of mistake or omission mechanical in nature which is apparent on the record and which does not involve a legal decision or judgment by an attorney * * (Citations omitted.) <em>Dentsply Internatl., Inc. v. Kostas </em>(1985), 26 Ohio App.3d 116, 118, 26 OBR 327, 498 N.E.2d 1079.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">{\u00b6 76} Further, Civ.R. 60(A) authorizes the correction of clerical mistakes only. <em>Musca v. Chagrin Falls </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 192, 3 OBR 219, 444 N.E.2d 475. The majority opinion quotes a decision of this court which quoted an earlier case as follows: \u201cA court may not by way of a nunc pro tunc entry, enter of record that which it intended or might have made but which in fact was not made.\u201d <em>McGowan v. Giles, </em>quoting a 1990 case of this court, which, in turn, cited an even earlier case of this court in 1987. The majority, however, ignores this long-established principle. The record preceding the challenged transfer from Judge McDonnell does not indicate the reason that the judge had requested that the case be transferred from her. To \u201csimply add additional information concerning what happened in the trial court,\u201d as the majority described the nunc pro tunc entries, is to enter \u201cthat which it intended or might have made but which in fact was not made.\u201d It is much more than a correction of a clerical error to add this information. Without approval of the appellate court, such an addition is an abuse of the nunc pro tunc entry. The majority, therefore, has clearly contradicted this principle, which this court in at least three cases has adopted: the error or omission must be \u201cmechanical\u201d and \u201capparent on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">{\u00b6 77} Arguably, the transfer from Judge Fuerst might be viewed as different from the second transfer. The motion requesting the judge to recuse herself laid out in the record all the factors that could have justified the transfer. Thus it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>might be argued that the information was in the record; adding it as a reason for the transfer simply made explicit what was previously implicit as a reason. But this argument does not apply to the second transfer. The majority also acknowledges that a \u201cclerical mistake\u201d \u201cdoes not involve a legal decision or judgment by an attorney.\u201d <em>Dentsply Internatl., Inc. v. Kostas, </em>26 Ohio App.3d at 118, 26 OBR 327, 498 N.E.2d 1079. What the nunc pro tunc entry added was a reason in order to comply with a legal requirement. Providing the reason for a legal decision clearly involves \u201ca legal decision or judgment by an attorney.\u201d Reviewed under the <em>Kostas </em>criterion, this record contains no evidence of a clerical mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">{\u00b6 78} The majority argues, however, that \u201cthe nunc pro tunc entries do not change the substance of the previous orders which reassigned the case from one judge to another due to recusal.\u201d Contrasting the explicit language of Sup.R. 4 with the purpose of Civ. R. 60(A), one must conclude that if the administrative judge fails to provide a \u201cjustifiable reason\u201d for a transfer at the time the transfer is made, then that order fails to state the substantive reason the transfer was made: it fails to state why the action was actually taken. Allowing the court to thereafter state, through a nunc pro tunc, the substantive reason for its earlier action allows an end run and undermines the purpose of Civ.R. 60(A). <em>Brickman, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">{\u00b6 79} The majority cites to App.R. 9(E), which it interprets to also permit the trial court in this case to enter its two nunc pro tunc entries. I do not agree with this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">{\u00b6 80} There are two kinds of omissions: (1) where what occurred is omitted and (2) where nothing occurred to be reported. If the administrative judge had written out an explanation for his transfer but the docket failed to include this statement, then this omission could be corrected pursuant to App.R. 9(E). Here, however, no reason was ever given when the case was transferred. A reason was added later during a limited remand for a specific purpose \u2014 which did not include giving a reason to transfer two cases. The second example is not an acceptable correction of the record. App.R. 9(E) refers only to omissions from the record, not to legal errors in documents contained within the record. For example, in a case sent back on limited remand, a trial court may not add reasons to its original decision granting summary judgment. Such an addition would change the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">{\u00b6 81} Such later corrections would defeat the purpose for requiring reasons for transfers in the first place. To allow a correction after the appellant has filed an appeal permits administrative judges to dally and hide their reasons, although that did not happen here. Trial judges should not have to wait upon an appeal being filed to know why a case is transferred. Such transfers affect not only the two judges directly involved in the transfer. They can affect the fairness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>system. Requiring reasons provides a check on that system, but that check is compromised if reasons are not required from the beginning and if there is no opportunity to scrutinize them without the extra burden of filing an appeal. The purpose of App.R. 9(E) is not to give judges a second chance, just as it is not the purpose to add to the burden of appellants. If correcting clerical errors after the appeal is docketed requires leave from the appellate court under Civ.R. 60(A), it would be incongruous to allow the court under App.R. 9(E) to add to the record what was never there except perhaps in the mind of Zeus.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">{\u00b6 82} In support of its reading of App.R. 9(E), the majority relies on the case of <em>State v. Hankerson </em>(Aug. 5, 1981), Hamilton App. No. C-800542, 1981 WL 9939. In <em>Hankerson, </em>when the trial court entered its nunc pro tunc order \u201cfinding that the goods in question exceeded $150 in value,\u201d the court explained that the change had already been stipulated to by defense counsel. The nunc pro tunc order, therefore, reflected what had actually taken place earlier in the proceedings. This factual scenario is not present in this case: no such stipulation occurred here. Because the facts in <em>Hankerson </em>are inapposite to the facts in this case, it is unpersuasive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">{\u00b6 83} Because at least one of the transfers in this case was improper insofar as it did not include a statement explaining the court\u2019s reason for transferring the case and that explanation was not even implicitly in the record and because the lower court subsequently lost jurisdiction to correct the transfer entries, the court\u2019s dismissal was void. I would therefore sustain these assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">{\u00b6 84} Finally, I disagree with the majority when it says that \u201cbecause the motion to dismiss was properly granted, any error by Judge Russo in failing to rule on the Civ.R. 60(B) motion was harmless.\u201d Because the court lacked jurisdiction to grant a motion, the dismissal was void. The court\u2019s ruling on the 60(B) motion, therefore, is also void for the same reasons the dismissal is void: lack of jurisdiction. I would therefore sustain this assignment of error as well.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-9\">.
