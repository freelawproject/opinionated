(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The extent of the increase depends on the number of qualifying prior convictions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>or strikes. The habitual sexual offender statute prescribes a prison term of 25 years to life for a person who is convicted of one or more of certain specified offenses after having been previously convicted of one of those specified offenses. (\u00a7 667.71.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">We granted review in this case to consider the following sentencing issues under these statutes: (1) whether a conviction for oral copulation with a child who is less than 14 years old and more than 10 years younger than the perpetrator (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c)(1)) is a strike under the Three Strikes law; (2) whether a defendant with a qualifying prior conviction under the habitual sexual offender statute who sustains two new qualifying convictions in one proceeding may receive a separate prison term under section 667.71 for each of the new convictions; and (3) whether a court should apply both the Three Strikes law and the habitual sexual offender statute in determining the sentence of a defendant who meets the criteria of both statutes. We conclude that defendant\u2019s prior conviction under section 288a constitutes a strike, that section 667.71 authorizes imposition of a term for each of his new qualifying convictions, and that his sentence for each new conviction should be determined by applying the provisions of both the Three Strikes law and the habitual sexual offender statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">As relevant here, an information filed July 2, 1996, charged defendant Floyd E. Murphy, Jr., with two counts of violating section 288, subdivision (a)\u2014committing a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d on a child who is less than 14 years old, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of himself or the child. As to each count, the information alleged that in May 1980 defendant sustained two qualifying prior convictions under the Three Strikes law, one for \u201coral copulation with child under 14 years, in violation of Section 288a[, subdivision] (c),\u201d and the other for a \u201cLewd Act with child under 14 years, in violation of Section 288[, subdivision] (a).\u201d The information also alleged that these prior convictions rendered defendant a habitual sexual offender under section 667.71. Finally, the information alleged that the prior conviction under section 288, subdivision (a), constituted a \u201cserious felony\u201d conviction for enhancement purposes under section 667, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">After hearing the evidence, the jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts. Defendant waived trial on the alleged prior convictions and admitted that he had previously been convicted under section 288a, subdivision (c), of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>\u201coral copulation on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d and under section 288, subdivision (a), of \u201clewd conduct with a child under the age of 14 years.\u201d The trial court sentenced defendant to a total unstayed prison term of 50 years to life, consisting of a consecutive term of 25 years to life for each conviction. The court explained: \u201cNow, that sentence is pursuant to the provisions of [section] 667 subdivision] (b) through subdivision] (i) [the Three Strikes law]. It\u2019s also subject to the provisions of [section] 667.71</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">5?</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">On appeal, defendant argued in part that the trial court committed the following sentencing errors: (1) treating his prior conviction under section 288a, subdivision (c), as a strike under the Three Strikes law; (2) relying on section 667.71 to impose a consecutive term for each of his new convictions; and (3) sentencing him under both section 667.71 and the Three Strikes law. The Court of Appeal rejected all of these arguments, finding that defendant\u2019s prior conviction under section 288a, subdivision (c), constituted a strike under the Three Strikes law, that section 667.71 authorized a consecutive term of 25 years to life for each of defendant\u2019s new convictions, and that each of those terms had to be tripled under the Three Strikes law (\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2)(A)(i)) because defendant had two prior strikes. For several reasons, however, it vacated defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing, directing the trial court to consider various sentencing issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">We then granted defendant\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">I. <em>Defendant\u2019s Section 288a Conviction Is a Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\"><em>A </em>strike under the Three Strikes law is a prior conviction for any offense that, as of June 30, 1993 (\u00a7 667, subd. (h)), was \u201cdefined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 as a violent felony or . . . defined in subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7 as a serious felony in this state.\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (d)(1).) (la) In arguing that defendant\u2019s prior conviction under section 288a, subdivision (c), for oral copulation with a child under 14 years of age is a strike, the Attorney General relies principally on subdivision (c)(6) of section 1192.7 (section 1192.7(c)(6)). Under section 1192.7(c)(6), a \u201clewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d is a \u201cserious\u201d felony. Citing <em>People v. Henderson </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 1235 [241 Cal.Rptr. 461], the Attorney General argues that an act of oral copulation with a child under 14 years of age is lewd per se, i.e., it necessarily constitutes a lewd act on a child within the meaning of section 1192.7(c)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Defendant disagrees, arguing that the language of section 1192.7(c)(6)\u2014 \u201clewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d\u2014is an \u201cobvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>reference ... to a violation of section 288, subdivision (a).\u201d The latter section provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who willfully and lewdly commits any lewd or lascivious act. . . upon or with the body, or any part or member thereof, of a child who is under the age of 14 years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that person or the child, is guilty of a felony . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 288, subd. (a).) Defendant reasons that because this language \u201cclosely matches\u201d the language of section 1192.7(c)(6), \u201cthe \u2018serious felony\u2019 \u201d that section 1192.7(c)(6) defines \u201cis a violation of section 288, subdivision (a).\u201d Defendant then asserts that because section 288, subdivision (a), \u201cnecessarily includes the specific intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify the lust, passions or sexual desires of one of the participants\u201d and oral copulation of a child under section 288a, subdivision (c), is \u201ca <em>general intent </em>crime,\u201d \u201cit is possible to commit a violation of section 288a, subdivision (c) <em>without </em>committing a lewd or lascivious act upon a child under 14.\u201d Thus, defendant asserts, his conviction under section 288a, subdivision (c), is not a \u201cserious felony\u201d conviction under section 1192.7(c)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">As in any case involving statutory interpretation, our fundamental task here is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent so as to effectuate the law\u2019s purpose. <em>(White </em>v. <em>Ultramar, Inc. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 572 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 981 P.2d 944].) We begin by examining the statute\u2019s words, giving them a plain and commonsense meaning. <em>(Garcia </em>v. <em>McCutchen </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 476 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 319, 940 P.2d 906].) We do not, however, consider the statutory language \u201cin isolation.\u201d <em>(Lungren v. Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].) Rather, we look to \u201cthe entire substance of the statute ... in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision .... [Citation.]\u201d <em>(West Pico Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific Finance Loans </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 594, 608 [86 Cal.Rptr. 793, 469 P.2d 665].) That is, we construe the words in question \u201c \u2018in context, keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We must harmonize \u201cthe various parts of a statutory enactment ... by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.\u201d <em>(Moyer v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224]; see also <em>Woods v. Young </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 315, 323 [279 Cal.Rptr. 613, 807 P.2d 455]; <em>Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>County of Riverside </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 84, 91 [255 Cal.Rptr. 670, 767 P.2d 1148]; <em>Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Applying these principles, we disagree with defendant. We first observe that defendant\u2019s argument is inconsistent with the plain language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>section 1192.7(c)(6). An act of oral copulation on a child under 14 years of age by a person more than 10 years older than the child is a lewd or lascivious act under the common and ordinary meaning of those words.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, as defendant acknowledges, section 1192.7(c)(6) contains \u201cno direct reference to section 288.\u201d By contrast, both the electorate and the Legislature have enacted other criminal statutes that define the triggering conduct or circumstance by express reference to a lewd and/or lascivious act on a child \u201cin violation of [s]ection 288.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(E) [\u201clewd or lascivious act upon the person of a child under the age of 14 years in violation of Section 288\u201d], 999/, subd. (a) [\u201clewd acts on a child under 14, in violation of Section 288\u201d], 1202.1, subd. (e)(6) [\u201c[l]ewd or lascivious acts with a child in violation of Section 288\u201d], 2962, subd. (e)(2)(I) [\u201c[l]ewd acts on a child under the age of 14 years in violation of Section 288\u201d], 11160, subd. (d)(20) [\u201c[l]ewd and lascivious acts with a child, in violation of Section 288\u201d].) Thus, the electorate and the Legislature have both shown that they know how to use language expressly requiring a violation of section 288 when that is their intent. The omission of such language from section 1192.7(c)(6)\u2014which the voters enacted by initiative and the Legislature subsequently amended\u2014undermines defendant\u2019s assertion that it \u201cobvious [ly] refer[s] . . . to a violation of section 288, subdivision (a).\u201d Indeed, defendant concedes that this omission \u201cargufably]\u201d shows an \u201cinten[t] to broaden the number and type of acts that f[a]ll within the purview of\u2019 section 1192.7(c)(6) beyond those acts within section 288\u2019s scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In resisting the statute\u2019s plain language, defendant relies in part on the Legislature\u2019s 1986 revision of section 1192.7(c)(6). As originally enacted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>1982 through Proposition. 8, section 1192.7(c)(6) defined the term \u201cserious felony\u201d to include \u201clewd acts on a child under the age of 14 years.\u201d (Former \u00a7 1192.7(c)(6), added by Prop. 8, \u00a7 7, enacted by voters, Primary Elec. (June 8, 1982).) In 1986, the Legislature revised this provision into its current form: \u201clewd <em>or lascivious </em>act on a child under the age of 14 years.\u201d (\u00a7 1192.7(c)(6), as amended by Stats. 1986, ch. 489, \u00a7 1, p. 1809, italics added.) According to defendant, the amended statute\u2019s \u201cuse [of] the precise statutory language from the definition of a violation of section 288, subdivision (a)\u201d shows that the Legislature \u201cintended [section 1192.7(c)(6)] to identify ... the felony defined in section 288, subdivision (a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">We find defendant\u2019s analysis unpersuasive. Defendant is correct that the amended version of section 1192.7(c)(6) precisely matched <em>some </em>of the language of section 288, subdivision (a): the single phrase, \u201clewd or lascivious act.\u201d However, it did not match <em>all </em>of section 288, subdivision (a)\u2019s language; as relevant here, it omitted the requirement that the perpetrator acted \u201cwith the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that person or the child . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 288, subd. (a).) By contrast, the same 1986 legislation also reworded subdivision (c)(18) of section 1192.7 to <em>completely </em>\u201cduplicated the definition of first degree burglary in effect at the time . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 764, 768 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 117, 919 P.2d 731].) This difference suggests that the Legislature did not, as defendant asserts, intend the 1986 revision of section 1192.7(c)(6) \u201cto identify ... the felony defined in section 288, subdivision (a).\u201d Had that been the Legislature\u2019s intent, it most likely would have either expressly referenced a violation of section 288 or, as it did in simultaneously revising the subdivision relating to first degree burglary, incorporated <em>all </em>of section 288, subdivision (a)\u2019s language.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>In support of his interpretation, defendant also suggests that limiting section 1192.7(c)(6) to violations of section 288, subdivision (a), is consistent with the structure of section 1192.7, subdivision (c). According to defendant, \u201c[a]ll of the other \u2018serious felonies\u2019 set forth in subdivision (c) of section 1192.7 describe specific offenses, or offenses that are committed in a specific manner .... There is no other \u2018serious felony\u2019 listed in subdivision (c) of section 1192.7 where a broad category of <em>conduct </em>is proscribed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Defendant\u2019s argument fails to recognize that in prior decisions construing section 1192.7 we \u201c \u2018rejected the view that sectionf] . . . 1192.7 consists] only of specific statutory offenses and enhancements. In so doing, [we] noted that although Proposition 8\u2019s serious felony enhancement provisions appear to be largely based upon section 12021.1, subdivision (b)\u2019s list of violent offenses, they also include items describing nonviolent criminal conduct which do not precisely correspond to the elements of any preexisting criminal offense. [Citations.] [We] reasoned [that] the inclusion of these items evidenced the voter\u2019s intention to deter certain criminal conduct regardless of whether it refers to specific criminal offenses because it is perceived as dangerous and deserving of additional punishment when committed by recidivists. [We] therefore concluded [that] the enhancement provisions enacted by Proposition 8 refer to the criminal <em>conduct </em>described therein, <em>not </em>to specific criminal <em>offenses </em>and thus these provisions apply whenever the prosecution pleads and proves the specified conduct. [Citation.]\u2019 (Italics in original.) [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Equarte </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 456, 463-464 [229 Cal.Rptr. 116, 722 P.2d 890].)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Defendant also relies on our decision in <em>Martinez, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 434. Citing <em>Martinez, </em>he asserts that \u201c[a]n act with an underage child becomes \u2018lewd or lascivious\u2019 depending entirely upon the sexual motivation and intent with which it is committed.\u201d \u201cAccordingly,\u201d defendant asserts, \u201cto constitute a \u2018lewd or lascivious act on a child under 14 years\u2019 [within the meaning of section 1192.7(c)(6)], there is a specific intent that must accompany the act. That specific intent element is entirely missing from a violation of section 288a.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Defendant misconstrues <em>Martinez. </em>There, the defendant argued that section 288\u2019s express terms\u2014\u201cany lewd or lascivious act\u201d committed \u201cwith the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of [the perpetrator] or the child\u201d\u2014require proof of <em>both </em>an \u201cinherently\u201d lewd or lascivious act <em>and </em>the specified \u201csexual \u2018intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 442.) We rejected this argument and reaffirmed the long-held view that \u201c \u2018any touching\u2019 of an underage child committed with the intent to sexually arouse either the defendant or the child\u201d establishes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>section 288 violation. <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 442.) As defendant observes, in reaching this conclusion, we stated: \u201c[W]e can only conclude that the touching of an underage child is \u2018lewd or lascivious\u2019 and \u2018lewdly\u2019 performed depending entirely upon the sexual motivation and intent with which it is committed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 449.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument takes this statement out of context. As our opinion explained, we granted review in <em>Martinez </em>\u201cfor the limited purpose of determining the acts necessary to sustain a conviction under . . . section 288.\u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 438.) In making this determination, we stressed the \u201cbasic purpose\u201d of that statute: \u201cto provide children with \u2018special protection\u2019 from sexual exploitation\u201d because they \u201care \u2018uniquely susceptible\u2019 to such abuse\u201d and \u201csuffer profound harm whenever they are perceived and used as objects of sexual desire. [Citation.] . . . [S]uch concerns cannot be satisfied unless the kinds of sexual misconduct that result in criminal liability are greatly expanded where children are concerned.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 443-444.) We found this purpose reflected in section 288\u2019s \u201cbroad and amorphous language,\u201d which \u201cdiffers markedly from other statutes in the same \u2018family\u2019 of crimes. [Citation.] In particular, other felony sex offenses prohibit the commission of certain clearly specified acts . . . [and] describen the criminal act in precise and clinical terms.\u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at pp. 442-443.) We concluded that the absence of such precise language in section 288 \u201cwas deliberate\u201d and disclosed the Legislature\u2019s intent \u201cto include sexually motivated conduct not made criminal elsewhere in the scheme. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 443.) We then explained that although \u201cchildren are routinely cuddled, disrobed, stroked, examined, and groomed as part of a normal and healthy upbringing,\u201d these \u201cintimate acts may also be undertaken for the purpose of sexual arousal. Thus, depending upon the actor\u2019s motivation, innocent or sexual, such behavior may fall within or without the protective purposes of section 288.\u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 450.) Given all of these considerations, we reaffirmed that \u201cthe \u2018gist\u2019 \u201d of the crime section 288 defines is \u201cthe defendant\u2019s intent to sexually exploit a child, not the nature of the offending act. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>Cal.4th at p. 444.) We thus concluded that \u201cthe lewd character of an activity cannot logically be determined separate and apart from the perpetrator\u2019s intent. . . . [A]ny other construction could exempt a potentially broad range of sexually motivated and harmful contact from the statute\u2019s reach. In light of the statutory purpose, we cannot conceive that the Legislature intended such a result. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Understood in this context, the statement defendant cites from <em>Martinez, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at page 450, does not establish that whether an act is \u201clewd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>or lascivious\u201d <em>within the meaning of section 1192.7(c)(6) </em>\u201cdepend[s] entirely upon the [perpetrator\u2019s] sexual motivation and intent.\u201d <em>Martinez </em>defined \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d <em>only </em>for purposes of applying section 288 and in light of that statute\u2019s basic purpose: to expand the kinds of criminal sexual misconduct where children are concerned by reaching sexually motivated conduct not otherwise made criminal. Section 288 thus is part of a statutory scheme that recognizes that some touchings of children are <em>always </em>harmful and improper, whereas others may or may not be, depending upon the actor\u2019s intent. To address the former, the Legislature passed statutes\u2014like section 288a, subdivision (c)(1)\u2014that precisely describe the inherently harmful acts and prohibit them in all circumstances. To address the latter, the Legislature passed section 288. And to implement this statutory scheme, <em>Martinez </em>reaffirmed a broad definition of a lewd or lascivious act that includes <em>any </em>touching committed with the intent section 288 describes, so as to <em>extend </em>protection <em>beyond </em>the inherently lewd acts precisely described and prohibited by the other statutes in the family of felony sex offenses. Defendant thus errs in now attempting to use Martinez\u2019s <em>expanded </em>definition to <em>narrow </em>section 1192.7(c)(6) and to <em>exclude </em>from its scope oral copulation on a child, which is an act that is always harmful, always improper, and always lewd, regardless of the perpetrator\u2019s intent. Although section 1192.7(c)(6) certainly includes acts that, because of the perpetrator\u2019s intent, are lewd or lascivious under <em>Martinez </em>and section 288, it is not limited to those acts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Indeed, our decision in <em>People v. Pearson </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 351 [228 Cal.Rptr. 509, 721 P.2d 595], which defendant cites, is inconsistent with his argument that precisely described criminal acts like oral copulation on a child are not lewd or lascivious where the perpetrator lacks the intent section 288 specifies. In <em>Pearson, </em>we held that the offense section 288 describes \u201cis not a lesser included offense of statutory sodomy\u201d with a child under the age of 14 years (\u00a7 286). <em>(Pearson, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 355.) Arguing to the contrary, the defendant in <em>Pearson </em>asserted \u201cthat \u2018it is inconceivable that a person can engage in sodomy on a child without at the same time committing a lewd and lascivious act on that child.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 356.) We agreed that defendant\u2019s assertion was \u201caccurate in a moral sense . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, we also \u201cfound . . . that as sodomy is a general intent crime, while a lewd act on a child [under section 288] requires proof of the specific intent\u201d that the statute describes, \u201cthe latter is not necessarily included in the former.\u201d <em>(People v. Griffin </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1011, 1030 [251 Cal.Rptr. 643, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>761 P.2d 103].) We find no evidence that when the voters enacted section 1192.7(c)(6) or when the Legislature amended it, they understood and used the term \u201clewd\u201d other than in its moral sense, which unquestionably includes defendant\u2019s act of orally copulating a child under 14 years of age. Indeed, in other statutes, the Legislature has characterized oral copulation on a child as \u201csexual assault\u201d (\u00a7 11165.1, subd. (a); Evid. Code, \u00a7 1036.2; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 128, subd. (d), 1219, subd. (d)(1)), \u201csexual abuse\u201d (\u00a7 11165.1, subd. (a)), a \u201csexually violent offense\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600.1), and \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d (\u00a7 1203.066, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In contrast, defendant\u2019s construction of section 1192.7(c)(6) would produce a result inconsistent with what he maintains was the voters\u2019 intent in enacting section 1192.7: \u201cto distinguish between those felony charges that were deemed \u2018serious,\u2019 and those that were not, and to prohibit plea bargaining for the former.\u201d Defendant fails to explain how this purpose would be served by excluding from the statute\u2019s reach an act of oral copulation on a child under 14 years of age by a person more than 10 years older than the child. Such an act, with its destructive impact on the child, is no less serious under the theoretical circumstance defendant suggests, i.e., the perpetrator\u2019s intent is \u201csadistic\u201d rather than \u201csexual.\u201d The same is true of an act of sodomy on a child under 14 years of age by a person more than 10 years older than the child (\u00a7 286, subd. (c)(1)); \u201c[a] child victim suffers no less from . . . sodomy undertaken for the purpose of punishment than he or she does from . . . sodomy performed for the purpose of sexual gratification.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Whitham </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1293 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 571].) Yet, under defendant\u2019s interpretation, sodomy on a child also would not be a \u201cserious felony\u201d within the meaning of section 1192.7 absent proof of the perpetrator\u2019s \u201csexual\u201d intent. Thus, defendant\u2019s construction of section 1192.7(c)(6) would not serve the very statutory purpose he identifies, i.e., to specify those serious felonies for which plea bargaining is prohibited. Moreover, because we cannot conceive that the voters or the Legislature intended to make the perpetrator\u2019s intent determinative of whether oral copulation and sodomy on a child are lewd or lascivious acts under section 1192.7(c)(6), we do not agree with defendant that his construction is one that the statute\u2019s \u201c \u2018language and the circumstances of its application may reasonably permit.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s suggestion that our construction of section 1192.7(c)(6) \u201crenders the statute ambiguous in the extreme\u201d and \u201cunconstitutionally vague.\u201d Defendant argues that a criminal \u201cwhose victim is under 14 is left to guess at whether a conviction he suffers will be treated as a \u2018strike\u2019 in the future.\u201d We need only respond that defendant acted under no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>such uncertainty here; he cannot reasonably or justifiably maintain that <em>he </em>was \u201cleft to guess\u201d as to whether orally copulating a child under 14 was a lewd or lascivious act. Indeed, he does not even argue otherwise. Rather, in raising the vagueness issue, he states: \u201cFor example, the uncertainty in a felony conviction of section 647.6, could not be resolved at the time of the conviction,\u201d but would \u201cdepend upon what information was put in the record, and how a court in the future viewed the defendant\u2019s intent.\u201d  However, a defendant who falls \u201csquarely within\u201d the reach of a statute lacks standing to challenge its vagueness as it \u201cmight be hypothetically applied to the conduct of others . . . .\u201d <em>(Parker </em>v. <em>Levy </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 733, 756 [94 S.Ct. 2547, 2561, 41 L.Ed.2d 439].) We \u201care not obliged\u201d to consider every conceivable situation that might arise under a statute\u2019s language if we can give it a \u201c \u2018reasonable and practical construction\u2019 \u201d that accords with the drafters\u2019 probable intent and encompasses the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>(Bowland v.

Here, because section 1192.7(c)(6) \u201cclearly applies to [defendant\u2019s] conduct,\u201d and he does not argue that it improperly prohibits a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, he may not challenge it on vagueness grounds. <em>(Tobe v. City of Santa Ana </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1069, 1095 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 402, 892 P.2d 1145].)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Thus, we conclude that the trial court correctly found defendant\u2019s prior conviction under section 288a, subdivision (c), to be a strike under the Three Strikes law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">II. <em>Section 667.71 Permits a Separate Term for Each New Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Section 667.71, subdivision (a), defines a \u201chabitual sexual offender\u201d as \u201ca person who has been previously convicted of one or more of\u2019 certain specified offenses \u201cand who is convicted in the present proceeding of one of those offenses.\u201d A person who meets this statutory definition \u201cis punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 25 years to life.\u201d (\u00a7 667.71, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Defendant maintains, contrary to the Court of Appeal, that section 667.71 does not authorize imposition of a separate prison term for each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>his new convictions, but authorizes only a single term of 25 years to life. He argues that \u201ca defendant sentenced under section 667.71 is not being sentenced for each of his current offenses, but rather for his status as a habitual sexual offender. Once that status is established [by proof of the requisite prior and current convictions], the punishment under subdivision (b) of section 667.71 is set at 25 years to life. There is nothing in subdivision (b) of section 667.71 that indicates a defendant is to receive a separate term of 25 years to life for <em>each </em>new qualifying sexual offense. Rather, the new offenses are used to establish the defendant\u2019s status as a \u2018habitual sexual offender\u2019, and once that status is established, the defendant\u2019s punishment is set.\u201d Thus, defendant contends that at most, he may be punished for his current convictions based on his \u201cstatus\u201d under section 667.71 as a habitual sexual offender \u201cby a single indeterminate term of 25 years to life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 234 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 903, 893 P.2d 1224] <em>{Jenkins), </em>we rejected a similar argument in applying section 667.7. Section 667.7, subdivision (a), defines \u201ca habitual offender\u201d as \u201c[a]ny person convicted of a felony in which the person inflicted great bodily injury as provided in Section 12022.53 or 12022.7, or personally used force which was likely to produce great bodily injury, who has served two or more prior separate prison terms as defined in Section 667.5 for\u201d certain listed offenses. Under the statute as relevant here, a habitual offender who has served two qualifying prior separate prison terms \u201cshall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 667.7, subd. (a)(1).) The defendant in <em>Jenkins </em>was a habitual offender under section <em>661.1 </em>because after serving two prior qualifying separate prison terms, he was convicted in a new proceeding of three qualifying offenses. <em>(Jenkins, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 239.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Among the issues we addressed in <em>Jenkins </em>was \u201cwhether a defendant, who is convicted of a number of serious felonies, each of which separately qualifies the defendant for a life sentence under section 667.7, may be sentenced to only a single life sentence under section 667.7, or may be sentenced to consecutive life sentences.\u201d <em>(Jenkins, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 254.) We held that the statute permits a consecutive life sentence for each new conviction, explaining: \u201cSection 667.7, like other recidivist punishment statutes that provide for more severe sentences for repeat offenders, specifies the applicable sentence for a present conviction of a qualifying felony committed by a defendant with a recidivist criminal history. <em>Although the defendant\u2019s status invokes the increased sentence, it is the new criminal conduct\u2014and in particular one or more specific felony convictions\u2014for which the defendant presently is being punished. </em>Nothing in the language of section 667.7 precludes imposition of additional terms consecutive to the habitual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>offender life term when those additional terms arise from separate, independent counts of current substantive crimes, and section 669 explicitly provides, in relevant part, that \u2018[l]ife sentences, whether with or without the possibility of parole, may be imposed to run consecutively with one another . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Jenkins, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 254-255, italics added.) In <em>Jenkins, </em>we further noted that although section 667.7 permitted consecutive sentencing for the defendant\u2019s current convictions, \u201cnothing\u201d in its language \u201ccompelled]\u201d consecutive sentencing; thus, \u201c[i]n imposing such life terms, the trial court retain[ed] discretion under section 669 to order that these terms be served either concurrently or consecutively.\u201d <em>(Jenkins, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Our reasoning in <em>Jenkins </em>applies equally to section 667.71, which is a recidivist punishment statute like section 667.7. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe statutory scheme in section 667.7 is very different from that set forth in section 667.71,\u201d we agree with the Court of Appeal that the two statutes operate similarly. Both prescribe an indeterminate sentence for a defendant who is convicted of a listed offense after having been previously convicted of those listed offenses (and, under \u00a7 667.7, having served at least two prior separate prison terms for the prior convictions). Thus, although, as defendant argues, his status as a habitual sexual offender invokes the increased sentence under section 667.71, it is his new criminal conduct\u2014and in particular one or more specific felony convictions\u2014for which he presently is being punished. Defendant can point to nothing in section 667.71\u2019s language that precludes imposition of additional terms consecutive to the habitual sexual offender indeterminate term when those additional terms arise from separate, independent counts of current substantive crimes. And section 669 explicitly provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[l]ife sentences, whether with or without the possibility of parole, may be imposed to run consecutively with one another . . . .\u201d Following <em>Jenkins, </em>we therefore conclude that section 667.71 authorizes separate consecutive sentences of 25 years to life for each of defendant\u2019s new convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We reject defendant\u2019s claim that this conclusion \u201cdoes not comport with [section 667.7l\u2019s] legislative history.\u201d In making this argument, defendant cites the Legislative Counsel\u2019s description of the 1994 legislation that enacted the applicable version of the statute. The Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest for that legislation states in relevant part: \u201cUnder existing law, a habitual sexual offender, as defined, is punishable by 25 years in the state prison or, under certain circumstances, 25 years to life . . . . HQ This bill would, instead, specify that a habitual sexual offender is punishable by imprisonment in state prison for 25 years to life . . . .\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 26 (1993-1994 1st Ex. Sess.) 5 Stats. 1994, Summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Dig., p. 575.) Defendant asserts that \u201c[n]owhere\u201d in this summary \u201cdid the Legislative Counsel indicate that a habitual sexual offender could be punished by 25 years to life for <em>each </em>new conviction.\u201d However, defendant cites nothing in the summary that indicates to the contrary, i.e., that a habitual sexual offender may <em>not </em>receive a life sentence for each new conviction. The legislative history simply does not speak to this question. Thus, nothing supports defendant\u2019s claim that the conclusion <em>Jenkins </em>compels fails to comport with section 667.71\u2019s legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Defendant also contends that in construing section 667.71, we should not \u201canalogiz[e] to section 667.7,\u201d but instead \u201cshould look at section 667.72.\u201d He asserts that the latter statute, which was \u201cenacted at the same time as section 667.71 [citation], provides for a single determinate term of 25 years\u201d for a \u201c \u2018habitual child molester,\u2019 \u201d i.e., someone who \u201chas previously served a prior prison term for a forcible child molestation conviction and \u2018is convicted in the present proceeding of the same offense against at least <em>two separate victims.\u2019\u2019 </em>[Citation.]\u201d Defendant then argues that if section 667.71 authorizes a consecutive life term for each new conviction, a defendant with a qualifying prior conviction \u201cgets <em>less time </em>for two new violations against <em>separate </em>victims (under \u00a7 667.72) than he does for two new violations against the <em>same </em>victim. (\u00a7 667.71.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">For a number of reasons, we reject defendant\u2019s argument. First, section 667.72 is no longer effective; the Legislature repealed it in October 1999, noting that the conduct it punished is \u201csubject to greater punishment under Section 667.71 . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1999, ch. 706, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 17.) Thus, the Legislature clearly recognized and intended that section 667.71\u2019s application would result in greater punishment than would application of former section 667.72.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Second, defendant errs in suggesting that even before the repeal, a defendant who committed two new qualifying offenses against <em>separate </em>victims would <em>necessarily </em>be sentenced under former section 667.72 instead of 667.71. Subdivision (c) of former section 667.72 provided: \u201cAt the request of the prosecutor and in lieu of the punishment specified in subdivision (b), the court shall instead order the defendant be punished according to Sections 1170.1 and 677.6, or according to Section 677.7 or <em>667.71, </em>if applicable.\u201d (Stats. 1993, ch. 558, \u00a7 1, p. 2797, italics added.) The relevant legislative history explains that in enacting former section 667.72, the Legislature recognized that \u201cpersons could be sentenced to a longer term of imprisonment under\u201d other statutes and included subdivision (c) to enable prosecutors to \u201cincapacitate] certain contemptible criminals for as long as possible . . . (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 526 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) June 22, 1993, p. 4.) Thus, the Legislature intended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>section 667.71 would apply where it required greater punishment than former section 667.72.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Third, defendant cites nothing to support his assertion that under former section 667.72, a defendant committing two new qualifying offenses against <em>separate </em>victims would receive only a \u201csingle\u201d determinate term of 25 years, rather than a term for each offense. Nothing in that section expressly provided for only a single term, and we have found no reported case addressing that (or any other) question under former section 667.72.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, courts have held that similar language in section 667.61, subdivision (e)(5)\u2014which triggers a life term for a defendant \u201cconvicted in the present case or cases of committing a[] [specified] offense . . . against more than one victim\u201d\u2014authorizes a separate life term for each victim. <em>(People </em>v. <em>DeSimone </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 693, 698-700 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 73] <em>(DeSimone), People v. Murphy </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 35, 40-41 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 130]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 693, 719 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 506].) These decisions undercut the fundamental premise of defendant\u2019s argument under former section 667.72 (although we express no opinion about their correctness).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In any event, the evolution of section 667.7l\u2019s language shows that the Legislature did not intend the applicable version of section 667.71 to operate like former section 667.72. In language similar to former section 667.72, section 667.71 originally defined a habitual sexual offender as a person who had served at least one prior prison term for a listed offense and who was \u201c[c]onvicted in the present proceeding\u201d of either \u201ctwo separate [listed] offenses . . . against two separate victims\u201d or \u201cat least three separate [listed] offenses . . . against at least three separate victims.\u201d (Stats. 1993, ch. 590, \u00a7 2, p. 3096.) In 1994, the Legislature amended the definition of a habitual sexual offender to its current form, i.e., \u201ca person who has been previously convicted of one or more of the [listed] offenses . . . and who is convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>in the present proceeding of one of those offenses.\u201d (\u00a7 667.71, subd. (a), as amended by Stats. 1994, ch. 447, \u00a7 2, p. 2414 and Stats. 1994, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 14, \u00a7 2, p. 8572.) Because the Legislature substantially revised section 667.71 by deleting language similar to that in former section 667.72, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the two statutes should be interpreted similarly.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Thus, we conclude section 667.71 authorizes a separate term of 25 years to life for each of defendant\u2019s new convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">II. <em>Sentencing Under Both the Three Strikes Law and Section 667.71 Is Proper</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Defendant also contends that the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the trial court could determine his sentence by applying both the Three Strikes law and section 667.71. Primarily, he argues that section 654 \u201cis applicable in this circumstance to limit the trial court to one sentencing scheme.\u201d Section 654, subdivision (a), provides in relevant part: \u201cAn act or omission that is punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more than one provision.\u201d Defendant asserts that applying both section 667.71 and the Three Strikes law violates this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Defendant\u2019s claim fails under <em>People v. Coronado </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 145 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 906 P.2d 1232] <em>(Coronado). </em>There, we held in part that section 654 did not prohibit use of a prior conviction and resulting prior prison term both to elevate a driving under the influence charge to a felony under Vehicle Code former section 23175 and to trigger a one-year sentence enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b), for service of a prior prison term. <em>(Coronado, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 149.) In reaching this result, we first explained that \u201c[b]y its own terms, section 654 applies only to an \u2018act or omission\u2019 made punishable in different ways by different statutes.\u201d <em>(Coronado, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 156.) We then discussed <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 517 [253 Cal.Rptr. 633] <em>(Rodriguez), </em>which \u201c[i]n a closely analogous context. . . reasoned that prior prison term enhancements are not imposed for \u2018acts or omissions\u2019 within the meaning of [section 654]: . . . \u2018Both sections 666 and 667.5 apply to facts, not acts; they relate to the <em>status </em>of the recidivist offender engaging in criminal conduct, not to the conduct itself.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Coronado, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 157.) Finding this reasoning \u201cpersuasive,\u201d we explained: \u201c[P]rior prison <em>term </em>enhancements are attributable to the defendant\u2019s status as a repeat offender [citations]; they are not attributable to the underlying criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>conduct which gave rise to the defendant\u2019s prior and current convictions. Because the repeat offender (recidivist) enhancement imposed here does not implicate multiple punishment of an act or omission, section 654 is inapplicable.\u201d <em>(Coronado, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 158; see also <em>DeSimone, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.4th at p. 700 [\u201cpenalty provision which relates solely to a defendant\u2019s status as a repeat offender does not punish an \u2018act or omission\u2019 and is not subject to section 654\u201d].) Similarly, as defendant points out, \u201cthe purpose of section 667.71 is <em>not </em>to punish especially aggravated instances of a particular crime,\u201d but to \u201cserve[] the same purpose as the \u2018Three Strikes\u2019 law, which is to punish recidivism.\u201d Thus, both the Three Strikes law and section 667.71 apply to the <em>fact </em>of defendant\u2019s recidivism, not to an act or omission within the meaning of section 654. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Benson </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 24, 34 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 294, 954 P.2d 557] [unlike \u00a7 654, \u201cwhich is concerned with the appropriate punishment for \u2018[a]n act or omission that is punishable in different ways,\u2019 the Three Strikes law has, as its central focus, <em>the status </em>of the defendant as a repeat felon\u201d].) Accordingly, under <em>Coronado, </em>application of both does not implicate section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We reject defendant\u2019s assertion that a different analysis applies here because \u201cthe issue\u201d in this case \u201cis not an \u2018enhancement\u2019 of [his] sentence,\u201d but \u201cthe applicability of two separate and distinct methods by which [his] minimum indeterminate term could be calculated.\u201d As we have explained, in <em>Coronado </em>we quoted and endorsed <em>Rodriguez, </em>which found section 654 inapplicable to section 666 because the latter section applies to the fact of a defendant\u2019s recidivist status, not to an act or omission within the meaning of section 654. <em>(Coronado, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 157; <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at p. 519.) In <em>Coronado, </em>we also cited <em>People v. Price </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1277 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 263], which similarly held that section 654 does not apply to section 666. <em>(Coronado, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 157.) Section 666 operates like the Three Strikes law and section 667.71; it does not establish an enhancement, but establishes an alternate and elevated penalty for a petty theft conviction when a recidivist defendant has served a prior term in a penal institution for a listed offense. <em>(People v. White Eagle </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1511, 1517-1518 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 749] <em>(White Eagle); </em>see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Dotson </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 547, 556 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 423, 941 P.2d 56] [\u00a7 1170.12, subd.

The salient point is that imposition of the increased penalties these statutes prescribe depends on a fact\u2014the defendant\u2019s status as a repeat offender\u2014not on an act or omission within the meaning of section 654. (See <em>In re Foss </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 910, 922 [112 Cal.Rptr. 649, 519 P.2d 1073] [increased penalties under habitual offender statutes \u201care attributable to the defendant\u2019s status as a repeat offender\u201d], overruled on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 791, 796-797, fn. 3 [129 Cal.Rptr. 769, 549 P.2d 537].) Section 654 therefore does not apply. (See <em>White Eagle, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 1519 [finding \u00a7 654 inapplicable to sentencing under both Three Strikes law and \u00a7 666]; <em>People v. Sipe </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 468, 488 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 266] [because application of Three Strikes law depends on defendant\u2019s \u201cstatus as a recidivist offender,\u201d \u00a7 654 does not apply].)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The cases defendant cites do not hold to the contrary. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142, 1144-1152 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 753, 857 P.2d 1163] <em>(Jones), </em>we held that in enacting what is now subdivision (a) of section 667, the voters did not intend that a defendant\u2019s sentence would be enhanced for both a prior conviction (under the new statute) <em>and </em>the resulting prison term (under \u00a7 667.5). Because we based this conclusion on the relevant statutory language, we expressly declined to discuss section 654\u2019s impact. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 1152.) In <em>People v. Flournoy </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1695, 1697-1701 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 188] <em>(Flournoy), </em>the court applied <em>Jones\u2019s </em>analysis to hold that multiple enhancements for a single prior rape conviction are not permissible under both section 667.6, subdivision (a), and section 667, subdivision (a). As we did in <em>Jones, </em>the <em>Flournoy </em>court reached its conclusion by interpreting the statutes in light of the voters\u2019 intent and therefore expressly declined to discuss section 654\u2019s effect. <em>(Flournoy, supra, </em>26 Cal.App.4th at p. 1699.) Thus, neither of these decisions supports defendant\u2019s section 654 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">We also reject defendant\u2019s related claim, based on section 1170, subdivision (b), and California Rules of Court, former rule 420(c) (renumbered rule 4.420, eff. Jan. 1, 2001), that sentencing under both the Three Strikes law and section 667.71 violates \u201cthe various proscriptions against dual use of facts for sentencing purposes.\u201d Defendant forfeited this argument by failing to raise it in the Court of Appeal. <em>(Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc. v. San Francisco Airports Com. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 352, 379 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 654, 981 P.2d 499].) Moreover, it fails on its merits. Where the governing statute specifies an upper, middle, and lower term for a crime, section 1170, subdivision (b), prohibits a court from imposing the upper term \u201cby using the fact of any enhancement upon which sentence is imposed . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>California Rules of Court, former rule 420(c) (present rule 4.420) also relates to the use of \u201ca fact charged and found as an enhancement\u201d as a basis for \u201cimposing the upper term . . . .\u201d Neither provision applies in this case, which involves calculation of defendant\u2019s term under the Three Strikes law and section 667.71, not the imposition of an upper term instead of a lower or middle term. (See <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 252, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Defendant also contends that application of both the Three Strikes law and section 667.71 is contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent. In his view, the Three Strikes law and section 667.71 establish entirely separate and alternative sentencing schemes that \u201cserve[] the same purpose . . . , which is to punish recidivism.\u201d Defendant argues that if someone \u201cis subject to sentencing as a \u2018habitual sexual offender\u2019 [under section 667.71], it is almost certain he will also be subject to sentencing under the Three Strikes law. Had the Legislature intended that a habitual sexual offender\u2019s sentence be doubled or tripled in every case under the Three Strikes law, it would have so provided.\u201d Thus, defendant asserts, \u201cit is clear\u201d that section 667.71 and the Three Strikes law \u201cwere intended to operate independently of one another.\u201d Because \u201cthe Legislature, in enacting the Three Strikes law, intended for [it] to operate in lieu of section 667.71,\u201d a defendant \u201cmay be sentenced under either of the two sentencing schemes, but not both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Unlike defendant, we find that the statutes disclose a legislative intent that the Three Strikes law apply <em>in addition to </em>section 667.71. Subdivision (f)(1) of section 667 provides that \u201c[notwithstanding any other law,\u201d the Three Strikes law <em>\u201cshall be applied in every case </em>in which a defendant has a prior felony conviction as defined in subdivision (d).\u201d (Italics added.) Moreover, subdivision (e) of section 667 provides that <em>\u201cin addition to </em>any other enhancement or punishment provisions which may apply,\u201d the sentencing provisions of the Three Strikes law <em>\u201cshall </em>apply where a defendant has a prior felony conviction.\u201d (Italics added.) Through this section, the Three Strikes law \u201cdeclares itself to \u2018apply\u2019 not exclusively, but rather <em>\u2018in addition to </em>any other . . . punishment provisions which may apply\u2019 [citations] . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 247 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365].) Thus, the Legislature has expressly indicated that where a defendant has a qualifying prior felony conviction, the sentencing provisions of the Three Strikes law not only <em>must </em>be applied, they <em>must </em>be applied <em>in addition to </em>any other punishment provisions. \u201c \u2018It is difficult to interpret the language of the statute in any other manner.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Dotson, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 554; see also <em>White Eagle, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1517-1518 [single prior conviction requires both alternate sentencing under \u00a7 666 for petty theft with a prior and doubling under Three Strikes law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Defendant cites nothing in either the Three Strikes law or section 667.71 that indicates the Legislature intended to exclude the latter statute from the mandatory terms of the former. In this regard, until its amendment in 1998, section 667.71 expressly specified the sentencing provisions that were exclusive alternatives to section 667.71. As originally enacted in 1993, before the Legislature passed the Three Strikes law, section 667.71 provided: \u201cAt the request of the prosecutor and in lieu of the punishment specified in [this section], the court shall order that the defendant be punished pursuant to Section 1170.1, 667.6, or 667.7, if applicable.\u201d (Stats. 1993, ch. 590, \u00a7 2, p. 3097 [former \u00a7 667.71, subd. (d)].) The Legislature amended this provision in September 1994, <em>after </em>the Three Strikes law took effect, by adding a reference <em>only </em>to the newly enacted section 667.61; it did not also add a reference to the new Three Strikes law. (Stats. 1994, ch. 447, \u00a7 2, p. 2414 and Stats. 1994, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 14, \u00a7 2, p. 8572; see fn. 7, <em>ante.) </em>This provision was completely deleted in 1998. (Stats. 1998, ch. 925, \u00a7 3.) Nevertheless, the Three Strikes law\u2019s omission from the repealed provision that expressly specified the punishment <em>alternatives </em>to section 667.71 fully supports our conclusion that the Legislature intended the Three Strikes law to operate in addition to, not to the exclusion of, section 667.71.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Under the guise of legislative intent, in his reply brief defendant argues for the first time that the Court of Appeal did not perform the correct sentence calculation under the provisions of the Three Strikes law. The Court of Appeal held that section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(A)(i), requires tripling of the sentence section 667.71 prescribes, so that defendant should receive a sentence of 75 years to life for each of his current offenses. Section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(A)(i), sets the minimum term of a third strike defendant\u2019s indeterminate life sentence under the Three Strikes law at \u201c[t]hree times the term otherwise provided as punishment for each current felony conviction subsequent to the two or more prior felony convictions.\u201d Defendant now contests the Court of Appeal\u2019s calculation, arguing that it \u201cfail[s] to consider that the term to be tripled is the term otherwise provided for the current felony conviction <em>subsequent </em>to the prior convictions.\u201d \u201cIn other words,\u201d defendant asserts, \u201cthe term to be tripled ... is the term to which [he] otherwise would have been sentenced <em>without consideration of his prior convictions,\u201d </em>i.e., \u201cthe principal term referred to in section 1170.1, without reference to the prior convictions.\u201d Thus, defendant argues that for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>his current convictions under section 288, subdivision (a), only the eight-year aggravated term under that section should be tripled. \u201cBy including the prior convictions in the calculation of [his] sentence under section 667.71 and then tripling that term under section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(A)(i), . . . the Court of Appeal misread the legislative intent.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Although we need not address this untimely argument (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 29(b)(1)), we reject it for its lack of merit. First, the plain language of the statute does not support defendant\u2019s statutory construction. As commonly understood, the statutory language in question\u2014\u201csubsequent to the two or more prior felony convictions\u201d\u2014simply identifies the relevant convictions whose terms are to be tripled and distinguishes them from the \u201ctwo or more prior felony convictions\u201d that trigger application of the third strike sentencing provision. (\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2)(A)(i).) It does not, as defendant suggests, direct that the punishment for the identified convictions be determined \u201cwithout consideration of\u2019 or \u201creference to\u201d the prior convictions. Indeed, in other sentencing statutes, the Legislature has shown that when it wants a sentence calculated without consideration of some circumstance, it knows how to use language clearly expressing that intent. (See \u00a7 1170.2 [length of imprisonment for certain inmates shall be determined \u201cwithout consideration of good-time credit\u201d].) The Three Strikes law\u2019s far different language suggests a different legislative intent. Second, defendant\u2019s argument is inconsistent with our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Nguyen </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 197 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 980 P.2d 905], There, we stated that \u201c[t]he common and ordinary meaning\u201d of the statutory phrase, \u201c \u2018the term otherwise provided as punishment,\u2019 \u201d is \u201cthe term that would be imposed in the absence of the Three Strikes law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 205.) Here, of course, the term that would be imposed absent the Three Strikes law is the term section 667.71 prescribes. Thus, the Court of Appeal\u2019s calculation was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We therefore conclude that the Court of Appeal did not err in holding that the trial court could apply both the Three Strikes law and section 667.71 in sentencing defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">At oral argument, the Attorney General asserted that the Three Strikes law mandates consecutive sentencing for defendant\u2019s new crimes because he sustained in this proceeding \u201ca current conviction for more than one felony count not committed on the same occasion, and not arising from the same set of operative facts . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (c)(6).) We leave it to the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>to consider this question on remand in conjunction with other sentencing matters the Court of Appeal identified, including defendant\u2019s request that one or both of his' prior convictions be struck under section 1385 in furtherance of justice. (See <em>People v. Superior Court (Romero) (1996) </em>13 Cal.4th 497 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628].)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">George, C.

In their briefs, the parties cite and discuss the legislative version of the Three Strikes law (\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i)). For convenience, we will do the same in the rest of our opinion. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>because the legislative and initiative versions of the Three Strikes law contain no substantive differences as to the issues before us, our discussion applies equally to both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The dissent errs in asserting that in <em>People v. Martinez </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 434 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 905, 903 P.2d 1037] <em>(Martinez), </em>we based our conclusion that section 288 is violated by any touching of an underage child with the requisite sexual intent on \u201cthe common and ordinary meaning of\u2019 the phrase \u201c \u2018lewd or lascivious act.\u2019 \u201d (Dis. opn. of Mosk, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 161.) On the contrary, in <em>Martinez, </em>we refused to adopt a \u201chyperliteral\u201d reading of this phrase that would contravene legislative intent or produce anomalous results, and instead interpreted it with reference to other language in section 288 that, \u201c[a]s commonly understood, . . . refer[s] to . . . \u2018sexual motivation.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 449.) Regarding the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of the phrase \u201clewd or lascivious act,\u201d we simply said that \u201c[njothing\u201d in it \u201crefers to particular forms of physical contact or sexual activity.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.) To support this conclusion, we noted that \u201c \u2018[t]he relevant dictionary meaning of \u201clewd\u201d is \u201csexually unchaste or licentious,\u201d \u201cdissolute, lascivious,\u201d \u201csuggestive of or tending to moral looseness,\u201d \u201cinciting to sensual desire or imagination,\u201d \u201cindecent, obscene, salacious.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict. (3d ed. 1961) p. 1301.)\u2019 Similarly, the word \u2018lascivious\u2019 means \u2018tending to arouse sexual desire\u2019; it is synonymous with \u2018lewd, lustful,\u2019 \u2018libidinous, salacious.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1274.)\u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 449, fn. 15.) Contrary to the dissent\u2019s view, this discussion and the dictionary definition <em>Martinez </em>cited support our conclusion that oral copulation on a child under 14 years of age by a person more than 10 years older than the child is a lewd or lascivious act as those words are commonly understood.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The dissent makes the same error as defendant in reasoning that the 1986 amendment \u201crendered\u201d section 1192.7(c)(6)\u2019s language \u201cvirtually identical to\u201d that of section 288. (Dis. opn. of Mosk, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 162.) Moreover, unlike the dissent, we find the legislative history of the 1986 amendment inconclusive at best. The dissent cites several legislative reports that state the amendment\u2019s purpose was to \u201cconform\u201d section 1192.7, subdivision (c), to \u201c \u2018the appropriate Penal Code section provisions.\u2019 \u201d (Dis. opn. of Mosk, J., <em>post, </em>at pp. 162-163.) However, as the dissent also notes, one of those reports also explained that after the amendment, the statute, which originally applied only to \u201c \u2018[specified lewd acts\u2019 . . . would apply as well to \u2018 \u201clascivious\u201d acts per P.C. Sec. 288.\u2019 \u201d (Dis. opn. of Mosk, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 162.) These statements can reasonably be read as indicating a legislative intent simply to expand section 1192.7(c)(6) to include all section 288 violations, not to restrict it only to such violations. Given the absence of a reference to section 288 in section 1192.7(c)(6), the significant difference we have identified in the language of the two statutes, and the anomalous consequences of the dissent\u2019s interpretation (see <em>post, </em>p. 148), we therefore do not believe the legislative history of the 1986 amendment justifies reading section 288\u2019s express and detailed sexual intent requirement into the more broadly worded section 1192.7(c)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Responding to one of the defendant\u2019s arguments in <em>Martinez, </em>we cited section 1192.7, subdivision (c), as one of the many statutes into which section 288 \u201chas been incorporated by reference . . . .\u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 446 &amp; fn. 9.)

(b)(1)) is a \u201clewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d as enumerated in Penal Code section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(6) (Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6)).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">The question here is this: Is oral copulation with a person under 14 years of age in violation of Penal Code section 288a a \u201clewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6)?</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">The majority answer, Yes, and proceed to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which gave the same answer below. They are wrong to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>What Penal Code section 288a requires for oral copulation with a person under 14 years of age is clear: The perpetrator must engage in an objectively sexual act, but need not possess any subjectively sexual intent. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Thornton </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 738, 765 [114 Cal.Rptr. 467, 523 P.2d 267], disapproved on another point in <em>People v. Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 684, fn. 12 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1] (plur. opn.) &amp; 686-687 (cone, opn. of Richardson, J.); <em>People v. Whitham </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1293 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 571]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brocklehurst </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 473, 476 [92 Cal.Rptr. 340].)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">What Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6) means by a \u201clewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d is also clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6)\u2019s \u201clewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d undoubtedly covers a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d on \u201ca child who is under the age of 14 years\u201d in violation of Penal Code section 288. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 434 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 905, 903 P.2d 1037], we concluded, under what we took to be the common and ordinary meaning of the words in question, that Penal Code section 288 required this: The perpetrator must possess a subjectively sexual intent, but need not engage in any objectively sexual act.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">But, to my mind, Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6)\u2019s \u201clewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d does not extend beyond a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d on \u201ca child who is under the age of 14 years\u201d in violation of Penal Code section 288. If it did in fact extend further, it would not carry any determinate sense in such part. And if it did indeed carry any such sense, it would not denote an objectively sexual act without regard to any subjectively sexual intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">That Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6)\u2019s \u201clewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d does not extend beyond a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d on \u201ca child who is under the age of 14 years\u201d in violation of Penal Code section 288 is supported by its language. The phrase in the former provision is virtually identical to the phrase in the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">That Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6)\u2019s \u201clewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d does not extend beyond a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d on \u201ca child who is under the age of 14 years\u201d in violation of Penal Code section 288 is confirmed by its history.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">As originally enacted by the voters through their approval of Proposition 8 at the Primary Election of June 8, 1982, Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>referred to \u201clewd acts on a child under the age of 14 years.\u201d (Prop. 8, \u00a7 7, as approved by voters, Primary Elec. (June 8, 1982).)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">As amended by the Legislature in 1986, Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6) was made to refer to \u201clewd <em>or lascivious </em>acts on a child under the age of 14 \u25a0 years\u201d (Stats. 1986, ch. 489, \u00a7 1, p. 1809, italics added), since changed from the plural to the singular.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Although without express citation, Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6)\u2019s \u201clewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d was intentionally, and not coincidentally, rendered virtually identical to Penal Code section 288\u2019s \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d on \u201ca child who is under the age of 14 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">For example, one legislative report accompanying Assembly Bill No. 3733 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.), the measure that would effect the amendment in question, stated as follows; \u201cThe . . . sponsor of this bill. . . claims that the differences in wording between Proposition 8 and related provisions of the Penal Code have led to confusion and may, in some cases, require special findings in order to apply Proposition 8 enhancements. Thus the proposed amendments are intended to conform Penal Code section 1192.7(c) ... to the appropriate Penal Code section provisions. According to the sponsor, this would end any confusion caused by the differences in language, while keeping true to the intent of the electorate.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3733 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 4, 1986, p. 2; accord, Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 3733 (1985-1986 Reg.

Com. on Pub. Safety, Republican Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3733 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 25, 1986, p. 1 [stating that the bill is \u201cintended to conform the Prop. 8 serious felonies to the definitions of the crimes listed elsewhere in the Penal Code\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The same legislative report went on to state of Assembly Bill No. 3733 and its effect: As it then stood, Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6) applied to \u201c[specified lewd acts\u201d; as amended, it would apply as well to \u201c \u2018lascivious\u2019 acts per P.C. Sec. 288.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3733 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 4, 1986, p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Another legislative report was similar: Assembly Bill No. 3733 would amend Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6) from \u201c[l]ewd acts\u201d to \u201c[l]ewd or lascivious acts per Penal Code Section 288.\u201d (Assem. 3d reading analysis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Assem. Bill No. 3733 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) June 5, 1986, p. 2, underscoring in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Yet another legislative report was to the same effect: Assembly Bill No. 3733 would amend Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6) from \u201clewd acts\u201d to \u201clewd or lascivious acts per Penal Code \u00a7 288.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3733 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) May 5, 1986, p. 1, underscoring in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In a word, as we recognized in Martinez, Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6) \u201cincorporated\u201d Penal Code section 288 \u201cby reference.\u201d <em>(People v. Martinez, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 446 &amp; fn. 9.) Such was its purpose, and such was its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Next, if Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6)\u2019s \u201clewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d did in fact extend beyond a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d on \u201ca child who is under the age of 14 years\u201d in violation of Penal Code section 288, it would not carry any determinate sense in such part. The language of Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6) points to Penal Code section 288 and <em>only to Penal Code section 288. </em>The same is true of its history.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Finally, if Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6)\u2019s \u201clewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d did indeed carry any determinate sense beyond a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d on \u201ca child who is under the age of 14 years\u201d in violation of Penal Code section 288, it would not denote an objectively sexual act without regard to any subjectively sexual intent. If we were right to conclude in <em>Martinez </em>that Penal Code section 288\u2019s \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d on \u201ca child who is under the age of 14 years\u201d indicates a subjectively sexual intent without regard to any objectively sexual act, it is hard for us to conclude here that Penal Code section 1192.7(c) (6)\u2019s \u201clewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d indicates precisely the opposite\u2014an objectively sexual act without regard to any subjectively sexual intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">It follows, then, that the answer to the question posed above is this: Oral copulation with a person under 14 years of age in violation of Penal Code section 288a\u2014which requires an objectively sexual act but not any subjectively sexual intent\u2014is <em>not </em>a \u201clewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6)\u2014which requires a subjectively sexual intent but not any objectively sexual act.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">In giving a contrary answer, the majority rely on the \u201cplain language\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 142, 143) of Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6)\u2019s \u201clewd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years,\u201d invoking the phrase\u2019s \u201ccommon and ordinary meaning\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 143). We proceeded in like fashion in <em>Martinez </em>with respect to Penal Code section 288 \u2019s \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d on \u201ca child who is under the age of 14 years,\u201d focusing on that phrase \u201c[a]s commonly understood\u201d <em>(People v. Martinez, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at 449). The majority purport to distinguish the latter phrase from the former, but without identifying any difference. They do not even attempt to explain how virtually the same phrase can indicate, in <em>Martinez, </em>a subjectively sexual intent without regard to any objectively sexual act, with \u201cintent\u201d being \u201cdeterminative,\u201d and, in this case, an objectively sexual act without regard to any subjectively sexual intent, with \u201cintent\u201d being altogether immaterial. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 148.) Somewhat embarrassed by our statement in <em>Martinez </em>that Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6) \u201cincorporated\u201d Penal Code section 288 \u201cby reference\u201d <em>(People v. Martinez, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 446 &amp; fn. 9), they assert that Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6) includes Penal Code section 288, but is not limited thereto, pointing to the fact that it is not absolutely identical and does not cite it expressly. Such an assertion is little more than an engine to allow the expansion of the provision at will. For they do not even suggest what Penal Code section 1192.7(c)(6) may include <em>in addition to </em>Penal Code section 288. Without a doubt, the kind of perpetrator whom they target is scarcely worthy of sympathy. But, nevertheless, he is entitled to better than he receives at their hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">In conclusion, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal as to sentence and remand the cause to that court for proceedings not inconsistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied June 20, 2001.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
