J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao2\">A juror in this criminal case expressly refused to follow the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding the crime of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, because the juror disagreed with the law criminalizing such behavior. The trial court dismissed the juror and replaced him with an alternate juror. On appeal following conviction, defendant claims the juror should not have been discharged, because the juror\u2019s refusal to follow the law was proper under the concept of \u201cjury nullification.\u201d The Court of Appeal rejected that contention and affirmed the judgment of conviction. We agree with the Court of Appeal and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Defendant Arasheik Wesley Williams was charged in an 11-count information with committing the offenses of false imprisonment (Pen. Code, \u00a7 236),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> assault with a deadly weapon or by force likely to produce great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)), forcible rape (\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2)), battery with serious bodily injury (\u00a7\u00a7 242, 243, subd. (d)), and torture (\u00a7 206) against his former girlfriend, Jennifer B., during three incidents occurring on December 31, 1994, January 1, 1995, and January 9, 1995. The information further alleged that defendant used a deadly or dangerous weapon in the commission of five of the counts (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)), used a deadly weapon in the commission of one of the charged rapes (\u00a7 12022.3, subd. (a) ), and inflicted great bodily injury on the victim in the commission of another of the counts (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">As to the December 31 incident, defendant was convicted of the misdemeanor offense of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor (\u00a7 261.5, subd. (b) ) as a necessarily included offense of rape. As to the January 1 incident, defendant was acquitted of all charges. As to the January 9 incident, defendant was convicted of assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury, false imprisonment, and torture. The jury found true the allegation that he inflicted great bodily injury on the victim, and found each of the remaining allegations not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Defendant was sentenced to the middle term of three years in prison on the conviction of assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury, plus a sentence enhancement of three years for inflicting great bodily injury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Sentences on the false imprisonment and torture convictions were stayed, and defendant was sentenced to a concurrent term of six months for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, for a total term of six years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">As noted above, the charges in this case arose from three incidents involving defendant and his former girlfriend. Only the first incident is relevant to the issue upon which we granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">At the time of the December 31, 1994, incident, defendant was 18 years of age and his girlfriend, Jennifer B., was 16 years of age. Both defendant and Jennifer B. testified that they engaged in sexual intercourse on that date; however, defendant testified it was consensual, and Jennifer B. testified defendant forced her to engage in intercourse by threatening her with knives.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">At trial, prior to the attorneys\u2019 closing arguments, the court indicated that it would instruct the jury that it could convict defendant of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor as a lesser offense included within the charged offense of rape. Defendant\u2019s objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">During argument, defense counsel made the following statement: \u201cSomething else has happened in this case .... They have added misdemeanors to all the charges you heard. . . . They added statutory rape suddenly without notice or preparation. Now, what is the role of a juror on the statutory misdemeanor rape? Your role as a juror is to fairly apply the law. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t want computers. We need the input of fair people, [defendant]\u2019s peers, if you will. Law as you know is not uniformly applied. I can see five cars speeding and the highway patrol is not likely to arrest any of the five. Mores, customfs] change. Times change. And the law must be applied fairly. So if the law is not being applied fairly, that\u2019s why you need fair jurors. Now there is a case called <em>Duncan versus Alaska. </em>It\u2019s the Supreme Court of the United States, 391 U.S. 145, 88 Supreme Court 1444. And I would like to read to you just two lines: \u2018The guarantee of jury trial in the federal and state Constitutions reflect a profound judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered. A right to jury trial is granted to criminal defendants in order to prevent oppression by the government.\u2019 And further on in the case at the end are the lovely words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u2018A jury may, at times, afford a higher justice by refusing to enforce harsh laws.\u2019 Please understand.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">During the first day of deliberations, the trial court received a message from the jury foreperson indicating that Juror No. 10 \u201crefuses to adhere to Judge\u2019s instruction to uphold the law in regard to rape and statutory rape, crime Section 261.5(b) of the Penal Code. He believes the law is wrong and, therefore, will not hear any discussions.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response, the trial court questioned Juror No. 10 outside the presence of the other jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">\u201cThe Court: [I]t\u2019s been reported to me that you refuse to follow my instructions on the law in regard to rape and unlawful sexual intercourse, that you believe the law to be wrong and, therefore, you will not hear any discussion on that subject. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">\u201c[Juror]: Pretty much, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Are you governed by what was said during argument by counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">\u201c[Juror]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">\u201cThe Court: You understand that there was an improper suggestion and that it\u2019s a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-10\">\u201c[Juror]: No, I don\u2019t know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-11\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Well, I\u2019m telling you that\u2019s what it was. And I would remind you too that you took an oath at the outset of the case in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>following language: \u2018Do you and each of you understand and agree that you will well and truly try the cause now pending before this Court and a true verdict render according only to the evidence presented to you and to the instructions of the Court.\u2019 You understand that if you would not follow the instructions that have been given to you by the court that you would be violating that oath? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">\u201c[Juror]: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">\u201cThe Court: Are you willing to abide by the requirements of your oath?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">\u201c[Juror]: I simply cannot see staining a man, a young man, for the rest of his life for what I believe to be a wrong reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">\u201cThe Court: Well, you understand that statutory rape or unlawful sexual intercourse has been described to you as a misdemeanor? Did you follow that in the instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">\u201c[Juror]: I\u2019ve been told it is a misdemeanor. I still don\u2019t see\u2014if it were a $10 fine, I just don\u2019t see convicting a man and staining his record for the rest of his life. I think that is wrong. I\u2019m sorry, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">\u201cThe Court: What you\u2019re saying is not the law either concerning that particular aspect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-11\">\u201c[Juror]: I\u2019m trying as best I can, Judge. And I\u2019m willing to follow all the rules and regulations on the entire rest of the charges, but on that particular charge, I just feel duty-bound to object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-12\">\u201cThe Court: So you\u2019re not willing then to follow your oath?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-13\">\u201c[Juror]: That is correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">The trial court, over defendant\u2019s objection, excused Juror No. 10, replaced him with an alternate juror, and instructed the jury to begin its deliberations anew. The next day, the jury convicted defendant of the above described charges, including unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b497-16\">A trial court\u2019s authority to discharge a juror is granted by Penal Code section 1089, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf at any time, whether before or after the final submission of the case to the jury, a juror dies or becomes ill, <em>or upon other good cause shown to the court is found to be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>unable to perform his duty, </em>or if a juror requests a discharge and good cause appears therefor, the court may order him to be discharged and draw the name of an alternate, who shall then take his place in the jury box, and be subject to the same rules and regulations as though he had been selected as one of the original jurors.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Italics added; see also Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 233, 234.)  \u201cWe review for abuse of discretion the trial court\u2019s determination to discharge a juror and order an alternate to serve. [Citation.] If there is any substantial evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s ruling, we will uphold it. [Citation.] We have also stated, however, that a juror\u2019s inability to perform as a juror must \u2018 \u201cappear in the record as a demonstrable reality.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Pe<em>ople </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 799, 843 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 347, 919 P.2d 1280].)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">A juror who refuses to follow the court\u2019s instructions is \u201cunable to perform his duty\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 1089. As soon as a jury is selected, each juror must agree to render a true verdict \u201c \u2018according only to the evidence presented . . . and <em>to the instructions of the court.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 232, subd. (b), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 687, 690 [131 Cal.Rptr. 782, 552 P.2d 742], after the jury had begun its deliberations, a juror sent a note to the judge asking to be excused because she was \u201c \u2018unable to follow the Court\u2019s instructions concerning deliberation.\u2019 \u201d Upon being questioned by the court, she explained \u201cthat she felt more emotionally than intellectually involved and that she thought she would not be able to make a decision based on the evidence or the law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court dismissed the juror over the defendant\u2019s objection. We affirmed the resulting judgment of conviction, stating: \u201cThe extensive hearing in which the juror steadfastly maintained that she could not follow the court\u2019s instructions, that she had been upset throughout the trial and that she wanted to be excused, clearly justified a conclusion that she could not perform her duty and thus established good cause for her discharge.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 696; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1446, fn. 2 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 16] [trial court is \u201cduty bound\u201d to discharge a juror who is unable to follow the law]; <em>People v. Williams </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1780-1781 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 521] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>[juror properly discharged because she \u201cwas unable to comprehend simple concepts, was unable to remember events during deliberations such as recent discussions or votes, and was not following the law\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 865 [277 Cal.Rptr. 122, 802 P.2d 906], this court upheld the removal of a juror for misconduct, stating: \u201c[W]e believe the misconduct in the present case did indicate that Juror Francis was unable to perform his duty. <em>That duty includes the obligation to follow the instructions of the court, </em>and a judge may reasonably conclude that a juror who has violated instructions to refrain from discussing the case or reading newspaper accounts of the trial cannot be counted on to follow instructions in the future.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Defendant contends, however, that the trial court\u2019s order denied him his right to trial by jury, because Juror No. 10 properly was exercising his alleged right to engage in juror nullification by refusing to follow the law regarding unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. But defendant has cited no case, and we are aware of none, that holds that a trial court violates the defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial by excusing a juror who refuses to follow the law. The circumstance that, as a practical matter, the jury in a criminal case may have the ability to disregard the court\u2019s instructions in the defendant\u2019s favor without recourse by the prosecution does not diminish the trial court\u2019s authority to discharge a juror who, the court learns, is unable or unwilling to follow the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">It long has been recognized that, in some instances, a jury has the ability to disregard, or nullify, the law.  A jury has the ability to acquit a criminal defendant against the weight of the evidence. <em>(Horning </em>v. <em>District of Columbia </em>(1920) 254 U.S. 135, 138 [41 S.Ct. 53, 54, 65 L.Ed. 185] [\u201cthe jury has the power to bring in a verdict in the teeth of both law and facts\u201d], not followed on other grounds in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaudin </em>(1995) 515 U.S. 506, 520 [115 S.Ct. 2310, 2318, 132 L.Ed.2d 444]; <em>United States v. Schmitz </em>(9th Cir. 1975) 525 F.2d 793, 794 [\u201cthe jury has the inherent power to pardon one no matter how guilty\u201d].) A jury in a criminal case may return inconsistent verdicts. <em>(Dunn v.

A court may not direct a jury to enter a guilty verdict \u201cno matter how conclusive the evidence.\u201d <em>(United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>Brotherhood of Carpenters </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(1947) 330 U.S. 395, 408 [67 S.Ct. 775, 782, 91 L.Ed. 973]; <em>Sullivan v.

Cir. 1969) 420 F.2d 142, 144.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">General verdicts are required in criminal cases, in order to permit the jury wide latitude in reaching its verdict. <em>(United States v. Spock </em>(1st Cir. 1969) 416 F.2d 165, 182.) \u201cA general verdict insures the input of compassion into a jury\u2019s decisional process. The rule against special verdicts and special questions in criminal cases is thus nothing more nor less than a recognition of the principle that \u2018the jury, as conscience of the community, must be permitted to look at more than logic.\u2019 [Citation.] In the words of one thoughtful commentator, the prohibition of special verdicts affirms the notation that \u2018[i]n criminal cases ... it has always been the function of the jury to apply the law, as given by the court in its charge, to the facts,\u2019 while preserving \u2018the power of the jury to return a verdict in the teeth of the law and the facts.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(United States v. McCracken </em>(5th Cir. 1974) 488 F.2d 406, 419; <em>United States v.

Chief Justice Bird, quoting Judge Learned Hand\u2019s description of jury nullification as the jury\u2019s \u201c \u2018assumption of a power which they had no right to exercise, but to which they were disposed through lenity,\u2019 \u201d observed: \u201cThis power is attributable to two unique features of criminal trials. First, a criminal jury has the right to return a general verdict which does not specify how it applied the law to the facts, or for that matter, what law was applied or what facts were found. [Citations.] HD Second, the constitutional double jeopardy bar pre: vents an appellate court from disregarding the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the defendant and ordering a new trial on the same charge. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ballard v. Uribe </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 564, 599 [224 Cal.Rptr. 664, 715 P.2d 624] (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Bird, C. J.).) The United States Supreme Court has referred to the ability of a jury in a criminal case to nullify the law in the defendant\u2019s favor as \u201cthe unreviewable power of a juiy to return a verdict of not guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>for impermissible reasons.\u201d <em>(Harris v. Rivera </em>(1981) 454 U.S. 339, 346 [102 S.Ct. 460, 464, 70 L.Ed.2d 530]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Palmer, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 856, 863.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">But the circumstance that the prosecution may be powerless to challenge a jury verdict or finding that is prompted by the jury\u2019s refusal to apply a particular law does not lessen the obligation of each juror to obey the court\u2019s instructions. More than a century ago, the United States Supreme Court recognized that jurors are required to follow the trial court\u2019s instructions. In <em>Sparf &amp; Hanson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1895) 156 U.S. 51 [15 S.Ct. 273, 39 L.Ed. 343], the trial court instructed the jury in a prosecution for murder that there was no evidence that would reduce the crime below the grade of murder. A juror asked whether the jury could return a verdict of manslaughter, and the trial court responded: \u201cIn a proper case, a verdict for manslaughter may be rendered, as the district attorney has stated, and even in this case you have the physical power to do so; but, as one of the tribunals of the country, a jury is expected to be governed by law, and the law it should receive from the court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 62, fn. 1 [15 S.Ct. at p. 278], italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In that case the United States Supreme Court found no error in the trial court\u2019s instructions, or in its refusal to instruct the jury that it could return a verdict of manslaughter. The high court conducted an exhaustive review of the authority then available, which repeatedly and consistently supported a single view, aptly stated as follows: \u201c \u2018 \u201cIt is true, the jury may disregard the instructions of the court, and in some cases there may be no remedy. But it is still the right of the court to instruct the jury on the law, and the duty of the jury to obey the instructions.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Sparf &amp; Hanson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>156 U.S. 51, 72 [15 S.Ct. 273, 382].) The high court concluded: \u201cWe must hold firmly to the doctrine that in the courts of the United States it is the duty of juries in criminal cases to take the law from the court, and apply that law to the facts as they find them to be from the evidence. Upon the court rests the responsibility of declaring the law; upon the jury, the responsibility of applying the law so declared to the facts as they, upon their conscience, believe them to be.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 102 [15 S.Ct. at p. 293].)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>In <em>Taylor v. Louisiana </em>(1975) 419 U.S. 522, 530 [95 S.Ct. 692, 698, 42 L.Ed.2d 690], the United States Supreme Court, in holding that the fair-cross-section requirement is fundamental to the jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, observed: \u201cThe purpose of a jury is to guard against the exercise of arbitrary power\u2014to make available the commonsense judgment of the community as a hedge against the overzealous or mistaken prosecutor and in preference to the professional or perhaps overconditioned or biased response of a judge.\u201d But in <em>Lockett v. Ohio </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 586, 596-597 [98 S.Ct. 2954, 2960, 57 L.Ed.2d 973], the high court clarified: \u201cNothing in <em>Taylor, </em>however, suggests that the right to a representative jury includes the right to be tried by jurors who have explicitly indicated an inability to follow the law and instructions of the trial judge.\u201d (See also <em>Morgan v. Illinois </em>(1992) 504 U.S. 719, 730 [112 S.Ct. 2222, 2230, 119 L.Ed.2d 492] [recognizing the \u201ctrial judge\u2019s responsibility to remove prospective jurors who will not be able impartially to follow the court\u2019s instructions and evaluate the evidence\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The high court reaffirmed this view in <em>United States v. Gaudin, supra, </em>515 U.S. 506, 510 [115 S.Ct. 2310, 2313], which acknowledged \u201c[t]he right to have a jury make the ultimate determination of guilt,\u201d but also recognized that \u201c[i]n criminal cases, as in civil, ... the judge must be permitted to instruct the jury on the law and to insist that the jury follow his instructions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 513 [115 S.Ct. at p. 2315].)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">This view has deep roots. In 1835, in <em>United States v. Battiste </em>(C.C.D.Mass. 1835) 24 F.Cas. 1042 (No. 14,545), Justice Story, sitting as a circuit justice, instructed the jury in a criminal case that they were the judges of the facts, but not of the law, stating: \u201c[T]hey have the physical power to disregard the law, as laid down to them by the court. But I deny, that, in any case, civil or criminal, they have the moral right to decide the law according to their own notions, or pleasure. On the contrary, I hold it the most sacred constitutional right of every party accused of a crime, that the jury should respond as to the facts, and the court as to the law. It is the duty of the court to instruct the jury as to the law; and it is the duty of the jury to follow the law, as it is laid down by the court. This is the right of every citizen; and it is his only protection. If the jury were at liberty to settle the law for themselves, the effect would be, not only that the law itself would be most uncertain, from the different views, which different juries might take of it; but in case of error, there would be no remedy or redress by the injured party; for the court would not have any right to review the law as it had been settled by the jury. Indeed, it would be almost impracticable to ascertain, what the law, as settled by the jury, actually was. . . . Every person accused as a criminal has a right to be tried according to the law of the land, the fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>law of the land; and not by the law as a jury may understand it, or choose, from wantonness, or ignorance, or accidental mistake, to interpret it.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1043.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In <em>United States v. Powell, supra, </em>469 U.S. 57, the high court reaffirmed the rule that verdicts in a criminal prosecution need not be consistent but, at the same time, the court recognized that jurors are obligated to follow the law. Although the court observed that inconsistent verdicts \u201cpresent a situation where \u2018error,\u2019 in the sense that the jury has not followed the court\u2019s instructions, most certainly has occurred,\u201d the court held that a new trial is not required because the defendant may have reaped the benefit of jury lenity. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 65 [105 S.Ct. at p. 477].) The court explained the rule permitting inconsistent verdicts in criminal cases \u201cas a recognition of the jury\u2019s historic function, in criminal trials, as a check against arbitrary or oppressive exercises of power by the Executive Branch.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Florida </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 78, 100 [90 S.Ct. 1893, 1905-1906, 26 L.Ed.2d 446] [\u201cThe purpose of the jury trial. . . is to prevent oppression by the Government. . . . Given this purpose, the essential feature of a jury obviously lies in the interposition between the accused and his accuser of the commonsense judgment of a group of laymen, and in the community participation and shared responsibility that results from that group\u2019s determination of guilt or innocence\u201d].) Repeating the court\u2019s phrase in <em>Dunn v. United States, supra, </em>284 U.S. 390, 393-394 [52 S.Ct. 189, 190], that such lenity is \u201can \u2018assumption of a power which [the jury has] no right to exercise,\u2019 \u201d the court concluded in <em>Powell: </em>\u201cThe fact that the inconsistency may be the result of lenity, coupled with the Government\u2019s inability to invoke review, suggests that inconsistent verdicts should not be reviewable.\u201d <em>(United States v. Powell, supra, </em>469 U.S. at p. 66 [105 S.Ct. at p. 477].) Later in its opinion, in rejecting the contention that the court should attempt to determine the reason for the inconsistent verdicts in each case, the court stated: \u201cJurors, of course, take an oath to follow the law as charged, and they are expected to follow it.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In <em>Standefer </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 10 [100 S.Ct. 1999, 64 L.Ed.2d 689], the high court returned to the theme that the procedural disadvantages placed upon the prosecution do not lessen the obligation of jurors to obey the court\u2019s instructions, or the expectation that they will do so. The decision in <em>Standefer </em>held that a defendant could be convicted of aiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>and abetting the commission of a federal offense even though the named principal had been acquitted of that offense. In rejecting the argument that the prosecution, after the named principal was acquitted, should be estopped from asserting that a crime had been committed, the court examined the nature of criminal prosecutions: \u201cFirst, in a criminal case, the Government is often without the kind of \u2018full and fair opportunity to litigate\u2019 that is a prerequisite of estoppel. Several aspects of our criminal law make this so: the prosecution\u2019s discovery rights in criminal cases are limited, both by rules of court and constitutional privileges; it is prohibited from being granted a directed verdict or from obtaining a judgment notwithstanding the verdict no matter how clear the evidence in support of guilt, [citation]; it cannot secure a new trial on the ground that an acquittal was plainly contrary to the weight of the evidence, [citation]; and it cannot secure appellate review where a defendant has been acquitted. [Citation.] HD The absence of these remedial procedures in criminal cases permits juries to acquit out of compassion or compromise or because of \u2018 \u201ctheir assumption of a power which they had no right to exercise, but to which they were disposed through lenity.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] It is of course true that verdicts induced by passion and prejudice are not unknown in civil suits. But in civil cases, post-trial motions and appellate review provide an aggrieved litigant a remedy; in a criminal case the Government has no similar avenue to correct errors. Under contemporary principles of collateral estoppel, this factor strongly militates against giving an acquittal preclusive effect.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 22-23 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2007], fn. omitted.) \u201cThis case does no more than manifest the simple, if discomforting, reality that \u2018different juries may reach different results under any criminal statute. That is one of the consequences we accept under our jury system.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 25 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 2008-2009].)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">California courts long have embraced the position reflected in the numerous United States Supreme Court decisions set out above. Two years before the high court\u2019s 1895 decision in <em>Sparf &amp; Hanson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>156 U.S. 51, this court reached the same conclusion: \u201cOf course, a jury, in rendering a general verdict in a criminal case, necessarily has the naked power to decide all the questions arising on the general issue of not guilty; but it only has the right to find the facts, and apply to them the law as given by the court.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lem You </em>(1893) 97 Cal. 224, 228 [32 P. 11], italics omitted, overruled on another ground in <em>People v. Kobrin </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 416, 427, fn. 7 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 895, 903 P.2d 1027].)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">This has been the law in California since the enactment in 1872 of section 1126, which states: \u201cIn a trial for any offense, questions of law are to be decided by the court, and questions of fact by the jury. Although the jury has the power to find a general verdict, which includes questions of law as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>as of fact, they are bound, nevertheless, to receive as law what is laid down as such by the court.\u201d (See also Pen. Code, \u00a7 1124 [\u201cThe Court must decide all questions of law which arise in the course of a trial.\u201d]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 310, subd. (a) [\u201cAll questions of law ... are to be decided by the court.\u201d].) Quoting section 1126, we stated in <em>In re Stankewitz </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 391, 399 [220 Cal.Rptr. 382, 708 P.2d 1260]: \u201cIn our system of justice it is the trial court that determines the law to be applied to the facts of the case, and the jury is \u2018bound ... to receive as law what is laid down as such by the court.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Of course, it is a fundamental and historic precept of our judicial system that jurors are restricted solely to the determination of <em>factual </em>questions and are bound by the law as given them by the court. They are not allowed either to determine what the law <em>is </em>or what the law <em>should be.\u2019 </em>[Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The principle that jurors are required to follow the law also is reflected in the decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dougherty </em>(D.C. Cir. 1972) 473 F.2d 1113. The court in <em>Dougherty </em>acknowledged the existence of jury nullification, observing that \u201c[t]he pages of history shine on instances of the jury\u2019s exercise of its prerogative to disregard uncontradicted evidence and instructions of the judge.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1130.) The circuit court, however, rejecting the contention that the jury should be instructed that it properly could disregard the court\u2019s instructions, noted that the \u201cso-called right of jury nullification . . . risks the ultimate logic of anarchy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1133.) The court stated: \u201cAn explicit instruction to a jury [sanctioning nullification] conveys an implied approval that runs the risk of degrading the legal structure requisite for true freedom, for an ordered liberty that protects against anarchy as well as tyranny.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1137.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Similarly, the court in <em>United States v. Moylan </em>(4th Cir. 1969) 417 F.2d 1002, 1006, recognized that a jury has \u201cthe undisputed power\u201d \u201cto acquit, even if its verdict is contrary to the law as given by the judge and contrary to the evidence,\u201d but rejected the argument that the jury should have been instructed that it had the power to acquit even if the defendants clearly were guilty. The court stated: \u201cHowever, this is not to say that the jury should be encouraged in their \u2018lawlessness,\u2019 and by clearly stating to the jury that they may disregard the law, telling them that they may decide according to their prejudices or consciences (for there is no check to insure that the judgment is based upon conscience rather than prejudice), we would indeed be negating the rule of law in favor of the rule of lawlessness. This should not be allowed.\u201d (Ibid.; <em>United States v. Anderson </em>(7th Cir. 1983) 716 F.2d 446, 449-450 [following \u201cthe accepted view that, while the \u2018community conscience\u2019 verdict is to be accepted as a natural and at times desirable aberration under our system, it is not to be positively sanctioned by instructions . . . which would encourage a jury to acquit \u2018under any circumstances\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>regardless of the applicable law or proven facts\u201d]; <em>United States v. Washington </em>(D.C. Cir. 1983) 705 F.2d 489, 494 [\u201cIt cannot be gainsaid that juries can abuse their power and return verdicts contrary to the law and instructions of the court, and thus nullify the criminal law, but courts generally have refused to give such an instruction to the jury. ... A <em>jury has no more \u2018right\u2019 to find a \u2018guilty\u2019 defendant \u2018not guilty\u2019 than it has to find a \u2018not guilty\u2019 defendant \u2018guilty, \u2019 and the fact that the former cannot be corrected by a court, while the latter can be, does not create a right out of the power to misapply the law. Such verdicts are lawless, a denial of due process and constitute an exercise of erroneously seized power.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">California courts are in accord. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 487-488, fn. 39 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1444-1445; <em>People </em>v. <em>Partner </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 178, 185-186 [225 Cal.Rptr. 502]; <em>People v.

In <em>People </em>v. <em>Nichols </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 21 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 433], the defendant was convicted of theft or unauthorized use of a vehicle (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851, subd. (a)) and the jury found that he had suffered two prior convictions. During deliberations, the jury asked whether defendant was subject to the three strikes law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nichols, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at p. 24; see \u00a7\u00a7667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12.) The court responded that it could not properly answer that question, and reminded the jurors that they could not consider the subject of penalty or punishment. The defendant argued on appeal that the trial court should have told the jury that the defendant was subject to a three strikes sentence, so that the jury could decide whether to exercise its power of jury nullification. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument, observing that the court need not instruct the jury concerning its power to nullify the law and, thus, need not instruct the jury regarding penalty or punishment so as to enable it to exercise that power. (Accord, <em>State v. McLanahan </em>(1973) 212 Kan. 208 [510 P.2d 153, 160] [\u201cAlthough it must be conceded that the jurors in a criminal case have the raw physical power to disregard both the rules of law and the evidence in order to acquit a defendant, it is the proper function and duty of a jury to accept the rules of law given to it in the instructions by the court, apply those rules of law in determining what facts are proven and render a verdict based thereon.\u201d]; <em>Davis v.

This view was considered and rejected in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th 1435.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Sanchez was charged with murder. One of the prosecution\u2019s theories was that the alleged crime was first degree felony murder, because the murder was committed during the course of a robbery. During deliberations, the jury sent the court a note asking whether a murder that took place during a robbery automatically was first degree murder, and the court answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The jury also asked, \u201cCan we arrive at a verdict where we find the defendant guilty of robbery/2d degree murder?\u201d <em>(People v. Sanchez, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1443.) The court answered \u201cno\u201d and explained the concept of felony murder. The court also reminded the jury of its obligation to \u201cfollow the law even if you disagree with it,\u201d inviting any juror who was \u201creluctant to follow the law to tell me, and I\u2019ll excuse you from jury service because you\u2019re not following the law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1444.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">On appeal from the resulting judgment of conviction for first degree murder, the defendant maintained the court erred in instructing the jury that it \u201c \u2018must find appellant guilty of first degree murder and could not nullify what it considered to be an unjust law . . .\u2019 and threatening to remove any juror who could not follow the law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanchez, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1444.) The Court of Appeal recognized that a jury\u2019s power to nullify the law is well established, but rejected the defendant\u2019s contention, concluding \u201cthe trial court was not required to instruct the jurors on their power of nullification and permit them to disregard the law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1446, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">One justice dissented, reasoning that the trial court erred in instructing the jury, in effect, that it lacked the power to nullify the law, and compounded that error by \u201cthreatening to punish any juror who could not follow the law by removing him or her from the panel.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanchez, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1453 (dis. opn. of Johnson, J.).) The dissent agreed that a court should not instruct the jury that it may disregard the law, but concluded that the court\u2019s instruction \u201cerroneously told the jurors they did not have the power or right of nullification.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1456 (dis. opn. of Johnson, J.).) The dissent suggested that, instead, the court should have reread the standard instruction (CALJIC No. 1.00) that \u201cdirects the jury to decide the case based on the facts and the law as supplied by the court.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanchez, supra, </em>at p. 1456 (dis. opn. of Johnson, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The majority in <em>Sanchez, </em>relying upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>People v. Dillon, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 441, rejected the dissent\u2019s view that the court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>in instructing the jury that it could not find the defendant guilty of second degree murder if it found that the murder was committed during a robbery. The trial court in <em>Dillon </em>had instructed the jury that an unlawful killing that occurs during an attempted robbery is first degree murder under the felony-murder rule. During deliberations, the jury sent the court a note asking whether it could return a verdict of second degree murder or manslaughter even if it found the killing occurred during an attempted robbery. In reply, the court reiterated that a killing committed during an attempted robbery is first degree murder. The jury later found the defendant guilty of first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Writing separately on the jury nullification issue before the court in <em>People v. Dillon, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 441, 490 (conc. opn. of Kaus, J.), Justice Kaus concluded that \u201cwhen the jury practically begged the court to show it a way by which to avoid a first degree verdict,\u201d the court \u201cshould have informed the jury of (1) its power to render a verdict more lenient than the facts justify, and (2) its immunity from punishment if it chooses to exercise that power.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 491, fn. 2 (cone. opn. of Kaus, J.).) The majority in <em>Dillon </em>disagreed with Justice Kaus\u2019s suggestion on this point, however, stating: \u201c[I]t cannot seriously be argued that, when asked by the jurors, a trial judge must advise them: T have instructed you on the law applicable to this case. Follow it or ignore it, as you choose.\u2019 Such advice may achieve pragmatic justice in isolated instances, but we suggest the more likely result is anarchy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 487-488, fn. 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\"><em>People v.

In <em>Fernandez, </em>jurors informed the court that they had found the defendant guilty of the charged offense, but asked whether they could return a verdict of guilty of a lesser offense. The court answered in the negative. The Court of Appeal affirmed the resulting judgment of conviction of the charged offense, stating: \u201c \u2018A juror\u2019s duty \u201cincludes the obligation to follow the instructions of the court ....\u2019\u201d [Citations.] . . . [T]o give every juror the option of disregarding with impunity any law personally judged to be morally untenable is akin to telling all drivers to drive as fast as they think appropriate without posting a limit as a point of departure.

The trial court permitted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>defendant to use the term \u201cjury nullification\u201d during argument, prompting the jury, during its deliberations, to ask the court to define that term. The court responded: \u201cThere is no such thing as valid jury nullification. Your obligation is to follow the instructions of the Court as to the law given to you.

While that power has, on some occasions, achieved just results, it also has led to verdicts based upon bigotry and racism.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A jury that disregards the law and, instead, reaches a verdict based upon the personal views and beliefs of the jurors violates one of our nation\u2019s most basic precepts: that we are \u201ca government of laws and not men.\u201d <em>(Reynolds v. Sims </em>(1964) 377 U.S. 533, 568 [84 S.Ct. 1362, 1385, 12 L.Ed.2d 506].)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The only case cited by the parties or that we have found that has addressed the specific issue raised in the present case\u2014i.e., whether a trial court may remove a juror who discloses, during jury deliberations, that he or she will not apply the law as instructed by the court\u2014is <em>U.S. v. Thomas, supra, </em>116 F.3d 606, involving a prosecution for violation of federal narcotics laws. In <em>Thomas, </em>pursuant to the provisions of rule 23(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (18 U.S.C.) permitting the court to dismiss a juror for \u201cjust cause\u201d and have a verdict returned by the remaining 11 jurors, a juror was dismissed during deliberations. The court of appeals held \u201cthat\u2014as an obvious violation of a juror\u2019s oath and duty\u2014a refusal to apply the law as set forth by the court constitutes grounds for dismissal under Rule 23(b).\u201d <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>116 F.3d at p. 608.)

Although the court in <em>Thomas </em>ultimately concluded that the trial court in that case had erred in dismissing the juror in question, because the record suggested that the juror\u2019s views may well have been motivated by doubts about the defendant\u2019s guilt rather than by an intent to nullify the law,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the <em>Thomas </em>opinion left no doubt that when the record does establish that a deliberating juror is unwilling to apply the law as instructed by the court, \u201ca juror\u2019s purposeful disregard of the law as set forth in the court\u2019s instruction may constitute just cause for that juror\u2019s removal under Rule 23(b).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 625.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Finally, defendant repeatedly asserts, in several different ways, that the juror removed in the present case did not evidence an intention to nullify the law, because he did not express a disagreement with the law prohibiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>statutory rape in all applications. Rather, defendant asserts, the removed juror simply concluded the law should not be applied in this case. We need not address whether this purported distinction would make a difference, because we do not agree with defendant\u2019s interpretation of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Referring to a note from the jury foreperson, the court asked Juror No. 10 whether it was true that he refused to hear any discussions regarding unlawful sexual intercourse because he \u201cbeliev[ed] the law to be wrong.\u201d Juror No. 10 replied: \u201cPretty much, yes.\u201d The court asked whether the juror was \u201cgoverned\u201d by defense counsel\u2019s statement during argument that \u201c[a] jury may, at times, afford a higher justice by refusing to enforce harsh laws.\u201d Again, Juror No. 10 answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The court then asked the juror whether he was \u201cwilling to abide by the requirements of your oath?\u201d The juror answered: \u201cI simply cannot see staining a man, a young man, for the rest of his life for what I believe to be a wrong reason.\u201d This prompted a brief discussion that ended with the juror stating: \u201cAnd I\u2019m willing to follow all the rules and regulations on the entire rest of the charges, but on that particular charge, I just feel duty-bound to object.\u201d The court then summarized by stating: \u201cSo you\u2019re not willing then to follow your oath?,\u201d to which the juror answered: \u201cThat is correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In the present case there is ample evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Juror No. 10 was unable to perform his duties as a juror. The juror stated that he objected to the law concerning unlawful sexual intercourse and expressly confirmed that he was unwilling to abide by his oath to follow the court\u2019s instructions. The juror\u2019s inability to perform his duties thus appears in the record \u201c \u2018 \u201cas a demonstrable reality.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

The trial court acted properly in excusing Juror No. 10 on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Jury nullification raises issues that go to the heart of our constitutional form of government. These issues sometimes arise when defendants, as a matter of conscience, choose to violate laws as a means of protest, or to violate laws they view as unjust. Such cases cause us to examine the meaning of the cherished right to trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">It is striking that the debate over juror nullification remains vigorous after more than a hundred years.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But it is equally significant that, during this time, no published authority has restricted a trial court\u2019s authority to discharge a juror when the record demonstrates that the juror is unable or unwilling to follow the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\u201cChampioning a jury\u2019s refusal to apply the law as instructed is inconsistent with the very notion of the rule of law. As the young Abraham Lincoln said in a related context, \u2018let me not be understood as saying there are no bad laws, or that grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do mean to say that although bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still, while they continue in force, for the sake of example, they should be religiously observed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ballard </em>v. <em>Uribe, supra, </em>41 Cal.Sd 564, 600 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Bird, C. J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Encouraging a jury to nullify a law it finds unjust or to act as the \u201cconscience of the community\u201d by disregarding the court\u2019s instructions may sound lofty, but such unchecked and unreviewable power can lead to verdicts based upon bigotry and racism.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Jurors who do not feel bound to follow the law can act capriciously, to the detriment of the accused. In addition to refusing to follow laws they view as unjust, such jurors could choose to disregard instructions mandated by the Legislature not to read media accounts of the trial, not to discuss the case with others, or not to conduct their own investigation by visiting the crime scene. (\u00a7 1122.) The jury might feel free to ignore the presumption of innocence or find the defendant guilty even though some jurors harbor a reasonable doubt. (\u00a7\u00a7 1096, 1096a; Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 502, 520.) A jury might disregard an instruction not to draw an inference from the exercise of a privilege (Evid. Code, \u00a7 913) and assume the defendant must be guilty if he or she chooses not to testify. In a capital case, a juror could vote to impose the death penalty without considering mitigating evidence. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.3.) Some jurors might decide not to view a defendant\u2019s confession with caution or not require corroboration of the testimony of an accomplice. <em>(People v. Carpenter </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 392 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 935 P.2d 708]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beagle </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 441, 455 [99 Cal.Rptr. 313, 492 P.2d 1]; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1111.) A jury even might determine that deliberations are too difficult and decide the defendant\u2019s guilt by the flip of a coin. (Pen. Code. \u00a7 1181, subd. 4 [verdict may not be decided by lot].)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">These are just a few of the many instructions required by the Legislature that a juror might choose to ignore if encouraged to nullify the law. (See also \u00a7\u00a7 1120 [juror must declare \u201cany personal knowledge respecting a fact in controversy in a cause\u201d], 1127a, subd.

As one commentator has noted: \u201cWhen jurors enter a verdict in contravention of what the law authorizes and requires, they subvert the rule of law and subject citizens\u2014defendants, witnesses, victims, and everyone affected by criminal justice administration\u2014to power based on the subjective predilections of twelve individuals. They affect the rule of men, not law.\u201d (Brown, <em>Jury Nullification Within the Rule of Law, supra, </em>81 Minn. L.Rev. at pp. 1150-1151, fn. omitted.) A nullifying jury is essentially a lawless jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">We reaffirm, therefore, the basic rule that jurors are required to determine the facts and render a verdict in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions on the law. A juror who is unable or unwilling to do so is \u201cunable to perform his [or her] duty\u201d as a juror (\u00a7 1089) and may be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Mosk, J., Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., and Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-11\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b496-12\">The language quoted by defense counsel actually is from the decision in <em>Duncan v.

The court interviewed each juror individually. Several jurors stated that Juror No. 5 had disrupted deliberations by \u201chollering\u201d at his fellow jurors and calling them racists. Two jurors stated that Juror No. 5 had come close to striking a fellow juror. One juror recounted that Juror No. 5 had \u201cpretended to vomit in the bathroom while other jurors were eating lunch outside the bathroom door.\u201d <em>(U.S. v.

I write separately, however, to sound a note of caution about the manner in which a trial court should investigate an allegation of such misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">When a deliberating jury tells the trial court that one of its members refuses to obey the court\u2019s instructions on the law, the court faces a delicate and difficult task, because its \u201cduty to dismiss jurors for misconduct comes into conflict with a duty that is equally, if not more, important\u2014safeguarding the secrecy of jury deliberations.\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Thomas </em>(2d Cir. 1997) 116 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>F.3d 606, 618.) A juror who votes to convict or acquit for reasons that violate the trial court\u2019s instructions on the law commits misconduct. Yet the trial court cannot probe the juror\u2019s motivations for fear of compromising the secrecy of the jury\u2019s deliberations. <em>(U.S. v. Brown </em>(D.C. Cir. 1987) 823 F.2d 591, 596.) To permit trial judges \u201cto conduct intrusive inquiries into . . . the reasoning behind a juror\u2019s view of the case, or the particulars of a juror\u2019s (likely imperfect) understanding or interpretation of the law as stated by the judge\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Thomas, supra, </em>116 F.3d at p. 620) would violate the secrecy of jury deliberations, a cornerstone of this nation\u2019s jurisprudence, and it would \u201cinvite trial judges to second-guess and influence the work of the jury\u201d <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 466 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 313, 21 P.3d 1225], a companion to this case, this court highlights the dangers of intruding upon the jury\u2019s deliberative process: \u201cJurors may be particularly reluctant to express themselves freely in the jury room if their mental processes are subject to immediate judicial scrutiny. The very act of questioning deliberating jurors about the content of their deliberations could affect those deliberations. The danger is increased if the attorneys for the parties are permitted to question individual jurors in the midst of deliberations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Thus, in questioning a juror to determine whether the juror is refusing to follow the trial court\u2019s instructions on the law, as alleged by other jurors, a trial court should conduct only a very limited inquiry. The court should caution the juror that it does <em>not </em>want to know whether the juror is voting to convict or acquit the defendant, or the reasons for that vote. The court should then state that it wants to know <em>only </em>whether the juror is willing to abide by the juror\u2019s oath to decide the case \u201c \u2018according only to the evidence presented . . . and ... the instructions of the court\u2019 \u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 232, subd. (b)), to which the juror is to respond only with either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">If the juror\u2019s answer is \u201cyes,\u201d the trial court should simply order the entire jury to resume deliberations. If the answer is \u201cno,\u201d the court should discharge the juror in question. If the juror\u2019s answer is equivocal, the trial court may have to inquire further. In doing so, however, the court should be mindful of these words of warning: \u201cWhere the duty and authority to prevent defiant disregard of the law or evidence comes into conflict with the principle of secret jury deliberations, we are compelled to err in favor of the lesser of two evils\u2014protecting the secrecy of jury deliberations at the expense of possibly allowing irresponsible juror activity.\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Thomas, supra, </em>116 F.3d at p. 623.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">In this case, the trial court\u2019s questioning of Juror No. 10, quoted in full by the majority (see maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 446-447), went beyond the limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>inquiry described above. Rather than asking only whether Juror No. 10 was willing to follow the court\u2019s instructions on the law, the court asked questions that were likely to\u2014and did\u2014reveal whether Juror No. 10 was of the view that defendant should be convicted or acquitted of the crime of unlawful sexual intercourse, and the reasons for that view. This unnecessarily broad inquiry may well have infringed upon the secrecy of the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Because defendant did not raise this issue in his petition for review, the majority expresses no views on the propriety of the trial court\u2019s line of questions. Thus, the majority opinion should not be read as expressing approval of the trial court\u2019s overly broad inquiry of Juror No. 10. With that caveat, I concur in the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b515-6\">WERDEGAR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnV\">I concur entirely in the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

Instead, a juror\u2019s refusal or inability to deliberate or, as here, a juror\u2019s inability or unwillingness to perform the duties of a juror (Pen.
