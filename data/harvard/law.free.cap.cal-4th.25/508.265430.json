Like many other states, California has adopted the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (7A pt. 1 West\u2019s U. Laws Ann. (1999) U. Div. of Income for Tax Purposes Act, \u00a7 1 et seq., p. 361) (UDITPA) in an attempt to resolve this dilemma (see Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25120-25141).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under this scheme of taxation, all taxpayer income is divided into business or nonbusiness income. Business income is apportion-able to each state using a three-factor formula. Nonbusiness income is allocable only to the taxpayer\u2019s commercial domicile. In this case, we consider whether a reversion of surplus pension plan assets is taxable by California as apportionable business income. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Hoechst Celanese Corporation (Hoechst), formerly Celanese Corporation, is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New Jersey and its commercial domicile in New York. It manufactures and sells a diversified line of chemicals, fibers and specialty products. Since the late 1960\u2019s, Hoechst has conducted business operations in California and filed California franchise tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">In 1947, Hoechst created its first pension plan. Since then, Hoechst\u2019s pension plans have undergone numerous changes. For example, the original pension plan required contributions from both Hoechst and its participating employees. In 1969, however, the plan became noncontributory, and only Hoechst had to make contributions. Despite the constant evolution of these plans, their purpose has remained the same. Hoechst has created and maintained these plans \u201cfor the general benefit of its employees\u201d in an effort to \u201cretain its current employees and to attract other qualified employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">The version of the pension plan at issue here was known as the Celanese Retirement Income Plan (CRIP I), and was subject to the terms of the Employee. Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq.) (ERISA). CRIP I dated back to the original 1947 plan and resulted from the merger in 1982 of several pension plans created and maintained by Hoechst and its controlled subsidiaries. It was a qualified plan under Internal Revenue Code section 401(a) (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(a)) and covered both active <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>and retired employees. Under the terms of CRIP I, each plan member only had a \u201cnonforfeitable right\u201d to a predefined level of benefits. <em>(Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson </em>(1999) 525 U.S. 432, 440 [119 S.Ct. 755, 761-762, 142 L.Ed.2d 881] <em>(Hughes Aircraft).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">In conjunction with CRIP I, Hoechst created and maintained a trust known as the Celanese Retirement Income Plan Trust (CRIP Trust I). The trust was tax exempt, and Chase Manhattan Bank acted as the trustee. To fund CRIP I, Hoechst made periodic contributions to the CRIP Trust I, and the trust invested these contributions in order to ensure adequate funding for the pension plan. These contributions discharged Hoechst\u2019s financial obligations and liabilities to CRIP I subject to any limitations imposed by ERISA. As permitted by law, Hoechst claimed tax deductions for these contributions on its federal and California tax returns. Any surplus assets in excess of those necessary to meet any obligations and liabilities owed under ERISA and CRIP I (surplus pension plan assets) were used to reduce future contributions by Hoechst to the CRIP Trust I and were not used to increase any benefits provided under the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Because the CRIP Trust I held the pension plan assets, Hoechst did not own or hold legal title to these assets and could not use these assets to fund any of its corporate activities. Hoechst, however, retained an interest in any surplus pension plan assets. These surplus assets would revert to Hoechst <em>only </em>upon termination of the plan and satisfaction of all benefits and liabilities owed under CRIP I and ERISA. Until such a reversion, none of the pension plan assets, including any contributions or capital gains, were taxable as Hoechst\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Even though Hoechst did not hold legal title to the pension plan assets, it did have some control over them through its power over CRIP I and the CRIP Trust I and their predecessors. For example, Hoechst had the power to amend or discontinue the pension plans at any time, subject to ERISA limitations. The board of directors of Hoechst also had the power to appoint and replace the trustees of the pension plan assets at any time\u2014a power that it exercised on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Hoechst also retained the power to administer its pension plans, including the power to prescribe procedures to follow in obtaining evidence necessary to establish the right of any person to payments under the plans, to interpret the terms of the plans, to prescribe procedures for determining and recording the periods for calculating benefits, and to determine the right of any person to benefits under the plans. To exercise these powers, Hoechst created an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>administrative committee composed of Hoechst employees, including corporate officers. Known as the Employee Benefits Administration Committee, the committee handled all paperwork for the plans, determined eligibility for benefits and considered requests for increases in benefits. The committee met in either New York or North Carolina three to six times a year on an irregular basis, depending on the rate that applications accumulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Hoechst also created a separate committee responsible for the supervision and review of the financial operation of its pension plans and trusts. The Celanese Pension Plan Investment Committee was comprised of Hoechst\u2019s chief financial officer, some of its vice-presidents, its controller and an individual from its human resources department. The committee established, supervised and reviewed the funding and investment policies of the plans and trusts and appointed the investment fund managers who determined the actual investments made by the plans and trusts. Although the committee did not control the specific investments chosen by the fund managers, it had the power to change fund managers and guide their overall investment strategy. On many occasions, Hoechst exercised this power and replaced these fund managers for various reasons, including inadequate performance. For example, in 1978, the committee \u201cdrastically revised\u201d the investment strategy of its pension plan and \u201cintroduced new managers with a different perspective on their mission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Due to years of wise investments, the CRIP Trust I accumulated more assets than necessary to fund the defined benefits owed to plan members under CRIP I and ERISA. In 1983, Hoechst decided to recapture these surplus assets in order to preclude their use in a takeover bid. To recapture the surplus assets, Hoechst divided CRIP I into two separate plans with essentially the same provisions as CRIP I. The newly created Celanese Retirement Income Plan (CRIP II) covered active employees, and the Celanese Retirement Security Plan (CRSP) covered retired employees. Like their predecessor, both plans were qualified benefit plans under Internal Revenue Code section 401(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Concurrent with its division of CRIP I, Hoechst divided the CRIP Trust I into two separate trusts. The Celanese Retirement Income Plan Trust (CRIP Trust II) funded the newly created CRIP II, while the Celanese Retirement Security Plan Trust (CRSP Trust) funded the newly created CRSP. As part of the split-up, Hoechst allocated all assets of the CRIP Trust I between the CRIP Trust II and the CRSP Trust. In making this allocation, Hoechst made sure that all benefits owed to CRIP II and CRSP members were fully funded as required under the terms of CRIP I and ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Using the funds allocated to the CRSP Trust, Hoechst purchased annuities to provide the benefits owed to its retirees. Hoechst then terminated both CRSP and the CRSP Trust in 1985. Upon termination, all surplus assets of that plan and trust reverted to Hoechst. This surplus totaled approximately $388.8 million. After the reversion, Hoechst placed these surplus pension plan assets in its general fund to be used for general corporate purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">As part of its 1985 federal tax returns, Hoechst reported the income from the reversion as \u201cmiscellaneous income.\u201d Hoechst also reported the income from the reversion as \u201ctaxable income of the business\u201d in its 1985 New York tax return, and paid New York state income tax on a small percentage of this income.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its 1985 California tax return, however, Hoechst did not apportion any part of the reverted income to California. Consequently, the state Franchise Tax Board (Board) issued a \u201cNotice of Additional Tax Proposed to Be Assessed for 1985\u201d and proposed to impose an additional franchise tax of $292,142 plus interest based on the income from the reversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Hoechst filed a timely protest. The Board denied the protest and affirmed the proposed assessment in its entirety. Hoechst then appealed to the State Board of Equalization (SBE). Citing <em>Appeal of Borden, Inc. </em>(Feb. 3, 1977) (1971-1978 Transfer Binder) Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 205-515, page 14,897-57 <em>(Borden), </em>and <em>Appeal of Kroehler Manufacturing Co. </em>(Apr. 6, 1977) (1971-1978 Transfer Binder) Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 205-646, page 14,897-122 <em>(Kroehler), </em>the SBE held that: (1) the definition of \u201cbusiness income\u201d in subdivision (a) of section 25120 created both a transactional and a functional test; and (2) income from the reversion was business income under the functional test. Thus, the reverted income was apportionable and subject to taxation in California. The SBE also found the tax assessment constitutional under the operational purpose test enunciated in <em>Allied-Signal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation </em>(1992) 504 U.S. 768, 778 [112 S.Ct. 2251, 2258, 119 L.Ed.2d 533] <em>(Allied-Signal).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Hoechst then filed a timely claim for refund with the Board. As part of the claim, Hoechst attached a check for $715,791.35\u2014which covered the original assessment plus interest. In the claim, Hoechst asked for a full refund, alleging that the income from the reversion did not constitute business income under section 25120. Hoechst further argued that apportionment of the income from the reversion to California violated the due process and commerce clauses of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">After the Board denied the claim, Hoechst filed a complaint for refund of taxes with the superior court. After a hearing, the court ruled in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Board. Specifically, the court found that: (1) the statutory definition of \u201cbusiness income\u201d established both a transactional and a functional test; (2) the income from the reversion was apportionable business income subject to taxation in California under the functional test; and (3) taxation of the income from the reversion by California did not violate the due process and commerce clauses of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Hoechst appealed, and the Court of Appeal reversed. Although the court applied both a transactional and functional test, it concluded that the reversion did not satisfy either test. First, the court found that the reversion did not meet the transactional test because the reversion was an extraordinary event that did not occur in the regular course of Hoechst\u2019s trade or business. Second, the court found that the reversion failed the functional test because Hoechst did not own or hold title to the pension plan assets that generated the income. Thus, the income from the reversion was nonbusiness income\u2014 and not business income\u2014and was only subject to taxation in Hoechst\u2019s commercial domicile, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">We granted review to determine whether: (1) income from a reversion of surplus pension plan assets constitutes business income apportionable to California; and (2) subjecting income from a reversion to taxation in California violates the federal due process and commerce clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Pursuant to \u201cthe unitary business principle,\u201d a state may \u201ctax a corporation on an apportionable share of the multistate business carried on in part in the taxing State.\u201d <em>(Allied-Signal, supra, </em>504 U.S. at p. 778 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2258].) California employs this \u201c \u2018unitary business\u2019 principle and formula apportionment in applying [its franchise] tax to corporations doing business both inside and outside the State.\u201d <em>(Container Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 159, 162-163 [103 S.Ct. 2933, 2939, 77 L.Ed.2d 545] <em>(Container Corp.).) </em>Under the \u201cunitary business/formula apportionment method,\u201d a state \u201ccalculates the local tax base by first defining the scope of the \u2018unitary business\u2019 of which the taxed enterprise\u2019s activities in the taxing jurisdiction form one part, and then apportioning the total income of that \u2018unitary business\u2019 between the taxing jurisdiction and the rest of the world on the basis of a formula taking into account objective measures of the corporation\u2019s activities within and without the jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 165 [103 S.Ct. at p. 2940].) Like many other states that use this method of taxation, California has adopted the UDITPA almost verbatim. <em>(Container Corp., </em>at p. 165 [103 S.Ct. at p. 2940]; \u00a7 25120 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Originally promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (Commissioners) in 1957, the UDITPA has two main objectives: \u201c(1) to promote uniformity in allocation practices among the 38 states which impose taxes on or measured by the income of corporations, and (2) to relieve the pressure for congressional legislation in this field.\u201d (Keesling &amp; Warren, <em>California\u2019s Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act </em>(1967) 15 UCLA L.Rev. 156, 156 (Keesling &amp; Warren).) Initially, the UDITPA received a tepid response as few states adopted it. In 1965, however, Congress proposed comprehensive legislation regulating state taxation of interstate commerce. Spurred by the specter of congressional intervention, many states, including California, adopted the UDITPA. (See Peters, <em>The Distinction Between Business Income and Nonbusiness Income </em>(1973) 25 So.Cal. Tax Inst. 251, 279 (Peters).) Currently, 22 states plus the District of Columbia have adopted the UDITPA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, some states have modeled their corporate tax scheme after the UDITPA. (See, e.g., <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Offerman </em>(1998) 349 N.C. 290 [507 S.E.2d 284, 294] <em>(Polaroid) </em>[North Carolina\u2019s \u201cCorporate Income Tax Act is modeled after [the] UDITPA\u201d]; <em>Kroger Co. v. Dept. of Revenue </em>(1996) 284 Ill.App.3d 473 [220 Ill.Dec. 566, 673 N.E.2d 710, 714] (Kroger) [the Illinois Income Tax Act \u201cwas modeled after the UDITPA\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">California\u2019s Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (California UDITPA) mirrors the UDITPA. (Compare \u00a7\u00a7 25120-25141 with 7A pt. 1 West\u2019s U. Laws Ann., <em>supra, </em>UDIPTA, \u00a7\u00a7 1-22, pp. 361-403.) Like the UDITPA, the California UDITPA divides all corporate income into two categories\u2014business income and nonbusiness income\u2014and uses the UDITPA definition of these categories. (\u00a725120.) \u201c\u2018Business income\u2019 means income arising from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business and includes income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a).) \u201c \u2018Nonbusiness income\u2019 means all income other than business income.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (d).) All business income is \u201capportioned to this state\u201d through a formula based on the property, sales and payroll of the taxpayer. (\u00a7 25128.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In contrast, nonbusiness income is generally \u201callocated in full to the state in which the taxpayer is domiciled.\u201d <em>(Robert Half Internat., Inc. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1020, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>1023 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 453] <em>(Robert Half).) </em>The tax treatment of corporate income therefore depends on its classification as business or nonbusiness income.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Because section 25120 defines \u201cnonbusiness income\u201d in relation to business income, the definition of \u201cbusiness income\u201d is the key to determining whether corporate income is apportionable or allocable.  To construe this definition, we apply the well-established rules of statutory construction and seek to \u201c \u2018ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wilcox v. Birtwhistle </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 977 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 260, 987 P.2d 727] <em>(Wilcox), </em>quoting <em>DuBois v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 382, 387 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 523, 853 P.2d 978].) As always, we begin with the words of a statute and give these words their ordinary meaning. <em>(Wilcox, </em>at p. 977.) If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, then we need go no further. <em>(Lungren v. Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].) If, however, the language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, then we look to \u201cextrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.\u201d <em>(People v. Woodhead </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1008 [239 Cal.Rptr. 656, 741 P.2d 154].) Where the Legislature adopts a uniform act, the history surrounding the creation and adoption of that act is also relevant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Marriage of Bonds </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 1, 16-19 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 252, 5 P.3d 815] <em>(Bonds).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">In the instant case, Hoechst contends the statutory definition of \u201cbusiness income\u201d creates a single transactional test, and the 1985 reversion of surplus pension plan assets does not satisfy this test or any other test. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>income from the reversion is nonbusiness income that is only taxable by Hoechst\u2019s commercial domicile, New York. The Board counters that the definition establishes both a transactional and functional test, and the reversion meets both tests. Thus, the reverted assets are apportionable to California. As explained below, we conclude that the statutory definition establishes separate transactional and functional tests for business income and that the reversion satisfies <em>only </em>the functional test. Therefore, the income from the reversion is apportionable business income.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">A. <em>The Business Income Tests</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Subdivision (a) of section 25120 states: \u201c \u2018Business income\u2019 means income arising from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business and includes income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations.\u201d Thus, the statutory definition of \u201cbusiness income\u201d consists of two clauses joined together by the conjunction and predicate, \u201cand includes.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In interpreting this language, all courts agree that the first clause establishes a transactional test. Some courts have, however, construed the second clause as a separate functional test for business income. <em>(Uniroyal Tire Co. v. Dept. of Finance </em>(Ala. 2000) 779 So.2d 227, 230 <em>(Uniroyal Tire).) </em>Under this construction, corporate income is business income if it satisfies either the transactional or functional test. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Other courts have rejected this approach and construed the two clauses as a single transactional test. Under this construction, the second clause modifies the first clause and merely exemplifies \u201cwhat fits within the definition.\u201d <em>(Polaroid, supra, </em>507 S.E.2d at p. 290.) Not surprisingly, Hoechst contends the statutory definition of business income establishes only a transactional test, while the Board contends the definition establishes both a transactional and functional test. We agree with the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We initially note that the statutory language is ambiguous and reasonably susceptible to either interpretation. On the one hand, the grammatical structure of the business income definition arguably creates both a transactional and functional test. \u201cBusiness income\u201d is the subject of the sentence. (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a).) Two predicate clauses containing different verbs, objects and prepositional phrases and separated by a conjunction follow this subject. As such, the definition arguably contains a \u201ccompound predicate\u201d that states two independent definitions of business income. <em>(Kroger, supra, 613 </em>N.E.2d at p. 713.) In other words, \u201cthe statute could grammatically be read as stating: \u2018Business income means income arising from transactions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>and activity in the regular course of the corporation\u2019s trade or business, and [business income] includes income from tangible and intangible property <em>(Polaroid, supra, </em>507 S.E.2d at p. 290.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Such an interpretation accords with the different language used in the first and second clauses. The first clause focuses on \u201ctransactions and activity\u201d and their relationship to \u201cthe regular course of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a).) In contrast, the second clause focuses on \u201cproperty\u201d and its relationship to \u201cthe taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The creation of two separate predicate clauses with different verbs, objects and prepositional phrases strongly suggests that \u201cthe second clause contains a definition distinct from that set forth in the first.\u201d <em>(Polaroid, supra, </em>507 S.E.2d at p. 291.) The apparent expansion of \u201cthe definition of business income\u201d by the second clause bolsters such a conclusion because a broader definition can hardly exemplify a narrower definition. <em>(Kroger, supra, </em>673 N.E.2d at p. 713.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">On the other hand, the addition of the word \u201cincludes\u201d after the conjunction linking the two clauses suggests that the second clause is a subset of the first clause under the last antecedent doctrine. (See \u00a7 25120, subd. (a).) According to this doctrine, \u201c \u2018qualifying words, phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote.\u2019 \u201d <em>(White </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 676, 680 [183 Cal.Rptr. 520, 646 P.2d 191], quoting <em>Board of Port Commrs. v. Williams </em>(1937) 9 Cal.2d 381, 389 [70 P.2d 918].) Arguably, the word \u201cincludes\u201d makes the second clause a qualifying clause that modifies the first clause\u2014and not just \u201cbusiness income.\u201d <em>(Uniroyal Tire, supra, </em>779 So.2d at p. 232.) In other words, \u201c[t]he concluding twenty-six words ... are added to include transactions involving disposal of fixed assets by taxpayers <em>who emphasize the trading of assets as an integral part of regular business.\u201d (Phillips Petroleum </em>v. <em>Dept. of Revenue </em>(Iowa 1994) 511 N.W.2d 608, 610 <em>(Phillips Petroleum), </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The language of the second clause provides some support for such an interpretation. The second clause states that the \u201cacquisition, management, <em>and </em>disposition\u201d of property must be \u201cintegral parts\u201d of the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cregular\u201d \u201cbusiness operations.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a), italics added.) The use of \u201cand\u201d suggests that the second clause merely exemplifies the first because the sale of property \u201c \u2018that is not regularly disposed of, but rather is held indefinitely,\u2019 \u201d arguably cannot be an integral part of the taxpayer\u2019s business operations. <em>(Uniroyal Tire, supra, </em>779 So.2d at p. 234, quoting Faber, <em>When </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>Does the Sale of Corporate Assets Produce Business Income for State Corporate Franchise Tax Purposes? </em>(May-June 1995) The Tax Executive 179, 187.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Moreover, the apparent breadth of the second clause equally supports the rejection of the functional test. As the Alabama Supreme Court observed: \u201cIf income is business income under the transactional test, then, a fortiori, it is business income under the functional test. In other words, the functional test would include everything that the transactional test includes\u2014and much more.\u201d <em>(Uniroyal Tire, supra, </em>779 So.2d at pp. 235-236.) As such, construing section 25120 to create two alternative tests for business income arguably renders the first clause mere surplusage, in violation of the rules of statutory construction. (See <em>People v. Cruz </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 764, 782 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 117, 919 P.2d 731].)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In light of these competing arguments, we conclude that the statutory language is ambiguous as to the existence of a separate functional test. At a minimum, we cannot find that either interpretation is unreasonable based solely on the statutory language. Indeed, the conflicting opinions of our sister courts interpreting the very same language demonstrate that reasonable minds may disagree over whether the business income definition creates a functional test.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, we must now turn to extrinsic aids in an effort to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent. These aids establish that the Legislature intended to create both a transactional and functional test for business income.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">As an initial matter, the legislative history behind the UDITPA strongly supports the inclusion of a functional test. Because the Legislature adopted the UDITPA almost verbatim (Keesling &amp; Warren, <em>supra, </em>15 UCLA L.Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>at p. 156), we look to the history behind the UDITPA for guidance (see <em>Bonds, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 16-19). This history reveals that the UDITPA definition of \u201cbusiness income\u201d derives from \u201cCalifornia decisional law\u201d which employed a separate functional test for business income. (Peters, <em>supra, </em>25 So.Cal. Tax Inst. at p. 278.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The first draft of the UDITPA did not distinguish between business and nonbusiness income. (Peters, <em>supra, </em>25 So.Cal. Tax Inst, at pp. 272-273.) After concerns about the constitutionality of the first draft arose, John S. Warren, a California tax administrator, suggested that the Commissioners divide all income into apportionable business income and allocable nonbusiness income. As part of his suggestion, Warren proposed a definition of business income based on language used in certain SBE decisions. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 275-276.) The Commissioners liked Warren\u2019s proposal, and \u201c[t]he final draft of the [UDITPA] contained the definitions of business income and nonbusiness income proposed by Mr. Warren.\u201d (Peters, <em>supra, </em>at p. 276.) Thus, the UDITPA\u2019s definition of business income was based on pre-UDITPA decisions of the SBE, and the UDITPA\u2019s distinction between business and nonbusiness income was \u201cin line with . . . California practice\u201d at the time of its enactment. (Keesling &amp; Warren, <em>supra, </em>15 UCLA L.Rev. at pp. 163-164; see also <em>Polaroid, supra, </em>507 S.E.2d at p. 294 [\u201cthe uniform definition of business income, as set forth in UDITPA, finds its origins in early California jurisprudence\u201d].) Accordingly, our interpretation of the business income definition should be guided by the SBE\u2019s pre-UDITPA decisions applying language similar to the language of the UDITPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">These SBE decisions consistently applied an <em>independent </em>functional test when determining whether income constituted business income. In doing so, the SBE used language virtually identical to the language in the second clause of the statutory definition. For example, in <em>Appeal of Marcus-Lesoine, Inc. </em>(July 7, 1942) 2 SBE 338, 340-341, the SBE held that interest income from conditional sales contracts constituted business income <em>solely </em>because \u201cthe acquisition, management and liquidation of the intangibles constitute^] integral parts of the corporation\u2019s regular business operations.\u201d Similarly, the SBE found that copyright royalties were business income <em>solely </em>because the \u201cacquisition, management and disposition of the intangibles constitute[d] integral parts of the corporation\u2019s regular business operations.\u201d <em>(Appeal of Houghton Mifflin Co. </em>(Mar. 28, 1946) 3 SBE 344, 345 <em>(Houghton Mifflin).) </em>The SBE also relied <em>solely </em>on the functional test when it held that patent royalties constituted business income. <em>(Appeal of National Cylinder Gas Co. </em>(Feb. 5, 1957) 6 SBE 153, 154 [\u201cWe have consistently held . . . that income from intangibles is includible in unitary income and subject to [apportionment] if the acquisition, management and disposition of the intangibles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>constitute integral parts of the unitary business\u201d]; <em>Appeal of Intern. Business Machines Corp. </em>(Oct. 7, 1954) 6 SBE 5, 6-7 [\u201cwe have previously held that income from such intangibles [patents] is subject to [apportionment] where the acquisition, management and disposition of the intangibles constitute integral parts of the owner\u2019s regular business operations\u201d].) Because these SBE decisions construe the language of the second clause as an independent test for business income, we hold that a separate functional test exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The comments to section 1, subdivision (a) of the UDITPA prepared by the Commissioners (Commissioners Comments) bolster our holding. The comment states in part that \u201c[i]ncome from the disposition of property used in a trade or business of the taxpayer is includible within the meaning of business income.\u201d (Comrs. Corns., UDITPA, com. foil. \u00a7 1, subd. (a), p. 2, reprinted at &lt;http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/ulc/fnact99/ 1920_69/udiftp57.htm&gt; [as of May 14, 2001].) By focusing on the \u201cproperty\u201d and its relationship to the \u201ctrade or business\u201d and using the \u201cdisposition\u201d language of the second clause <em>{ibid..), </em>the Commissioners\u2019 comment strongly suggests that a separate functional test for business income exists. Indeed, the comment ostensibly makes all income from the disposition of property used in the taxpayer\u2019s business apportionable even if the disposition does not occur \u201cin the regular course of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business.\u201d (7A pt. 1 West\u2019s U. Laws Ann., <em>supra, </em>UDITPA, \u00a7 1, subd. (a), pp. 361-362.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Administrative decisions interpreting the statutory definition of \u201cbusiness income\u201d also support the inclusion of a separate functional test.  Although we are not bound by administrative decisions construing a controlling statute, we accord \u201c \u2018great weight and respect to the administrative construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 12 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 960 P.2d 1031] <em>(Yamaha), </em>quoting <em>International Business Machines v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 923, 931, fn. 7 [163 Cal.Rptr. 782, 609 P.2d 1].) The amount of deference given to the administrative construction depends \u201c \u2018upon <em>the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to </em>control.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Yamaha, </em>at pp. 14-15, italics added by <em>Yamaha, </em>quoting <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co. </em>(1944) 323 U.S. 134, 140 [65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124].)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">In light of these considerations, we find the SBE decisions construing the language of the second clause of the statutory business income definition as an independent functional test for business income highly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>persuasive. In <em>Borden, supra, </em>(1971-1978 Transfer Binder) Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH), paragraph 205-616, page 14,897-59, the SBE first addressed the validity of the functional test and held that section 25120 authorized a separate \u201cfunctional test for business income.\u201d In a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, the SBE discussed the legislative history behind the UDITPA and relied heavily on those California administrative decisions that formed the basis for the business income definition. <em>(Borden, </em>at pp. 14.897- 58 to 14,897-59.) The SBE also cited language in regulations proposed by the Multistate Tax Commission and enacted in California that supported the existence of a separate functional test. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 14,987-59.) Finally, the SBE rejected the contrary conclusion reached by the Kansas and New Mexico courts in <em>Western Natural Gas, supra, </em>446 P.2d at page 783, and <em>McVean, supra, </em>543 P.2d at page 492, because these courts did not consider the UDIPTA\u2019s history or the regulations. <em>(Borden, </em>at p. 14,897-59.) During the 24 years since <em>Borden, </em>the SBE has consistently applied both a transactional and functional test when determining whether income constitutes business income under subdivision (a) of section 25120.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the SBE thoroughly considered the issue, reached a reasonable conclusion, and consistently applied this conclusion over the past 24 years, we see no reason to overturn the SBE\u2019s long-standing construction. (See <em>Yamaha, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 12-15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Finally, construing the second clause of the definition as a separate functional test fulfills one of the primary objectives behind the UDITPA\u2014to promote uniformity among the states. (Keesling &amp; Warren, <em>supra, </em>15 UCLA L.Rev. at p. 156.) Although courts in other jurisdictions that have adopted the UDITPA have disagreed over the existence of a separate functional test, the state legislatures in these jurisdictions have not. In four of the five states where the state court rejected the functional test, the state legislature amended the definition of business income to include such a test.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (See Iowa Code \u00a7 422.32; Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 79-3271, subd. (a) [taxpayer may elect to apply the functional test]; N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 7-4-2, subd. A; Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 67-4-2004.) Thus, virtually all states adopting the UDITPA now construe the second clause of the business income definition as a separate functional test. In the interests of promoting uniformity, we do the same. Accordingly, Hoechst\u2019s income from the reversion of surplus pension plan assets is apportionable as business income if it satisfies <em>either </em>the transactional test or the functional test.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">B. <em>The Transactional Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Under the transactional test, corporate income is business income if it arises \u201cfrom transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a).) Upon construing and applying this statutory language, we conclude that Hoechst\u2019s reversion of surplus pension plan assets fails to meet the transactional test.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The language of the transactional test is unambiguous, and courts have construed this language in a consistent manner. \u201cThe controlling factor by which\u201d the transactional test \u201cidentifies business income is the nature of the particular transaction\u201d that generates the income. <em>(Western Natural Gas, supra, </em>446 P.2d at p. 783.) To create business income, these \u201ctransactions and activity\u201d must occur \u201cin the <em>regular </em>course of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a), italics added.) \u201c[Rjelevant considerations include the frequency and regularity of similar transactions, the former practices of the business, and the taxpayer\u2019s subsequent use of the income.\u201d <em>(Associated Partnership I, supra, </em>889 S.W.2d at p. 195.) \u201c[Unprecedented, . . . once-in-a-corporate-lifetime occurrence^]\u201d do not meet the transactional test because they do not occur in the regular course of any business. <em>(Phillips Petroleum, supra, </em>511 N.W.2d at pp. 610-611.) Thus, income arising from \u201cextraordinary\u201d events such as a \u201ccomplete liquidation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>and cessation of business\u201d cannot satisfy the transactional test. <em>(Uniroyal Tire, supra, </em>779 So.2d at p. 236.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Here, the reversion and the activities necessary to execute the reversion were extraordinary occurrences. They were not normal trade or business activities of Hoechst, which manufactured and sold a diversified line of chemicals, fibers and specialty products. Indeed, the 1985 reversion of surplus pension plan assets was the first and only such transaction in Hoechst\u2019s corporate history. Because the reversion was a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime corporate occurrence,\u201d it cannot meet the transactional test. <em>(Phillips Petroleum, supra, </em>511 N.W.2d at pp. 610-611.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In reaching this conclusion, we reject the Board\u2019s attempt to define the relevant \u201ctransactions and activity\u201d as the purchase and sale of securities by the fund managers appointed by Hoechst. (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a).) These investments did not result in <em>any taxable income </em>to Hoechst <em>until and unless: </em>(1) the investments generated more assets than necessary to fund the defined benefits owed to plan members; and (2) Hoechst acted to recapture these surplus assets. Thus, the only transaction or activity that generated any taxable income for Hoechst was the reversion itself. Accordingly, the income from the reversion does not satisfy the transactional test and is apportionable to California only if it meets the functional test.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">C. <em>The Functional Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Under the functional test, corporate income is business income \u201cif the acquisition, management, and disposition of the [income-producing] property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a).)  After reviewing the statutory language and the applicable extrinsic aids, we hold that the reversion satisfies the functional test. Therefore, the income from the reversion is business income apportionable to California.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">We begin our analysis by examining the statutory language. In contrast to the transactional test, which focuses on the income-producing \u201ctransactions and activity,\u201d the functional test focuses on the income-producing \u201cproperty.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a).) This property may be \u201ctangible\u201d or \u201cintangible\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>and the nature of the relationship between this property and the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cbusiness operations\u201d is the critical inquiry <em>(Texaco-Cities, supra, </em>695 N.E.2d at p. 486 [the functional test \u201cfocuses upon the role or function of the property as being integral to regular business operations\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Before defining the relationship necessary to meet the functional test, we reject at the outset Hoechst\u2019s contention that the statutory term \u201cproperty\u201d implies that the taxpayer must own or hold legal title to the property. Such an interpretation only considers the term \u201cproperty\u201d in isolation and ignores the conditional clause that places this term in context: \u201cif the acquisition, management, and disposition of the <em>property </em>constitute integral parts of the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a), italics added.) This conditional clause\u2014and not the vague implications of the term \u201cproperty\u201d\u2014defines the relationship between the property and the taxpayer required by the functional test.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The conditional clause contains two key phrases: \u201cacquisition, management, and disposition of the property\u201d and \u201cintegral parts of the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a).) The first phrase\u2014 \u201cacquisition, management, and disposition of the property\u201d\u2014appears to refer to the taxpayer\u2019s interest in and power over the income-producing property. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In construing this phrase, the parties focus on the meaning of the word \u201cand.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Hoechst contends \u201cand\u201d has a conjunctive meaning, while the Board contends \u201cand\u201d has a disjunctive meaning in the statute. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Because \u201cand\u201d is ordinarily conjunctive and because nothing suggests a legislative intent to give \u201cand\u201d a different meaning, we agree with Hoechst. (See <em>Wilcox, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 977.) We do not, however, end our inquiry there. Rather, we find it both instructive and necessary to consider the meaning of the terms \u201cacquisition,\u201d \u201cmanagement,\u201d and \u201cdisposition\u201d in the context of the business income definition. (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Upon doing so, we conclude that the phrase \u201cacquisition, management, and disposition\u201d \u201crefers to the conditions of ownership of property by the taxpayer.\u201d <em>(Kroger, supra, </em>673 N.E.2d at p. 714.) Such a conclusion follows logically from the ordinary meanings of these words. At the time of the enactment of the California UDITPA, \u201cacquisition\u201d signified the \u201cact of acquiring\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (1961) p. 19), and \u201cacquire\u201d meant \u201cto come into possession, control, or power of disposal of\u2019 <em>(id. </em>at p. 18). \u201c[Mjanagement\u201d referred to the \u201cact... of managing,\u201d and \u201cmanage\u201d meant \u201cto control and direct: handle either well or ill: cope with: Conduct, Administer\u201d and \u201cto direct or carry on business or affairs: Supervise, Administer.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1372.) Finally, \u201cdisposition\u201d denoted <em>\u201cthe act or the power </em>of disposing or disposing of\u2019 and, as relevant here, \u201cdispose of\u2019 meant \u201cto transfer into new hands or to the control of someone else . . . Relinquish, Bestow.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 654, italics added.) In light of these definitions, the phrase \u201cacquisition, management, and disposition of the property\u201d establishes that the taxpayer must: (1) obtain some interest in and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>control over the property; (2) control or direct the use of the property; and (3) transfer, or have the power to transfer, control of that property in some manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Under this construction, legal ownership or title to the property is not necessary. Such a limitation is too restrictive because property ownership \u201cfinds expression through multiple methods.\u201d <em>(Union Oil Co. v. State Bd. of Equal. </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 441, 447 [34 Cal.Rptr. 872, 386 P.2d 496].) \u201cOwnership is not a single concrete entity but a bundle of rights and privileges as well as of obligations.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.) Indeed, corporations often control and use property to generate business income without owning or holding legal title to that property. Consequently, we believe the phrase \u201cacquisition, management, and disposition\u201d encompasses the myriad of ways that corporations may control and use the rights and privileges commonly associated with property ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The Commissioners Comments to the UDITPA confirm our belief. In the comment to section 1 of the UDITPA, the Commissioners state that \u201c[income from the disposition of property\u201d is business income if the property is <em>\u201cused </em>in a trade or business of the taxpayer.\u201d (Comrs. Corns., UDITPA, com. foil. \u00a7 1, subd. (a), p. 2, reprinted at &lt;http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/ulc/ fnact99/1920_69/udiftp57.htm&gt; [as of May 14, 2001], italics added.) In making this statement, the Commissioners clearly contemplated that the functional test would focus on the taxpayer\u2019s control and use of the property and not on legalistic formulations of property ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Of course, mere control and use of the income-producing property is not enough to satisfy the functional test. Rather, the taxpayer\u2019s control and use of the property must still be an \u201cintegral part[] of the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a).) The critical terms in this second key phrase of the functional test are \u201cintegral,\u201d \u201cregular,\u201d and \u201coperations.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As explained below, these terms establish that the taxpayer\u2019s control and use of the property must contribute materially to the taxpayer\u2019s production of business income so that the property becomes interwoven into and inseparable from the taxpayer\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">We begin our interpretation of this phrase by defining the terms \u201cregular\u201d and \u201coperations.\u201d \u201c[RJegular\u201d means \u201cNormal\u201d or \u201cTypical.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict., <em>supra, </em>at p. 1913.) In the business context, \u201coperations\u201d mean \u201cthe whole process of planning for and operating a business\u201d or \u201ca phase of a business or of business activity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1581.) As such, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>phrase \u201cregular trade or business operations\u201d is unambiguous and refers to the normal or typical business activities of the taxpayer. (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">To reach this conclusion, we reject Hoechst\u2019s contention that the word \u201cregular\u201d limits the functional test to normal or customary corporate events. Although \u201cregular\u201d has the same meaning in the transactional and functional tests, it is not used in the same way in these tests. In the transactional test\u2014which focuses on the income-producing transaction\u2014\u201cregular\u201d modifies \u201ccourse of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business\u201d and makes the nature of the transaction relevant. <em>(Associated Partnership I, supra, </em>889 S.W.2d at p. 195.) In the functional test\u2014which focuses on the income-producing property\u2014 \u201cregular\u201d modifies \u201ctrade or business operations\u201d and follows the phrase \u201can integral part of.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a).) Consequently, \u201cregular,\u201d as used in the functional test, does not refer to the nature of the transaction, and the extraordinary nature or infrequency of the income-producing transaction is irrelevant. (See <em>Citicorp of North America, Inc. v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1430 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 509] (Citicorp); see also <em>Pierce Associates, supra, </em>462 A.2d at p. 1131; <em>Texaco-Cities, supra, </em>695 N.E.2d at p. 484; <em>Polaroid, supra, </em>507 S.E.2d at p. 289; <em>Ross-Araco, supra, </em>674 A.2d at p. 693.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Thus, the phrase \u201cregular trade or business operations\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a)) establishes that the taxpayer\u2019s control and use of the income-producing property must be part of the taxpayer\u2019s normal or typical business activities. The statutory term \u201cintegral\u201d then provides the touchstone for determining whether the property has a close enough relationship to the taxpayer to satisfy the functional test. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Not surprisingly, the parties disagree over the meaning of \u201cintegral.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Hoechst contends \u201cintegral\u201d means \u201cnecessary or essential to.\u201d The Board counters that \u201cintegral\u201d only means \u201ccontributing to.\u201d We, however, find neither interpretation to be accurate. Instead, we hold that \u201cintegral\u201d requires an organic unity between the taxpayer\u2019s property and business activities whereby the property contributes materially to the taxpayer\u2019s production of business income.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">As an initial matter, we note that the dictionary definition of \u201cintegral\u201d arguably supports both parties\u2019 positions. As defined by Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary, <em>supra, </em>at page 1173, \u201cintegral\u201d means \u201cof, <em>relating to, </em>or serving to form a whole: <em>essential to </em>completeness: organically joined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>or linked: Constituent, Inherent.\u201d (Italics added.) The relevant case law also lends support to both interpretations. On the one hand, we have suggested that \u201cintegral\u201d means \u201c \u2018dependent upon or contributes to\u2019 \u201d in the multistate taxation context. <em>(Superior Oil Co. v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 406, 413-414 [34 Cal.Rptr. 545, 386 P.2d 33], quoting <em>Edison California Stores, Inc. v. McColgan </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 472, 481 [183 P.2d 16].) On the other hand, other jurisdictions have used the \u201cessential to\u201d language when construing the functional test. (See, e.g., <em>Texaco-Cities, supra, </em>695 N.E.2d at p. 485; <em>Union Carbide Corp. v. Offerman </em>(2000) 351 N.C. 310 [526 S.E.2d 167, 171] <em>(Union Carbide).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Nonetheless, we believe that both interpretations are problematic and do not capture the true meaning of \u201cintegral.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a).) Construing \u201cintegral\u201d as \u201ccontributing to\u201d makes the test too expansive and creates constitutional problems. Although property that is integral to a taxpayer\u2019s business undoubtedly contributes to that business, \u201cintegral\u201d must imply something more than a mere contribution. Otherwise, the functional test would encompass all corporate transactions and run afoul of the constitutional limits on state taxation. (See ASARCO, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 307, 326 [102 S.Ct. 3103, 3114, 73 L.Ed.2d 787] <em>(ASARCO) </em>[property must do more than contribute to the taxpayer\u2019s business in order to be taxed by a state].) Construing \u201cintegral\u201d as \u201cnecessary or essential to,\u201d however, is too restrictive. Under this interpretation, many sales of corporate property could not satisfy the functional test because a corporate taxpayer presumably will not sell property unless the property is no longer necessary or essential to its business. Such an outcome conflicts with the explanatory comments to the UDITPA which contemplate the apportionment of gains realized from any sale of property used in the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business. (Comrs. Corns., UDITPA, com. foil. \u00a7 1, subd. (a), p. 2, reprinted at chttp:// www.law.upenn.edu/bll/ulc/fnact99/1920_69/udiftp57.htm&gt; [as of May 14, 2001].)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Thus, the meaning of \u201cintegral\u201d must fall somewhere in between these two interpretations. In forging this middle ground, we once again look to the SEE decisions underlying the functional test for guidance. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 524-525; see also Keesling &amp; Warren, <em>supra, </em>15 UCLA L.Rev. at pp. 163-164; <em>Polaroid, supra, </em>508 S.E.2d at p. 294.) These decisions reveal that the meaning of \u201cintegral\u201d comes from our decision in <em>Holly Sugar Corp. </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 218 [115 P.2d 8] <em>(Holly Sugar). (See Houghton Mifflin, supra, </em>3 SBE at p. 346 [relying on <em>Holly Sugar].) </em>In <em>Holly Sugar, </em>we held that losses suffered by a taxpayer from the forced liquidation of stock were apportionable because \u201cthe stockholding in question was an integral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>part of [the taxpayer\u2019s] unitary sugar business.\u201d <em>(Holly Sugar, </em>at p. 225.) The stockholding was \u201cintegral\u201d because it could not \u201creasonably be characterized as an extraneous investment separate and apart from the California business\u201d of the taxpayer. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 224.) Rather, \u201cthe activities of the two companies\u201d constituted \u201cone indivisible, composite whole, each portion giving value to every other portion.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Because of \u201cthis organic unity of operation,\u201d we regarded the liquidation of the stockholding as an \u201cintegral\u201d part of the unitary business of the taxpayer. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 224-225.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">In the context of the business income definition, the word \u201cintegral\u201d therefore refers to an \u201corganic unity\u201d between the income-producing property and the taxpayer\u2019s business activities. <em>(Holly Sugar, supra, </em>18 Cal.2d at p. 224.) The property must be so interwoven into the fabric of the taxpayer\u2019s business operations that it becomes \u201cindivisible\u201d or inseparable from the taxpayer\u2019s business activities with both \u201cgiving value\u201d to each other. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Such a relationship exists when the taxpayer controls and uses the property to contribute materially to the taxpayer\u2019s production of business income. (See <em>Borden, supra, </em>[1971-1978 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) 1 205-616, p. 14,897-59; <em>New York Football Giants, supra, </em>[1971-1978 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) ^ 205-600, p. 14,897-33.) In this way, we capture the true meaning of \u201cintegral.\u201d (See Webster\u2019s 3d Internat. Dict., <em>supra, </em>at p. 1173 [\u201cintegral\u201d means \u201cserving <em>to form a whole: </em>essential to <em>completeness: organically joined or </em>linked\u2019 (italics added)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Forming these interpretations of the statutory language into a cohesive whole, we conclude that income is business income under the functional test if the taxpayer\u2019s acquisition, control and use of the property contribute materially to the taxpayer\u2019s production of business income. In making this contribution, the income-producing property becomes interwoven into and inseparable from the taxpayer\u2019s business operations. Such an interpretation of the functional test flows from the ordinary meaning of the statutory language and the California decisions that formed the basis for the UDITPA definition of \u201cbusiness income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We further note that our interpretation is consistent with Court of Appeal decisions applying the functional test. For example, the Court of Appeal has found business income where the income-producing property contributed materially to the taxpayer\u2019s production of business income. In <em>Citicorp, </em>the court held that income from a taxpayer\u2019s sale of buildings constituted business income under the functional test because \u201cthe buildings were constructed or acquired to serve as important locations for [the taxpayer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>business] operations.\u201d <em>(Citicorp, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1429-1430.) Thus, the court premised its finding of business income on the buildings\u2019 material contribution to the taxpayer\u2019s production of business income and concluded that the buildings were an indivisible part of the taxpayer\u2019s business operations. (See <em>ibid.; </em>see also <em>Times Mirror Co. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 872, 877-878 [162 Cal.Rptr. 630] [income from the taxpayer\u2019s sale of a subsidiary\u2019s stock was business income because the subsidiary generated business income].)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">In contrast, the Court of Appeal has found nonbusiness income where the taxpayer\u2019s control and use of the property did not contribute materially to the generation of business income. In <em>Robert Half, </em>the court found that losses incurred from the repurchase of a stock warrant constituted nonbusiness income. <em>(Robert Half, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th at p. 1028.) Although the court mistakenly focused on the extraordinary nature of the transaction (see <em>id. </em>at p. 1025), it reached the correct result. The taxpayer\u2019s control and use of the warrants did not contribute materially to the production of any business income and were separate and distinct from the taxpayer\u2019s business operations. Therefore, losses from the repurchase of the warrants did not satisfy the functional test.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Our interpretation of the functional test also accords with the SBE\u2019s interpretation over the past two decades. On the one hand, the SBE has consistently found business income under the functional test where the taxpayer\u2019s control and use of the property contributed materially to the production of business income and became an indivisible part of the taxpayer\u2019s business. For example, the SBE found that losses from the sale of goodwill constituted business income because the taxpayer\u2019s acquisition and maintenance of this goodwill \u201ccontributed materially to the production of business income.\u201d <em>(Borden, supra, </em>[1971-1978 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) H 205-616, p. 14,897-59.) The SBE also held that compensation received for the loss of exclusive territorial rights constituted business income because these rights were \u201can important aspect of the business\u201d and \u201ccontributed materially to the production of business income.\u201d <em>(New York Football Giants, supra, </em>[1971-1978 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) T[ 205-600, p. 14,897-33.) Similarly, the SBE found that dividends from a joint venture were business income because these ventures \u201ccontributed materially to the production of operating income . . . and clearly served to further the operation of\u2019 the taxpayer\u2019s business. <em>(Standard Oil, supra, </em>[1981-1984 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) ^ 400-383, at p. 22,571.) Finally, the SBE held that income from stock sales constituted business income because \u201cthe assets and activities represented by the stock were fully integrated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>functioning parts of [the taxpayer\u2019s] existing unitary business.\u201d <em>(Occidental Petroleum, supra, </em>[1981-1984 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) n 400-394, p. 22,616.)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">On the other hand, the SBE has consistently refused to find business income under the functional test where the taxpayer\u2019s control and use of the property did. not contribute materially to the production of business income and were separate from the taxpayer\u2019s business. For example, the SBE found that rental income from a condominium constituted nonbusiness income because the rental business had no connection to the taxpayer\u2019s architectural business. <em>(Amwalt Group, supra, </em>[1981-1984 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) ^ 400-433, p. 22,696.) Similarly, the SBE held that income from the sale of stock in a company constituted nonbusiness income where the taxpayer exercised no control over and received no special benefits from that company. <em>(Mark Controls, supra, </em>[1986-1990 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) H 401-452, p. 24,569.) Finally, the SBE held that property used to obtain tax benefits did not give rise to business income because the property did not contribute to the production of business income and was not connected to any business activity of the taxpayer. <em>(VSI Corp., supra, </em>[1991-1992 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) H401-937, pp. 26,241 to 26,242; <em>National Dollar Stores, supra, </em>[1984-1986 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) H 401-403, p. 24,432.)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Finally, our interpretation is largely consonant with the decisions of other jurisdictions that have adopted the functional test. These jurisdictions have focused on the taxpayer\u2019s use of the property and typically find business income where the taxpayer uses that property to produce business income. (See, e.g., <em>Pierce Associates, supra, </em>462 A.2d at p. 1132 [insurance proceeds for flood damage to manufacturing facility used by the taxpayer to generate business income]; <em>Texaco-Cities, supra, </em>695 N.E.2d at pp. 486-487 [income from sale of pipeline and related assets used by the taxpayer to produce business income]; <em>American Smelting, supra, </em>567 P.2d at pp. 907-909 [royalties from patents developed and used by the taxpayer, income from leases of mines and rental of homesites to workers, interest income from short-term investments, income from sale of stock in companies used by the taxpayer for access to raw materials or as customers]; <em>Simpson Timber, supra, </em>953 P.2d at pp. 369-370 [proceeds from condemnation of timbered property used by the taxpayer as a source of raw materials].) These jurisdictions, however, refuse to find business income where the taxpayer has no control over the property or does not use the property in the production of business income. (See, e.g., <em>Pledger, supra, </em>831 S.W.2d at p. 125 [interest income from intercorporate note passively held and not controlled by the taxpayer]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>Ross-Araco, supra, </em>674 A.2d at p. 697 [income from sale of land never improved or used by the taxpayer]; <em>Laurel Pipe Line Co. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania </em>(1994) 537 Pa. 205 [642 A.2d 472, 475] [income from sale of pipeline not used by the taxpayer for over three years].)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Having established the contours of the functional test, we now apply it to Hoechst\u2019s reversion of surplus pension plan assets and conclude that the reversion meets this test. In reaching this conclusion, we find two SBE decisions instructive. In <em>Appeal of American Snuff Co. </em>(Apr. 20, 1960) [1959-1962 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 201-538, page 12,053 <em>(American Snuff), </em>the SBE held that interest income from loans made to the taxpayer\u2019s employees constituted business income under the functional test. Because the taxpayer made these loans \u201cfor the purpose of increasing the efficiency of the employees and they, accordingly, contributed to the operations of the unitary business,\u201d the SBE concluded that \u201cthe acquisition, management and disposition of\u2019 the loans \u201cconstitute[d] integral parts of the\u201d taxpayer\u2019s \u201cregular business operations.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Seventeen years later, the SBE applied the same reasoning and found that a rebate of surplus funds in a retirement plan constituted business income. <em>(Kroehler, supra, </em>[1971-1978 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) H 205-647, p. 14,897-123.) Because the plan served \u201c[a]s an inducement to retain the current employees of the Furniture Division and to attract other qualified employees,\u201d and because employees were necessary to conduct the taxpayer\u2019s business operations, the SBE held that the \u201cacquisition, management, and disposition of\u2019 the plan \u201cconstitute[d] integral parts of [the taxpayer\u2019s] manufacturing and sales business.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Taken together, these decisions establish that property maintained and used by a taxpayer to retain and attract employees is integral to the taxpayer\u2019s business operations. Although these decisions are not binding, we find them especially persuasive because of their longevity, consistency and reasoning. (See <em>Yamaha, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 12-14.) Indeed, <em>American </em>Snuff-\u2014which predates the California UDITPA\u2014is arguably controlling because the Legislature presumably enacted the UDITPA with the understanding that it did not alter existing California law. (See Keesling &amp; Warren, <em>supra, </em>15 UCLA L.Rev. at pp. 163-164 [the UDITPA\u2019s distinction between business and nonbusiness income \u201cis in line with . . . existing California practice\u201d].) Moreover, at least one other state court applying the functional test has applied similar reasoning to reach a similar conclusion. (See <em>American Smelting, supra, </em>567 P.2d at p. 907 [holding that rental income from homesites rented to employees constituted business income because the homesites were an integral part of the taxpayer\u2019s business operations].)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>In light of the reasoning of these decisions, the income from Hoechst\u2019s reversion of surplus pension plan assets constitutes business income under the functional test. Hoechst created the income-producing property\u2014the pension plan and trust\u2014in order to retain its current employees and to attract new employees. Hoechst had \u201cbroad authority to amend [the] plan\u201d <em>(Hughes Aircraft, supra, </em>525 U.S. at p. 442 [119 S.Ct. at p. 762]), and retained an interest in any surplus pension plan assets. It funded the plan with its business income and used these contributions to reduce its tax liability. Hoechst exercised control over the plan and its assets through various committees composed of its officers and employees. For example, Hoechst controlled: (1) the appointment of trustees over the pension plan assets; (2) the appointment of investment fund managers; and (3) the administration of the plan and its assets. In doing so, Hoechst directed the plan\u2019s overall investment strategy. Indeed, Hoechst regularly changed trustees and fund managers for various reasons, including inadequate performance, and even \u201cdrastically altered\u201d the plan\u2019s investment strategy in 1978. The surplus pension plan assets generated from this new investment strategy then allowed Hoechst to reduce or suspend its contributions to the plan otherwise required under ERISA. (See <em>Hughes Aircraft, supra, </em>525 U.S. at p. 441 [119 S.Ct. at p. 762].) Finally, Hoechst disposed of the pension plan assets by transferring these assets to two new plans and trusts, terminating one of these plans and trusts, and reverting the surplus assets of the terminated plan and trust to itself. Because the pension plan assets contributed materially to Hoechst\u2019s production of business income via their effect on Hoechst\u2019s labor force, the \u201cacquisition, management and disposition of\u2019 these assets \u201cconstitute integral parts of\u2019 Hoechst\u2019s \u201cbusiness operations.\u201d <em>(American Snuff, supra, </em>[1959-1962 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) 1 201-538, p. 12,053; <em>Kroehler, supra, </em>[1971-1978 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) 205-647, p. 14,897-123.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that Hoechst did not own or hold legal title to the pension plan assets, and that ERISA imposed many restrictions on Hoechst\u2019s control and use of these assets. (See <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 85, 91 [103 S.Ct. 2890, 2896-2897, 77 L.Ed.2d 490].) Nonetheless, Hoechst\u2019s control and use of the pension plan assets still contributed materially to its production of business income by improving the efficiency and quality of its workforce which, in turn, generated Hoechst\u2019s business income. Thus, the pension plan assets were integral to Hoechst\u2019s business operations, because these assets were interwoven into and inseparable from Hoechst\u2019s employee retention and recruitment efforts\u2014an essential part of any business operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">We further note that apportioning income from the reversion to California is equitable in light of the tax benefits received by Hoechst in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>with its control and use of the pension plan assets. Not only did Hoechst receive an operational benefit from its pension plan contributions, it also received a tax deduction for these contributions throughout the lifetime of the plans. Absent their use in the pension plans, these contributions would have been taxable as business income by California. Thus, Hoechst essentially received the. pension plans\u2019 contribution to its California business operations <em>tax free </em>prior to its reversion of surplus pension plan assets. In fact, absent apportionment of the income from the reversion, Hoechst would receive a windfall because New York\u2014Hoechst\u2019s commercial domicile\u2014 taxed only a small percentage of the reverted income. Under these circumstances, subjecting income from the reversion to taxation in California is both fair and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Finally, the absence of any reference to these pension plan assets in Hoechst\u2019s financial statements is irrelevant. These omissions are the product of accounting standards in effect prior to 1985 and do not necessarily reflect the actual relationship between the assets and Hoechst\u2019s business operations. In any event, national accounting standards adopted in 1985 now require \u201cexpanded disclosures intended to provide more complete and more current information\u201d about pension plan assets in financial statements. (Fin. Acctg. Stds. Bd., Summary of Statement No. 87, Employers\u2019 Accounting for Pensions (Dec. 1985) p. 3, at &lt;http://www.rutgers.edu/Accounting/raw/fasb/st/ summary/stsum87.htm&gt; [as of May 14, 2001].) The Financial Accounting Standards Board created these standards in an effort to make clearer the link between \u201cpension plan finances\u201d and \u201cthe corporations\u2019 operations.\u201d <em>(Improving FAS 87 </em>(Oct. 18, 1999) Pensions &amp; Investments, p. 12.) Thus, the failure of Hoechst to report the earnings of its pension plan on its books of account has no bearing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">We are mindful that the North Carolina Supreme Court reached a contrary conclusion in <em>Union Carbide, supra, </em>526 S.E.2d at page 171. We, however, find the reasoning of the North Carolina Supreme Court questionable in several respects. First, <em>Union Carbide </em>seemed to define \u201cintegral\u201d as \u201cessential to.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As a result, the court applied an overly restrictive interpretation of the functional test. Second, <em>Union Carbide </em>appeared to focus on the surplus rather than the income-producing property\u2014the pension plan assets. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, the court mistakenly concluded that the pension plan assets did not contribute to the taxpayer\u2019s production of business income. Finally, the North Carolina Supreme Court did not consider the California decisions that gave rise to the UDITPA definition of business income even though the court recognized the California roots of the UDITPA. <em>(Polaroid, supra, </em>508 S.E.2d at p. 294.) Because of these deficiencies, we decline to follow <em>Union </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>Carbide </em>despite the UDITPA\u2019s interest in promoting uniformity. In any event, our reasoning is consistent with the reasoning used by most other jurisdictions that apply the functional test (see <em>ante, </em>at p. 534), and conforms to the reasoning used by the Montana Supreme Court in an analogous situation (see <em>American Smelting, supra, </em>567 P.2d at p. 907). Accordingly, we conclude that the reversion created business income under the functional test.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Even though Hoechst\u2019s reversion of surplus pension plan assets falls within the statutory definition of business income, subjecting the income from the reversion to taxation in California must still pass constitutional muster.  Under the federal due process and commerce clauses, \u201ca State may not tax value earned outside its borders.\u201d <em>(ASARCO, supra, </em>458 U.S. at p. 315 [102 S.Ct. at p. 3108].) The taxpayer bears the \u201c \u2018burden of showing by \u201cclear and cogent evidence\u201d that [the state tax] results in extraterritorial values being taxed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 207, 221 [100 S.Ct. 2109, 2119, 65 L.Ed.2d 66], quoting <em>Butler Bros. v. McColgan </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 501, 507 [62 S.Ct. 701, 704, 86 L.Ed. 991], in turn quoting <em>N. &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. No. Carolina </em>(1936) 297 U.S. 682, 688 [56 S.Ct. 625, 628, 80 L.Ed. 977].) As explained below, Hoechst does not meet this burden. Therefore, apportionment of the income from the reversion to California is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">In limiting a state\u2019s taxing power, courts \u201care guided by the basic principle that the State\u2019s power to tax an individual\u2019s or corporation\u2019s activities is justified by the \u2018protection, opportunities and benefits\u2019 the State confers on those activities.\u201d <em>(Allied-Signal, supra, </em>504 U.S. at p. 778 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2258], quoting <em>Wisconsin v.

Thus, there must be \u201csome definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax.\u201d <em>(Miller Bros. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 340, 344-345 [74 S.Ct. 535, 539, 98 L.Ed. 744].) Corporate income \u201cearned in the course of activities unrelated to [corporate activities in the taxing] State\u201d is not includible in any apportionment formula. <em>(Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes </em>(1980) 445 U.S. 425, 439 [100 S.Ct. 1223, 1232, 63 L.Ed.2d 510].) The rationale behind this limitation is self-evident: \u201cIn a Union of 50 States, to permit each State to tax activities outside its borders would have drastic consequences for the national economy, as businesses could be subjected to severe multiple taxation.\u201d <em>(Allied-Signal, supra, </em>504 U.S. at pp. 777-778 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2258].)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>In construing these constitutional limitations on a state\u2019s taxing power, the United States Supreme Court has focused \u201con the objective characteristics of the [income-producing] asset\u2019s use and its relation to the taxpayer and its activities within the taxing State.\u201d <em>(Allied-Signal, supra, </em>504 U.S. at p. 785 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2262].) This relationship must involve a \u201cflow of value . . . .\u201d <em>(Container Corp., supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 178 [103 S.Ct. at p. 2947], italics omitted.) As such, only income from assets that \u201cserve an operational rather than an investment function\u201d are apportionable to a state for tax purposes. <em>(Allied-Signal, supra, </em>504 U.S. at p. 787 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2263].) The mere fact that a transaction has a \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d is not enough. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 788 [112 S.Ct. at pp. 2263-2264].) Although the United States Supreme Court has not clearly differentiated operational and investment functions, it has stated that an asset serves an operational function if it helps the taxpayer \u201cmake better use ... of [its] existing business-related resources.\u201d <em>(Container Corp., supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 178 [103 S.Ct. atp. 2947].)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Here, the income-producing asset\u2014the pension plan and trust\u2014 undoubtedly served an operational function for Hoechst. Hoechst funded the plan and trust with its apportionable business income. It managed the plan and trust by choosing the trustee and appointing a committee of its officers and employees to oversee the trust\u2019s administration, to choose its investment managers, and to guide its overall investment strategy. More importantly, Hoechst created and maintained the plan and trust in order to induce its current employees to stay and to attract new employees. As such, the pension plan and trust undoubtedly helped Hoechst \u201cmake better use\u201d of an important and existing business-related resource\u2014its employees. <em>(Container Corp., supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 178 [103 S.Ct. at p. 2947].) Indeed, Hoechst can hardly claim that the pension plan and trust were separable from its employee recruitment and retention efforts\u2014a crucial part of its business operations in California. Accordingly, subjecting an apportionable share of the reverted pension plan assets to taxation in California does not violate the federal due process or commerce clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">George, C.

Code, \u00a7 25120 et seq.) (UDITPA) was intended to help the several states avoid laying conflicting claims on the income of multistate businesses, thereby facilitating compliance with the due process and commerce clauses of the United States Constitution. In today\u2019s decision, the court encourages conflicting claims by defining as allocable \u201cbusiness income\u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 25120, subd. (a)) precisely the same type of income that the highest court of a sister state in the only other decision directly on point has defined as nonallocable \u201cnonbusiness income\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (d); <em>Union Carbide Corp. v. Offerman </em>(2000) 351 N.C. 310 [526 S.E.2d 167]). The court today, in other words, has ensured the UDITPA will not achieve its intended purpose. To what degree the act will fail, only time will tell.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">I suspect the act will fail to a large degree, because the majority\u2019s definition of business income is potentially all-encompassing. What the majority calls the transactional test captures income from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer\u2019s business. The so-called functional test addresses income from property. \u201c[I]ncome is business income under the functional test,\u201d the majority declares, \u201cif the taxpayer\u2019s acquisition, control and use of the property contribute materially to the taxpayer\u2019s production of business income.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 532.) The taxpayer\u2019s creation and indirect management of the ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq.) trust, the majority reasons, \u201ccontributed materially to its production of business income by improving the efficiency and quality of its workforce which, in turn, generated Hoechst\u2019s business income.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 536.)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The majority\u2019s broad definition of business income under the functional test has two problems, both of which strike at the heart of the UDITPA\u2019s purpose of fostering the uniform, constitutional allocation of a single taxpayer\u2019s income among the various states entitled to claim a portion thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The first problem is that the majority\u2019s definition of business income under the functional test potentially reaches <em>all </em>income from business-owned property, thereby rendering illusory, or nearly illusory, the category of nonallocable \u201cnonbusiness\u201d income recognized in the UDITPA. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 25120, subd. (d).) The majority permits the casual reader to assume that some corporate investments, even after today\u2019s far-reaching decision, may not be sufficiently integral to the corporation\u2019s business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>operations for their sale to generate allocable business income. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 534-535.) The assumption seems to make the decision less far-reaching and therefore more palatable. But the courts and administrative agencies that wrote the opinions the majority cites for reassurance on this point did not have the benefit of today\u2019s decision. After today\u2019s decision, income from property is allocable business income if there is \u201can organic unity between the taxpayer\u2019s property and business activities whereby the property contributes materially to the taxpayer\u2019s production of business income.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 530.) If this test captures income from an ERISA trust, which a corporation does not own and in which the corporation has only a contingent, reversionary interest, then the test must also capture income from other investments in property owned by the corporation and expected at some point to produce income available for business activities. Because a corporation must be able to draw upon its assets for business purposes as and when necessary, the wise management of cash and surplus assets to achieve an appropriate balance of liquidity, risk and return is just as essential to the production of business income as the wise management of human resources. We can, therefore, be sure the State Board of Equalization will soon ask itself whether income from the cash management accounts and other investments, wherever located, of corporations doing some business in California is not subject to taxation in California on the same basis as reversionary income from an ERISA trust. While the majority correctly observes that the former type of income has not been taxed by nondomiciliary states as allocable business income in the past (see maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 534-535), the majority\u2019s decision offers no principled basis for predicting that such income will not be taxed as business income in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The second problem is that the majority\u2019s definition betrays a narrow, parochial focus on the decisions of our own State Board of Equalization. We cannot safely assume our sister states will share the majority\u2019s firm conviction that California law is best. While Californians who participated in drafting the UDITPA may well have been influenced in that exercise by their knowledge of California law (see maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 522-523), it does not follow that we may properly assume the UDITPA adopted prior California law wholesale, or that we may treat the pre-UDITPA decisions of a single state\u2019s administrative agency as equivalent to authoritative interpretations of a uniform, multistate law. The official comments to the UDITPA do not even mention California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">That said, I nevertheless agree with the majority that it may be \u201cequitable\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 536) for California to tax the reversion to the extent Hoechst Celanese Corporation has deducted its contributions to the pension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>plan on its prior California tax returns. But equity in this sense is not a concern of the UDITPA. It is, instead, the domain of the tax benefit rule, a judicially developed principle that cancels out an earlier deduction when careful examination shows that a later event is fundamentally inconsistent with the premise on which the deduction was initially based. <em>(Hillsboro National Bank v.
