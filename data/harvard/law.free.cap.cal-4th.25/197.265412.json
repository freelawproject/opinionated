We conclude that a refund claim sufficiently raises any contention that is intertwined with or clearly implied from contentions explicitly raised in the claim. We further conclude that Revenue and Taxation Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sections 6011, subdivision (c)(10) and 6012, subdivision (c)(10) (hereafter section 601 l(c)(10) and section 6012(c)(10)) apply to the transactions at issue in this case and exempt the copyright transfers from taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">Heather Preston is a professional artist. From 1981 to 1993, Preston entered into a number of written agreements to provide artwork for use as book illustrations and rubber stamp designs (collectively, Agreements).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">Under the terms of the first agreement, dated August 11, 1981, Preston provided Celestial Arts, a book publisher, with eight illustrations for Remember the Secret, a children\u2019s book. Celestial Arts received \u201cthe right to reproduce the artwork in the book and in publicity and promotion connected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>with the book.\u201d In return, Celestial Arts gave Preston \u201ca 5% of cash received royalty on books sold\u201d and paid her $1,500 as an advance against future royalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">From 1988 to 1993, Preston entered into a series of agreements with All Night Media, a rubber stamp manufacturer. The agreements encompassed 54 designs created by Preston and gave All Night Media \u201c[a]ll rights for the use of [Preston\u2019s] artwork on any and all rubber stamp products. . . .\u201d In return, Preston received a flat fee upon publication of the first All Night Media catalog containing the designs and an additional amount in the form of either a flat fee for each publication of the designs in a subsequent catalog or a 5 percent royalty on sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In the last agreement, Preston contracted with Enchant\u00e9, a book publisher, to supply illustrations for a children\u2019s book, The Rainbow Fields. Enchant\u00e9 acquired \u201call of the exclusive rights comprised in the copyrights\u201d contained in these illustrations, including the \u201cunlimited perpetual right to sell, license, distribute, and otherwise use\u201d these copyrights in any media. In return, Preston received a royalty from Enchant\u00e9 on all book, calendar and poster sales containing the illustrations and a $7,500 advance on these royalties. Preston also retained the right to reproduce the illustrations \u201csolely for portfolio and self-promotion purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Pursuant to these Agreements, Preston transferred \u201cfinished artwork in tangible form . . . .\u201d The clients \u201cthen copied or reproduced images from this finished artwork\u201d for use in their products and returned the tangible artwork to Preston. Aside from those rights in the artwork expressly transferred under the Agreements, Preston retained all other rights in the artwork, including title.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In 1994, the State Board of Equalization (Board) conducted a sales and use tax audit of Preston\u2019s business records for the period of January 1, 1990, through December 31, 1993 (the audit period). The Board eventually determined that Preston owed sales tax in the amount of $1,711.82 and interest in the amount of $321.44 based on the amount of royalties she received from the Agreements during the audit period.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Preston paid the tax claimed due and filed a petition for redetermination of her tax liability. One month later, Preston timely submitted a claim for refund. In her six-page claim, Preston raised a number of objections to the assessed tax. For example, she argued that California Code of Regulations, title 18, section 1501 (hereafter Regulation 1501)\u2014which specifically exempts a manuscript submitted for publication from sales tax\u2014precludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>taxation of the proceeds from her Agreements. She also claimed that these proceeds were not taxable because she only transferred \u201cthe right of reproduction and the artwork is returned to [her] for [her] files. Hence, a \u2018sale\u2019 of original artwork has not occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">After a hearing, the Board concluded that the royalties were taxable gross receipts and denied Preston\u2019s petition for redetermination. Preston then paid the interest due. Soon after, the Board denied her claim for refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Preston then filed the instant action, seeking a refund of the sales tax and interest that she paid. In her complaint, Preston alleged that \u201c[t]he sales tax paid by plaintiff [Preston] should be refunded because the use rights transferred by her were intangible property.\u201d After a one-day hearing, the trial court found that \u201cthe items sold by Plaintiff [Preston] were tangible personal property, and not intangible property\u201d and entered judgment for the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The Court of Appeal affirmed. In support, the court concluded that: (1) Preston waived any claim premised on the nontaxability of the Agreements\u2019 transfer of copyrights; (2) attainment of the tangible artwork was the true object of the Agreements because they \u201cwould have been worthless\u201d without the tangible artwork; and (3) the Agreements transferred \u201cpossession ... of tangible personal property for a consideration\u201d as understood in section 6006, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">We granted review to determine whether: (1) an administrative claim alleging that the taxpayer transferred only the right to reproduce and did not sell her artwork sufficiently raises a claim that the transaction involved the transfer of nontaxable copyrights; and (2) a taxpayer who temporarily transfers possession of tangible artwork solely for reproduction in books and merchandise but otherwise retains ownership of the artwork has to pay sales tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">As a preliminary matter, we must determine whether Preston has exhausted her administrative remedies by sufficiently raising the copyright issue in her claim for refund. Although the Board concedes that Preston \u201calleges that she transferred solely intangible property,\u201d it contends she did not sufficiently allege that the transactions were nontaxable transfers of copyrights. Thus, she failed to exhaust her remedies as to any claim premised on federal copyright law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Before filing suit for a tax refund, a taxpayer must present a claim for refund to the Board. (\u00a7 6932.) The claim \u201cshall be in writing and shall state the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded.\u201d (\u00a7 6904, subd. (a).) The purpose of these statutory requirements is to ensure that the Board receives sufficient notice of the claim and its basis. (See <em>Wertin v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 961, 977 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 644] [\u201cthe purpose of the statute is to put the board on notice of a claim\u201d].) The Board then has an opportunity to correct any mistakes, thereby conserving judicial resources. (See <em>Atari, Inc. v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 665, 673 [216 Cal.Rptr. 267] <em>(Atari).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Any lawsuit against the Board must be based \u201con the grounds set forth in the claim\u201d for refund. (\u00a7 6933.) It may not include issues <em>\u201cnot </em>raised in the claim.\u201d <em>(Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1269, 1290 [250 Cal.Rptr. 891], italics added, affd. <em>sub nom. Jimmy Swaggart Ministries </em>v. <em>Cal. Bd. of Equalization </em>(1990) 493 U.S. 378 [110 S.Ct. 688, 107 L.Ed.2d 796].) \u201cThe claim for refund thus frames and restricts the issues for litigation.\u201d <em>(American Alliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 601, 609 [184 Cal.Rptr. 674, 30 A.L.R.4th 865].) Indeed, courts \u201care without jurisdiction to consider grounds not set forth in the claim.\u201d <em>(Atari, supra, </em>170 Cal.App.3d at p. 672.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Despite these limits on actions against the Board, a taxpayer need not expressly raise a contention in order to meet the statutory exhaustion requirements. Where the contention is intertwined with contentions expressly raised in the refund claim, courts may consider that contention even though the claim did not explicitly raise it. (See <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 149, 164-165 [85 Cal.Rptr. 890] <em>(Montgomery Ward) </em>[considering unstated contentions because they were \u201cintertwined\u201d with contentions raised in the refund claim].) In other words, unstated contentions clearly implied from contentions expressly raised in a claim for refund are sufficiently stated for purposes of exhaustion. (See <em>Wallace Berrie &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 60, 66, fn. 2 [219 Cal.Rptr. 142, 707 P.2d 204] <em>(Wallace Berrie) </em>[taxpayer satisfied the exhaustion requirement by implicitly raising the contention in his refund claim].)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">In this case, Preston more than sufficiently raised the copyright issue in her claim for refund. First, the contention in her claim that the transactions at issue involve only the transfer of the \u201cright of reproduction\u201d and not the \u201c \u2018sale\u2019 of original artwork\u201d sufficiently conveys her reliance on federal copyright law. Because the right \u201cto reproduce the copyrighted work\u201d is one of the rights given to copyright owners by statute (17 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u00a7 106), Preston\u2019s refund claim, by definition, raises a contention predicated on federal copyright law.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Second, Preston\u2019s discussion of Regulation 1501 adequately raises the copyright issue. In her refund claim, she analogizes an illustrator who submits illustrations for publication to the writer in Regulation 1501 who submits a manuscript for publication and asks \u201c[w]hy should one be taxed differently from the other?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the manuscript example in Regulation 1501 is premised on the nontaxability of a copyright transfer (see <em>Navistar Internat. Transportation Corp. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 868, 877 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 651, 884 P.2d 108] <em>(Navistar)), </em>Preston\u2019s analogy implicitly alleges that her transactions are not taxable because they involve only the transfer of nontaxable copyrights.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The absence of the word \u201ccopyright\u201d or an explicit reference to federal copyright law is immaterial. Preston\u2019s contention that the transactions were nontaxable transfers of copyrights is, without question, intertwined with and clearly implied from the contentions in Preston\u2019s refund claim. Thus, she has satisfied the statutory exhaustion requirements. <em>(Wallace Berrie, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 66, fn. 2; <em>Montgomery Ward, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d at pp. 164-165.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Finally, the Board\u2019s reliance on its ignorance of federal copyright law is disingenuous. Many transactions involve copyright transfers. Presumably, the Board must deal with copyright issues when determining the tax consequences of these transactions. The Board must therefore have at least a passing familiarity with copyright law. At a minimum, the Board should be able to recognize that a reference to the right to reproduce\u2014the best known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>right given to copyright owners\u2014implicates federal copyright law. (See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(1).) Indeed, the right to reproduce is embodied in the word \u201ccopyright.\u201d Accordingly, Preston sufficiently raised the copyright issue for exhaustion purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We now turn to the propriety of assessing a sales tax in this case and begin by determining whether Preston\u2019s Agreements are completely exempt from taxation because they fail to create transfers of tangible property for consideration. Citing the manuscript example found in Regulation 1501, Preston and amicus curiae Graphic Artists Guild contend the Agreements created <em>no </em>transfers of tangible property for consideration because the transfers of artwork were incidental to the transfers of copyrights in the artwork. Thus, <em>all </em>proceeds from the Agreements should be exempt from taxation. The Board counters that the temporary transfers of artwork pursuant to the Agreements constitute taxable leases. As explained below, we find that the Agreements are not wholly exempt from sales tax because they created taxable transfers of tangible property.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">California law imposes a retail tax on \u201cthe gross receipts . . . from the sale of all tangible personal property . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 6051.) A \u201csale\u201d means \u201c[a]ny transfer of title or possession, exchange, or barter, conditional or otherwise, in any manner or by any means whatsoever, of tangible personal property for a consideration\u201d (\u00a7 6006, subd. (a)), and includes \u201c[a]ny lease of tangible personal property in any manner or by any means whatsoever, for a consideration\u201d (\u00a7 6006, subd. (g)). \u201c \u2018Tangible personal property\u2019 means personal property which may be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched, or which is in any other manner perceptible to the senses.\u201d (\u00a7 6016.)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Because these provisions apply only to tangible personal property, intangible personal property is not subject to sales tax. (See <em>Navistar, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 874.) Although there is no statutory definition of intangible property, \u201csuch property is generally defined as property that is a \u2018right\u2019 rather than a physical object.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 875, quoting <em>Roth Drug, Inc. v. Johnson </em>(1936) 13 Cal.App.2d 720, 734 [57 P.2d 1022].) \u201cThus, for purposes of the law of taxation, intangible property is defined as including personal property that is not itself intrinsically valuable, but that derives its value from what it represents or evidences.\u201d <em>(Navistar, </em>at p. 874.)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Despite these definitions, distinguishing between tangible and intangible personal property for taxation purposes has proven troublesome. Much of the problem stems from the fact that the value of a tangible object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>often depends on the \u201cintangible rights and privileges\u201d associated with the object. <em>(Roehm v. County of Orange </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 280, 285 [196 P.2d 550].) Even where the intangible right\u2014i.e., a copyright\u2014is wholly distinct from the material object (see 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 202), determining the tax consequences of a transaction involving the transfer of such a right has been difficult because the transaction often includes the concurrent transfer of tangible property. (See, e.g., <em>Simplicity Pattern Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 900, 906 [167 Cal.Rptr. 366, 615 P.2d 555] <em>(Simplicity Pattern) </em>[transfer of film negatives and recordings and their copyrights].)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Regulation 1501 has exacerbated the confusion. Regulation 1501 ostensibly defines the criteria for \u201cdetermining whether a particular transaction involves a <em>sale of tangible personal property </em>or the transfer of tangible personal property incidental to the <em>performance of a service </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) It provides that \u201c[t]he basic distinction ... is one of the true objects of the contract; that is, is the real object sought by the buyer the service per se or the property produced by the service. If the true object of the contract is the service per se, the transaction is not subject to tax even though some tangible personal property is transferred.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The \u201ctrue object\u201d test described in Regulation 1501, by its terms, applies only to transactions involving \u201cthe performance of a service.\u201d The regulation, however, contains an example that does <em>not </em>appear to involve the performance of a service. (See <em>Culligan Water Conditioning </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 86, 96 [130 Cal.Rptr. 321, 550 P.2d 593] [\u201cService is defined as \u2018performance of labor for the benefit of another\u2019 \u201d].) In the so-called manuscript example, an author transfers \u201can original manuscript\u201d to a publisher \u201cfor the purpose of publication . . . .\u201d (Reg. 1501.) This transfer appears to involve the transfer of a copyright\u2014and not the performance of a service. (See <em>Navistar, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 877.) Nonetheless, Regulation 1501 applies the true object test and concludes that the transfer \u201cis not subject to taxation\u201d because the true object of the transaction is the acquisition of an intangible property right.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In doing so, Regulation 1501 suggests that a transfer of tangible property is not taxable if the transfer is incidental to the transfer of intangible property.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>We have, however, rejected such a broad interpretation of the manuscript example. In <em>Simplicity Pattern, </em>we held that the sale of \u201cfilm negatives and master recordings used to make audiovisual\u201d training materials created a taxable transfer of tangible property for consideration. <em>(Simplicity Pattern, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 903.) To reach this holding, we concluded that \u201ca sale\u201d does not become \u201cnontaxable whenever its principal purpose is to transfer the intangible content of the physical object being sold\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 909), and found Regulation 1501 inapplicable because the \u201ctransfer was not incidental to any service\u201d <em>(Simplicity Pattern, </em>at p. 912). We also distinguished plaintiff\u2019s acquisition of negatives and recordings from the manuscript example in Regulation 1501 because \u201ca manuscript furnishes only verbal guidance,\u201d while the negatives and recordings were physically useful in the manufacturing process. <em>(Simplicity Pattern, </em>at p. 909.) Therefore, the negatives and recordings were analogous to printing plates, and the sale of these negatives and recordings was taxable. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 909, 912.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Since <em>Simplicity Pattern, </em>appellate courts have consistently held that a transfer of tangible property physically useful in the manufacturing process in conjunction with a transfer of intangible property rights in that property results in a taxable sale. In <em>Capitol Records, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 582, 587 [204 Cal.Rptr. 802] <em>(Capitol Records), </em>the Court of Appeal found taxable \u201croyalties [paid] in exchange for ownership of master tapes produced by\u201d independent production companies financed by the plaintiff. Relying on <em>Simplicity Pattern, </em>the court concluded that Regulation 1501 did not exempt these transactions from taxation because the tapes \u201cwere manifestly useful in the manufacturing process, [and] were not furnished as incidents to any service . . . .\u201d <em>(Capitol Records, </em>at p. 596.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Applying the same reasoning, the Court of Appeal in <em>A &amp; M Records, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 358, 376 [250 Cal.Rptr. 915] <em>(A &amp; M Records), </em>concluded that temporary transfers of master tapes created taxable transfers of tangible property. In <em>A &amp; M Records, </em>the plaintiffs obtained an exclusive license to use master tapes and duplicate master tapes owned by its subsidiaries. In return, the plaintiffs paid its subsidiaries royalties \u201cbased upon sales of records and tapes . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 365.) The plaintiffs then leased these duplicate master tapes to record clubs, which used them to produce records and tapes and received royalties from these clubs \u201con the basis of the number of records and tapes sold . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Based on <em>Simplicity Pattern </em>and <em>Capitol Records, </em>the court held that these royalty payments were taxable. In doing so, the court found Regulation 1501 inapplicable because the master tapes \u201cwere essential in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ultimate production of the records and tapes through which plaintiffs made their revenues\u201d (A <em>&amp; M Records, </em>at p. 376). Unlike the manuscript in Regulation 1501, \u201cthe master tapes are used in the production of records and tapes and are thus not used solely for their intellectual or artistic content.\u201d (A <em>&amp; M Records, </em>at p. 376.)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Together, these decisions establish that any transfer of tangible property <em>physically useful </em>in the manufacturing process is subject to sales tax even though the true object of the transfer is an intangible property right like a copyright. (See <em>Simplicity Pattern, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 912 [\u201cTheir [the negatives and recordings] value as physical objects permitted measuring the tax on their sale by the price received for their entire worth\u201d].) The purpose or nature of the transfer and the form of payment are irrelevant. (See A <em>&amp; M Records, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.3d at pp. 375-376; <em>Cqpitol Records, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d at p. 596.)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Such a conclusion flows logically from the statutes defining taxable and nontaxable leases. Under subdivision (g) of section 6006, \u201c[a]ny lease of tangible personal property <em>in any manner or by any means whatsoever, </em>for a consideration\u201d creates a taxable transfer. (Italics added.) Section 6006.3 then broadly defines \u201c \u2018[l]ease\u2019 \u201d to \u201cincludeQ rental, hire and license.\u201d Only leases involving the <em>\u201cuse of tangible personal property </em>for a period of less than one day for a charge of less than twenty dollars ($20) when <em>the privilege to use the property </em>is restricted to use thereof on the premises or at a business location of the grantor of the privilege\u201d are statutorily exempt from taxation. <em>{Ibid., </em>italics added.) By broadly defining taxable leases and narrowly defining the exception in terms of the <em>use </em>of the tangible property, sections 6006 and 6006.3 establish that the purpose behind and duration of a transfer of tangible property are irrelevant for determining whether a taxable transfer occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\"><em>Navistar </em>does not dictate a contrary result. <em>Navistar </em>merely held that \u201cphysical usefulness\u201d was not \u201ca necessary condition to taxation.\u201d <em>(Navistar, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 879.) After <em>Navistar, </em>transfers of tangible property remain taxable even if these transfers are merely incidental to transfers of intangible property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Thus, the temporary transfers of Preston\u2019s tangible artwork are taxable transfers of tangible property. Because Preston\u2019s Agreements transferred the artwork for use in a manufacturing process performed outside Preston\u2019s personal or business premises, they fall within the statutory definition of a taxable lease. (See \u00a7\u00a7 6006, subd. (g), 6006.3.) Like printing plates, master recordings and film negatives, the tangible artwork was physically useful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>and essential in the ultimate production of books and rubber stamps incorporating the copyright in the artwork. Without the physical artwork, the contracts were essentially \u201cworthless.\u201d (A <em>&amp; M Records, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.3d at p. 376.) As such, the artwork is not like a manuscript, which only furnishes \u201cverbal guidance\u201d and is not essential to the manufacturing process. <em>(Simplicity Pattern, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 909.) The Regulation 1501 manuscript example therefore does not govern, and the temporary transfer of Preston\u2019s artwork for purposes of reproduction is subject to sales tax. Indeed, Preston has implicitly conceded this point by declining to claim a refund of taxes attributable to her labor costs and arguing for the applicability of sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10). Accordingly, we conclude that Preston\u2019s Agreements are not entirely exempt from taxation because they involved a transfer of tangible property for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">(5a) Even though Preston\u2019s Agreements involved transfers of tangible property for consideration, they also involved transfers of intangible property\u2014the copyrights in the artwork\u2014for consideration. The Board contends Preston\u2019s transfer of tangible artwork in conjunction with the transfer of copyrights in that artwork renders her transactions taxable <em>in their entirety. </em>In support, the Board cites California Code of Regulations, title 18, section 1540 (hereafter Regulation 1540) as amended in January 2000. We, however, decline to adopt the Board\u2019s contention, and, instead, hold that sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10)\u2014as enacted in 1993\u2014govern Preston\u2019s Agreements and apply retroactively to exclude the copyright transfers from sales tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">We begin by determining whether Preston\u2019s Agreements are technology transfer agreements that fall within the purview of sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10). Section 6011 defines \u201c \u2018[sjales price\u2019 \u201d (\u00a7 6011, subd. (a)), and section 6012 defines \u201c \u2018[gjross receipts\u2019 \u201d (\u00a7 6012, subd. (a)). These sections are mirror images and identify the items to be included in or excluded from any calculation of the amount subject to sales tax pursuant to section 6051. In 1993, the Legislature added sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10). These provisions are identical and <em>exempt </em>the \u201camount charged for intangible personal property\u201d\u2014specifically, a <em>patent or copyright </em>interest\u2014transferred pursuant to a \u201ctechnology transfer agreement\u201d from taxation. (\u00a7\u00a7 6011(c)(10)(A), 6012(c)(10)(A).) As explained below, Preston\u2019s Agreements constitute technology transfer agreements as understood in sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) and are governed by these provisions if they apply retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The rules for interpreting statutes are well established. \u201cWhen construing a statute, we must \u2018ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wilcox </em>v. <em>Birtwhistle </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 977 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 260, 987 P.2d 727], quoting <em>DuBois </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 382, 387 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 523, 853 P.2d 978].) \u201cThe words of the statute are the starting point.\u201d (Wilcox, at p. 977.) If the ordinary meaning of the language \u201cis clear and unambiguous,\u201d then we need look no further. <em>(Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].) Otherwise, we may resort to extrinsic sources, such as the legislative history. (See <em>Harwich </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 272, 277 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 222, 980 P.2d 927].)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Application of these rules yields one inescapable conclusion: Preston\u2019s Agreements are technology transfer agreements as understood in sections 6011(c)(10) and 6Q12(c)(10). We begin by examining the statutory language. Subparagraphs (A) through (C) of sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) state that the amount subject to sales tax does \u201cnot include\u201d: \u201c(10)(A) The amount charged for intangible personal property transferred with tangible personal property in any technology transfer agreement, if the technology transfer agreement separately states a reasonable price for the tangible personal property. ftQ (B) If the technology transfer agreement does not separately state a price for the tangible personal property, and the tangible personal property or like tangible personal property has been previously sold or leased, or offered for sale or lease, to third parties at a separate price, the price at which the tangible personal property was sold, leased, or offered to third parties shall be used to establish the retail fair market value of the tangible personal property subject to tax. The remaining amount charged under the technology transfer agreement is for the intangible personal property transferred. [^Q (C) If the technology transfer agreement does not separately state a price for the tangible personal property, and the tangible personal property or like tangible personal property has not been previously sold or leased, or offered for sale or lease, to third parties at a separate price, the retail fair market value shall be equal to 200 percent of the cost of materials and labor used to produce the tangible personal property subject to tax. The remaining amount charged under the technology transfer agreement is for the intangible personal property transferred.\u201d Sections 6011(c)(10)(D) and 6012(c)(10)(D) then broadly define a \u201c\u2018technology transfer agreement\u2019 \u201d as \u201cany agreement under which a person who holds a patent or copyright interest assigns or licenses to another person the right to make and sell a product or to use a process that is subject to the patent or copyright interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Read as a whole and giving the statutory language its ordinary meaning, sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) unambiguously establish that the value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>of a patent or copyright interest transferred pursuant to a technology transfer agreement is <em>not </em>subject to sales tax even if the agreement also transfers tangible personal property. The lone trigger for this exemption is the presence of a technology transfer agreement. In other words, these provisions exclude the value of a patent or copyright interest from taxation whenever a person who owns a patent or copyright transfers that patent or copyright to another person so the latter person can make and sell a product embodying that patent or copyright. (See \u00a7\u00a7 6011(c)(10)(D), 6012(c)(10)(D).)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">In this case, Preston owned the copyrights in the transferred artwork. (See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(a).) Under the Agreements, she separately and distinctly transferred one of the rights comprised in a copyright\u2014the right to reproduce. (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(1).) Pursuant to the Agreements, the transferees manufactured and sold products\u2014i.e., books or rubber stamps\u2014\u201csubject to\u201d the transferred copyright interest. (\u00a7\u00a7 6011(c)(10)(D), 6012(c)(10)(D).) Accordingly, Preston\u2019s Agreements are technology transfer agreements as defined by paragraph (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The absence of the word \u201ccopyright\u201d in most of the Agreements is irrelevant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although an assignment or license of a copyright requires a \u201cwriting\u201d (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a)), the writing need not mention the word \u201ccopyright.\u201d (See <em>Schiller &amp; Schmidt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nordisco Corp. </em>(7th Cir. 1992) 969 F.2d 410, 413 [finding a valid copyright license even though the agreement did \u201cnot mention the word \u2018copyright\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Armento v. Laser Image, Inc. </em>(W.D.N.C. 1996) 950 F.Supp. 719, 733 [omission of \u201cthe word \u2018copyright\u2019 is not dispositive\u201d].) Where the wording of the agreement clearly transfers one of the rights or any subdivision of the rights specified in title 17 United States Code section 106, a copyright transfer has occurred. (Armento, at p. 733.) All of the Agreements assign or license the right to reproduce Preston\u2019s artwork. Because the right to reproduce is one of the exclusive rights comprised in a federal copyright (see 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(1) [\u201cthe owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following: [^[| (1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords\u201d]), the Agreements create a valid copyright assignment. (See <em>Schiller, </em>at p. 413; <em>Armenio, </em>at p. 733.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Likewise, the limited scope of the rights transferred in some of the Agreements does not mean that no copyrights were assigned or licensed. \u201cThe ownership of a copyright may be transferred in whole <em>or in part </em>by any means of conveyance or by operation of law,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright, <em>including any subdivision of any of the rights specified by section 106, </em>may be transferred . . . and owned separately.\u201d (17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 201(d)(1), (2), italics added.) In light of this broad language, \u201cthere would appear to be no limit on how narrow the scope of licensed rights may be and still constitute a \u2018transfer\u2019 of ownership, as long as the rights thus licensed are \u2018exclusive.\u2019 \u201d (3 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, Copyright (2000) Assignments and Licenses, \u00a7 10.02[A], p. 10-21.) All of Preston\u2019s Agreements, at a minimum, transferred the exclusive right to reproduce her artwork in a particular book or on rubber stamps. Therefore, the Agreements constitute valid assignments or licenses of a copyright interest covered by sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10). (See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(d)(1), (2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The Agreements also do not fall outside the purview of sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) because they involved the transfer of artwork and not technology. The Legislature broadly defined \u201ctechnology transfer agreement\u201d to encompass the transfer of <em>any </em>copyright interest which, by definition, includes copyrights in artwork. (See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a)(5).) It did not limit the definition to transfers of <em>high </em>technology. Indeed, the Legislature could have easily done so by defining \u201ctechnology transfer agreement\u201d as an assignment or license of \u201cthe right to make and sell\u201d a <em>high technology </em>\u201cproduct or to use a\u201d <em>high technology </em>process. (\u00a7\u00a7 6011(c)(10)(D), 6012(c)(10)(D).) Absent such language, we will not infer such a limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">We further reject the Board\u2019s contention that Preston\u2019s Agreements are not technology transfer agreements because they did not license \u201cthe right to make and sell a product . . . .\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 6011(c)(10)(D), 6012(c)(10)(D).) At oral argument, the Board claimed that Preston\u2019s Agreements did not transfer the right to make or sell a product because the transferees could have made or sold their books or rubber stamps without Preston\u2019s copyrights. The Board, however, misconstrues the statutory language. A technology transfer agreement need only license \u201cthe right to make and sell a product . . . <em>that is subject to the </em>. . . <em>copyright </em>interest.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) Because copyrights only protect \u201cthe <em>expression </em>of the idea\u2014not the idea itself\u2019 <em>(Mazer </em>v. <em>Stein </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 201, 217 [74 S.Ct. 460, 470, 98 L.Ed. 630], italics added (Mazerj)\u2014a product \u201cis subject to\u201d a copyright interest (\u00a7\u00a7 6011(c)(10)(D), 6012(c)(10)(D)), if the product is a copy of the protected expression or incorporates a copy of the protected expression. (See <em>Mazer, </em>at p. 218 [74 S.Ct. at pp. 470-471]). Here, Preston\u2019s Agreements gave the transferees the right to make and sell books or rubber stamps that incorporate a copy of her copyrighted artwork. Thus, the Agreements necessarily licensed the right to \u201cmake and sell a product . . . subject to the . . . copyright interest.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7601 l(c)(10)(D), 6012(c)(10)(D).)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Indeed, the Board\u2019s contention reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference between patents and copyrights.  Patents give an owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u201cthe exclusive right to manufacture, use, and sell his invention.\u201d <em>(Zenith Radio Corp. </em>v. <em>Hazeltine Research, Inc. </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 100, 135 [89 S.Ct. 1562, 1583, 23 L.Ed.2d 129].) Thus, the license of a patent interest, by definition, gives the licensee the right to make a product or to use a process. In contrast, \u201ccopyright protects originality rather than novelty or invention\u2014 conferring only \u2018the sole right of multiplying copies.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mazer, supra, </em>347 U.S. at p. 218 [74 S.Ct. at p. 471], fn. omitted.) Thus, the license of a copyright interest can only give the licensee the right to reproduce the copyrighted material in a product\u2014and not the right to make and sell a product.  Because sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) expressly exempt the assignment or license of the right to make and sell a product subject to <em>either </em>a patent <em>or </em>copyright from taxation, they must encompass agreements, like Preston\u2019s, that license the right to reproduce copyrighted material in a product to be manufactured and sold by the licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In any event, the legislative history validates our interpretation of sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10), even if the statutory language is ambiguous. These subdivisions grew out of the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Petition of Intel Corporation </em>(June 4, 1992) [1993-1995 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 402-675, page 27,873 <em>(Intel). </em>In <em>Intel, </em>petitioner licensed several patents and copyrights to other companies so they could manufacture integrated circuits embodying these patents and copyrights. As part of the license agreements, petitioner transferred tangible property consisting of \u201cwritten information, instructions, schematics, database tapes, and test tapes.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Board held that these agreements created two separate and distinct transactions for tax purposes. The first transaction involved the transfer of tangible personal property and was subject to sales tax. The second transaction involved the nontaxable transfer of intangible property. In reaching this conclusion, the Board broadly defined \u201cintangible property\u201d as \u201cthe license to use the information under the copyright <em>or </em>patent.\u201d <em>{Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Soon after <em>Intel, </em>Assembly Member Charles Quackenbush introduced Assembly Bill No. 103 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) (Assembly Bill No. 103)\u2014 which eventually became sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10). The express purpose of Assembly Bill No. 103 was to \u201cimplement a decision of the Board of Equalization (BOB) with regards to an appeal filed by the Intel Corporation.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Rev. &amp; Tax., Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 103, as amended Mar. 17, 1993, p. 2; see also Cal. Dept. Finance, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 103, as amended Aug. 17, 1993, p. 1 [\u201cthe intent of this bill is to codify the Board of Equalization\u2019s (BOE) interpretation of Regulation 1501 as it applied to a technology transfer case <em>[Intel] </em>before the Board\u201d].) To implement <em>Intel, </em>Assembly Bill No. 103 borrowed <em>Intel\u2019s </em>broad definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>of intangible property and exempted any transfer of such property from taxation. (Compare <em>Intel, supra, </em>[1993-1995 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) H 402-675, p. 27,873 [holding that \u201cthe sale of intangible property which consists of the license to use the information under the <em>copyright or </em>patent\u201d was not subject to sales tax (italics added)], with sections 6011(c)(10)(D) and 6012 (c)(10)(D) [defining \u201c \u2018technology transfer agreement\u2019 \u201d as an assignment or license of \u201cthe right to make and sell a product or to use a process that is subject to the <em>patent or copyright </em>interest\u201d (italics added)].) In doing so, the Legislature presumably intended to adopt the plain meaning of this language and establish that the amount charged for a license to use <em>either </em>a patent <em>or </em>copyright is not taxable even if the license also transfers tangible property for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Such an understanding is confirmed by the enactment process. When Assembly Bill No. 103 reached the Senate, some analyses raised a concern that the proposed legislation was more expansive than <em>Intel. </em>\u201c[T]he use of \u2018or\u2019 instead of \u2018and\u2019 [in the definition of technology transfer agreement] broadens the Board\u2019s Intel decision to include not only those high technology agreements in which relatively little tangible personal property is transferred along with very valuable intangible rights to make and sell a product, but also copyright agreements involving a substantial proportion of tangible personal property. If taxpayers are able to structure a contract so that a large proportion of the value of the tangible personal property is assigned to the intangible copyright\u2014e.g., in a sale of a painting, assigning all but the price of canvas and oils to the intangible copyright to make posters of the painting\u2014their sales tax liability would be reduced.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Rev. &amp; Tax., analysis of proposed amends, to Assem. Bill No. 103, July 7, 1993, p. 3.) To address this concern, the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee proposed to limit the exemption in sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) to patent \u201cand\u201d copyright transfers. (Sen. Com. on Rev. &amp; Tax., analysis of proposed amends, to Assem. Bill No. 103, July 7, 1993, p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The Senate, however, rejected this proposal and made <em>no </em>changes to the definition of \u201ctechnology transfer agreement.\u201d Instead, the Senate actually broadened \u201cthe types of [agreements] that qualify for an exemption . . . .\u201d (Assem. Floor Analysis, Cone, in Sen. Amends, to Assem. Bill No. 103, as amended Aug. 17, 1993, p. 2.) In doing so, the Senate apparently concluded that Assembly Bill No. 103 adequately addressed the concern \u201cby requiring that a \u2018reasonable price\u2019 or \u2018fair market retail value\u2019 of like property be used to value the tangible personal property being transferred.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Rev. &amp; Tax., rev. analysis of proposed amends, to Assem. Bill No. 103, July 7, 1993, p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Soon after the Senate declined to limit the scope of Assembly Bill No. 103, the Board voiced its own concerns over the scope of the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>exemption. Noting that it \u201cmay be more broad than intended,\u201d the Board claimed that the proposed definition of technology transfer agreement would encompass licenses of copyrights in artwork, photographs, film strips and technical drawings. (State Bd. of Equalization, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 103, as amended Aug. 17, 1993, pp. 2-3, italics omitted.) The Board further acknowledged that the bill, as written, \u201cwould provide opportunities for the exclusion of a portion of gross receipts\u201d from taxation whenever a \u201cseller of commercial art\u201d separately charges \u201cfor the right to make and sell copies of the original artwork.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Several legislative committees echoed these concerns: \u201c[T]he exemption in this bill is somewhat broader than provided under board interpretation, because the bill exempts transactions concerning agreements which license patents or copyright interests, whereas the existing board interpretation concerns licenses of patent and copyright interests. BOB indicates that this bill could exempt many transactions, such as licenses of photographs, film strips or other artwork which currently are subject to taxation.\u201d (Appropriations Com., Fiscal Summary of Assem. Bill. No. 103, as amended Aug. 17, 1993, p. 1; Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill. No. 103, as amended Aug. 17, 1993, p. 2; see also Cal. Dept. Finance, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 103, as amended Aug. 17, 1993, p. 3 [\u201cBecause this bill refers to patents or copyrights, there is some concern that it may broaden the Intel decision to include not only high technology agreements where tangible personal property is transferred with very valuable intangible rights to make and sell a product, but also copyright agreements involving a substantial proportion of tangible personal property\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Thus, the Legislature was undoubtedly aware that the language of Assembly Bill No. 103 exempted <em>any </em>patent <em>or </em>copyright transfer from taxation, including transfers of copyrights in artwork. Nonetheless, the Legislature enacted this broad language <em>without </em>change. (Compare Stats. 1993, ch. 887, \u00a7 1, pp. 4826-4828 with Sen. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 103, Aug. 17, 1993.) This decision to adopt the broad language of Assembly Bill No. 103 despite repeated warnings about its scope strongly signals a legislative intent to apply sections 6011(c) (10) and 6012(c) (10) to copyrights in artwork.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The statement of intent in the 1993 legislation enacting sections 6011(c) (10) and 6012(c) (10) does not support a contrary interpretation. This statement provides that: \u201cIt is also the intent of the Legislature that the amendments made by this act not create any inference regarding the application of the Sales and Use Tax Law to other transactions involving the transfer of both intangible rights and property and tangible personal property.\u201d (Stats. 1993, ch. 887, \u00a7 3, p. 4831.) This language merely limits the scope of these provisions to those transfers of intangible property expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>encompassed within the statutory definition of \u201ctechnology transfer agreement.\u201d In other words, the sales tax exemption created by sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) applies only to the transfer of a patent or copyright interest\u2014and <em>no other </em>transfer of an intangible right or property such as a trade secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The Board\u2019s January 2000 amendments to Regulation 1540, even if they apply retroactively, do not alter our conclusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   Although a regulation enacted by the Board \u201c \u2018is entitled to great weight\u2019 \u201d <em>(International Business Machines </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 923, 930-931 [163 Cal.Rptr. 782, 609 P.2d 1], quoting <em>Rivera v.

The present version of Regulation 1540 makes the transfer of a \u201ccopyright, or subpart of a copyright (such as a right to reproduce or to prepare derivative works)\u201d in a photograph or work of art subject to sales tax whenever there is a \u201ctransfer by a tangible medium of\u2019 that photograph or work of art. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d)(4).) In doing so, Regulation 1540 conflicts with sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10), which expressly exempt the transfer of a copyright interest from taxation even if there is a corresponding transfer of tangible property. As such, Regulation 1540 exceeds the scope of the Board\u2019s authority and is invalid.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (See <em>Agnew, </em>at p. 322.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Our previous decisions are consistent with our interpretation of sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10). For example, in <em>Navistar, </em>we held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>purchase of drawings and designs and manuals and procedures containing trade secrets were fully taxable as a sale of tangible personal property. We based our holding in part on the absence of a \u201cseparate and distinct transfer of an intangible property right.\u201d <em>(Navistar, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 877-878, fn. omitted.) Consequently, we declined to apply sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10), because \u201cthe transfer of patents and copyrights\u201d was not at issue. <em>(Navistar, </em>at p. 880.) In contrast, the Agreements in this case involve the separate and distinct transfer of a copyright\u2014an intangible right distinct from \u201cany material object in which the work is embodied.\u201d (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 202; see also Civ. Code, \u00a7 982, subd. (c) [transfer of tangible artwork does not transfer the \u201cright of reproduction\u201d absent an express written agreement].) Thus, <em>Navistar </em>is distinguishable. For the same reason, <em>Intellidata, Inc. v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 594, 598-599 [188 Cal.Rptr. 850], <em>Albers v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 494, 496-497 [47 Cal.Rptr. 69], and <em>People v. Grazer </em>(1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 274, 278-279 [291 P.2d 957]\u2014which do not involve the transfer of a patent or copyright\u2014 are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><em>Michael Todd Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 684 [21 Cal.Rptr. 604, 371 P.2d 340], is also distinguishable. In <em>Michael Todd, </em>we held that the value of copyrights may be included in the valuation of a tangible object for purposes of calculating an ad valorem property tax. In the process, we reasserted \u201c[t]he propriety of including nontaxable intangible values in the valuation of otherwise taxable property . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 694.) We did not, however, hold that \u201csuch values are subsumed [in the value of tangible property] as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Shubat v. Sutter County Assessment Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 794, 804 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 1].) Thus, <em>Michael Todd </em>does not preclude the Legislature from excluding the value of patents or copyrights transferred in conjunction with tangible personal property from the retail sales tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Likewise, our decision in <em>Simplicity Pattern </em>is consistent with our interpretation of sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10). In <em>Simplicity Pattern, </em>the plaintiff sold \u201cfilm negatives and master recordings used to make audiovisual\u201d training materials. <em>(Simplicity Pattern, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 903.) The Board assessed the sales tax on these transactions using the value of the item stated in the inventory accounts on the plaintiff\u2019s books. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 904.) Because the inventory accounts calculated this value based on the \u201ccosts of materials and services\u201d used in producing the items, the Board, in effect, taxed the value of the tangible personal property sold by the plaintiff. (Ibid.; <em>id. </em>at p. 904, fn. 1.) Thus, by affirming the Board\u2019s assessment, we implicitly followed the approach outlined in sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10). Indeed, sections 6011(c)(10)(C) and 6012(c)(10)(C) establish that the \u201cretail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>fair market value ... of the cost of materials and labor used to produce the tangible personal property subject to tax\u201d may be used to calculate the sales tax on any transfer of tangible property in a technology transfer agreement. To the extent that <em>Simplicity Pattern Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 900, suggests that copyrights transferred in a technology transfer agreement may be taxed, however, sections 601 l(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) supersede it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Finally, our interpretation is consistent with the manuscript example in Regulation 1501. A manuscript \u201cfurnishes only verbal guidance to editors and typesetters\u201d and is not physically useful in the reproduction process. <em>(Simplicity Pattern, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 909, fn. omitted.) Because a publisher that obtains temporary possession of a manuscript does not physically use the manuscript in the publication process, the publisher receives no taxable benefit from this transfer of tangible personal property. (Cf. \u00a7 6006.3 [defining a lease in terms of the \u201cuse of tangible personal property\u201d].) Thus, under sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10), the tangible form of the manuscript has <em>no </em>taxable value to the publisher, and all proceeds from this transfer of the manuscript are exempt from taxation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Accordingly, Preston\u2019s Agreements are technology transfer agreements, and sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) control the tax consequences of these Agreements if these provisions apply retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">We now turn to the retroactivity issue. Because the legislation adding sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) did not become operative until April 1, 1994\u2014several months after the end of Preston\u2019s audit period\u2014these provisions do not govern here unless they apply retroactively. Even assuming that sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) \u201csubstantially change[] the legal consequences of past events\u201d <em>(Western Security Bank v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 232, 243 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 243, 933 P.2d 507] <em>{Western Security)), </em>we conclude they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">\u201cWhether a statute should apply retrospectively or only prospectively is, in the first instance, a policy question for the legislative body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>enacting the statute.\u201d <em>(Western Security, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 244.) Although statutes \u201care generally presumed to operate prospectively and not retroactively,\u201d this presumption is rebuttable. <em>(In re Marriage of Bouquet </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 583, 587 [128 Cal.Rptr. 427, 546 P.2d 1371], fn. omitted.) \u201c[W]hen the Legislature clearly intends a statute to operate retrospectively, we are obliged to carry out that intent unless due process considerations prevent us.\u201d <em>(Western Security, </em>at p. 243.) We may infer such an intent from the express provisions of the statute as well as from extrinsic sources, including the legislative history. (See <em>Evangelatos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188, 1210 [246 Cal.Rptr. 629, 753 P.2d 585] <em>(Evangelatos).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">With respect to sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10), the pertinent legislative materials reveal an unequivocal legislative intent to give it retrospective effect. In particular, the official statement of intent indicates that the Legislature intended sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) to apply retroactively. Section 3 of the 1993 statute amending sections 6011 and 6012 provides that: \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to clarify the application of the Sales and Use Tax Law (Part 1 (commencing with Section 6001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code) to technology transfer agreements, as defined.\u201d (Stats. 1993, ch. 887, \u00a7 3, p. 4831.) This statement alone strongly suggests that the Legislature intended for sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) to \u201capply to all existing causes of action from the date of its enactment,\u201d even if these subdivisions do not, in fact, clarify existing law. <em>(California Emp. etc. Com. </em>v. <em>Payne </em>(1947) 31 Cal.2d 210, 214 [187 P.2d 702] <em>(Payne); </em>see also <em>Western Security, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 243.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The legislative history reinforces our interpretation of this statement of intent. As explained earlier, Assembly Member Quackenbush introduced Assembly Bill No. 103 in order to implement <em>Intel. </em>(See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 216-217.) Although several analyses warned the Senate about the breadth of Assembly Bill No. 103 and its apparent expansion of <em>Intel, </em>the Senate declined to amend the bill. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 216-217.) Instead, the Senate <em>added </em>the statement of intent language found in section 3 of Assembly Bill No. 103 <em>after </em>receiving these warnings. (See Sen. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 103, Aug. 17, 1993.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">At this point, the Board expressed its own reservations about Assembly Bill No. 103\u2019s broadening of <em>Intel </em>and the newly added statement of intent language. \u201cProposed Section 3 of the bill would provide legislative intent language which specifies that this act is intended to clarify the application of the Sales and Use Tax Law with respect to technology transfer agreements, as defined in the bill. However ... the proposed definition of technology <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>transfer agreements could be interpreted more broadly, and, with this intent language, <em>could even be extended </em>retroactively(State Bd. of Equalization, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 103, as amended Aug. 17, 1993, p. 4, italics added.) Despite this admonition, the Legislature enacted Assembly Bill No. 103 <em>without </em>altering the statement of intent language. (Compare Stats. 1993, ch. 887, \u00a7 1, p. 4828 with Sen. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 103, Aug. 17, 1993.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Thus, the legislative history makes two things clear. First, the Legislature added a statement giving Assembly Bill No. 103 retrospective effect even though it was aware that the bill may partially change existing law. Second, the Legislature was aware of the retroactivity question during the enactment process and, nevertheless, chose to adopt language giving the statute retrospective effect. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the Legislature intended sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) to apply retroactively. (See <em>Evangelatos, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 1211 [where the Legislature consciously considers retroactivity and adopts language indicating an intent to give a statute retrospective effect, we may infer such an intent].)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The characterization of the legislation as a \u201ctax levy within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution\u201d does not alter our conclusion. (Stats. 1993, ch. 887, \u00a75, p. 4831.) By using this language, the Legislature merely acknowledged the normally accelerated effective date of the legislation in accordance with the dictates of article IV, section 8, subdivision (c) of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Likewise, the postponement of the operative date of the legislation until \u201cthe first day of the first calendar quarter commencing more than 90 days after the effective date of this act\u201d does not mean that the Legislature intended to limit its application to transactions occurring after that date. (Stats. 1993, ch. 887, \u00a7 5, p. 4831.)  \u201cThe effective date [of a statute] is . . . the date upon which the statute came into being as an existing law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCaskey </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 411, 416 [216 Cal.Rptr. 54].) \u201c[T]he operative date is the date upon which the directives of the statute may be actually implemented.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Although the effective and operative dates of a statute are often the same, the Legislature may \u201cpostpone the operation of certain statutes until a later time.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Henderson </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 475, 488 [166 Cal.Rptr. 20].) The Legislature may do so for reasons other than an intent to give the statute prospective effect. For example, the Legislature may delay the operation of a statute to allow \u201cpersons and agencies affected by it to become aware of its existence and to comply with its terms.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Palomar </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 131, 134-135 [214 Cal.Rptr. 785].) In addition, the Legislature may wish \u201cto give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>lead time to the governmental authorities to establish machinery for the operation of or implementation of the new law.\u201d <em>(Estate of Rountree </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 976, 980, fn. 3 [192 Cal.Rptr. 152].) A later operative date may also \u201cprovide time for emergency clean-up amendments and the passage of interrelated legislation.\u201d (Henderson, at p. 488.) Finally, a later operative date may simply be \u201ca date of convenience ... for bookkeeping, retirement or other reasons.\u201d <em>(Ross </em>v. <em>Bd. of Retirement of Alameda County Employees\u2019 Retirement Assn. </em>(1949) 92 Cal.App.2d 188, 193 [206 P.2d 903].)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In this case, the Legislature gave no rationale for the postponement. Thus, it may have postponed the operative date for reasons <em>other than </em>an intent to give sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) prospective effect. For example, the Legislature may have wished to give the Board time to enact new regulations for the 1993 tax year or to settle ongoing tax disputes prior to the implementation of the legislation. The Legislature also may have anticipated possible cleanup amendments in light of the Board\u2019s reservations over the scope of sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10). (See State Bd. of Equalization, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 103, as amended Aug. 17, 1993, pp. 2-3.) The delayed operative date may also reflect nothing more than a legislative desire to correlate the operative date to the filing deadlines for the 1993 tax year. Indeed, the Legislature\u2019s decision to make the legislation adding sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) operative on April 1, 1994\u2014 just before the April 15 deadline for filing 1993 tax returns\u2014equally suggests an intent to apply these subdivisions retroactively to transactions occurring in 1993. In any event, where, as here, compelling indicators of the Legislature\u2019s intent to give a statute retrospective effect exist, the mere postponement of the statute\u2019s operative date is not enough to negate these indicators. (See <em>Tevis </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 190, 194-196 [272 P.2d 757] [a charter amendment has retrospective effect even though the amendment delayed its effective date].)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Of course, even where the ascertainable indicators of legislative intent call for retroactive application <em>(In re Marriage of Bouquet, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 591), we will not apply a statute retroactively if \u201cthere is some constitutional objection thereto.\u201d <em>(Payne, supra, </em>31 Cal.2d at p. 214.) However, no such objection exists here. Retroactive application of sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) does not violate due process because it can only reduce the tax liability of a claimant and therefore cannot impair any vested property right of the claimant. (See <em>In re Marriage of Bouquet, </em>at pp. 591-594.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Giving sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) retrospective effect also does not constitute a gift of public funds in violation of article XVI, section 6 of the California Constitution.  \u201cAs a general rule, the Legislature cannot provide relief for taxes which have become fixed and vested.\u201d <em>(Scott </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number><em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1597, 1604 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 376].) However, \u201cexpenditures of public funds or property which involve a benefit to private persons are not gifts within the meaning ... of the Constitution if those funds are expended for a <em>public purpose </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Payne, supra, </em>31 Cal.2d at p. 216, italics added.) \u201cThe determination of what constitutes a public purpose is primarily a matter for the Legislature, and its discretion will not be disturbed by the courts so long as that determination has a reasonable basis.\u201d <em>(County of Alameda v. Carleson </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 730, 746 [97 Cal.Rptr. 385, 488 P.2d 953].) Consistent with this deference to the Legislature, courts have upheld the constitutionality of retroactive tax exemptions that provided relief to \u201cunwary taxpayers\u201d <em>(Scott, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 1605), promoted the use of alternative energy sources <em>(County of Sonoma </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 982, 993 [241 Cal.Rptr. 215]), or prevented \u201cundue hardship on employers\u201d <em>(Schettler v. County of Santa Clara </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 990, 1004 [141 Cal.Rptr. 731]).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Even assuming the Board had a fixed and vested right in the sales tax assessed against Preston, the retroactive application of sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) falls within this public purpose exception. By enacting these provisions, the Legislature \u201cintended to provide certainty to business taxpayers\u201d and \u201cimprove the business climate in California.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Rev. &amp; Tax., Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 103, as amended Mar. 17, 1993, p. 2; see also Sen. Com. on Rev. &amp; Tax., Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 103, July 7, 1993, p. 2.) Such an intent is undoubtedly a valid public purpose, and sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10)\u2014which clarify and limit the tax burden of businesses\u2014are wholly consistent with this purpose. Therefore, retroactive application of sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) does not create an unconstitutional gift of public funds. (See <em>County of Sonoma </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at p. 993.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that sections 6011(c)(10) and 6012(c)(10) have retrospective effect and govern the Agreements at issue here. Under these provisions, only the portion of Preston\u2019s income attributable to the Agreements\u2019 temporary transfer of tangible artwork is taxable. Because the Agreements do \u201cnot separately state a price for the tangible personal property\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 6011(c)(10)(B), (C), 6012(c)(10)(B), (C)), the amount subject to taxation is either \u201cthe price at which the tangible personal property was sold, leased, or offered to third parties\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 6011(c)(10)(B), 6012(c)(10)(B)), or \u201c200 percent of the cost of materials and labor used to produce the tangible personal property subject to tax\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 6011(c)(10)(C), 6012(c)(10)(C)). We therefore remand for a calculation of the sales tax owed by Preston under the Agreements and the resulting refund owed to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">George, C.

A Board of Equalization regulation expressly recognizes the latter transaction as a transfer of intangible property and thus not taxable. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, \u00a7 1501 (regulation 1501).)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Regulation 1501 provides in relevant part: \u201c[A]n idea may be expressed in the form of tangible personal property and that property may be transferred for a consideration from one person to another; however, the person transferring the property may still be regarded as the consumer of the property. <em>Thus, the transfer to a publisher of an original manuscript by the author thereof for the purpose of publication is not subject to taxation. The author is the consumer of the paper on which he has recorded the text of his creation. </em>However, the tax would apply to the sale of mere copies of an author\u2019s works or the sale of manuscripts written by other authors where the manuscript itself is of particular value as an item of tangible personal property and the purchaser\u2019s primary interest is in the physical property. Tax would also apply to the sale of artistic expressions in the form of paintings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>sculptures even though the work of art may express an original idea since the purchaser desires the tangible object itself; that is, since the true object of the contract is the work of art in its physical form.\u201d (Italics added.) The majority too recognizes that, under this example, the author of the manuscript is exempt from taxation. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 211.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Like the author in regulation 1501\u2019s example, plaintiff artist expressed on paper her creative efforts, which she transferred to a publisher for reproduction in children\u2019s books. The paper was merely the medium of transfer. Just as the \u201cauthor is the consumer of the paper on which he has recorded the text of his creation\u201d (reg. 1501), plaintiff artist is the consumer of the paper (tangible property) on which she has recorded her artistic expression (intangible property).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The distinction between an author\u2019s creative expression in the form of words and, as here, an artist\u2019s creative expression in the form of illustrations for a book should make no difference for purposes of taxation. In both, the creative expression represents intangible property. In both, the vehicle for the artist\u2019s expression is the paper, which is tangible property. I therefore agree with plaintiff that the transfer of her artistic renderings to a publisher for reproduction in children\u2019s books should, for tax purposes, be treated the same as the transfer of an author\u2019s manuscript to a publisher.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The majority\u2019s holding to the contrary would lead to anomalous results. Consistent with the manuscript example mentioned in regulation 1501, an author\u2019s transfer of a manuscript to a publisher would be exempt from taxation. Yet an artist\u2019s transfer of original drawings to the publisher for reproduction as illustrations in the same book would be taxable. Because the transfer of property determined to be tangible even though valued in part for its intangible content is taxed on the full value of the transaction <em>(Simplicity Pattern Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 900, 912 [167 Cal.Rptr. 366, 615 P.2d 555]), an author of a manuscript who also happened to draw the illustrations for the book would, under the majority\u2019s holding, have to pay taxes on both the transfer of the manuscript and the artwork if the transfer to the publisher occurred at the same time; but if the illustrations were transferred at a different time, only the transfer to the publisher of the illustrations for the book would be taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">According to the majority, plaintiff\u2019s original artwork is distinguishable from an author\u2019s original manuscript because artwork, unlike a manuscript, is physically useful in the manufacturing process and essential to the ultimate production of books, whereas a manuscript furnishes only \u201cverbal guidance.\u201d The majority, however, provides no support for this broad assertion. The majority also asserts that plaintiff\u2019s transfer agreements with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>publisher would be \u201cessentially \u2018worthless\u2019 \u201d without the \u201cphysical artwork.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 211.) But so would an author\u2019s agreement with the publisher to transfer a manuscript without ever providing the manuscript.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">To summarize, I see no meaningful difference between an author\u2019s transfer of a manuscript to a publisher (nontaxable under the majority\u2019s holding) and an artist\u2019s transfer of drawings to a publisher for a book\u2019s illustrations (taxable under the majority\u2019s holding). If the author is not subject to taxation, then neither should the artist here be.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Even if I were to agree with the majority that the transfer here is distinguishable from a manuscript under regulation 1501, that artwork is \u201ctechnology,\u201d and that the transfer is governed by the technology transfer agreement statutes (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 225), I would conclude, contrary to the majority, that these statutes are not retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">At issue are plaintiff\u2019s transfers of illustrations to the publisher for the period January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1993. Thereafter, the Legislature enacted the technology transfer agreement statutes at issue and directed that they become operative on April 1, 1994. (Stats. 1993, ch. 887, \u00a7 5, p. 4831.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">A statute is presumed to operate prospectively unless there is \u201can express declaration of retrospectivity or a clear indication\u201d that the Legislature intended otherwise. <em>(Tapia </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 282, 287 [279 Cal.Rptr. 592, 807 P.2d 434]; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 148, 153 [233 Cal.Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743].) Here we have neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">The majority insists, however, there is a clear indication of the statutes\u2019 retroactivity. In enacting the statutes, the Legislature expressed its intent to \u201cclarify the application of the Sales and Use Tax Law ... to technology transfer agreements, as defined.\u201d (Stats. 1993, ch. 887, \u00a7 3, p. 4831.) I do not share the majority\u2019s view that because the Legislature used the word \u201cclarify\u201d when it enacted the technology transfer statutes, it must have intended their retroactive application. Nor does the statutes\u2019 legislative history support such an intent by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">From the Legislature\u2019s decision to postpone the operative date of the statutes to April 1, 1994, 90 days after their effective date (Stats. 1993, ch. 887, \u00a7 5, p. 4831), one can reasonably infer, as I do, that the Legislature intended the technology transfer statutes to apply prospectively. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>majority notes, a statute\u2019s operative date may be postponed to give people time to comply with the statute, to allow government agencies to formulate implementing procedures, or to allow for the passage of related legislation. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 223-224.) This enables individuals and entities to adjust to future applications of new law.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Here, the statutes in question established new law. The Legislature enacted those statutes in the wake of the Board of Equalization decision in <em>Petition of Intel Corporation </em>(June 4, 1992) [1993-1995 Transfer Binder] Cal.Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 402-675, page 27,873. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 216, 222.) The Legislature, however, broadened the types of agreements qualifying for a tax exemption beyond those recognized in <em>Intel. </em>(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 216-218.) Given this change in the law, the Legislature\u2019s postponement of the statutes\u2019 operative date to a date 90 days after the statutes\u2019 effective date tends to support an intent to have the statutes apply prospectively rather than, as the majority concludes, retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Because there is no clear indication that the Legislature intended to give retroactive effect to the technology transfer agreement statutes enacted after the tax period at issue, I conclude that those statutes are inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">For the reasons stated above, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Mosk, J., and Werdegar, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-11\">All further statutory references are to the Revenue and Taxation Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
