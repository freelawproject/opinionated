Code, \u00a7 451)?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that such evidence is not admissible because arson is a general intent crime. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">On September 26, 1997, defendant told his friends that he hated Orville Figgs and was going to bum down Figgs\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">On the afternoon of September 27, defendant and his brother David drove by Figgs\u2019s home on the Ponderosa Sky Ranch. Defendant \u201cflipped the bird\u201d at Figgs as they passed by.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">Later that day, around 5:00 p.m., a neighbor saw David drive a white pickup truck into the Ponderosa Sky Ranch canyon, but could not tell if he had a passenger. Around 9:00 p.m., the same neighbor saw the pickup track drive out of the canyon at a high rate of speed. A half-hour later, a fire was reported. Shortly after 10:00 p.m., Figgs was awakened by a neighbor. Because the fire was rapidly approaching his house, Figgs set up a fire line. The fire came within 150 feet of his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">At 9:00 or 9:30 p.m., one of defendant\u2019s friends saw defendant at David\u2019s apartment. He was angrily throwing things around. When asked if defendant was heavily intoxicated, the friend replied, \u201cYes. Agitated, very agitated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">The county fire marshall, Alan Carlson, responded to the fire around 1:30 a.m. and saw a large fire rapidly spreading in the canyon below the ranch. He described fire conditions on that night as \u201cextreme.\u201d Both the weather and the vegetation were particularly dry. The wind was blowing from 12 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>27 miles per hour, with gusts up to 50 miles per hour. The canyon had heavy brush, trees, grass, and steep sloping grades. The fire could not be controlled for three days and burned an area from 2.5 to 2.8 miles long.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The fire marshall traced the origin of the fire to an approximately 10-foot-square area that was completely burned and smelled of \u201cchainsaw mix,\u201d a combination of oil and gasoline. A soil sample taken from that area tested positive for gasoline. About 40 feet away, the marshall found defendant\u2019s wallet, which was near a recently opened beer can, and tire tracks. He also found a disposable lighter nearby and two more beer cans in other parts of the canyon. All the cans had the same expiration date.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Several days later, defendant spoke with the fire marshall. After waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]), defendant told the marshall that he and his brother had spent much of the day drinking. They then drove in David\u2019s white pickup to the Ponderosa Sky Ranch canyon, where they drank some more and stayed between three and one-half to five hours. Defendant saw that the area was in poor condition and decided to bum some of the weeds. His family had once lived there. He pulled out the weeds, placed them in a small pile in a cleared area, retrieved a plastic gasoline jug from David\u2019s truck, and from the jug poured \u201cchainsaw mix\u201d on the pile of weeds. Defendant put the jug down a few feet away and lit the pile of weeds with a disposable lighter. The fire quickly spread to the jug and got out of hand. He and David tried to put the fire out, unsuccessfully. They panicked and fled while the jug was still burning. Defendant told the marshal that he meant no harm, claimed the fire was an accident, but admitted that he and his family had hard feelings with the Figgs family.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The marshall testified that the fire had not been started in a cleared area. The area was covered with vegetation, and there was no evidence that the fire started accidentally during a debris burn or that someone had tried to put it out. The marshall opined that the fire was intentionally set.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">An information charged defendant with arson of forest land. (\u00a7451, subd. (c).) The trial court instructed on arson (\u00a7451, subd. (c))<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and on the lesser offenses of arson to property (\u00a7 451, subd. (d)), . unlawfully causing a fire of forest land (\u00a7 452, subd. (c)), and misdemeanor (\u00a7 452; subd. (d)) unlawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>causing a fire of property. It described arson and all lesser offenses as general intent crimes and further instructed that voluntary intoxication is not a defense to arson and the lesser crimes and does not relieve defendant of responsibility for the crime. The jury found defendant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Defendant appealed, arguing that evidence of voluntary intoxication was admissible to show that he lacked the requisite mental state for arson. The Court of Appeal agreed. It reasoned that, as defined in its prior decisions of <em>In re Stonewall F. </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1054 [256 Cal.Rptr. 578] <em>(Stonewall F.) </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Fabris </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 685 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 667] <em>(Fabris), </em>the mens rea for arson is the intent to set fire to or bum or cause to be burned forest land, a specific mental state, as to which voluntary intoxication evidence is admissible under section 22, subdivision (b). The court reversed because the instmction that voluntary intoxication was not a defense to arson \u201cdenied defendant the opportunity to prove he lacked the required mental state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">We granted the People\u2019s petition for review on the issue of whether evidence of voluntary intoxication is admissible, under section 22, to negate the required mental state for arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Section 22 provides, as relevant: \u201c(a) No act committed by a person while in a state of voluntary intoxication is less criminal by reason of his or her having been in that condition. Evidence of voluntary intoxication shall not be admitted to negate the capacity to form any mental states for the crimes charged, including, but not limited to, purpose, intent, knowledge, premeditation, deliberation, or malice aforethought, with which the accused committed the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">\u201c(b) Evidence of voluntary intoxication is admissible solely on the issue of whether or not the defendant actually formed a required specific intent, or, when charged with murder, whether the defendant premeditated, deliberated, or harbored express malice aforethought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Evidence of voluntary intoxication is inadmissible to negate the existence of general criminal intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Whitfield </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 437, 448 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 858, 868 P.2d 272].) In <em>People v. Hood </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 444 [82 Cal.Rptr. 618, 462 P.2d 370] <em>(Hood), </em>we first addressed the question whether to designate a mental state as a general intent, to prohibit consideration of voluntary intoxication or a specific intent, to permit such consideration. There, we held that intoxication was relevant to negate the existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>of a specific intent, but not a general intent, and that assault is a general intent crime for this purpose. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 455-459.) We stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u201cThe distinction between specific and general intent crimes evolved as a judicial response to the problem of the intoxicated offender. That problem is to reconcile two competing theories of what is just in the treatment of those who commit crimes while intoxicated. On the one hand, the moral culpability of a drunken criminal is frequently less than that of a sober person effecting a like injury. On the other hand, it is commonly felt that a person who voluntarily gets drunk and while in that state commits a crime should not escape the consequences. (See Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law (2d ed. 1960) p. 537.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u201cBefore the nineteenth century, the common law refused to give any effect to the fact that an accused committed a crime while intoxicated. The judges were apparently troubled by this rigid traditional rule, however, for there were a number of attempts during the early part of the nineteenth century to arrive at a more humane, yet workable, doctrine. The theory that these judges explored was that evidence of intoxication could be considered to negate intent, whenever intent was an element of the crime charged. As Professor Hall notes, however, such an exculpatory doctrine could eventually have undermined the traditional rule entirely, since some form of <em>mens rea </em>is a requisite of all but strict liability offenses. (Hall, <em>Intoxication and Criminal Responsibility, </em>57 Harv.L.Rev. 1045, 1049.) To limit the operation of the doctrine and achieve a compromise between the conflicting feelings of sympathy and reprobation for the intoxicated offender, later courts both in England and this country drew a distinction between so-called specific intent and general intent crimes.\u201d <em>(Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at pp. 455-456, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Although we noted in <em>Hood </em>that specific and general intent have been notoriously difficult terms to define and apply, we set forth a general definition distinguishing the two intents: \u201cWhen the definition of a crime consists of only the description of a particular act, without reference to intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence, we ask whether the defendant intended to do the proscribed act. This intention is deemed to be a general criminal intent. When the definition refers to defendant\u2019s intent to do some further act or achieve some additional consequence, the crime is deemed to be one of specific intent.\u201d <em>(Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at pp. 456-457.) The basic framework that <em>Hood </em>established in designating a criminal intent as either specific or general for purposes of determining the admissibility of evidence of voluntary intoxication has survived. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendoza </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1114, 1128 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 428, 959 P.2d 735].)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Defendant argues that arson requires the specific intent to burn the relevant structure or forest land, a mental state that may be negated by evidence of voluntary intoxication. The People argue that arson is a general intent crime with a mental state that cannot be negated by such evidence. The Courts of Appeal have disagreed on the intent requirement for arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In <em>Stonewall F., supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d 1054, two minors set fire to a pile of leaves near a school building. The fire spread to the school, causing considerable damage. The juvenile court found that the minors intentionally set fire to the leaves, but that they did not intend to bum the school building. The court further found that the fire had been set recklessly, within the meaning of section 450, subdivision (f), and that the minors had also committed the more serious offense of arson. (\u00a7451.) The Court of Appeal, Third Appellate District, reasoned that, since section 452 created the less culpable crime of recklessly starting a fire (requiring a subjective awareness of the risk), the arson statute required a more culpable mental state \u201ctranscending recklessness,\u201d which the court labeled \u201cintentional.\u201d (208 Cal.App.3d at p. 1067.) It concluded: \u201cTo \u2018willfully and maliciously\u2019 cause the burning of a structure under section 451, subdivision (c) must mean that the burning of the structure is the end in view of the wrongful conduct, to wit intended.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In light of the juvenile court\u2019s factual findings, the Court of Appeal reduced the finding from arson to the lesser offense of recklessly causing a fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In <em>People v. Glover </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1476, 1479-1484 [285 Cal.Rptr. 362] (Second App. Dist., Div. Five) <em>(Glover), </em>the defendant invoked <em>Stonewall F., </em>claiming that the evidence did not support a specific intent to burn the relevant stmcture, a requirement for arson. The <em>Glover </em>court characterized <em>Stonewall F. </em>\u2019s holding to be that arson is a specific intent crime <em>(Glover, supra, </em>at pp. 1479-1480), but disagreed. It held that arson is a general intent crime, that it was not necessary for the evidence to show that the defendant possessed a specific intent to set fire to the apartment that had burned, and that it was required only that the acts that caused the apartment to burn were done willfully and maliciously. <em>(Glover, supra, </em>at pp. 1479, 1483-1484.) Other Courts of Appeal have agreed with <em>Glover. (People </em>v. <em>Lee </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 659, 664 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 782] [Second App. Dist., Div. Six]; <em>People v. Fry </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1334, 1338-1339 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 43] [Sixth App. Dist.]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1840, 1845-1846 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 317] [Fourth App. Dist., Div. One]; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Bolden </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 707, 717 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 485] [Second App. Dist., Div. Seven; disagreeing with <em>Stonewall F., </em>but refraining \u201cfrom detailing our own views\u201d because issue necessarily resolved under other, properly given instructions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">In <em>Fabris, </em>the Third Appellate District revisited the issue and reaffirmed its decision in <em>Stonewall F. (Fabris, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 693.) Applying the general test in <em>Hood </em>for distinguishing between general and specific intent, the court acknowledged that arson can be characterized as a general intent crime. <em>(Fabris, </em>at p. 697.) It held that the trial court did not prejudicially err in describing arson as a general intent crime as long as \u201cthe jury is correctly [apprised] of the elements of arson\u2014that the intent required is to set fire to or cause a structure to bum\u2014and there is no issue of voluntary intoxication . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 698.) Because intoxication was not an issue in <em>Fabris, </em>as it was with <em>Stonewall F., </em>the court \u201cimplied] no view whether arson, as defined in section 451, is a \u2018specific intent crime\u2019 for purposes of section 22.\u201d <em>(Fabris, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 696, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In this case, the Third Appellate District addressed the issue that was left unanswered in <em>Fabris. </em>It held that the mens rea for arson, as defined in <em>Stonewall F. </em>and Fabris\u2014the intent to set fire to or bum or cause to be burned forest land\u2014is a \u201crequired specific intent\u201d for which evidence of voluntary intoxication is admissible under section 22, subdivision (b). The Court of Appeal continued to characterize arson as a general intent crime, but relied on our opinion in <em>People v. Mendoza, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at page 1131, in concluding that the intent required for section 451 arson \u201c\u2018is closely akin to <em>Hood\u2019s </em>definition of specific intent, which requires proof that the defendant acted with a specific and particularly culpable mental state.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">We agree with the People that arson requires only a general criminal intent and that the specific intent to set fire to or bum or cause to be burned the relevant structure or forest land is not an element of arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u201cOur analysis must . . . begin with an examination of the statutory language describing the proscribed conduct, including any express or implied reference to a mental state.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hering </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 440, 445 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 839, 976 P.2d 210].) \u201cA person is guilty of arson when he or she willfully and maliciously sets fire to or burns or causes to be burned or who aids, counsels, or procures the burning of, any structure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>forest land, or property.\u201d (\u00a7 451.) \u201cMaliciously\u201d is defined in the arson chapter as \u201ca wish to vex, defraud, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act, established either by proof or presumption of law.\u201d (\u00a7 450, subd. (e); see also \u00a7 7, subd. 4.) \u201cWillfully\u201d is not defined in the arson chapter, but in section 7, subdivision 1: \u201cThe word \u2018willfully,\u2019 when applied to the intent with which an act is done or omitted, implies simply a purpose or willingness to commit the act, or make the omission referred to. It does not require any intent to violate law, or to injure another, or to acquire any advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u201c[T]he terms \u2018willful\u2019 or \u2018willfully,\u2019 when applied in a penal statute, require only that the illegal act or omission occur \u2018intentionally,\u2019 without regard to motive or ignorance of the act\u2019s prohibited character.\" <em>(Hale v. Morgan </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 388, 396 [149 Cal.Rptr. 375, 584 P.2d 512] and cases cited therein.) \u201cWillfully implies no evil intent; \u2018 \u201cit implies that the person knows what he is doing, intends to do what he is doing and is a free agent.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Bell </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1030, 1043 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 156]; see also <em>In re Trombley </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 801, 807 [193 P.2d 734].) The use of the word \u201cwillfully\u201d in a penal statute usually defines a general criminal intent, absent other statutory language that requires \u201can intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence.\u201d <em>(People v. Bell, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 1043; see also <em>People v. Sargent </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1206, 1215, 1219, 1224 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 835, 970 P.2d 409]; <em>People v. Colantuono </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 206, 213-215 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 908, 865 P.2d 704].)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">As with \u201cwillfully,\u201d the statutory definition of \u201cmaliciously,\u201d in the context of arson, requires no specific intent. Section 450, subdivision (e) defines \u201cmaliciously\u201d in terms of the arson statutes as \u201ca wish to vex, defraud, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act . . . .\u201d This is the same definition found in section 7, subdivision 4, except for the addition of \u201cdefraud.\u201d Outside the context of arson, the term \u201cmalicious,\u201d as used in section 7, subdivision 4, does not transform an offense into a specific intent crime. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Laster </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1450, 1468 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 680] [willful and malicious discharge of firearm from motor vehicle is a general intent crime]; <em>People v.

Nor does the term \u201cmalicious\u201d transform an offense into a specific intent crime in the context of arson. <em>(People v. Nance </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 925, 930 [102 Cal.Rptr. 266] [arson does not require a specific mental state which would permit defense of diminished capacity]; see also <em>People v.

(\u00a7 451.) Language that typically denotes specific intent crimes, such as \u201cwith the intent\u201d to achieve or \u201cfor the purpose of\u2019 achieving some further act, is absent from section 451. <em>(People v. Hering, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 446.) \u201cA crime is characterized as a \u2018general intent\u2019 crime when the required mental state entails only an intent to do the act that causes the harm; a crime is characterized as a \u2018specific intent\u2019 crime when the required mental state entails an intent to cause the resulting harm.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 463, 518-519, fn. 15 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 826, 896 P.2d 119].) The statute does not require an additional specific intent to burn a \u201cstructure, forest land, or property,\u201d but rather requires only an intent to do the act that causes the harm. This interpretation is manifest from the fact that the statute is implicated if a person \u201ccauses to be burned . . . any structure, forest land, or property.\u201d <em>(People v. Hiltel </em>(1901) 131 Cal. 577, 579-580 [63 P. 919] [defendant \u201ccaused\u201d building to be burned even though he set fire to different structure].) Thus, the intent requirement for arson fits within the <em>Hood </em>definition of general intent, i.e., the description of the proscribed act fails to refer to an intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence. <em>(Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at pp. 456-457.)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The statutory history of California\u2019s arson law further indicates that the Legislature did not consider arson, as defined in section 451, a specific intent crime. The common law crime of arson was the \u201c \u2018wilful and malicious burning of the dwelling house of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Bramble </em>(1947) 31 Cal.2d 43, 48 [187 P.2d 411]; see <em>U.S. v. Doe </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 136 F.3d 631, 635 [common law crime of arson is a general intent crime].) Before 1872, the arson statute contained no language supporting specific intent as an element of the offense, but rather paralleled the common law crime of arson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>as a \u201cwilful and malicious burning.\u201d (Stats. 1856, ch. 110, \u00a7\u00a7 4-5, p. 132; <em>In re Bramble, supra, </em>31 Cal.2d at pp. 48-49.) This changed with the adoption of the Penal Code in 1872, which provided that \u201c[a]rson is the willful and malicious burning of a building, with intent to destroy it.\u201d (Former \u00a7 447, enacted 1872 and repealed by Stats. 1929, ch. 25, \u00a7 6, p. 47; <em>In re Bramble, supra, </em>31 Cal.2d at p. 49.) That offense required a specific intent to destroy the property that was burned. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mooney </em>(1899) 127 Cal. 339, 340 [59 P. 761]; <em>People v. Fong Hong </em>(1898) 120 Cal. 685, 687 [53 P. 265].)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">When arson was recodified in 1929, section 447 was repealed (Stats. 1929, ch. 25, \u00a7 6, p. 47), and the new primary arson statutes (former \u00a7\u00a7 447a, 448a, &amp; 449a) dropped the specific intent requirement, leaving \u201cwilfully and maliciously\u201d as the only mental element. (Stats. 1929, ch. 25, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, p. 46; see <em>Glover, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1480 &amp; fn. 3 [setting forth statutory language of former \u00a7\u00a7 447a, 448a, &amp; 449a].) Other arson-related crimes (former \u00a7\u00a7 450a &amp; 451a), as part of the 1929 enactment, contained a specific intent requirement. (Stats. 1929, ch. 25, \u00a7 4, p. 46.) Former section 450a prohibited arson when done \u201cwith intent to injure or defraud the insurer.\u201d Former section 451a prohibited the placing of a \u201cflammable, explosive or combustible material\u201d in a building \u201cwith intent to eventually wilfully and maliciously set fire to or bum same.\u201d (Stats. 1929, ch. 25, \u00a7 5, p. 47; see <em>Glover, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1480-1481 &amp; fn. 4 [sets forth statutory language of former \u00a7\u00a7 450a &amp; 451a].)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In 1979, sections 447a, 448a, 449a, and 450a were repealed and section 451 was added to the Penal Code. (Stats. 1979, ch. 145, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, 7, p. 338.) The basic language in former sections 447a, 448a, and 449a, \u201cAny person who wilfully and maliciously sets fire to or bums or causes to be burned . . . ,\u201d was retained in section 451. (See Stats. 1979, ch. 145, \u00a7 8, p. 338.) Also, section 451a was amended and renumbered; it is currently section 455. (Stats. 1979, ch. 145, \u00a7 9, p. 339.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Since the 1929 recodification, specific intent has remained separate from the basic definition of arson as willful and malicious. (See \u00a7\u00a7 451, subd. (d) [burning of one\u2019s own property not arson \u201cof property\u201d absent an intent to defraud], 451.5 [aggravated arson], 453 [possession or manufacture of combustible material or incendiary device with intent to willfully and maliciously use], 455 [placement of flammable material in or about structure is an attempt only when done with intent to eventually willfully and maliciously set fire to it].)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Also, as part of the 1979 recodification of the arson statutes, the Legislature enacted section 452, which created the crime of recklessly causing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>fire, and section 450, which defined various terms, including \u201crecklessly\u201d (\u00a7 450, subd. (f)) and \u201cmaliciously\u201d (\u00a7 450, subd. (e)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Stats. 1979, ch. 145, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 11, pp. 338-339.) Section 452 provides, in pertinent part, that, \u201cA person is guilty of unlawfully causing a fire when he recklessly sets fire to or bums or causes to be burned, any structure, forest land or property.\u201d Section 450, subdivision (f) states: \u201c \u2018Recklessly\u2019 means a person is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his or her act will set fire to, bum, or cause to burn a structure, forest land, or property. The risk shall be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation. A person who creates such a risk but is unaware thereof solely by reason of voluntary intoxication also acts recklessly with respect thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Defendant reasons that, since arson is the more serious crime, it should have a more culpable mental state than the recklessness requirement of section 452. From that premise, he infers that the more culpable mental state of arson must be a specific intent. However, the lesser offense requires mere recklessness; arson requires the general intent to perform the criminal act. This is a continuum that does not support specific intent.  The fact that a crime requires a greater mental state than recklessness does not mean that it is a specific intent crime, rather than a general intent crime. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rocha </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 893, 898 [92 Cal.Rptr. 172, 479 P.2d 372] [although assault cannot be committed recklessly, \u201c[i]t does not follow, however, that assault with a deadly weapon should be classified as a specific intent crime\u201d].) The fact that reckless burning is a lesser offense of arson is also not dispositive. For example, attempted rape, a specific intent crime, is a lesser included offense of rape, a general intent crime. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Osband </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 622, 685 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 26, 919 P.2d 640]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 526, 528 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 677, 822 P.2d 385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Arson\u2019s malice requirement ensures that the act is \u201cdone with a design to do an intentional wrongful act. . . without any legal justification, excuse or claim of right.\u201d (5 Am.Jur.2d (1995) Arson and Related Offenses, \u00a7 7, p. 786.) Its willful and malice requirement ensures that the setting of the fire must be a deliberate and intentional act, as distinguished from an accidental or unintentional ignition or act of setting a fire; \u201c \u2018in short, a fire of incendiary origin.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Green, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d at p. 379; <em>People v. Andrews, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.2d at p. 75; 5 Am.Jur.2d, <em>supra, </em>Arson and Related Offenses, \u00a7 7, p. 786; accord, <em>U.S. v. Doe, supra, </em>136 F.3d at p. 635.) \u201cBecause the offensive or dangerous character of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>defendant\u2019s conduct, by virtue of its nature, contemplates such injury, a general criminal intent to commit the act suffices to establish the requisite mental state.\u201d (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Colantuono, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 215 [assault].) Thus, there must be a general intent to willfully commit the act of setting on fire under such circumstances that the direct, natural, and highly probable consequences would be the burning of the relevant structure or property. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fry, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at p. 1339; Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed. 1982) Offenses Against Habitation and Occupancy, \u00a7 2, pp. 276-277; cf. <em>People v. Rocha, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 899 [assault]; <em>People v. Bohmer, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.3d at p. 190 [malicious placement of obstruction on railroad tracks].) On the other hand, the offense of unlawfully causing a fire covers reckless accidents or unintentional fires, which, by definition, is committed by a person who is \u201caware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his or her act will set fire to, bum, or cause to burn a structure, forest land, or property.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 450, subd. (f), 452.) For example, such reckless accidents or unintentional fires may include those caused by a person who recklessly lights a match near highly combustible materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Defendant argues that, because the Legislature expressly made voluntary intoxication inadmissible to negate the recklessness required for the lesser offense, but did not expressly do so for arson, it intended that voluntary intoxication evidence is admissible to negate the mental state of arson. We disagree. Unlawfully causing a fire was a new crime added by the 1979 recodification of arson. (Stats. 1979, ch. 145, \u00a7 11, p. 339, adding \u00a7452; <em>Review of Selected 1979 California Legislation </em>(1980) 11 Pacific L.J. 412, 414.) The Legislature chose expressly to state its intent as to the new offense, one without an interpretative history. On the other hand, the Legislature did not redefine the basic definition of arson in the 1979 recodification; it retained the same \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d language in section 451. The arson statutes, prior to the 1979 amendment (former \u00a7\u00a7 447a, 448a, &amp; 449a), had been constmed generally as general intent crimes. <em>(People v. Andrews, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.2d at pp. 74-75; see also <em>People v. Tanner, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.3d at pp. 955-958; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nance, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.3d at p. 930; <em>People v. Williams, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.3d at pp. 345-346; <em>People v. Woods </em>(1958) 157 Cal.App.2d 617, 621-623 [321 P.2d 477] [voluntary intoxication not a defense to malicious burning under former \u00a7 449a]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mooney, supra, </em>127 Cal. at p. 340 [the words \u201cwillfully\u201d and \u201cmaliciously\u201d \u201cimport only that criminal intent which is a necessary part of every felony or other crime\u201d].) We had also previously held, prior to the 1979 amendment, that evidence of intoxication was admissible to negate a specific intent crime, but not a general intent crime. <em>(Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at pp. 455-456.)  \u201c[W]hen the Legislature amends a statute without changing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>those portions of the statute that have previously been construed by the courts, the Legislature is presumed to have known of and to have acquiesced in the previous judicial construction.\u201d <em>(People v. Blakeley </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 82, 89 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 451, 999 P.2d 675]; <em>People v. Weidert </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 836, 844 [218 Cal.Rptr. 57, 705 P.2d 380].)  Thus, we decline to infer an intent, which is contrary to the weight of legislative history, prior judicial interpretation, and statutory text, from legislative silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Defendant concedes that, prior to 1979, this court had not decided whether arson is a general or specific intent crime. Rather he argues that we indicated, in several cases, that arson required a specific intent. <em>(People v. Nichols </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 150, 163 [89 Cal.Rptr. 721, 474 P.2d 673]; <em>People v. Chavez </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 778, 789 [329 P.2d 907]; <em>People v. Ashley </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 246, 264, fn. 4 [267 P.2d 271].) However, in <em>Nichols </em>and <em>Chavez, </em>we adopted the defendants\u2019 characterization of arson as including a specific intent requirement, without squarely addressing the issue. In addressing those defendants\u2019 instructional claims as they related to felony-murder arson, we <em>assumed </em>their underlying predicate arguments that arson included a specific intent, but nevertheless concluded that the jury had been instructed properly. Although, at one point in <em>Nichols, </em>we referred to arson as containing a specific intent requirement <em>(Nichols, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 163), our analysis suggested that arson was a general intent crime. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 164-165 [\u201c[I]n felony murder based on arson the jury need find only that the defendant intended to set the fire\u201d]; see <em>Glover, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1481.) In <em>Ashley, </em>involving a grand theft conviction, we listed arson as a specific intent crime in dicta. (See <em>People v. Ashley, supra, </em>42 Cal.2d at p. 264, fn. 4.) Even if we accept defendant\u2019s claim that the law of arson was unsettled before the 1979 amendment, the salient fact is that the Legislature has retained the same basic definition of arson as willful and malicious since the 1929 recodification, when it omitted the specific intent requirement. We infer that if the Legislature meant for arson to have a specific intent requirement, it would have done so expressly.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Defendant further argues that, because the mental state for arson, as with assault, can be characterized as general intent or specific intent, like <em>Hood, </em>the decision whether or not to give effect to evidence of intoxication must rest on policy considerations. <em>(Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at pp. 457-458.) He emphasizes that, as a matter of policy, allowing intoxication evidence to negate the mental state element for arson would not necessarily result in complete acquittal, since a defendant could still be held accountable for a reckless burning, to which intoxication evidence is irrelevant. (\u00a7\u00a7 452, 450, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>subd. (f); cf. <em>People v. Whitfield, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 451.) However, as explained above, arson\u2019s mental state can be classified clearly as a general intent. In any event, policy considerations do not support defendant\u2019s claim. Although the policy consideration advanced by defendant may be valid, the policy considerations expressed in <em>Hood </em>itself appear to be more consistent with the legislative intent to exclude voluntary intoxication evidence from negating the mental state of arson. There, we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u201cA compelling consideration is the effect of alcohol on human behavior. A significant effect of alcohol is to distort judgment and relax the controls on aggressive and anti-social impulses. (Beck and Parker, <em>The Intoxicated Offender\u2014A Problem of Responsibility </em>(1966) 44 Can. Bar Rev. 563, 570-573; Muelberger, <em>Medico-Legal Aspects of Alcohol Intoxication </em>(1956) 35 Mich. State Bar J. 36, 40-41.) Alcohol apparently has less effect on the ability to engage in simple goal-directed behavior, although it may impair the efficiency of that behavior. In other words, a drunk man is capable of forming an intent to do something simple, such as strike another, unless he is so drunk that he has reached the stage of unconsciousness. What he is not as capable as a sober man of doing is exercising judgment about the social consequences of his acts or controlling his impulses toward anti-social acts. He is more likely to act rashly and impulsively and to be susceptible to passion and anger.  It would therefore be anomalous to allow evidence of intoxication to relieve a man of responsibility for the crimes of assault with a deadly weapon or simple assault, which are so frequently committed in just such a manner. As the court said in <em>Parker v. United States </em>(D.C. Cir. 1966) 359 F.2d 1009, 1012-1013, \u2018Whatever ambiguities there may be in distinguishing between specific and general intent to determine whether drunkenness constitutes a defense, an offense of this nature is not one which requires an intent that is susceptible to negation through a showing of voluntary intoxication.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 458.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Later, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rocha, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 893, we rejected a contention that assault with a deadly weapon is a specific intent crime. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 898-899.) We based that conclusion on the legislative history of section 245, cases that have traditionally viewed assault as a general intent crime, and the <em>Hood </em>consideration that voluntary intoxication so naturally lends itself to the commission of assault. \u201cSince alcohol is so often a factor inducing simple assaults ... it would be anom[a]lous to permit exculpation because of intoxication.\u201d <em>(Rocha, </em>at p. 898.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In arson, as with assault, there is generally no complex mental state, but only relatively simple impulsive behavior. A typical arson is almost never the product of pyromania (see Leong, A <em>Psychiatric Study of Persons </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>Charged, with Arson </em>(1992) 37 J. Forensic Sci. 1319, 1324; Ritchie &amp; Huff, <em>Psychiatric Aspects of Arsonists </em>(1999) 44 J. Forensic Sci. 733, 738-739 (Ritchie &amp; Huff); Rasanen et al., <em>The Mental State of Arsonists as Determined by Forensic Psychiatric Examinations </em>(1995) 23 Bull.Am.Acad. Psychiatry L. 547, 548 (R\u00e4s\u00e4nen et al.)). Instead, \u201cit often is an angry impulsive act, requiring no tools other than a match or lighter, and possibly a container of gasoline.\u201d (Ritchie &amp; Huff, <em>supra, </em>44 J. Forensic Sci. at p. 733.) \u201cArson is one of the easiest crimes to commit on the spur of the moment... it takes only seconds to light a match to a pile of clothes or a curtain.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The apparent legislative policy concerns are consistent with studies that have shown the following: that revenge and vindictiveness are principal motives for arson (see, e.g., Ritchie &amp; Huff, <em>supra, </em>44 J. Forensic Sci. at p. 735; Leong &amp; Silva, <em>Revisiting Arson from an Outpatient Forensic Perspective </em>(1999) 44 J. Forensic Sci. 558, 562); that there is a strong relationship between alcohol intoxication and arson (see, e.g., R\u00e4s\u00e4nen et al., <em>supra, </em>23 Bull.Am.Acad. Psychiatry L. at p. 549 [86 percent of arsonists intoxicated on alcohol during arson]; Ritchie &amp; Huff, <em>supra, </em>44 J. Forensic Sci. at p. 737 [55 percent of arsonists intoxicated on alcohol and more than 60 percent of arsonists under influence of some intoxicant during arson]; Koson &amp; Dvoskin, <em>Arson: </em>A <em>Diagnostic Study </em>(1982) 10 Bull.Am.Acad. Psychiatry L. 39, 42-43 (Koson &amp; Dvoskin) [57.7 percent of arsonists intoxicated on alcohol or drugs and alcohol during arson]); and that recidivist arsonists committing chronic or repetitive arson have high levels of alcohol dependence (see, e.g., Koson &amp; Dvoskin, <em>supra, </em>10 Bull.Am.Acad. Psychiatry L. at p. 47). Thus, the motivations for most arsons, the ease of its commission, and the strong connection with alcohol reflect the crime\u2019s impulsiveness. \u201cIt would therefore be anomalous to allow evidence of intoxication to relieve a man of responsibility for the crime[] of [arson], which [is] so frequently committed in just such a manner.\u201d <em>(Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 458.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Relying on <em>Mendoza, </em>defendant argues that even if arson is a general intent crime, the mental state for arson is a \u201crequired specific intent\u201d for purposes of section 22. <em>(People v. Mendoza, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1131.)  In <em>Mendoza, </em>we held that the mental state for aider and abettor liability, which has intent and knowledge components, is a \u201crequired specific intent\u201d for purposes of section 22, subdivision (b). <em>(People v. Mendoza, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1131.) An aider and abettor must \u201c \u2018act with knowledge of the criminal purpose of the perpetrator <em>and </em>with an intent or purpose either of committing, or of encouraging or facilitating commission of, the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1123, original italics.) Although we concluded that the intent requirement for an aider and abettor fit the <em>Hood </em>definition of specific intent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>we also recognized that knowledge did not expressly fall within section 22. (Mendoza, at pp. 1129, 1131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><em>Mendoza </em>does not support defendant\u2019s position. An aider and abettor must <em>intend </em>not only the act of encouraging and facilitating, but also the <em>additional criminal act </em>the perpetrator commits. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1129.) Because the knowledge requirement was intimately entwined with intent, we concluded that it \u201c \u2018is closely akin to <em>Hood\u2019s </em>definition of specific intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1131.) On the other hand, the definition of arson does not refer to defendant\u2019s intent to do some further act or achieve some additional consequence. Moreover, our holding in <em>Mendoza </em>\u201cis very narrow,\u201d limited to admission of evidence of intoxication solely on the question of aider and abettor liability. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the withholding of voluntary intoxication evidence to negate the mental state of arson violates his due process rights by denying him the opportunity to prove he did not possess the required mental state. <em>(Montana v. Egelhoff </em>(1996) 518 U.S. 37, 39-40, 56 [116 S.Ct. 2013, 2015-2016, 2023-2024, 135 L.Ed.2d 361].)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remand the case to the Court of Appeal for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">George, C.

Code, \u00a7 210.) <em>Some </em>mental state, if only consciousness, is required for every crime, even one termed a \u201cstrict liability\u201d offense. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 26, par. Four.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">Rather, the admissibility of evidence of voluntary intoxication to disprove the mental state required for a crime depends, ultimately, on policy\u2014 specifically, as we explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hood </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 444 [82 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 618, 462 P.2d 370], the policy of the Legislature, implicit in section 22 of the Penal Code, to \u201cachieve\u201d a \u201chumane, but workable,\u201d \u201ccompromise between the conflicting feelings of sympathy and reprobation for the intoxicated offender\u201d <em>(People v. Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 456).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">In implementing the legislative policy on voluntary intoxication, we use the notions of general intent and specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u201cGeneral intent\u201d and \u201cspecific intent\u201d have \u201cevolved as labels to identify\u201d particular crimes, with \u201cspecific intent\u201d crimes allowing the admission of evidence of voluntary intoxication to disprove the required mental element and \u201cgeneral intent\u201d crimes not doing so. <em>(People v. Sargent </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1206, 1228 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 835, 970 P.2d 409] (cone. opn. of Mosk, J.); accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Cain </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1, 83 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 481, 892 P.2d 1224] (cone. opn. of Mosk, J.); <em>People v. Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at pp. 455-457; see <em>People v. Whitfield </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 437, 463 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 858, 868 P.2d 272] (cone, and dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Pursuant to the accepted rule of thumb, \u201c \u2018[g]eneral intent\u2019 has usually been affixed if the mental element of\u2019 a crime \u201centails only an intent to engage in certain proscribed conduct.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sargent, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1228 (cone. opn. of Mosk, J.); accord, <em>People v. Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at pp. 456-457.) \u201cIn contrast, \u2018specific intent\u2019 has usually been affixed if the mental element of\u2019 a crime \u201centails an intent to engage in certain proscribed conduct for the purpose of bringing about, or allowing, a certain proscribed result.\u201d <em>(People v. Sargent, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1228 (cone. opn. of Mosk, J.); accord, <em>People v. Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 457.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">But even if \u201cspecific intent\u201d could be affixed to a given crime in accordance with this rule of thumb, \u201cgeneral intent\u201d must be affixed instead if the crime in question is itself closely linked to voluntary intoxication in its commission. (See <em>People v. Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 458.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Let us turn to the crime of arson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">\u201cA person is guilty of arson when he . . . willfully and maliciously sets fire to or bums or causes to be burned . . . any structure, forest land, or property.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7451.) The perpetrator acts \u201cwillfully\u201d when he acts with a \u201cpurpose or willingness to commit the act. . . referred to.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 7, item 1.) The perpetrator acts \u201cmaliciously\u201d when he acts with a \u201cwish to vex, defraud, annoy, or injure another person\u201d or with an \u201cintent to do\u201d any other \u201cwrongful act.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 450, subd. (e).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Thus, the crime of arson requires a mental state with two components. In its first component, arson requires that the perpetrator act with the \u201cpurpose\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>or \u201cwillingness\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 7, item 1) to \u201cset fire to\u201d a \u201cstructure, forest land, or property,\u201d to \u201cburn\u201d any such object, or to \u201ccause\u201d it \u201cto be burned\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 451). Apparently, the perpetrator\u2019s intent need not be <em>resultative, </em>in the sense of aiming to <em>burn down </em>an indicated object.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But it must be <em>inceptive, </em>in the sense of aiming to <em>start </em>a fire. In its second component, arson requires that the perpetrator act for the purpose of \u201cdo[ingj\u201d any other \u201cwrongful act,\u201d including \u201cvex[ing], defraud [ing], annoy [ing], or injuring] another person.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 450, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">It follows that the mental state required for the crime of arson could readily be deemed to be one of specific intent\u2014namely, an intent to engage in certain proscribed conduct, that is, setting fire to an indicated object, burning it, or causing it to be burned, for the purpose of bringing about, or allowing, a certain proscribed result, that is, any other wrong, including vexation, fraud, annoyance, or injury to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">But, even though \u201cspecific intent\u201d could be affixed to the crime of arson, \u201cgeneral intent\u201d should be affixed instead. That is because arson is itself closely, indeed very closely, linked to voluntary intoxication in its commission\u2014voluntary intoxication attending arson more often, and perhaps far more often, than not. (See, e.g., Ritchie &amp; Huff, <em>Psychiatric Aspects of Arsonists </em>(1999) 44 J. Forensic Sci. 733, 737; R\u00e4s\u00e4nen et al., <em>The Mental State of Arsonists as Determined by Forensic Psychiatric Examinations </em>(1995) 23 Bull.Am.Acad. Psychiatry L. 547, 549; Koson &amp; Dvoskin, <em>Arson: A Diagnostic Study </em>(1982) 10 Bull.Am.Acad. Psychiatry L. 39, 42-43.) \u201cIt would therefore be anomalous,\u201d in <em>Hood\u2019s </em>words, \u201cto allow evidence of [voluntary] intoxication to relieve a man of responsibility for\u201d arson, which is \u201cso frequently committed in just such a manner.\u201d <em>(People v. Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 458.)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Although they apparently recognize that \u201cgeneral intent\u201d should be affixed to the crime of arson because arson is itself closely linked to voluntary intoxication in its commission, the majority deny that the mental state required could readily be deemed to be one of specific intent. Their denial is inexplicable. It is also incorrect. They seem to rest on the premise that the perpetrator\u2019s intent must be inceptive, aiming to start a fire, and apparently need not be resultative, aiming to bum down an indicated object. Even if their premise is sound, it gives them no aid. For, even if the perpetrator\u2019s intent must be inceptive rather than resultative, the required mental state could readily be deemed to be one of specific intent\u2014again, an intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>engage in proscribed conduct involving setting fire to an indicated object, burning it, or causing it to be burned, for the purpose of bringing about, or allowing, a proscribed result involving any other wrong, including vexation, fraud, annoyance, or injury to another person. At the end of the day, all that the majority have to justify their denial seems to be an assumption that the perpetrator\u2019s intent must be resultative rather than inceptive. <em>Hood </em>itself is plain: \u201cWhen\u201d a crime \u201crefers to\u201d the perpetrator\u2019s \u201cintent to do <em>some </em>further act or achieve <em>some </em>additional consequence\u201d beyond the \u201cdescription of a particular act,\u201d the \u201ccrime is deemed to be one of specific intent.\u201d <em>(People v. Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at pp. 456, 457, italics added.) The majority\u2019s assumption is that, beyond referring to the perpetrator\u2019s setting fire to an indicated object, burning it, or causing it to be burned, arson must refer to an intent on his part to achieve a <em>particular </em>additional consequence, that is, to bum the object down, as opposed to doing any other wrong, including vexation, fraud, annoyance, or injury to another person. Their assumption is unsupported. Hence, it falls of its own weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In sum, although I cannot join in the majority\u2019s analysis, I do indeed join in their conclusion that evidence of voluntary intoxication is inadmissible to disprove the mental state required for the crime of arson. Because I do so, I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The crime of arson was formerly defined in language requiring that the perpetrator act with the \u201cintent to destroy.\u201d (E.g., Pen. Code, former \u00a7 447, enacted 1872 and repealed Stats. 1929, ch. 25, \u00a7 6, p. 47.) It is not now so defined.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b146-5\">BROWN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ\">I concur in the determination that arson is a general intent crime precluding a defense of voluntary intoxication. I write separately because I remain convinced <em>People v. Mendoza </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1114 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 428, 959 P.2d 735] <em>(Mendoza) </em>was wrongly decided (see <em>id. </em>at pp. 1138-1141 (dis. opn. of Brown, J.)) and, as this case illustrates, will continue to wreak havoc in the lower courts for years to come.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In finding arson to be a specific intent crime, the Court of Appeal initially cited its own decisions in <em>In re Stonewall F. </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1054 [256 Cal.Rptr. 578] and <em>People v. Fabris </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 685 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 667]; but it substantially bolstered this conclusion by drawing heavily on <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pages 1126-1132, as well as <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitfield </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 437 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 858, 868 P.2d 272]\u2014on which the <em>Mendoza </em>court principally relied\u2014and <em>People </em>v. <em>Reyes </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 975 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 39]\u2014which it cited with approval. The common thread of these cases is the transmutation of a knowledge requirement into a specific intent: Thus, the <em>Mendoza </em>court explained that \u201calthough knowledge \u2018may not fall literally within the <em>Hood </em>formulation of specific intent, the element [of aiding and abetting liability] that requires that the defendant act with knowledge of [the perpetrator\u2019s criminal intent] is closely akin to <em>Hood\u2019s </em>definition of specific intent, which requires proof that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>defendant acted with a specific and particularly culpable mental state.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Mendoza, </em>at p. 1131, quoting <em>Whitfield, </em>at p. 450, and citing <em>Reyes, </em>at pp. 982-986.) From this kernel and its analysis of <em>Whitfield </em>and <em>Reyes, </em>the Court of Appeal extracted the essential support for its earlier determination that voluntary intoxication is a defense to arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Unconvincingly, in my view, the majority attempts to distinguish <em>Mendoza. </em>(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 92-93.) Consistent with the reasoning in my dissent, I anticipate this effort will likely cause more confusion than clarification by reinforcing the fundamental analytical error of <em>Mendoza, </em>which was to step outside the terms of Penal Code section 22 without a principled basis for doing so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
