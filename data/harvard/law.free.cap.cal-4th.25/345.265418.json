Code, \u00a7 187),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the multiple-murder special circumstance (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3)), and one count of second degree murder (\u00a7 187). After the first jury was unable to reach a verdict on the issue of penalty for the first degree murders with a special circumstance, the case was retried as to penalty, and a different jury returned a penalty verdict of death. The trial court denied the automatic motion to modify penalty (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e)) and sentenced defendant to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">This appeal from the judgment of death is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).) We will affirm the judgment as to guilt and special circumstances, but, because of serious error in the selection of the jury that returned the penalty verdict, we will reverse the judgment as to penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Within three weeks after being paroled from state prison, where he had been serving a sentence for voluntary manslaughter, defendant killed three more people: Walter Sanders, Monique Hilton, and Martha Kitzler. Defendant killed Sanders and Hilton with a shotgun; he strangled and stabbed Kitzler. The killings all occurred in Los Angeles County. Defendant surrendered in San Luis Obispo County and confessed to these homicides. At trial, defendant did not dispute that he had killed the three victims. The disputed issues largely concerned his mental states and the existence of mitigating circumstances warranting a punishment other than death.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">A. <em>Prosecution\u2019s Guilt Phase Case-in-Chief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">On May 7, 1984, defendant was released on parole from the state prison at Soledad, California, where he had been serving a sentence for a 1978 voluntary manslaughter conviction. After his release, defendant withdrew around $7,000 in cash from his bank account in Los Angeles, apparently Social Security benefits defendant had received after his father\u2019s death. Defendant intended to obtain employment on a ranch in the Palmdale-Newhall area, but he changed his mind when he thought about how strenuous the work would be. While traveling on a bus, defendant met Walter Sanders, a 16-year-old runaway from Lompoc, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Around May 15, 1984, defendant and Sanders arrived by bus in Sylmar, California, where they visited Victoria Ventura, a friend of Sanders. Ventura took them to a used car lot where defendant bought a small station wagon. Sanders spent the night with Ventura, and defendant returned the next day to pick him up.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Around May 19, 1984, defendant and Sanders arrived in the station wagon at Peggy Ashley\u2019s home in Lompoc. Sanders used Ashley\u2019s telephone to call his mother, who lived nearby. Sanders\u2019s mother came to Ashley\u2019s house, bringing Sanders about $40 in cash and some clothing. Sanders told his mother that he would return in June after finishing a job loading trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Around the same time, defendant and Sanders visited Faith Craft at her home in Lancaster, and they invited her out to eat. As they were driving to a local restaurant, Craft saw a gun and handcuffs in defendant\u2019s station wagon.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">On May 22, 1984, the body of Walter Sanders was found near the California Aqueduct on a dirt road in the Antelope Valley. He had been shot five times with a shotgun. The wounds were to the chest, the face, the back of the head, the right side of the back, and up the rectum. It appeared that the shots had been fired in that order, with the shots becoming progressively closer in range. Sanders was apparently standing during the first three shots and lying down during the final two. Multiple shotgun wounds caused his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Defendant spent the weekend of May 26 and 27, 1984, in Hollywood at a house owned by his 17-year-old half sister, Martha Kitzler. Defendant and Kitzler had the same mother, who had died in an automobile accident in 1972, but different fathers. Also living in the house with Kitzler were defendant\u2019s uncle, Carlos Rodriguez, and Rodriguez\u2019s wife and two children. Under the mattress in her bedroom, Kitzler had $2,700 in cash, the proceeds of the sale of her car. Kitzler had told Rodriguez that defendant was jealous of her boyfriend, Flavio Alvarez. On Monday morning, May 28, 1984, Rodriguez asked defendant to leave the house because he did not want defendant to be there with Martha and his wife. Defendant was gone by 11:00 a.m., when Rodriguez left the house. The other occupants of the house, except Kitzler, all left before noon.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">That same morning, Flavio Alvarez telephoned Martha Kitzler. Saying she was about to take a shower, Kitzler asked him to pick her up around noon so they could go to lunch together. When Alvarez came to Kitzler\u2019s house at noon, he noticed defendant\u2019s station wagon parked outside with the motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>running, and defendant answered his knock on the door. Defendant said that Kitzler was in the shower. After Alvarez entered the house, defendant left, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d Defendant then got in his car and drove away. Alvarez knocked on the door of Kitzler\u2019s bedroom. Receiving no answer, he opened the bedroom door and found her body on the bed. When he removed a towel that covered her head and clothing that had been placed over her body, he observed stab wounds and immediately notified the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Martha Kitzler\u2019s bedroom appeared to have been ransacked, but her money was still under the mattress. Asphyxia, possibly by manual strangulation, caused Kitzler\u2019s death. Stab wounds on her torso and neck were inflicted after death. Abrasions in her vagina were inflicted at the time of or within 24 hours before death.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">On the same day, May 28, 1984, the badly decomposed body of Monique Hilton was found on a dirt road in the Antelope Valley. She had been shot four times with a shotgun and had been dead for at least two days. The wounds were to the head, head and neck, right side of the chest, and the back of the body. Multiple shotgun wounds caused her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">During the afternoon of May 28, 1984, defendant placed a series of telephone calls to Anita Rinker, whom he had never met in person, but to whom he had spoken over the telephone once or twice a month since 1980, when he had called her number by mistake. Defendant told Rinker that he had killed three people. He described where he had left the bodies, and he asked her to give this information to the police. Rinker tried to persuade defendant to surrender, but he was reluctant to do so because he feared that he would be put to death for these crimes. Rinker suggested that defendant could plead insanity, but defendant replied that he was not insane.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Around 9:00 that evening, defendant rang the doorbell at the sheriff\u2019s substation at Templeton in San Luis Obispo County. He told Deputy Candy Marie Jones, who opened the door, that he wanted to turn himself in, that he had killed three people, and that the weapons he had used\u2014a gun and a knife\u2014were inside his car. After taking defendant into custody, Deputy Jones confirmed that a knife and a shotgun were in defendant\u2019s station wagon, which was parked in the lot next to the sheriff\u2019s station. She transported defendant to the county jail, from which he was released into the custody of the Los Angeles Police Department. When he was taken into custody, defendant had around $80 remaining from the $7,000 he had withdrawn from the bank three weeks before.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Tests of the shotgun found in defendant\u2019s car revealed that it had fired expended shotgun shells found near the bodies of Walter Sanders and Monique Hilton.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>During tape-recorded interviews by investigating officers on May 29 and 30, 1984, defendant described the circumstances of the three killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Regarding the killing of Walter Sanders, defendant said he met Sanders on the bus near Sylmar. Defendant pretended he was in the military and was on his way to a party in Los Angeles. Sanders asked to go with him, and defendant agreed. After they got off the bus in downtown Los Angeles, defendant admitted that he had recently been released from prison and was running from parole. Sanders said he was running away too, and they agreed to become crime partners. They decided to travel together by bus to New York, where they planned to support themselves by robberies and other crimes. When they reached Arizona, however, they changed their plans and eventually returned to California. Defendant bought the shotgun while Sanders was staying with Victoria Ventura in Sylmar. Sanders wanted to test the gun, so defendant drove out to the desert. Defendant fired one shot, and then Sanders wanted to fire the gun also, but defendant did not trust him. They argued about the gun and about defendant\u2019s lack of trust, and then defendant shot Sanders.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Regarding the killing of Monique Hilton, defendant said that after he killed Sanders, he returned to Los Angeles. He picked up Hilton early one morning as she was hitchhiking on Santa Monica Boulevard. When she got in the car, she told defendant she was hungry and had no money. After buying her some food and some clothing, defendant wanted to leave her, but eventually he agreed to let her accompany him to the Lancaster-Palmdale area, where they rented a motel room. Hilton offered to have sex with defendant, but he declined because she said she was having her period. They left the motel, and defendant drove down a dirt road and stopped the car. He told Hilton he did not believe that she had no money, and he demanded that she show him her money. When she again denied that she had any money, he picked up the shotgun from the backseat and told her to get out of the car. She walked away and then turned around. She told defendant to look in her bag, where he found the key to a motel room in Hollywood. As she was walking back to the car, defendant shot her.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Regarding the killing of Martha Kitzler, defendant said that on the morning of May 28, 1984, Kitzler had sent him to the store to buy shampoo and conditioner for her. When he returned, he found Kitzler alone in the house. After he gave her the shampoo and conditioner, she told him to leave, and that made him angry. He accused her of not trusting him and of treating him like a stranger. He told her she was the only one he had left, besides his brother David, because the other members of his family did not care for him. She said she did not care for him either because he had wasted his life in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>prison. Defendant then went out to his car and brought back his knife, intending to kill Kitzler, but he put the knife down inside the house before Kitzler saw it. He told Kitzler he should kill her because of the way she was treating him. Kitzler \u201cstarted talking shit\u201d and defendant threw her down on the bed and slapped her. Defendant started choking her with his hands and she turned blue. Then defendant got the knife and stabbed her. After she was dead, he tried to move the body to the shower but then changed his mind and covered the body with clothing and a towel. He rinsed the knife, took it outside, and threw it into the back of his car. He remembered that she had money from selling her car, and he started to look for it by going through the drawers in her bedroom, but then the doorbell rang. It was Kitzler\u2019s boyfriend, Flavio Alvarez. Before answering the door, defendant checked his own clothing and saw that his shirt had blood on it, so he removed it. He also turned the shower on, so Alvarez would think that Kitzler was taking her shower. After letting Alvarez into the house, defendant got in his car and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">B. <em>Defense Case at the Guilt Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The defense called no witnesses and offered no exhibits at the guilt phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">C. <em>Guilt Verdicts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The jury convicted defendant of second degree murder as to Walter Sanders and of first degree murder as to Monique Hilton and Martha Kitzler. The jury found that defendant used a firearm (a shotgun) to murder Sanders and Hilton, and that he used a deadly weapon (a knife) to murder Kitzler. The jury found the multiple-murder special-circumstance allegation true, and it also found true allegations that defendant had previously been convicted of voluntary manslaughter and assault by a prisoner, for each of which crimes he had served a separate term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">D. <em>Penalty Phase Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">After the first jury was unable to reach a verdict as to penalty, the penalty phase was retried. At the penalty retrial, the prosecutor again presented evidence concerning the murders of Walter Sanders, Monique Hilton, and Martha Kitzler. This presentation included additional evidence intended to show that defendant had raped Kitzler before he killed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">Investigating officers testified that when Kitzler\u2019s body was discovered, the position and condition of her clothing, with the breasts exposed and the sweat pants down far enough to expose the buttocks and some pubic hair, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>suggested the possibility of rape. There were bloody stains on the victim\u2019s left upper thigh, under the sweat pants, in the shape of fingertips. A clear thick fluid was found around the victim\u2019s navel, but on testing it proved not to be semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The autopsy of Kitzler\u2019s body revealed three fresh superficial abrasions in the bottom part of the vagina, consistent with the forcible insertion of a penis. Swabs of Kitzler\u2019s mouth and vagina tested positive for P-30, a protein from the male prostate gland, indicating the presence of semen, although no sperm was detected. The blood type of the semen donor could not be determined. A swab of Kitzler\u2019s right nipple tested positive for amylase, a constituent of both saliva and sweat. The sweat or saliva was from a person with blood type B who was a secretor (a person whose blood type can be determined from bodily fluids other than blood, such as sweat, semen, and saliva). Defendant, like 15 percent of the population, is a type B secretor, whereas Kitzler had blood type A.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The prosecution also presented evidence of other criminal conduct by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In July 1976, while a prisoner at a maximum security facility of the California Youth Authority, defendant set fire to a mattress in his cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">On January 7, 1978, defendant picked up two hitchhikers, 16-year-old Johnnie G. and 18-year-old Troy Crovella, who were on their way to visit Crovella\u2019s girlfriend in San Diego. Defendant took them to the girlfriend\u2019s house, but she was not home. Eventually they decided to hunt jackrabbits. Defendant bought a .22-caliber rifle and ammunition at a San Diego pawnshop, and he drove to a desert area near the cities of Palmdale and Lancaster. They rented a motel room and drank alcohol. Defendant and Crovella decided to shoot at the tires of passing cars. At dusk, they drove into the desert, and defendant stopped on the side of a road. G. remained in the car because he did not want to be involved. Defendant and Crovella walked away, and a few minutes later G. saw flashes he thought were from gunfire. Defendant returned alone, telling G. that after they hit a car Crovella became scared and ran back to the motel. They returned to the motel without finding Crovella. G. told defendant that he had telephoned his mother earlier and had given her the license plate number and a description of defendant\u2019s car. G. said his mother would report this information if G. did not return within another hour and a half. Defendant seemed upset, but he agreed to drive G. to Los Angeles. They stopped about midway in the journey because G. needed to urinate. As G. was returning to the car, defendant tried to kiss him on the face and to \u201cgrope\u201d him. G. backed away and got into the car. A while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>later, in Culver City, G. asked defendant to stop the car, saying he was sick. G. got out, ran away, and reported the incident to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Sheriff\u2019s officers found Crovella\u2019s body in the area indicated by G. Crovella had been shot in the head, neck, shoulder, arm, leg, and lower back. At least nine bullets, all apparently .22-caliber, had struck him, of which at least five inflicted wounds that would have been independently fatal. When arrested, defendant said he shot Crovella because he became angry after Crovella made sexual advances and fired the rifle at defendant. Defendant remarked that he should have killed G. as well. On October 26, 1978, defendant pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter for killing Crovella.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">On September 16, 1979, defendant and Ernest Kelly were inmates at the same state prison. Kelly and defendant entered Kelly\u2019s cell, where Kelly had agreed to help defendant with some legal papers. Defendant slammed the cell door, which locked automatically. When Kelly tried to move toward the door to call for a guard to open it, defendant blocked his way and began to strike him. Defendant said, \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you.\u201d Although much smaller than defendant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kelly attempted to fight back. Defendant grabbed at Kelly\u2019s belt, apparently trying to remove it. Defendant hit Kelly on the side of the head with a glass jar that he took from a shelf in the cell. Guards arrived to rescue Kelly, who received stitches inside one ear and suffered permanent hearing loss. For this incident, defendant pled guilty to assault by a state prison inmate (\u00a7 4501) on October 23, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The defense presented evidence of defendant\u2019s life history.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Defendant\u2019s mother was bom in Nicaragua as Myma Rodriguez. She came to the United States around 1950. She lived in Los Angeles, where she met David Silva, defendant\u2019s father, who was bom in Mexico. They married in 1956. They had two children: defendant\u2019s older brother (named David like his father) and defendant. Defendant was bom in October 1959 with a cleft palate, making his speech unclear. During the marriage, while defendant\u2019s father was at work, defendant\u2019s mother often went visiting in the neighborhood, leaving defendant and his brother, both under the age of five, alone in the house. Defendant\u2019s parents separated and divorced around 1960 or 1961. At first his mother had custody of defendant and his brother. Later, around 1962 or 1963, defendant lived with his mother\u2019s sister, Clarisa Bemheim, at her Los Angeles home.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Around 1963 or 1964, when defendant was four or five years old, defendant\u2019s father, David Silva, took defendant and his brother to live for a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>months with their grandmother, Josefina Acosta Silva, in Mexico City. Several times, Josefina left defendant and his brother alone in the house, with the door padlocked from the outside. Josefina and other family members always ate in the dining room, but she made defendant and his brother eat in the kitchen, like servants. They were thin and had no toys to play with. Josefina did not read to them and never showed them any affection. Because defendant had an unusual physical appearance, and his speech was difficult to understand, the children in the neighborhood teased him.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Defendant lived with Josefina in Mexico City again from 1966 to 1968. As before, Josefina often went away and left defendant alone, locked inside her apartment, sometimes for several days. Defendant would sit at the window and complain of hunger to friends outside. Josefina kept padlocks on the refrigerator and on all cabinets that contained food. Defendant sometimes had bruises on his body. He never went to school, and he received no instruction at Josefina\u2019s apartment. Defendant did not have a bedroom and slept on the floor. Defendant started running away from Josefina\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In May 1967, defendant\u2019s mother, who was then living in Los Angeles, gave birth to Martha Kitzler, defendant\u2019s half sister. Martha\u2019s father, who never married defendant\u2019s mother, bought a house for Martha and defendant\u2019s mother to live in.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Defendant\u2019s father, who was then living in Alaska, sent money to Josefina every month for defendant\u2019s care. In the spring of 1968, he and his new bride came to visit defendant and Josefina in Mexico City for two weeks. While they were there, defendant ran away once and was gone for not more than two days. When defendant\u2019s father and stepmother asked about the locks on the refrigerator and food cabinets, Josefina said she did not want defendant to eat all the food. As she had done during defendant\u2019s earlier stay with her, Josefina showed no affection for defendant, and she made him take his meals in the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Defendant\u2019s father was killed in Alaska in July 1968. After he learned that his father had died, defendant, who was then nine years old, ran away from Josefina for good. Josefina went to Alaska for the funeral of defendant\u2019s father, but defendant, who was then living on the streets, had no opportunity to attend the funeral.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">In November 1968, a juvenile court in Mexico adjudged defendant a vagrant and committed him to a prevocational school, where defendant remained until March 1969. The director, a Catholic priest, recalled defendant as a quiet and lonely child, with a speech impediment, who did not play with the other children.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>In April 1970, defendant returned from Mexico to live with his mother in Los Angeles. But he frequently ran away and started shoplifting, stole a car, and was placed in a juvenile facility in Sylmar for three months. One staff member at Sylmar recalled defendant as a very cooperative child with a speech impediment that made him a target for older, more sophisticated children.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Defendant\u2019s mother said she could not control him, so he was placed in a foster home. When he ran away from the foster home, he was placed in a facility in Corona named Good Samaritan, but he stole a staff member\u2019s car and drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In March 1971, the juvenile court placed defendant at Showers School for Exceptional Children, a private facility in the desert east of Oceanside for mentally retarded children, most of whom were also emotionally disturbed. Defendant remained there until October 1971, and apparently he was later returned there for an additional month or two. While there, defendant complained of headaches two or three times each week. To the staff, defendant appeared to be frightened and quiet, unable to play or interact with other children, but he did not receive any therapy for his emotional problems. His reading ability was below first grade level, but his intelligence was greater than the tests indicated. He was educationally and socially unsophisticated, but streetwise. He had very low self-esteem. He ran away from the school three or four times, usually by stealing a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Defendant\u2019s mother died in an automobile accident in March 1972 when defendant was about 13 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Around this same time, defendant telephoned a bank and threatened to harm someone if money was not brought to him at the telephone booth from which he had placed the call. Defendant was arrested at the booth. His probation officer interpreted this behavior as an act of \u201cextreme desperation\u201d and recommended placement in the Youth Authority because it provided security and an opportunity for therapy. Instead, the juvenile court placed him in another foster home, this time with the Clinkscales, a couple who owned a small farm in the Antelope Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">While defendant was at this foster home, he attended public schools in Lancaster. He was first placed in an eighth grade class, then moved to a seventh grade class, and finally to a class for the educable mentally retarded (EMR). Peggy Foster testified that she drove the bus that defendant rode to and from school and also supervised him on the school playground. She remembered defendant as a likable child who always followed instructions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>His speech was difficult to understand, and other children teased him. Patricia McMurrin testified she worked as a nurse at the same school. Defendant\u2019s large size, large head, large hands, and prominent jaw suggested to her that defendant might have acromegaly, a glandular disorder involving an excess production of growth hormone. She suggested to the Clinkscales that defendant be medically examined for this condition. McMurrin observed that other children frequently teased defendant at school, called him \u201cbig head and mush mouth.\u201d When this happened, defendant became angry and verbally aggressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Elizabeth Day, one of defendant\u2019s classmates in the EMR class, recalled that defendant wore clothes that were torn and did not fit him. They seemed more like work clothes than school clothes. Defendant\u2019s hair was cut very short, and he always wore a beanie. Other children teased defendant, and this made him angry, but he never hurt them. His teacher in the EMR class, Claudia Perkins, testified that defendant was unable to write his name or to recognize the letters of the alphabet. Defendant was socially isolated, had very low self-esteem, and often complained of headaches. He was the only student she ever taught who refused to draw pictures of his family. Once when they were discussing mothers, defendant said, \u201cI don\u2019t have one of those.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Around this time, defendant\u2019s probation officer assigned his case to a student professional worker, Ema Hope, who arranged for the surgical repair of defendant\u2019s cleft palate. Hope testified that she regarded the surgical repair as essential because, in a child, a disability like cleft palate causes social isolation, low self-esteem, introversion, anger, and resentment. Defendant was then 12 or 13 years old, and cleft palates are usually repaired at a younger age. Hope\u2019s only personal contact with defendant was in March 1973 when she took him for evaluation to the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. Based on this contact, and her review of defendant\u2019s file, Hope did not think defendant\u2019s placement in the foster home was appropriate because defendant needed social and therapeutic intervention and an enriched environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">In March 1973, the medical center\u2019s evaluation team found that defendant\u2019s palate had scars from an earlier surgical repair that had not cured the speech problem. Another surgical repair was successfully performed in September 1973. Defendant was supposed to return for further evaluation after this surgery, but he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">During the following years, placement for defendant became increasingly difficult. The juvenile court did not follow the probation officer\u2019s recommendation for placement in the Youth Authority, and other facilities either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>declined to accept him or were not suitable. On one occasion, the court ordered placement at Los Angeles County General Hospital, from which defendant immediately ran away. On another occasion, the court terminated the wardship and released defendant to the streets because no suitable placement was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Richard Gonzales was a youth counselor at the Youth Training School in Chino in July 1976 when defendant set fire to the mattress in his cell. Gonzales assisted in extinguishing the fire and in obtaining medical treatment for defendant, who had sustained serious burns on his face and hands. Defendant was in great pain, but he did not receive any treatment for more than six hours. Defendant asked whether his family would be notified about the bums, and defendant remarked that now they would have to visit him. Defendant also said that before he set the fire he had been suffering from a headache, but the staff would not give him any aspirin or other medication. During the night, defendant placed a telephone call to his brother to ask his brother to visit him. The brother promised to visit defendant but abruptly ended the conversation, explaining that he wanted to watch a television program. Defendant then began to cry. Defendant continued to cry in the back of the van as Gonzales drove him to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">On December 6, 1976, defendant was paroled from the California Youth Authority and placed in Rogers Social Rehabilitation, a residential care home ran by Maxine Rogers for children from the Youth Authority who were mentally disordered or developmentally disabled. It was regarded as a placement of last resort for children with very difficult problems. Rogers was concerned that the materials she received from the Youth Authority did not include a psychiatric report on defendant. She noticed that defendant was very paranoid about his appearance and very fearful that people would harm him. Rogers thought defendant needed extensive therapy, but his parole officer, a man named Lambert, refused to authorize therapy for defendant. Rogers arranged for defendant to be evaluated by the University of Southern California Medical Center, but Lambert refused to follow the center\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Lambert removed defendant from Rogers\u2019s home on December 29, 1976, because he thought the placement was too expensive and Rogers was asking for too much treatment for defendant. Defendant was again placed in Rogers\u2019s home on March 11, 1977. Rogers observed that defendant was very depressed but seemed happy to be at her home again. Lambert removed defendant from Rogers\u2019s home once more around March 26, 1977, again because of the expense. Lambert then placed defendant in a rest home with elderly people. Defendant phoned Rogers every day from the rest home, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>complaining of the lack of supervision. Defendant would cry during these calls. Rogers thought at that time that defendant needed a lot of therapy and was not receiving any. Rogers asked Lambert to remove defendant from the rest home and place him in a facility with more structure. A short time later, defendant was back in the Youth Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">At the Youth Authority, Harold Safford, a staff psychologist, evaluated defendant twice during 1977. At the first evaluation, Safford concluded that defendant was not mentally ill, but he was impulsive and developmentally disabled, he had low self-esteem and very poor judgment, he lacked insight into the reasons for his behavior, and he had no ability to foresee the consequences of his own behavior. At the second evaluation, S afford concluded that defendant \u201cshowed no ability to make a reasonable judgment and that nothing that had happened in his contact with the criminal justice system had made any difference in his ability to change his behavior.\u201d He recommended that defendant be either permanently institutionalized or paroled to a closed institution that he could leave only when accompanied by a \u201csocially adept person.\u201d Safford had never before or since made a similar recommendation for any other ward he had evaluated. He found defendant unique in lacking any capacity to learn from experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">On November 14, 1977, defendant was paroled from the Youth Authority and for the third time placed in Rogers\u2019s home. As before, Rogers observed that defendant seemed very depressed but happy to be back in her care. She also found that defendant \u201cwas anxious to have therapeutic treatment,\u201d but his parole officer, Lambert, said that defendant had received enough treatment at the Youth Authority. Rogers arranged for another psychiatric evaluation of defendant at the University of Southern California Medical Center. Defendant told Rogers that he thought he should be locked up in the Youth Authority, a remark that Rogers regarded as very significant. Lambert removed defendant from Rogers\u2019s home around the first week of December 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">In January 1978, defendant approached a priest, Father Hugh Crowe, after mass at a Catholic church in Los Angeles and asked to go to confession. Father Crowe brought defendant to the rectory, where defendant confessed he had shot and killed a young man in the desert near Lancaster. Defendant said that he and the victim had gone to the desert to shoot rabbits, but then they had quarreled over the rifle. Father Crowe testified that defendant seemed sincerely remorseful for this deed, but he would not agree to surrender himself to the police. Later, Father Crowe visited defendant in prison, and defendant expressed a desire to join a religious order and become a monk. Later still, in October 1984, Father Crowe visited defendant in jail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>while defendant was awaiting trial for these capital offenses. At first, defendant seemed very discouraged and indifferent as to whether he lived or died. In later visits, defendant\u2019s mood improved. Defendant expressed remorse for the three later killings, and Father Crowe formed the opinion that he would improve himself and become a better human being in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In 1980, while incarcerated in the protective housing unit at Soledad prison, defendant attended Catholic services each week and met Father Lawrence Kambitsch, one of two Catholic chaplains at Soledad. During this time defendant had no visitors except a priest from Los Angeles. At first, defendant would not read Bible passages during the services, and Father Kambitsch learned this was because defendant was unable to read. Eventually, defendant taught himself to read and participated in the services. Defendant told Father Kambitsch that after his release he would like to either help children or join a monastery. Father Kambitsch helped defendant make contacts with some monasteries to obtain information about their entrance requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In late 1981 or early 1982, while imprisoned, defendant telephoned a Benedictine monastery in Antelope Valley. Defendant spoke to Father Francis Benedict about becoming a monk. Father Benedict encouraged defendant, and defendant began to telephone \u201cevery couple of months\u201d for more information. Father Benedict formed the impression that defendant sincerely wanted to do something worthwhile with his life, to serve God. In May 1984, on a Sunday after his release from prison, defendant telephoned Father Benedict to arrange a visit. Father Benedict invited defendant to come straightaway. Defendant arrived after dark, hours later than Father Benedict had expected him, and defendant seemed uncomfortable and less enthusiastic. Because of the lateness of the hour, Father Benedict told defendant that he could stay overnight at the monastery and that in the morning they would talk. Defendant was shown to a room, but he left without spending the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">On May 8, 1984, the day after he was released on parole, defendant reported to the parole office in Los Angeles, where he signed a document reciting the terms of his parole. One of these terms required defendant to attend an outpatient psychiatric clinic for evaluation. Defendant needed a referral slip to take to the clinic, and he was told to report to the parole office again on May 15, when he would receive the referral slip. Defendant did not report on May 15, and on May 18 defendant telephoned the parole office and asked if a warrant had been issued. When told that no warrant had issued, defendant said something about not being able to live on the outside, and he asked that a warrant be issued if he did not report in person that day. Defendant did not report in person that day, and a warrant was eventually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>issued, two or three days before defendant\u2019s arrest, but it \u201cdid not get into the system, so it was cancelled.\u201d Normally a warrant is issued only when a parolee has been missing for 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Shlomo Meled, a physician with a specialty in endocrinology and a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, testified that, after examining defendant at Cedars-Sinai Hospital, including the results of a CAT scan performed in January 1985, and after reviewing defendant\u2019s medical records, he was of the opinion that defendant had an extremely rare condition. A tumor developed in defendant\u2019s pituitary gland, at the base of his brain, probably when he was around one year old, causing oversecretion of growth hormone and producing a condition known as gigantism. Such tumors frequently press against the optic nerve and the hypothalamus, causing loss of peripheral vision, migraine-like headaches, excessive hunger, and severe mood swings. Tests of defendant\u2019s blood in 1974 and 1976 had shown growth hormone levels far above normal. In 1985, however, defendant\u2019s growth hormone level was normal, indicating that the tumor was no longer active and probably no longer existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Franklin David Rudnick, a psychiatrist and the medical director of a neuro-behavioral clinic at the University of California at Los Angeles, testified that defendant was evaluated at the clinic, apparently while awaiting trial in this case. Testing revealed a functional abnormality of the left temporal lobe of defendant\u2019s brain, which is the sort of abnormality that is associated with violent behavior. When interviewed by Rudnick, defendant said that when he was a child his grandmother had hit him with pots and pans; this kind of trauma to the head could have caused the abnormality. Dr. Rudnick also testified that defendant\u2019s medical records indicated the presence of a pituitary tumor that had since become inactive, and that a pituitary tumor, if it presses against a temporal lobe, may also make a person prone to rage and violent behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Michael Healy, an educational psychologist who specialized in emotionally and behaviorally disturbed children, testified that in his extensive experience he had never encountered another individual with as many physical handicaps, deprivations, and rejections as defendant. According to Healy, the unrepaired cleft palate was a devastating thing for defendant because it interrupted normal language development. His parents\u2019 inability to deal effectively with his cleft palate and his gigantism caused defendant to withdraw and become isolated. Rejection by his peers caused defendant to become frightened and distrustful of others. Being kept out of school for years, being emotionally and perhaps physically abused by his grandmother, and being erroneously placed in a class for the mentally retarded all further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>contributed to his low self-esteem and interfered with normal social development.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In addition to the evidence about defendant\u2019s life history, the defense presented forensic evidence relating to the death of Martha Kitzler. Criminalist Lynne Herold of the Los Angeles County Coroner\u2019s Office testified that she assisted in collecting evidence from the body of Martha Kitzler. When she removed Kitzler\u2019s clothing, a bloodstained wad of toilet tissue fell out of the panties.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">David Sugiyama, a criminalist employed by the defense, obtained this tissue and tested it. The tissue was stained with type A blood, consistent with Martha Kitzler\u2019s blood type. No sperm were observed and testing for P-30, a protein from the male prostate gland, was negative, indicating an absence of semen. Sugiyama retested the vaginal swabs taken from Kitzler\u2019s body and, unlike the prosecution\u2019s criminalist, he detected no P-30. He then reviewed the gel that the prosecution\u2019s criminalist had produced from the swabs and did not observe \u201cany clear-cut banding.\u201d Although it was \u201ca real difficult call to make,\u201d he concluded that this gel did not show P-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">On rebuttal, defendant\u2019s grandmother, Josefina Acosta Silva, testified that while defendant was living with her in Mexico City, she treated him like a son, hired a tutor to educate him, gave him toys to play with, never left him alone in the house, did not deny him food, and did not lock her cabinets or refrigerator. Michael Maloney, a clinical psychologist, testified that defendant is \u201cof low intelligence,\u201d but he is \u201cnot technically mentally retarded.\u201d Defendant is not psychotic, but he may have borderline personality disorder. Defendant may have been in a rage when he killed Walter Sanders and Martha Kitzler, but Maloney was less certain about defendant\u2019s mental state during the murder of Monique Hilton. Defendant seemed sincerely remorseful, particularly regarding Kitzler\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Issues Relating to Guilt</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">I. <em>Motion to Replace Public Defender with Private Attorney</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">On November 14, 1984, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Douglas A. McKee held a pretrial status conference, at which Deputy Public Defender Michael O. Clark, defendant\u2019s appointed trial counsel, announced that defendant \u201cwould like to have a <em>Marsden </em>motion.\u201d (See <em>People v. Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44].) After the prosecutor left the courtroom, defendant then submitted a document, apparently written by another inmate at defendant\u2019s direction, stating reasons for defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>dissatisfaction with counsel. The document stated that counsel had advised defendant to waive his statutory speedy trial rights because without a waiver the matter would be transferred to Judge (now Chief Justice) Ronald George, and counsel had also advised defendant that Judge George would probably treat defendant unfairly. After reading the document, the court asked defense counsel to leave the courtroom, and in his absence explained that counsel was correct that without a time waiver the matter would have to be transferred to Judge George for assignment because Judge McKee was then presiding over another trial that had not yet concluded. Judge McKee said that if the case was transferred to Judge George for assignment, there was no way to predict which judge would ultimately preside over the trial and he had no reason to think that the judge who ultimately presided over defendant\u2019s trial would treat him unfairly. Judge McKee said he himself had formed no opinion on the merits of defendant\u2019s case and if he presided over the trial he would try to be fair. Judge McKee asked defendant if he had any other complaints, and defendant alleged that counsel had told a witness at the preliminary hearing that defendant would get the death penalty and that counsel seemed to be preparing only for the penalty phase and not for the guilt phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Judge McKee then had defense counsel return to the courtroom to respond to defendant\u2019s allegations. Counsel said he had told a witness at the preliminary hearing that the prosecution \u201cprobably would seek\u201d the death penalty, and that he had never told anyone that defendant \u201cwas going to get\u201d the death penalty. Counsel said he planned to contest guilt but in view of defendant\u2019s confession, other incriminating evidence, the abolition of the diminished capacity defense, and the time pressure caused by defendant\u2019s insistence on a speedy trial, he was devoting most of his energies to preparing for the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Judge McKee declined to rule on the <em>Marsden </em>motion and transferred the matter to Judge George. After the transfer, Judge George asked defendant to state his complaints against his trial counsel. Defendant said that counsel was misleading him, and he referred Judge George to the letter the inmate had written on his behalf. After reading the letter, Judge George asked defendant if he wished to say anything else. Defendant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Judge George then asked trial counsel whether in his opinion there was a conflict of interest that would justify relieving the public defender\u2019s office. Counsel answered in the negative. Judge George then denied the motion to relieve the public defender\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">We reject defendant\u2019s contention that Judge George abused his discretion in denying the motion to relieve appointed counsel. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>argues that Judge George failed to make an adequate inquiry into defendant\u2019s reasons for requesting substitute counsel. The record shows, however, that Judge George asked defendant three times to state the grounds of his motion, never interrupted defendant\u2019s explanation, and read and considered the letter that defendant submitted. This was sufficient to satisfy the court\u2019s duty of inquiry. (See <em>People v. Hines </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 997, 1023-1024 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 938 P.2d 388].) Applying the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review to the court\u2019s ruling denying the motion to relieve counsel <em>(People v. Earp </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 826, 876 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 857, 978 P.2d 15]), we discern no such abuse here. Defendant\u2019s vague allegations that his attorney was misleading him or pressuring him to waive his speedy trial rights fall well short of establishing that counsel was not providing adequate representation or had become embroiled in such an irreconcilable conflict with defendant that ineffective representation was likely to result. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">II. <em>Adequacy of Notice of Felony-murder Theory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Defendant urges this court to reverse the two convictions for murder in the first degree on the ground that he received insufficient notice of the charged offenses. As to each count, the information charged defendant with \u201cthe crime of murder, in violation of Section 187, Penal Code, a felony committed as follows: That the said Mauricio Rodriguez Silva . . . did willfully, unlawfully, and with malice aforethought murder [victim\u2019s name], a human being.\u201d The information did not refer to felony murder, but the court instructed the jury on both felony murder and murder committed with premeditation and deliberation. Defendant contends the information did not give him notice that the prosecution would proceed on a felony-murder theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u201c[W]e have long held that a pleading charging murder adequately notifies a defendant of the possibility of conviction of first degree murder on a felony-murder theory.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gallego </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 115, 188 [276 Cal.Rptr. 679, 802 P.2d 169].) Defendant mistakenly relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697], and in particular on a statement in the plurality opinion that the \u201ctwo kinds of murder,\u201d felony murder and murder with express or implied malice, \u201care not the \u2018same\u2019 crimes.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 476, fn. 23 (plur. opn. of Mosk, J.).) As we have since explained, however, this means only that the elements of the two kinds of murder differ; there is but a single statutory offense of murder. <em>(People v. Carpenter </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 394-395 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 935 P.2d 708]; <em>People v. Pride </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 195, 249 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 833 P.2d 643].) \u201cFelony murder and premeditated murder are not distinct crimes . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Davis </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 463, 514 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 826, 896 P.2d 119].)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Because of the different varieties of murder, we have acknowledged that in some instances an information charging murder without elaboration may not provide notice sufficient to afford the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. <em>(People v. Gallego, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d 115, 189; <em>People v. Murtishaw </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 733, 751, fn. 11 [175 Cal.Rptr. 738, 631 P.2d 446].) Here, however, defendant could not have been taken unawares. The prosecutor\u2019s references in opening statement to defendant\u2019s intent to rob murder victim Hilton and to defendant\u2019s attempt to find Kitzler\u2019s money after killing her, followed by introduction of evidence showing attempted robbery of the victims, provided sufficient notice of the prosecution\u2019s felony-murder theory. (See <em>People v. Davis, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 463, 513.) In any event, because defendant did not move to reopen when he learned that the court would instruct the jury on felony murder, his claim of insufficient notice is not preserved for appellate review. <em>(People v. Memro </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 786, 869 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 219, 905 P.2d 1305].)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">III. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence of First Degree Murder of Monique Hilton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Defendant contends the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to establish that the murder of Monique Hilton was murder of the first degree. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The prosecution argued alternative theories of premeditated murder and felony murder, relying on the statutory provision that a murder is of the first degree if it is a \u201cwillful, deliberate, and premeditated killing,\u201d or a killing \u201ccommitted in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate . . . robbery . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 189.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">To determine the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, an appellate court reviews the entire record in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether it contains evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, from which a rational trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People v. Marshall </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1, 34 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 84, 931 P.2d 262]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wader </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 610, 640 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 788, 854 P.2d 80].) We apply this standard in determining the sufficiency of the evidence to establish premeditation and deliberation as elements of first degree murder. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1117, 1124-1125 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 577, 831 P.2d 1159].) Evidence concerning motive, planning, and the manner of killing are pertinent to the determination of premeditation and deliberation, but these factors are not exclusive nor are they invariably determinative. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1125-1126.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Defendant concedes that he killed Monique Hilton, and that he did so intentionally, but he maintains that he did not intend to rob her and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the killing was an impulsive, unplanned act. He relies on statements he made during the tape-recorded interview with investigating officers. In that interview, he said he drove Monique Hilton out to the desert because he wanted to find out whether the body of Walter Sanders had been discovered. He then changed his mind and stopped the car intending to confront Monique Hilton. He did not want to take her money but he wanted to find out if she had been lying to him and taking advantage of him when she said she had no money and persuaded him to buy food and clothing for her. He thought she was still lying to him when she continued to deny that she had any money, and in a fit of anger he shot and killed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The jury was not required to accept this version of events. A rational trier of fact could disbelieve those portions of defendant\u2019s statements that were obviously self-serving, particularly in light of defendant\u2019s expressed concern, both during the interview with the officers and in his telephone conversation with Anita Rinker, that he could receive the death penalty. A rational trier of fact could reject as implausible defendant\u2019s explanation that he drove Monique Hilton, a relative stranger and a person whom he admitted he did not trust, down a dirt road in a relatively isolated desert area to look for the body of someone he had recently killed. A rational trier of fact could infer instead that defendant selected this location because it was a place where no potential witnesses or rescuers could see them or hear Monique Hilton\u2019s cries for help and the sounds of a shotgun firing. In other words, a rational trier of fact could infer that defendant took Hilton to the place where she died because he had already formed the intent to rob or to kill her, or to both rob and kill her. Thus, the murder\u2019s isolated location, selected by defendant, is itself evidence of planning. Defendant\u2019s statements that he believed Hilton had lied to him about having no money and had taken advantage of him in persuading him to spend his money on her are evidence of motive. The manner of killing\u2014multiple shotgun wounds inflicted on an unarmed and defenseless victim who posed no threat to defendant\u2014is entirely consistent with a premeditated and deliberate murder. Thus, having reviewed the entire record in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that it contains ample evidence to sustain the verdict of first degree murder on a theory of premeditation and deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">We conclude as well that the record contains ample evidence to sustain the verdict of first degree murder on a theory of a killing during an actual or attempted robbery. A rational trier of fact could reject as implausible defendant\u2019s assertion that although he suspected that Monique Hilton had lied when she said she had no money, and had taken advantage of him by persuading him to buy things for her, and although he demanded that Hilton show him her money, and reinforced the demand by brandishing his shotgun, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>although he had purchased the shotgun for use in committing robberies, he had no intent to take her money by force or intended to take only enough to reimburse himself for what he had spent for her food and clothing (see <em>People v. Sakarias </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 596, 622-623 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 17, 995 P.2d 152]). A rational trier of fact could infer instead that defendant\u2019s intent was to take any money or other thing of value that Hilton might have, and that he killed her while attempting to carry out this intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">IV. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence of First Degree Murder of Martha Kitzler</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Defendant contends his conviction for the first degree murder of Martha Kitzler must be reversed because this count was submitted to the jury on alternative theories of felony murder and premeditated murder, the evidence was legally insufficient to support the felony-murder theory, and there is a reasonable possibility the jury relied on the unsupported felony-murder theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">This count was not submitted to the jury on alternative theories of premeditated murder and felony murder, but only on the theory of premeditation. Although some of the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on first degree murder applied to all three murder counts alike, the trial court gave a special instruction, applicable only to the count charging the murder of Monique Hilton, requiring jury unanimity as to the theory of first degree murder. (But see <em>People </em>v. <em>Pride, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 195, 249 [jury unanimity on first degree murder theory not required].) In argument to the jury, the prosecutor argued only the theory of premeditation and deliberation in urging a verdict of first degree murder in the slaying of Martha Kitzler. The prosecutor argued a theory of felony murder in the commission of robbery only as to the killing of Monique Hilton, and not as to the killing of Martha Kitzler. Viewing the jury instructions and the arguments of counsel together, a reasonable juror would have understood that the felony-murder theory applied only to the killing of Monique Hilton, and not to the killing of Martha Kitzler.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Assuming for argument\u2019s sake only that the killing of Martha Kitzler was submitted to the jury under alternative theories, and assuming also that the evidence was insufficient to support the felony-murder theory, we conclude that defendant was not prejudiced because it is not reasonably probable that the jury relied on a factually unsupported theory. If a count is submitted to a jury on alternative theories, and the evidence is insufficient as to one theory, we assume that the jury rested its verdict on the theory adequately supported by the evidence, particularly when that was the only theory mentioned by counsel during argument. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guiton </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1116, 1127-1130 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 365, 847 P.2d 45].) The evidence here is more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>adequate to support the verdict of first degree murder in the killing of Martha Kitzler on the theory of premeditation and deliberation. In his tape-recorded statement, defendant admitted that he had already formed the intent to kill Kitzler when he went to his car to get his knife. Although he did not immediately proceed to carry out his plan, but instead put the knife down inside the house before Kitzler saw it, this only emphasizes that defendant had ample time to reflect before he strangled Kitzler.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">V. <em>Failure to Instruct on Theft as Lesser Included Offense of Robbery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Although the charges against defendant did not include robbery, the trial court instructed the jury, under the felony-murder doctrine, that defendant could be convicted of the charged offense of murder if the jury found that the murder occurred during the course of a robbery, and the court accordingly instructed the jury on the elements of robbery. Defendant maintains that in this context the trial court on its own initiative should also have instructed on the elements of theft as a lesser included offense of robbery. Asserting that the jury could have found on the evidence presented that defendant formed the intent to steal only after he had killed a victim, defendant argues that a taking under those circumstances was theft and not murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Although a trial court on its own initiative must instruct the jury on lesser included offenses of <em>charged </em>offenses, this duty does not extend to <em>uncharged </em>offenses relevant only as predicate offenses under the felony-murder doctrine. <em>(People v. Miller </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 522, 526-527 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 663]; see <em>People v. Memro, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 786, 888-890 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) Because defendant was not charged with robbery, the trial court did not have to instruct the jury on theft as a lesser included offense of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Defendant may be understood to argue also that the trial court, again on its own initiative, should have given the jury a special instruction highlighting the issue of after-formed intent\u2014that a defendant who forms the intent to steal only after killing or otherwise using force against the victim is not guilty of robbery. We reject this contention because an after-formed intent instruction is a pinpoint instruction that a trial court has no obligation to give when neither party has requested that it be given. <em>(People v. Webster </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 411, 443 [285 Cal.Rptr. 31, 814 P.2d 1273].) Moreover, we have held that the standard instructions on felony murder and robbery, CALJIC Nos. 8.21 and 9.10, \u201cadequately cover the issue of the time of the formation of the intent to steal.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hendricks </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 635, 643 [244 Cal.Rptr. 181, 749 P.2d 836]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 577, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>625-626 [276 Cal.Rptr. 874, 802 P.2d 376].) The trial court gave those standard instructions to the jury in this case. In particular, the felony-murder instruction stated that a killing was murder of the first degree if it occurred \u201cas a result of the commission of or attempt to commit the crime of robbery, and where there was in the mind of the perpetrator the specific intent to commit such crime . . . .\u201d \u201cA reasonable juror would necessarily understand from this instruction that defendant was guilty of robbery-murder only if the intent to steal was formed before the fatal blow was struck.\u201d <em>(People v. Hayes, supra, </em>at p. 629.)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">VI. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct in Referring to Manslaughter Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The charges against defendant included an allegation that he had served a separate prison term for a 1978 voluntary manslaughter conviction. During jury voir dire, the trial court ruled that the prosecution could not use evidence of the facts underlying this earlier offense to prove the current murder charges. Consistent with this ruling, the prosecution introduced evidence of the 1978 conviction and state prison term, but not evidence of, the circumstances of the offense. The court instructed the jury to determine the truth of the prior prison term allegation, but not to consider the prior conviction \u201cas proof that the defendant committed the crimes charged in the information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Defendant contends that the prosecution violated the court\u2019s ruling and committed misconduct throughout the guilt phase of the trial by repeatedly referring to the circumstances underlying the 1978 manslaughter conviction. He contends also that the trial court erred in denying two motions for mistrial based on this misconduct. We consider the specific instances of alleged misconduct in chronological sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">During jury voir dire, the prosecutor asked whether any member of the jury panel had any particular knowledge of the Pearblossom area of Los Angeles County, adding that \u201cthree of the crimes actually that have been committed or alleged to have been committed by the defendant, the one in \u201978 and two of the crimes now were alleged to have been committed in the area of Pearblossom.\u201d The defense moved for mistrial; the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">A trial court should grant a mistrial only when a party\u2019s chances of receiving a fair trial have been irreparably damaged, and we use the deferential abuse of discretion standard to review a trial court ruling denying a mistrial. <em>(People v. Ayala </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 225, 282 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 682, 1 P.3d 3].)  Here, because no jury had been sworn and the trial had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>begun, it is doubtful that a mistrial motion, rather than a motion to quash or dismiss the venire, was procedurally correct. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayfield </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 668, 722, fn. 7 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 928 P.2d 485].) In any event, the trial court could reasonably conclude, in the exercise of its discretion, that the prosecutor\u2019s brief reference to the location of the 1978 killing did not irreparably damage defendant\u2019s chances of receiving a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The claim of prosecutorial misconduct based on this remark is not reviewable. \u201cTo preserve for appeal a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, the defense must make a timely objection at trial and request an admonition; otherwise, the point is reviewable only if an admonition would not have cured the harm caused by the misconduct.\u201d <em>(People v. Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 447 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610].)  Here, the defense, after raising a timely objection, expressly declined the court\u2019s offer to admonish the jury to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s remark. Because an admonition would have cured any harm, the failure to request an admonition renders the claim of misconduct unreviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Were we to conclude that the misconduct claim was reviewable, we would also conclude that it is lacking in merit. Although it is misconduct to elicit or attempt to elicit inadmissible evidence in violation of a court ruling <em>(People v. Price, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 324, 451), the trial court had not yet ruled on the admissibility of the circumstances of the 1978 offense when the prosecutor first alluded to the location of that offense, and thus the remark violated no court ruling.  Conduct by a prosecutor that does not violate a court ruling is misconduct only if it amounts to \u201cthe use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the court or the jury\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Strickland </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 946, 955 [114 Cal.Rptr. 632, 523 P.2d 672]; accord, <em>People v. Espinoza </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 806, 820 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 682, 838 P.2d 204]) or \u201cis so egregious that it infects the trial with such unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 1047, 1084 [255 Cal.Rptr. 352, 767 P.2d 619]).  The prosecutor\u2019s brief reference in voir dire to the location of the 1978 homicide was not egregious, deceptive, or reprehensible because, absent a ruling, the prosecutor could reasonably think that the facts of the 1978 offense might be admissible, a position he later argued to the trial court, though without success.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">During the evidentiary portion of the guilt trial, the prosecutor on one occasion disregarded the trial court\u2019s ruling. In direct examination of an investigating officer, the prosecutor asked how far the scene of the 1978 homicide was from the locations where the bodies of Walter Sanders and Monique Hilton were found. The defense promptly objected, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>sustained the objection, and the witness never answered the question. The trial court denied a defense motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Although the defense objected to the prosecutor\u2019s question to the investigating officer, the defense declined to have the trial court admonish the jury to disregard the question. Because such an admonition would have cured any harm, the failure to request an admonition renders the prosecutorial misconduct claim unreviewable. In any event, although the prosecutor\u2019s question about the location of the 1978 homicide violated the court\u2019s earlier ruling that the circumstances of that offense were inadmissible, and so was improper, this improper question did not result in any prejudice to defendant or render the trial fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">During argument to the jury at the guilt phase, the prosecutor several times referred to the 1978 voluntary manslaughter conviction, arguing that it supported the conclusion that defendant premeditated the three charged murders and that these offenses therefore were murders of the first rather than the second degree. The defense raised no objection, nor did it request any admonition. Nonetheless, defendant now asserts a claim of prosecutorial misconduct based on these remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The absence of both an objection and a request for admonition makes defendant\u2019s claim unreviewable. Nonetheless, because defendant also claims that his trial attorney violated his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel by this failure to object, we consider whether the prosecutor\u2019s argument constituted misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">During his argument to the jury, the prosecutor did not refer to the details or the circumstances of the 1978 voluntary manslaughter offense, and so the argument did not violate any court ruling. The facts to which the prosecutor did refer\u2014defendant\u2019s 1978 voluntary manslaughter conviction, the prison term he served for that offense, and his release from prison shortly before the three charged murders\u2014were all supported by evidence adduced during the trial. The argument was not deceptive, reprehensible, or egregious. The thrust of the argument was that defendant, having once killed another human being and having suffered conviction and imprisonment for that conduct, would know what killing another human being means and what its consequences are, and that this knowledge made it more likely that when defendant again killed he did so with premeditation and deliberately rather than rashly and impulsively.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">In argument to the jury, prosecutors have wide latitude to suggest inferences that may be drawn from the evidence presented at trial, and whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the inferences are reasonable is generally a matter for the jury to decide. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dennis </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 468, 522 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 680, 950 P.2d 1035].) Although the logic of the prosecutor\u2019s argument\u2014that a person\u2019s recent completion of a prison term for voluntary manslaughter would strongly motivate that person to pause and reflect before committing another homicide, thus supporting an inference of premeditation\u2014may seem somewhat tenuous, we are unable to conclude that the argument itself constituted misconduct. In any event, the jury\u2019s verdict of second degree murder for the killing of Walter Sanders, the first of the three killings charged in this case, suggests that the jury did not find the inference urged by the prosecutor particularly compelling. Accordingly, defense counsel\u2019s failure to object does not demonstrate constitutionally deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Issues Relating to Penalty</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Defendant raises several claims of error regarding the penalty phase and the validity of his death sentence, but we need consider only one. During jury selection, the defense alleged that the prosecutor had improperly used peremptory challenges against five Hispanic prospective jurors, and the trial court found a prima facie case of invidious discrimination, but the court erroneously permitted the prosecutor to give his reasons for the peremptory challenges in ex parte hearings, out of the presence of defendant and his attorney. Although the record of voir dire failed to support some of the reasons that the prosecutor gave, the trial court accepted every reason without inquiry and denied the defense motion, with the result that no Hispanic served on the jury that returned the death verdict. We will conclude that the denial of the defense motion was prejudicial error requiring reversal of the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">VII. <em>Discrimination in Peremptory Challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Early in the jury selection process for the penalty retrial, the prosecutor revealed an acute sensitivity to the presence of Hispanics on the jury panel and an evident belief that Hispanics would not be favorable jurors for the prosecution. The first penalty phase had resulted in a hung jury, with the final vote seven for a sentence of death and five for a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. Before the penalty retrial, the defense challenged the jury panels as not providing a fair cross-section of the community, and the prosecutor said this; \u201cI also believe that [defense counsel] has only made a record on Hispanic surnames and has not included any other races, creeds, or colors such as black, oriental because <em>the first trial hung up on racial grounds. </em>[Defense counsel] is well aware that <em>four of the five people in the first trial were Mexican-Americans or at least had those surnames that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>voted, for life without possibility of parole. </em>And I believe that [defense counsel] is trying to influence this court, at this time, so that he gets the same type of a panel he got on the first trial.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Some days later, the prosecutor again said he believed the hung jury in the first penalty trial \u201cwas based on race.\u201d Eventually the prosecutor explained: \u201cWhen I was speaking to the jurors that voted for life without parole, four of those jurors were in fact Hispanic . . . [and] one of the Hispanic jurors turned to the only Hispanic juror who voted for death and said, \u2018You let us down,\u2019 meaning \u2018You are Hispanic. We are Hispanic. We are a group.\u2019 And \u2018You let us down because you didn\u2019t vote for life without parole.\u2019 That\u2019s what I based my comment on.\u201d Despite his stated belief that the hung jury during the first penalty trial was attributable to the racial or ethnic bias of Hispanic jurors, the prosecutor denied that he would exercise any peremptory challenge \u201con the basis of race, creed or color.\u201d But the implausible explanations that the prosecutor later gave for exercising peremptory challenges to exclude <em>every </em>Hispanic from the jury at the retrial of penalty raise grave doubts about the sincerity of this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">A. <em>The first Batson/Wheeler motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">During jury selection, the defense charged that the prosecutor had exercised peremptory challenges against three prospective jurors\u2014Jose M., Jose C., and Armida S.\u2014solely because of their Hispanic ancestry or surnames, in violation of the federal and state Constitutions. (See <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 79, 84-89 [106 S.Ct. 1712, 1716-1719, 90 L.Ed.2d 69]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258, 276-277 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748].) Based on this charge, the defense moved to dismiss the panel and begin jury selection anew. Finding that the defense had stated a prima facie case, the trial court asked the prosecutor to explain the reasons for the challenges. The prosecutor requested an ex parte hearing, out of the presence of defendant and defense counsel, to state the reasons for the peremptories. Over defense objection, the trial court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">1. <em>Jose M.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">During the ex parte hearing, the prosecutor said he challenged M. because, during the death qualification voir dire, M. said \u201che would look for other options\u201d when the prosecutor \u201casked him could he exercise his discretion to impose the death penalty,\u201d and M. \u201cindicated that he thought it was the toughest penalty, and he would look for other options.\u201d The prosecutor said he \u201calso felt that [M.] was an extremely aggressive person and might hang the jury with his thoughts at that point . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Defendant alleges, and we agree, that the transcript of the death-qualification voir dire provides no support for either of these reasons. When defense counsel asked M. for his opinion on the death penalty, M. answered: \u201cWell, I guess I have an opinion on it. I mean, it\u2019s the most\u2014the hardest\u2014 oh, what\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for\u2014punishment you can give.\u201d When defense counsel asked M. to clarify whether he was for or against the death penalty, he replied: \u201cI would say I\u2019m mixed. I would, you know, consider it and I would consider opposition to it.\u201d Defense counsel then explained how a jury is supposed to decide the penalty in a capital case, and M. said he could do that. Defense counsel asked: \u201cSo you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t think you would have a problem returning either verdict?\u201d M. replied: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In answer to further questioning by defense counsel, M. promised that he would engage in deliberations, that \u201cafter doing that process\u201d he would \u201cdefinitely\u201d stand by his decision if he was convinced he was right and the others were wrong, but also that he would reanalyze his own decision if other jurors convinced him he was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In reply to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, M. said he did not consider himself an \u201coverly sympathetic person,\u201d and he assured the prosecutor that he would \u201clisten to all the evidence that\u2019s presented\u201d from \u201cboth sides,\u201d that he would attempt to arrive at a fair and impartial verdict \u201cwhatever it is,\u201d that if the jury was \u201chung up one way or the other\u201d he would \u201cback off\u2019 and \u201clisten to the other jurors and ask [himjself \u2018Was I right or was I wrong?\u2019 \u201d In response to the prosecutor\u2019s question asking whether he was'\u201ca strong enough person\u201d if he felt he was wrong \u201cto admit this out loud and change [his] vote,\u201d M. answered \u201cCertainly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The prosecutor then asked: \u201cDo you lean one way or the other on the death penalty, do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">M. answered: \u201cPossibly slightly for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Finally, the prosecutor asked M. whether he could return a death verdict against defendant \u201cif he\u2019s earned the death penalty.\u201d M. answered \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">2. <em>Jose C.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">During the ex parte hearing, the prosecutor said he challenged C. because, during the death qualification voir dire, C. \u201cindicated that he leaned away, or I thought he leaned away, from the death penalty from all that was said.\u201d The prosecutor added: \u201cAlso, if the court will recall, Mr. [C.] had indicated during [defense counsel\u2019s] questioning that he had had several fist fights out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>in the street. I don\u2019t know if the court recalls that or not, but he was talking about he and his brother being jumped and beaten up.\u201d The court said it did recall C. saying that. The prosecutor continued: \u201cI was very worried about a person that was out there. Maybe it wasn\u2019t his fault. I got the feeling that trouble rather followed Mr. [C.] I felt uneasy with Mr. [C.] being that he had been in so many fist fights, at least three that I think he had recalled, one was gang-related. It seems to me he might have been in an area where it was gang activity, I had an idea because of the fist fights and because he had been beaten up and so on. Also because there was great violence in this case, and fist fights in the cell, I asked Mr. [C.] be excused on that basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Defendant alleges that the record of the death-qualification voir dire provides no support for the prosecutor\u2019s statement that C. \u201cleaned away\u201d from the death penalty. When defense counsel asked whether he had thought about the death penalty, C. answered: \u201cI had given it some thought but I never come to a conclusion. I never had to form a strong opinion about it.\u201d C. agreed that he was \u201cnot really strong pro death penalty, . . . not strong anti-death penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">During questioning by the prosecutor, C. said he had \u201csome friends that have very strong opinions for the death penalty.\u201d C. had discussions with his friends about this at work, but he usually did not take a position on the death penalty. C. explained: \u201cI\u2019m kind of familiar with both sides, but I haven\u2019t taken a stand. Although there\u2019s been times when I have felt that the\u2014there was a place for the death penalty.\u201d Asked by the prosecutor whether he \u201clean[ed] away from it in most cases,\u201d C. answered: \u201cThat\u2019s just the thing, you know, I\u2019ve gone back and forth, because I think there\u2019s no mitigating circumstances, and sometimes I just think that, you know, there\u2019s just no other way to render justice.\u201d The prosecutor asked: \u201cThe death penalty in some cases, in your mind, is appropriate and in other cases, life without parole is appropriate, is that right?\u201d C. answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The prosecutor then explained the process of penalty determination in a capital case, asking C. at various points whether he understood. The prosecutor then asked C. if he was a \u201cstrong enough person\u201d to return a death verdict and affirm it in court in the presence of the defendant. C. replied, \u201cI think so.\u201d The prosecutor then said: \u201cYou\u2019re really hesitating and it kind of worries me and I just want to know what\u2019s going on inside right now, because you\u2019re kind of smiling and because I know you\u2019re fishing in your mind for the right\u2014the right way to answer it truthfully. And I know that you\u2019re trying to be truthful.\u201d C. answered: \u201cI never thought that I\u2019d get called into a case like this to begin with, being my first time . . . and whatnot. So, I said it\u2019s not an easy decision to make and because it\u2019s such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>decision to make, I can\u2019t just blurt out an answer.\u201d Finally, the prosecutor asked whether C. leaned one way or the other on the death penalty. C. answered: \u201cI think if I lean, it\u2019s toward the death penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">During the general voir dire, in response to questions by defense counsel, C. described two incidents (not three, as the prosecutor later stated) in which he was involved in fights. He said the first incident happened \u201ca while back\u201d when he \u201cwas probably around 15 or 16 or 17 years old, and there was three guys in another car, and some words were passed, what have you, and there was a chase ensued after that and [his] car stalled\u201d and he fought because \u201ctwo guys jumped on\u201d him. The second incident happened \u201csomewhere else, at a later date.\u201d He was \u201cwalking down the street\u201d with his cousin when they \u201cbumped into two guys and they started a fight.\u201d His cousin \u201chit one of them and then, out of the bushes came out about ten other guys.\u201d C. said the incidents would not affect his ability to be fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The prosecutor did not question C. about these incidents or how they would affect his performance as a juror. Indeed, the prosecutor declined to question C. at all during general voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">3. <em>Armida S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">During the ex parte hearing, the prosecutor said he challenged S. because she \u201cworked for the Department of Social Services ... at least at one point\u201d and because she had argued with the prosecutor during the death-qualification voir dire. The prosecutor added: \u201cI asked her the same questions I was asking the other jurors about, \u2018Could you do it? Would you do it?\u2019 And Miss [S.] backed up and started arguing with me about that. I think if you look the record up, the court will recall she and I just did not get along. We had, in fact, during [death-qualification voir dire] an argument about whether she was going to do it. She was very argumentative towards me. She was not towards [defense counsel]. That\u2019s why I excused Miss [S.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">The record does not support the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that S. had worked for the Department of Social Services, although she stated on her questionnaire that one of her children did. The matter was not raised during general voir dire, at which the prosecutor declined to question S. at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Defendant alleges that the transcript of the death-qualification voir dire fails to support the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that S. had argued with him. This is what the transcript shows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">The prosecutor: \u201c[Defense counsel] was asking you about whether you would stick by your guns so to speak back there in the jury room. You <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>understand that both [defense counsel] and myself want a decision in this matter. We\u2019re not asking you to change your mind just so that we can have a decision, but that in fact if you go back there and it\u2019s 10 to 2, 11 to 1, and you\u2019re the one, whichever way you\u2019re leaning, will you listen to the other jurors?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">S.: \u201cYes, I would to a certain extent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">The prosecutor: \u201cOnly to a certain extent?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">S.: \u201cWell, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">The prosecutor: \u201cAre you too proud to change your mind even if they\u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">S.: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">The prosecutor: \u201c\u2014Even if they show you you\u2019re wrong?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">S.: \u201cIf they show me I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m going to change my mind, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">The prosecutor: \u201cThat involves listening, that involves listening to the other jurors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-13\">S.: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-14\">The prosecutor: \u201cWill you do that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-15\">S.: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-16\">The prosecutor: \u201cWe want a decision. And I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re going to be hung up one way or the other. I\u2019m just saying that let\u2019s say you go back there. Very often jurors go back into the jury room and not everybody sits down and says we think it should be this way or we think it should be that way. They\u2019re hung up at the beginning. They\u2019re decided, not hung up but decided. What we don\u2019t want you to do is get your ego involved so that you can\u2019t say, \u2018You\u2019re right. Maybe I should change my mind.\u2019 We don\u2019t want that. We want a juror that will go back there and that will listen to both sides .even though she may have made up her mind. She\u2019ll listen to both sides and then she\u2019ll, after having heard both sides, change her mind if she thinks it\u2019s warranted. Are you that type of juror?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-17\">S.: \u201cI believe I am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-18\">The prosecutor: \u201cAre you a fair-minded person?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>S.: \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">The prosecutor: \u201cIncidentally, do you think you\u2019re an overly sympathetic person?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">S.: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">The prosecutor: \u201cThe defense may try and prove to you that the death penalty is not warranted just on your sympathies alone and that\u2019s perfectly legal. You\u2019re allowed to do that. Do you think you\u2019re an overly sympathetic person that wouldn\u2019t give me a chance, and that would only consider sympathy and nothing else?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">S.: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">The prosecutor: \u201cTell me something else. While you\u2019re considering whatever sympathy this defendant may put on before you, can you keep an open mind that you can also feel sympathy for four dead human beings if you find they died at the hands of the defendant in this matter? Will you keep this in mind also?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">S.: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd will you put that on the scale if you think it should be there?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-12\">S.: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-13\">The prosecutor: \u201cMa\u2019am, are you a strong enough person\u2014I intend to prove that death is the appropriate penalty, in this case. And if and only if I do that, are you a strong enough person to come back into this courtroom, sit down in that jury box, and look us all in the eye and pronounce that judgment. Can you do it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-14\">S.: \u201cI think so. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-15\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd will you do it if it is the right thing to do?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-16\">S.: \u201cYes. I would.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">4. <em>The trial court\u2019s findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-18\">During the brief ex parte hearing, in which the prosecutor gave his reasons for exercising peremptory challenges against Prospective Jurors M., C., and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>S., the trial court did not ask the prosecutor any questions and did not remark on any discrepancies between the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons and the prospective jurors\u2019 responses on voir dire or on their questionnaires. When proceedings resumed in the presence of defendant and defense counsel, the trial court denied the first <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>motion. The court said only that the prosecutor \u201cdid provide an explanation with regard to\u201d the three peremptory challenges and that \u201cI think that there was a good excuse with regard to all of these people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">B. <em>The second Batson/Wheeler motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Later during voir dire, after the prosecution had exercised additional peremptory challenges, the defense renewed the <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>motion, charging that the prosecutor had exercised peremptory challenges against two more prospective jurors\u2014Rosalinda R. and Ernestina R.\u2014solely because of their Hispanic ancestry or surnames. Over defense objection, the trial court again held an ex parte hearing at which the prosecutor gave reasons for the challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">1. <em>Rosalinda R.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">During the ex parte hearing, the prosecutor said he challenged Rosalinda R. because she \u201chad worked for L.A.P.D. for ten years,\u201d and the prosecutor did not \u201cknow what effect that would have on her,\u201d and because she \u201cmade a point of indicating to us her brother had been beaten by officers who had belonged to L.A.P.D.,\u201d as a result of which the prosecutor \u201cfelt uneasy with\u201d her.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">On the jury questionnaire, in answer to whether she or any friend or family member had been a crime victim, Rosalinda R. wrote: \u201cMy brother was beaten by police officers.\u201d On general voir dire, she said she had worked as a clerk typist for \u201cL.A.P.D.\u201d (the Los Angeles Police Department) for 10 years, and as a result knew many police officers. She said this would have no effect, however, and she \u201cdefinitely\u201d could judge the testimony of a police officer the same as any other witness. She had not worked in the Hollywood division and did not recognize the names of any of the officers who would testify. She had worked in the records department. Regarding the incident with her brother, she said it had happened two years earlier, when she was no longer working for the police department, and the officers involved were sheriff\u2019s deputies, not police. She had no hard feelings about it, and she \u201cnever got into it\u201d because she and her brother were not \u201cthat close.\u201d She had enjoyed working for the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">2. <em>Ernestina R.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">During the ex parte hearing, to explain his challenge of Ernestina R., the prosecutor said: \u201cMiss [R.] indicated she had a husband that was shot to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>death, which leads me to believe what effect that would have on the robbery [szc].\u201d He said he had \u201cmixed emotions\u201d because \u201c[s]he seemed to be sympathetic to the defense, but at the same time she had a close cousin that had been shot to death in a robbery,\u201d and the prosecutor \u201cdidn\u2019t know how to reconcile with those two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">On her juror questionnaire, in answer to whether she or any friend or family member had been a crime victim, Ernestina R. wrote: \u201cMy nephew was shot when he was trying to help some people that had been robbed.\u201d During general voir dire, she explained that the incident had occurred about two and one-half years earlier in East Los Angeles, where her nephew was living. The nephew was 28 years old, married, with young children. Some men committed a robbery in an apartment building, and her nephew saw them and chased them. They shot him, and he died on the spot. Ernestina R. did not know whether the culprits were apprehended, because she did not often see or visit the nephew\u2019s family. No one else close to her had ever been a victim of a violent crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Thus, the person who had been shot was not, as the prosecutor had said, Ernestina R.\u2019s husband or \u201cclose cousin,\u201d but instead a nephew with whom she said she had not been particularly close. The prosecutor never explained how this experience would make her an unfavorable juror for the prosecutor, nor did the prosecutor explain the conclusory assertion that she \u201cseemed to be sympathetic to the defense.\u201d Respondent has not called our attention to anything in the record of voir dire that supports that assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">3. <em>The trial court\u2019s findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The transcript of the second ex parte hearing comprises a single page. As in the first ex parte hearing, the trial court did not question the prosecutor or remark on the apparent disparity between the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons and what the record shows to have occurred during voir dire. When proceedings resumed in the presence of defendant and defense counsel, the court said only this: \u201cI did hear the explanations presented by the prosecutor with regard to peremptory challenges exercised against Rosalinda [R.] and Ernestina [R.], and they appear to be very valid reasons for those excuses.\u201d As a result of the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges and the trial court\u2019s rulings, no Hispanic served on the jury that returned the verdict selecting the penalty of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">C. <em>The new trial motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">After the jury had returned the death verdict, the trial court unsealed the transcripts of the ex parte hearings in which the prosecutor had stated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>reasons for the peremptory challenges of the five Hispanic prospective jurors. Defendant then moved for a new trial on the ground, among others, that the prosecutor had failed to give valid and sufficient reasons for exercising these peremptory challenges. Defense counsel argued to the court that almost all of the prosecutor\u2019s reasons were either unsupported by the record or inherently implausible. When denying the new trial motion, the trial court\u2019s only explanation was this: \u201cWell, the Court held an in camera hearing with regard to the exclusion of several jurors, and the Court felt that there was sufficient reason for the exclusion of those witnesses\u2014I mean for those jurors. So your motion is denied for a new penalty phase trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">D. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The United States Supreme Court has given this explanation of the process required when a party claims that an opponent has. improperly discriminated in the exercise of peremptory challenges: \u201c[Ojnce the opponent of a peremptory challenge has made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination (step one), the burden of production shifts to the proponent of the strike to come forward with a race-neutral explanation (step two). If a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide (step three) whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination.\u201d <em>(Purkett v. Elem </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 765, 767 [115 S.Ct. 1769, 1770-1771, 131 L.Ed.2d 834].)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Here, in step one, the trial court ruled for the defense when it found a prima facie case of improper discrimination, and we assume that substantial evidence supports that determination. (See <em>People v. Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 197 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365].) In step two, the prosecutor defended the five challenged strikes by giving reasons that were facially neutral as to Hispanic ancestry or surname. (See <em>Purkett v. Elem, supra, </em>514 U.S. 765, 768 [115 S.Ct. 1769, 1771] [\u201c \u2018Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.\u2019 \u201d].) Our concern here is with step three: whether the record as a whole shows purposeful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Before addressing that question, however, we note that the trial court erred in excluding the defense from the hearing at which the prosecutor stated his reasons. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ayala </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 243, 262 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 532, 6 P.3d 193]; <em>U.S. v. Thompson </em>(9th Cir. 1987) 827 F.2d 1254, 1257.) The trial court partially alleviated the effect of this error, however, by giving the defense an opportunity to comment on the prosecutor\u2019s reasons when it unsealed the transcripts of the ex parte hearings after the jury had returned the penalty verdict. The defense availed itself of this opportunity by arguing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>as a ground for new trial as to penalty, that the prosecution\u2019s stated reasons were unsupported by the record and pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">During the ex parte hearings, when the prosecutor gave reasons that misrepresented the record of voir dire, the trial court erred in failing to point out inconsistencies and to ask probing questions. \u201cThe trial court has a duty to determine the credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s proffered explanations\u201d <em>(McClain v. Prunty </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 217 F.3d 1209, 1220), and it should be suspicious when presented with reasons that are unsupported or otherwise implausible (see <em>Purkett v. Elem, supra, </em>514 U.S. 765, 768 [115 S.Ct. 1769, 1771] [stating that at step three \u201cimplausible or fantastic justifications may (and probably will) be found to be pretexts for purposeful discrimination\u201d]; <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Prunty, supra, </em>at p. 1221 [\u201cWhere the facts in the record are objectively contrary to the prosecutor\u2019s statements, serious questions about the legitimacy of a prosecutor\u2019s reasons for exercising peremptory challenges are raised.\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In particular, we agree with defendant that the court erred in denying the motion as to Prospective Juror Jose M. Nothing in the transcript of voir dire supports the prosecutor\u2019s assertions that M. would be reluctant to return a death verdict or that he was \u201can extremely aggressive person.\u201d Although an isolated mistake or misstatement that the trial court recognizes as such is generally insufficient to demonstrate discriminatory intent <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 189 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 123, 940 P.2d 710]), it is another matter altogether when, as here, the record of voir dire provides no support for the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge and the trial court has failed to probe the issue <em>(McClain </em>v. <em>Prunty, supra, </em>217 F.3d 1209, 1220-1224; <em>Johnson v. Vasquez </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 3 F.3d 1327, 1331). We find nothing in the trial court\u2019s remarks indicating it was aware of, or attached any significance to, the obvious gap between the prosecutor\u2019s claimed reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge against M. and the facts as disclosed by the transcripts of M.\u2019s voir dire responses. On this record, we are unable to conclude that the trial court met its obligations to make \u201ca sincere and reasoned attempt to evaluate the prosecutor\u2019s explanation\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 161, 167-168 [197 Cal.Rptr. 71, 672 P.2d 854]) and to clearly express its findings <em>(People v. Fuentes </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 707, 716, fn. 5 [286 Cal.Rptr. 792, 818 P.2d 75]).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination\u2014that defendant failed to meet his burden of proving intentional discrimination with respect to the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenge of Prospective Juror M.\u2014is unreasonable in light of the evidence of the voir dire proceedings. Although we generally \u201caccord great deference to the trial court\u2019s ruling that a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>reason is genuine,\u201d we do so only when the trial court has made a sincere and reasoned attempt to evaluate each stated reason as applied to each challenged juror. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fuentes, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 707, 720; see also <em>People v. Jackson </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 1164, 1197-1198 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 49, 920 P.2d 1254].) When the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons are both inherently plausible and supported by the record, the trial court need not question the prosecutor or make detailed findings. But when the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons are either unsupported by the record, inherently implausible, or both, more is required of the trial court than a global finding that the reasons appear sufficient. As to Prospective Juror M., both of the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons were factually unsupported by the record. Because the trial court\u2019s ultimate finding is unsupported\u2014at least as to Prospective Juror M.\u2014we conclude that defendant was denied the right to a fair penalty trial in violation of the equal protection clause of the federal Constitution <em>(Batson v. Kentucky, supra, </em>476 U.S. 79, 84-89 [106 S.Ct. 1712, 1716-1719]) and was denied his right under the state Constitution to a trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community <em>(People v. Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 258, 276-277).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Our conclusion makes it unnecessary to determine whether the trial court erred in denying the <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>motion as to the other four Hispanic prospective jurors whom the prosecutor removed by peremptory challenge. The exclusion by peremptory challenge of a single juror on the basis of race or ethnicity is an error of constitutional magnitude requiring reversal. <em>(People v. Montiel </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 877, 909 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 705, 855 P.2d 1277]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fuentes, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 707, 716, fn. 4; see <em>People v.
