One such statutory procedure appears in Penal Code section 4852.01 et seq., concerning \u201ccertificates of rehabilitation\u201d in the superior court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A convicted felon can request a certificate of rehabilitation, and the superior court may issue such an order, upon a compelling showing of postsentence reform. If granted, the certificate of rehabilitation serves as an automatic application and judicial recommendation for a gubernatorial pardon in the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">Samuel Earl Ansell, Jr., (Ansell) is a convicted child molester who sought a certificate of rehabilitation long after he finished serving his sentence. The superior court denied the petition under a statutory amendment, adopted after Ansell committed his crimes, which makes a certificate of rehabilitation unavailable to persons who, like Ansell, have been convicted of particular sex offenses. The Court of Appeal affirmed. Ansell sought review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">Ansell claims here, as below, that the amendment retroactively increases the punishment for his crimes and therefore violates the prohibition against ex post facto laws under the federal and state Constitutions. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>because a certificate of rehabilitation has no direct or indirect ameliorative effect on the \u201cpunishment\u201d for a crime, as that word is defined for ex post facto purposes, a postcrime amendment which restricts the availability of the certificate, and thus relegates offenders like Ansell to other means of seeking a postsentence pardon, does not increase such punishment in violation of the ex post facto clause. We will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">I. Statutory Background</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">The Penal Code prescribes punishment, of course, for the crimes defined therein. For convicted felons, including sex offenders, such punishment typically involves a prison sentence, although other dispositions such as probation are authorized in some cases. (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 1168, 1170, 1203.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Less known, perhaps, are the collateral consequences associated with a felony conviction after sentence has been served. Most of these disabilities have existed in some form for decades, and many appear in statutes located outside the Penal Code. Some of the more common rules include disqualification from jury service,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> impeachment as a witness,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> inaccessibility to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>firearms,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and registration as a sex offender.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, a felony conviction may disqualify the person from practicing many licensed trades and professions and from holding certain positions of public employment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under prior law, persons convicted of \u201cinfamous crimes\u201d were disenfranchised even after sentence was complete.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, a convicted felon who is not imprisoned or on parole can now vote.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">As explained further below, convicted felons who claim to be reformed have traditionally sought relief from the various consequences of their convictions through the Governor\u2019s power and discretion to grant pardons under the state Constitution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Biggs </em>(1937) 9 Cal.2d 508, 511 [71 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>P.2d 214, 116 A.L.R. 205].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Different pardon application procedures exist in two neighboring statutory schemes. Since both schemes affect our analysis and appear in few published decisions, we summarize them as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The oldest procedure\u2014the one not invoked by Ansell\u2014is located in section 4800 et seq. As pertinent here, this scheme authorizes the submission of pardon applications directly to the Governor. Such direct applications are investigated and processed as set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Ansell relies on the certificate of rehabilitation procedure in section 4852.01 et seq., which, by its own terms, offers an \u201cadditional, but not an exclusive\u201d means of requesting a pardon. (\u00a7 4852.19.) During World War II the Governor\u2019s office was inundated with pardon applications received from ex-felons who were otherwise barred from serving in the military and working in defense industries. (See <em>Requirement for Rehabilitation Certificate, supra, </em>65 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 232, 233-234; Mosk, <em>Certificates of Rehabilitation and the New Pardon Procedure </em>(1943) 18 State Bar J. 172, 173-175.) Enacted as an urgency measure in 1943, the certificate of rehabilitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>scheme eased the administrative burden on the executive branch by allowing the superior court to investigate and recommend pardon applicants. (Stats. 1943, ch. 400, \u00a7 1, p. 1922, eff. May 13, 1943.)</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">With certain exceptions discussed as relevant below, the certificate of rehabilitation procedure is available to convicted felons who have successfully completed their sentences, and who have undergone an additional and sustained \u201cperiod of rehabilitation\u201d in California. (\u00a7 4852.03, subd. (a) [imposing general minimum requirement of five years\u2019 residence in this state, plus an additional period typically ranging between two and five years depending upon the conviction]; see \u00a7\u00a7 4852.01, subds. (a)-(c), 4852.06.) During the period of rehabilitation, the person must display good moral character, and must behave in an honest, industrious, and law-abiding manner. (\u00a7 4852.05; see \u00a7 4852.06.) Several provisions make clear that a person is \u201cineligible to . . . petition for a certificate of rehabilitation\u201d (\u00a7 4852.03, subd. (b)), and that no such petition \u201cshall be filed\u201d (\u00a7 4852.06), unless and until the foregoing requirements are met. (See \u00a7 4852.01, subds. (a)-(c) [describing who \u201cmay file\u201d a petition].)</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Proceedings begin when a qualified person petitions for a certificate of rehabilitation in the superior court of the county in which he lives. (\u00a7 4852.06; see \u00a7 4852.07 [requiring notice to the Governor and to the district attorney in the county or counties where the petition is filed and the petitioner was convicted].) Other provisions allow the petitioner to pursue a certificate of rehabilitation without personal expense and with professional assistance. (\u00a7\u00a7 4852.04 [establishing a right to counsel and to assistance from rehabilitative agencies, including probation and parole officers], 4852.08 [authorizing representation by the public defender or other appointed counsel], 4852.09 [prohibiting court fees of any kind], 4852.1 [authorizing the production of official records at no charge], 4852.18 [making the petition and other necessary forms available at no charge].)</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">The superior court holds a hearing and considers testimonial and documentary evidence bearing on the petition. (\u00a7\u00a7 4852.1, 4852.11.) To this end, the court may compel the production of judicial, correctional, and law enforcement records concerning the crimes of which petitioner was convicted, his performance in custody and on supervised release, and his conduct during the period of rehabilitation, including all violations of the law known to any peace officer. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The district attorney may be directed to investigate and report on relevant matters. (\u00a7 4852.12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">To enter an order known as a certificate of rehabilitation, the superior court must find that the petitioner is both rehabilitated and fit to exercise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>rights and privileges lost by reason of his conviction. (\u00a7 4852.13, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The issuing court transmits certified copies of the certificate of rehabilitation to the Governor, the Board of Prison Terms, the Department of Justice, and\u2014in the case of persons twice convicted of a felony\u2014the Supreme Court. (\u00a7 4852.14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">A certificate of rehabilitation issued and transmitted in the foregoing manner serves two functions under the language of the statutory scheme. First, it has the effect of \u201crecommending that the Governor grant a full pardon to the petitioner.\u201d (\u00a7 4852.13(a).) Second, the certificate of rehabilitation constitutes \u201can application for a full pardon upon receipt of which the Governor may, without any further investigation, issue a pardon to the person named therein, except that, pursuant to Section 8 of Article V of the Constitution, the Governor shall not grant a pardon to any person twice convicted of felony, except upon the written recommendation of a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court.\u201d (\u00a7 4852.16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Whether a certificate of rehabilitation and automatic application for a pardon issues under section 4852.01 et seq., or whether a pardon is sought by direct application under section 4800 et seq., certain civil rights and privileges are restored if the Governor acts favorably on the request.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> General statements of this ameliorative principle appear in section 4852.17, concerning \u201ca full and unconditional pardon by the Governor, based upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>certificate of rehabilitation,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and in section 4853, concerning all other cases \u201cin which a full pardon has been granted by the Governor.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">More specific statutes in various codes and schemes confirm that a pardon removes or alleviates particular disabilities, including those cited earlier in the opinion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> With respect to some disabilities, relief may be available based on the convicted felon\u2019s receipt of a certificate of rehabilitation, even where no pardon has been obtained.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Recently, the Legislature limited the circumstances under which a certificate of rehabilitation can be sought and obtained by convicted sex offenders,</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>II. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Ansell, acting through counsel, filed a petition for a certificate of rehabilitation (petition) in Sacramento County Superior Court (trial court) on January 22, 1998. The District Attorney of Sacramento County (district attorney) conducted a preliminary investigation and reported its findings to the trial court (report). The sparse record in the present case consists largely of these two documents and attachments, and reveals the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Ansell sustained three felony convictions in Orange County on December 29, 1980. Violations of three different statutes were involved\u2014section 288, subdivision (a) (lewd conduct with a victim under age 14), section 288a, subdivision (b)(2) (oral copulation with a victim under age 16), and section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>288a, subdivision (c) (oral copulation with a victim under age 14 or by use of force, fear, or retaliatory threat). Ansell was committed to Patton State Hospital, having apparently qualified as a \u201cmentally disordered sex offender\u201d under former law. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, former \u00a7 6300 et seq., repealed by Stats. 1981, ch. 928, \u00a7 2, p. 3485.) When Ansell was released on September 2, 1983, his sentence was modified to five years\u2019 probation, and included a requirement that he register as a convicted sex offender under section 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The petition alleged, and the report did not dispute, that Ansell had lived continuously in California since April 1984, had successfully completed probation in September 1988, and had behaved in an upright fashion throughout the period of rehabilitation. Attached to the petition and incorporated therein was an order of the Orange County Superior Court, filed September 12, 1997, granting Ansell relief from the 1980 convictions under section 1203.4, subdivision (a) (section 1203.4(a)). Specifically, the section 1203.4(a) order vacated the guilt judgment, dismissed the underlying complaint, and purported to release Ansell from \u201cpenalties and disabilities\u201d resulting from his convictions. However, the same order made clear that it did not permit access to firearms (see \u00a7\u00a7 1203.4(a), 12021), remove the obligation to register as a sex offender (see \u00a7\u00a7 290.1, 290.5), or preclude disclosure of the conviction on applications for public office or license (see \u00a7 1203.4(a)).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>A hearing on the petition was held April 22, 1998. The district attorney argued that the amendment to section 4852.01(d)\u2014which took effect shortly before the petition was filed\u2014prevented Ansell from receiving a certificate of rehabilitation based on his convictions under section 288, subdivision (a), and section 288a, subdivision (c). Citing new section 4852.01(e) and alluding to section 4800 et seq., the district attorney observed that any relief from these convictions was available only through a pardon obtained directly from the Governor. Counsel for Ansell replied that denying the petition based on legislation enacted long after the crimes violated ex post facto principles. Ruling from the bench, the trial court summarily rejected the ex post facto claim and denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Ansell appealed, and the judgment was affirmed. In a brief opinion, the Court of Appeal concluded that because Ansell was not foreclosed from seeking a pardon altogether, section 4852.01(d) did not retroactively inflict new punishment for his crimes or otherwise implicate ex post facto concerns. The court declined to follow <em>Sovereign v. People </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 143 [192 Cal.Rptr. 469] (Sovereign) insofar as it invalidated, on ex post facto grounds, another unfavorable postcrime change in the certificate of rehabilitation procedure. We granted Ansell\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">A. <em>The Amended Statute Applies by Its Terms Here.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">The parties seem to assume that amended section 4852.01(d) applies to persons seeking a certificate of rehabilitation after January 1, 1998, the amendment\u2019s effective date, if they were convicted of a specified sex crime <em>at any time. </em>Under such a construction, the certificate is unavailable to the petitioner even though he committed his crimes and allegedly reformed before the amended statute took effect. We agree the Legislature intended this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">In preventing some convicted sex offenders from invoking the certificate of rehabilitation scheme, section 4852.01(d) does not state that the underlying crime must occur, or that a conviction must be entered, <em>after </em>January 1, 1998. Nor does the amendment purport to exempt from its operation individuals who were eligible to pursue a certificate of rehabilitation <em>before </em>that time, but who failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>Rather, the amendment declares that the certificate of rehabilitation procedure in section 4852.01 et seq. \u201cshall not apply\u201d to \u201cpersons convicted of\u2019 violating particular sex crime statutes. (\u00a7 4852.01(d).) This language is unqualified, and its meaning is plain. No one who has ever been convicted of a specified offense can use the statutory scheme to request or receive a certificate of rehabilitation with the amended statute in effect. To hold that the amendment does not apply based on the age of the underlying crimes or for some other reason, we would have to engraft onto section 4852.01(d) exceptions and limitations that find no support in its literal terms. We decline to rewrite the statute or to artificially restrict its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">The legislative history supports our determination that the amended statute applies under the circumstances of the present case. These materials disclose several reasons for the amendment, and suggest an intent to immediately affect the broadest possible range of cases.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">First, based on the \u201chigh recidivism rate,\u201d persons convicted of the sex crimes listed in section 4852.01(d) were deemed to be a threat to the public long after their crimes are committed and any sentence is served. (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 729 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Feb. 26, 1997, pp. 1, 3.) The Legislature doubted that rehabilitation could be \u201cverififed]\u201d in such cases; it assumed a risk of reoffense exists even where a judicial finding of reform is made, and feared the public might be lulled into a false sense of security under such circumstances. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 3.) The Legislature determined that the public is best protected by denying potential recidivists access to certificates of rehabilitation altogether. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Next, the Legislature found that even before section 4852.01(d) was amended, convicted sex offenders received \u201cno practical benefit\u201d under the statutory scheme. (Sen. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 729 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 5, 1997, p. 3.) Information from the Governor\u2019s Office revealed that pardons based on certificates of rehabilitation are rare for persons convicted of the sex crimes listed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>section 4852.01(d). (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 729 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Feb. 26, 1997, p. 4.) The Legislature also predicted that fewer convicted sex offenders would seek or obtain certificates of rehabilitation in light of two then recent changes in other statutes. (Sen. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 729 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 5, 1997, p. 3.) Such changes were identified <em>(ibid.), </em>as follows: (1) the amendment of section 290.5, which ended the ability of many sex offenders\u2014including those covered by section 4852.01(d)\u2014to use a certificate of rehabilitation to remove the duty to register under section 290 (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 16), and (2) the enactment of section 4852.13(b), which prevents certificates of rehabilitation from being granted to sex offenders who remain a threat to minors (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Finally, the Legislature sought to avoid the \u201cwaste of public resources\u201d that would occur if certificates of rehabilitation were routinely requested and denied in sex offense cases. (Sen. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 729 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 5, 1997, pp. 3, 5.) Lawmakers were keenly aware of provisions in section 4852.01 et seq. allowing petitioners to seek certificates of rehabilitation at public expense, obligating public agencies to investigate and litigate those petitions, and compelling the superior court to hold hearings in such cases. (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 729 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Feb. 26, 1997, pp. 3-4.) Section 4852.01(d) sought to reduce the \u201cburdensome\u201d effect of these provisions by barring requests for certificates of rehabilitation that have little or no chance of success. (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 729 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) at p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">In light of the foregoing concerns, the Legislature must have intended to bar persons convicted of the targeted sex crimes from receiving certificates of rehabilitation under section 4852.01(d) as soon as it took effect. A contrary construction would prolong the risk to the public of granting such certificates to convicted sex offenders who had not genuinely reformed, and would postpone the cost-saving benefits which the measure was expected to produce. For instance, if section 4852.01(d) were found to apply only to qualifying sex crimes committed after its January 1, 1998, effective date, the statute would have no effect until the perpetrator of a post-1997 crime had been convicted, served his sentence, completed a lengthy period of rehabilitation, and sought relief under the statutory scheme. Such a construction would effectively delay implementation of the statute for many years after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>its enactment.  We cannot conceive the Legislature intended to postpone and frustrate section 4852.01 (d)\u2019s aims in this manner.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Consistent with the parties\u2019 apparent understanding of the amended statute, we conclude section 4852.01(d) applies to Ansell based on his 1980 convictions under section 288, subdivision (a), and section 288a, subdivision (c). His request for a certificate of rehabilitation was properly denied unless the amendment is unconstitutional\u2014an issue we now address.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">B. <em>The Amended Statute Does Not Trigger or Deny Ex Post Facto Protection.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Ansell emphasizes that section 4852.01(d) eliminates the certificate of rehabilitation procedure based on crimes committed before the statute was amended. He insists this unfavorable change in the statutory effect of past criminal conduct violates the ex post facto clauses of both the federal and state Constitutions. (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9; see <em>People v. Frazer </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 737, 754, fn. 15 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 312, 982 P.2d 180], and cases cited [placing no different meaning on the federal and state ex post facto clauses, and following United States Supreme Court cases on the subject].)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Beginning with <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Youngblood </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 37, 41-44 [110 S.Ct. 2715, 2718, 2720, 111 L.Ed.2d 30] <em>(Collins), </em>the United States Supreme Court has reaffirmed that the ex post facto clause is interpreted in a manner consistent with its understanding when the Constitution was framed. (Accord, <em>Carmell v. Texas </em>(2000) 529 U.S. 513, 521-525 [120 S.Ct. 1620, 1626-1629, 146 L.Ed.2d 577] <em>(Carmell).) </em>This approach employs the test announced in <em>Calder </em>v. <em>Bull </em>(1798) 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390 (opn. of Chase, J.) <em>(Calder), </em>and defines ex post facto violations in terms of four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>finite groups.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> While more expansive and amorphous formulations had developed after <em>Colder </em>was decided, they have since been disavowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">In particular, the high court has made clear that an ex post facto violation does not occur simply because a criminal defendant loses \u201c \u2018substantial protections\u2019 \u201d <em>(Collins, supra, </em>497 U.S. 37, 45, 46 [110 S.Ct. 2715, 2721]), or suffers some \u201c \u2018disadvantage\u2019 \u201d after the crime occurs. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 [110 S.Ct. at pp. 2721-2723]; accord, <em>Carmell, supra, </em>529 U.S. 513, 539 [120 S.Ct. 1620, 1636]; <em>Garner v.

As relevant here, and consistent with Colder\u2019s third category (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 22), a substantial and disadvantageous change is prohibited only if it \u201cinflicts a greater <em>punishment, </em>than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.\u201d <em>(Calder, supra, </em>3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390 [1 L.Ed. 648, 650] (opn. of Chase, J.), italics added.) Unless the consequences are penal in nature, defendants cannot rely on statutes in existence at the time of the crime, or otherwise complain of oppressive retroactive treatment. <em>(Carmell, supra, 529 U.S. </em>513, 532-533 [120 S.Ct. 1620, 1633]; <em>Lynce v. Mathis </em>(1997) 519 U.S. 433, 441 [117 S.Ct. 891, 895-896, 137 L.Ed.2d 63].)</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Ansell insists that the amendment to section 4852.01(d) \u201crepunishes\u201d all convicted sex offenders to whom it applies. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">The Legislature\u2019s own assessment of the challenged law affects its constitutional character. In finding no punishment for ex post facto purposes, both the United States Supreme Court and this court \u201cordinarily defer\u201d to legislative assurances that the statute serves nonpunitive governmental aims. <em>(Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 346, 361 [117 S.Ct. 2072, 2081-2082, 138 L.Ed.2d 501] (Hendricks); accord, <em>Seling v.

The challenged provision is part of a statutory scheme that formally recognizes and, to some extent rewards, the rehabilitative efforts of convicted criminals after their sentence is complete. In weighing the costs and benefits of retaining this procedure for certain serious sex offenders, the Legislature expressed no interest in imposing new criminal sanctions or exacting fresh revenge. Nor did it suggest that punishment under existing laws was inadequate. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Hanson </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 355, 362 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 58, 1 P.3d 650] [finding that a restitution fine constitutes punishment for double jeopardy purposes based on an express legislative intent to increase the \u201c \u2018penalty\u2019 \u201d for convicted criminals and dissuade \u201c \u2018future criminality\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">As we have seen, more mundane concerns prompted the amendment of section 4852.01(d). The Legislature found that persons covered by the amended statute are not likely to receive certificates of rehabilitation, given their risk of reoffense. Yet, the cost of financing and litigating unsuccessful petitions in these cases was known to be high. While the Legislature assumed the relevant group remains dangerous even where a certificate of rehabilitation is obtained, such concerns do not compel a finding of punitive intent. <em>(Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, 361 [117 S.Ct. 2072, 2082] [finding no intent to punish sexual predators under an involuntary commitment scheme that \u201cprotect[s] the public from harm\u201d]; <em>Castellanos, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 785, 798 (lead opn. of George, C. J.) [describing as \u201cregulatory,\u201d not punitive, a sex offender registration requirement aimed at controlling crime and preventing recidivism]; <em>Hubbart, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1138, 1171 [legislative concern over \u201cthe serious harm\u201d caused by dangerous sex offenders does not reflect a punitive intent].)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Of course, a measure can be \u201cso punitive in either purpose or effect\u201d that it raises ex post facto concerns notwithstanding legislative evidence to the contrary. <em>(Young, supra, </em>531 U.S. 250, 261 [121 S.Ct. 727, 734], citing <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, 361 [117 S.Ct. 2072, 2082]; accord, <em>Nestor, supra, </em>363 U.S. 603, 617 [80 S.Ct. 1367, 1376].) This determination requires the \u201cclearest proof\u2019 and is not lightly made. <em>(Young, supra, </em>531 U.S. at p. 261 [121 S.Ct. at p. 734]; <em>Nestor, supra, </em>363 U.S. at p. 617 [80 S.Ct. at p. 1376.) The controlling considerations vary depending upon the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">Specifically, the high court has considered such factors as whether the challenged law imposes an affirmative disability or restraint; whether any such sanction has been historically regarded as punishment; whether the law promotes the traditional aims of punishment (i.e., retribution and deterrence) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>through means commonly used in criminal statutes (e.g., imposing culpability for proscribed acts and requiring scienter); whether the law bears a rational connection to legitimate nonpenal aims; and whether it appears excessive in relation to such aims. <em>(Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, 361-363 [117 S.Ct. 2072, 2081-2083], applying <em>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 144, 168-169 [83 S.Ct. 554, 567-578, 9 L.Ed.2d 644]; see <em>Hudson v. United States </em>(1997) 522 U.S. 93, 99 [118 S.Ct. 488, 493, 139 L.Ed.2d 450, 162 A.L.R. Fed. 737] [describing the factors as \u201cuseful guideposts\u201d]; <em>United States v. Ward </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 242, 249 [100 S.Ct. 2636, 2641-2642, 65 L.Ed.2d 742] [discussing one \u201chelpful\u201d factor and finding no punishment].)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">This court has applied the foregoing principles and rejected ex post facto challenges to laws regulating the public safety risks posed by convicted sex offenders. We have consistently found that such statutes are not punitive in purpose or effect even where they place substantial burdens on persons who committed pre-enactment crimes. Three recent cases illustrate the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">In <em>Castellanos, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 785, a convicted sex offender was required to register with local authorities upon his release from prison. Registration was ordered during sentencing on the qualifying crimes, and was based on legislation enacted after they occurred. This court declined to strike the registration requirement, finding no punishment in the ex post facto sense. While separate opinions in the case emphasized different factors in reaching this conclusion, a majority of the court agreed that registration laws had not traditionally been viewed as criminal or penal in nature. <em>(Castellanos </em>at pp. 792, 798 (lead opn. of George, C. J.); <em>id. </em>at p. 804 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) A majority of Justices also found that registration helps locate sex offenders who commit new crimes, and that the law is no more onerous than necessary to protect the public from harm\u2014a permissible regulatory goal. <em>(Castellanos </em>at pp. 796, 798 (lead opn. of George, C. J.); <em>id. </em>at p. 804 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">Similarly, in <em>People v. McVickers </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 81 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 850, 840 P.2d 955], the sentencing court ordered a convicted sex offender to take an HIV blood test under a postcrime statute allowing positive test results to be used for future sentence enhancement purposes. On review, this court observed that the statute was intended to serve the legitimate nonpenal purpose of preventing the spread of disease and that medical testing had not historically been used as punishment for crime. Also, none of the means employed by the statute appeared excessive or retributive, namely, a minimally intrusive blood test, limited disclosure of test results, and additional punishment upon reoffense. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 87-89.) We therefore held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>statutory test requirement did not constitute punishment and that its application did not offend ex post facto principles. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">A more onerous measure, the Sexually Violent Predators Act, was upheld in <em>Hubbart, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1138. Under this act, mentally disordered sex offenders could be involuntarily committed to a secure treatment facility immediately upon their release from prison based, in part, on violent crimes committed before the law took effect. The law allowed commitment to continue as long as the person remained dangerous, and offered various opportunities to obtain release under appropriate conditions. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1143-1149.) Applying <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, which upheld a similar Kansas law, this court found that the commitment scheme did not increase punishment for the qualifying crimes or implicate ex post facto concerns. Relevant factors included the state\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting the public and treating dangerously ill persons, the historical use of commitment laws for this purpose, and various statutory features ensuring that commitment lasted no longer than necessary to achieve the law\u2019s nonpunitive aims. <em>(Hubbart, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1138, 1172-1178.)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">Ansell implicitly attempts to distinguish the foregoing cases, and suggests that certain factors commonly used to find criminal punishment are present here. He first assumes that the postsentence disabilities imposed on convicted felons under state statutory law are part of the punishment for their crimes. As best we can discern from the conclusory nature of the claim, he contends that the amendment to section 4852.01(d) aggravates punishment because it prevents use of a certificate of rehabilitation, and any pardon that might be based thereon, to obtain relief from these affirmative punitive restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">At the outset, we reject the suggestion that absent section 4852.01(d), a certificate of rehabilitation is <em>necessarily </em>available to any convicted felon who claims to meet the minimum statutory requirements and is otherwise eligible to apply. As we have explained, the superior court conducts a thorough inquiry into the applicant\u2019s conduct and character from the time of the underlying crimes through the time of the certificate of rehabilitation proceeding. (\u00a7\u00a7 4852.1-4852.12.) The standards for determining whether rehabilitation has occurred are high. (\u00a7\u00a7 4852.05, 4852.13(a); see \u00a7\u00a7 4852.11, 4852.13(b).) The decision whether to grant relief based on the evidence is discretionary in nature. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lockwood </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 222, 227-229 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 769]; see \u00a7 4852.13(a), as amended by Stats. 1996, ch. 129, \u00a7 2, eff. July 8, 1996 [clarifying that a certificate of rehabilitation \u201cmay\u201d issue upon the requisite showing of reform].) Contrary to what Ansell seems to imply, there is no circumstance under which the statutory scheme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>requires or guarantees issuance of a certificate of rehabilitation by the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Ansell also mischaracterizes those postsentence consequences of a felony conviction that might be ameliorated or removed by a certificate of rehabilitation or an ensuing pardon. In a long line of decisions, the United States Supreme Court has upheld laws restricting the rights and conduct of convicted felons after sentence is served, even where fundamental interests are at stake. <em>(Lewis v. United States </em>(1980) 445 U.S. 55, 60-67 [100 S.Ct. 915, 918-921, 63 L.Ed.2d 198] <em>(Lewis) </em>[applying a federal firearm ban to a convicted felon whose qualifying conviction was obtained in violation of the constitutional right to counsel]; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>418 U.S. 24, 41-56 [94 S.Ct. 2655, 2665-2672] [upholding state laws permanently depriving convicted felons of the right to vote]; <em>De Veau v. Braisted </em>(1960) 363 U.S. 144, 151-160 [80 S.Ct. 1146, 1150-1154, 4 L.Ed.2d 1109] <em>(De Veau) </em>(lead opn. of Frankfurter, J.) [enforcing a state statute prohibiting convicted felons from holding office in labor organizations]; <em>Hawker v. New York </em>(1898) 170 U.S. 189, 192-200 [18 S.Ct. 573, 575-578, 42 L.Ed. 1002] <em>(Hawker) </em>[applying a state statute barring convicted felons from practicing medicine].)</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">The foregoing disabilities are \u201ccivil\u201d notwithstanding the use of criminal sanctions to ensure their enforcement. <em>(Lewis, supra, </em>445 U.S. 55, 67 [100 S.Ct. 915, 922]; see <em>Hawker, supra, </em>170 U.S. 189, 190, 196-197 [18 S.Ct. 573, 576-577].) The same laws also do not involve \u201cpunishment\u201d when subjected to ex post facto scrutiny. <em>(De Veau, supra, </em>363 U.S. 144, 160 [80 S.Ct 1146, 1155] (lead opn. of Frankfurter, J.); <em>Hawker, supra, </em>170 U.S. at pp. 191, 196-197 [18 S.Ct. at pp. 574, 576].) In reaching these conclusions, the high court has emphasized that the restrictions are imposed, not as punishment for past crimes, but as a \u201crelevant incident\u201d to some other present regulatory purpose. <em>(De Veau, supra, </em>363 U.S. at p. 160 [80 S.Ct. at p. 1155] (lead opn. of Frankfurter, J.); see, e.g., <em>Lewis, supra, </em>445 U.S. at p. 66 [100 S.Ct. at p. 921] [Congress could reasonably conclude that firearms are dangerous in the hands of convicted felons]; <em>Hawker, supra, </em>170 U.S. at pp. 196-197 [18 S.Ct. at p. 576] [legislature could reasonably conclude that convicted felons are unfit to practice medicine].)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">The same principles define the postsentence disabilities experienced by convicted felons under California law. These statutes serve vital public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>interests, avoid criminal punishment, and otherwise raise no ex post facto concerns. (See, e.g., <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Board of Architectural Examiners </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 763, 784-786 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 952 P.2d 641] [licensing rules and disciplinary proceedings under the Business and Professions Code are not criminal or penal, and instead promote vocational fitness and competence], 787 [same characterization of vocational disqualifications based on felony convictions]; <em>Castellanos, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 785, 796 (lead opn. of George, C. J.) [sex offender registration requirement protects the public from harm and does not involve criminal punishment under ex post facto principles]; <em>id. </em>at pp. 804-805 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Kennard, J.) [same]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301, 314 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111] (lead opn. of Kaus, J.) [impeachment with a prior felony conviction provides the present trier of fact with relevant information concerning the witness\u2019s character and credibility]; <em>Rubio v. Superior Court </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 93, 101 [154 Cal.Rptr. 734, 593 P.2d 595] [exclusion of convicted felons from jury service promotes the state\u2019s legitimate interest in assuring an impartial verdict]; <em>People v. King </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 12, 21 [148 Cal.Rptr. 409, 582 P.2d 1000] [firearm prohibition promotes public safety and rationally assumes the danger is greater where such weapons are possessed by convicted felons].)</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Hence, the statutory disabilities about which Ansell complains have not historically been regarded as criminal or penal under ex post facto principles. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>To the extent some convicted sex offenders are barred from using certificates of rehabilitation to remove or ease these civil restraints, the amendment to section 4852.01(d) thus does not inflict punishment for the underlying crimes. The statute is not punitive simply because it denies the opportunity to obtain relief from other <em>nonpunitive </em>laws. We find no ex post facto violation on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Ansell next suggests that the amendment to section 4852.01(d) is vindictive and far more burdensome than necessary to achieve its nonpenal aims. For reasons he does not explain, Ansell assumes that a certificate of rehabilitation offers the sole means by which convicted sex offenders can seek and obtain a gubernatorial pardon. By denying access to the certificate of rehabilitation procedure, he insists, the amended statute ensures that the affected group has no chance of receiving a pardon even where rehabilitation under section 4852.01 et seq. may have occurred. We find no statutory support for this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">A certificate of rehabilitation constitutes an application for a pardon when received by the Governor. (\u00a7 4852.16.) Ansell is correct that the amendment to section 4852.01(d) withholds this automatic application provision from sex offenders convicted of the specified crimes. According to the legislative history discussed earlier, the change affects those individuals who are least likely to obtain certificates of rehabilitation in the superior court, and who are most likely to waste public resources attempting to obtain such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">However, nothing prevents convicted sex offenders like Ansell from pursuing clemency outside the certificate of rehabilitation scheme. (See \u00a7 4852.19.) Under the alternative procedure set forth in section 4800 et seq., convicted felons\u2014including sex offenders covered by section 4852.01(d)\u2014 may appeal directly to the Governor for a pardon and for relief from the civil disabilities we have described. Like the certificate of rehabilitation scheme in section 4852.01 et seq., the direct application procedure contemplates a thorough investigation of all pardon candidates, including any rehabilitative steps taken after sentence is served. (\u00a7\u00a7 4802-4803, 4812-4813; see <em>ante, </em>fn. 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Indeed, the Legislature has acknowledged the Governor\u2019s \u201cright to pardon\u201d convicted sex offenders \u201c[notwithstanding\u201d their ineligibility for certificates of rehabilitation under section 4852.01(d). (\u00a7 4852.01(e).) As suggested by section 4852.01(e) and reflected in section 4800 et seq., no change has been made in the standards used to investigate and process pardon applications not submitted in certificate of rehabilitation form. (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>We recognize that a certificate of rehabilitation also serves as a judicial recommendation for a pardon (\u00a7 4852.13(a)), and that no similar provision appears in section 4800 et seq. However, regardless of which statutory application procedure is used, and notwithstanding any recommendation by the superior court, the pardon decision is discretionary, and rests ultimately with the Governor. (Cal. Const., art. V, \u00a7 8, subd. (a); see Brown, <em>The Quality of Mercy </em>(1993) 40 UCLA L.Rev. 327, 328-332.) The amendment to section 4852.01(d) effects no fundamental, punitive change in the opportunity for executive mercy and clemency available to convicted sex offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Finally, Ansell contends the amended statute constitutes an ex post facto law under <em>Sovereign, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d 143. In his view, <em>Sovereign </em>properly concluded that unfavorable changes in the certificate of rehabilitation scheme are punitive and cannot be applied to persons who commit pre-amendment crimes. However, we reject <em>Sovereign's </em>reasoning and result.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">In <em>Sovereign, </em>an attorney (petitioner) was convicted of grand theft, imprisoned, and then paroled. Less than three and one-half years after he was released from prison, and slightly more than two years after he was discharged from parole, petitioner sought and received a certificate of rehabilitation. In granting relief, the superior court apparently relied on the minimum statutory period of rehabilitation in existence when petitioner left prison. However, eight months before the petition was filed, an amendment to section 4852.03 lengthened the applicable period of rehabilitation by 21 months, and thereby postponed the earliest time at which a certificate of rehabilitation could be sought. Relying on this amendment, the People claimed the certificate of rehabilitation was void, and moved to vacate the order. The superior court denied the motion. <em>(Sovereign, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d at pp. 145-147.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Affirming the judgment, the Court of Appeal held in <em>Sovereign </em>that the new, longer rehabilitation requirement of section 4852.03 could not, consistent with ex post facto guarantees, be used to calculate petitioner\u2019s eligibility for a certificate. The court started from the premise that the postsentence disabilities experienced by convicted felons are punitive, including, in petitioner\u2019s case, loss of his law license. <em>(Sovereign, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d at pp. 147-149.) The court reasoned that because these statutory restrictions inflict punishment until a certificate of rehabilitation and/or pardon is obtained, \u201cthen surely [an amendment to section 4852.03 increasing the period of rehabilitation and] prolonging the time that ex-prisoners remain subject to these penalties constitutes punishment, as well.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 154.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\"><em>Sovereign's </em>analysis is flawed in several respects. First, the court characterized ex post facto violations in terms of any statute that retroactively<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number> \u201c \u201calter[s] the situation of the accused to his disadvantage.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Sovereign, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d at p. 150.) The United States Supreme Court has since clarified in <em>Collins, supra, </em>497 U.S. 37, 47-51 [110 S.Ct. 2715, 2721-2723], that such an ambiguous test expands the ex post facto doctrine beyond its original meaning, and is inconsistent with <em>Calder, supra, </em>3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390 [1 L.Ed. 648, 650] (opn. of Chase, J.). (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 22.) Although <em>Sovereign </em>did not have the benefit of <em>Collins </em>and its progeny, this subsequent authority undermines the conceptual foundation on which <em>Sovereign </em>was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Second, both before and after <em>Sovereign </em>was decided, punishment for ex post facto purposes has depended on whether a legislative intent to punish is manifest, and whether the law is actually punitive in nature. High court cases have long based the latter determination on, among other things, whether the challenged sanction has historically been regarded as punishment, and whether it bears a rational connection to the law\u2019s apparent nonpenal purpose. (E.g., <em>Nestor, supra, </em>363 U.S. 603, 617 [80 S.Ct. 1367, 1376]; <em>De Veau, supra, </em>363 U.S. 144, 160 [80 S.Ct. 1146, 1155] (lead opn. of Frankfurter, J.); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, supra, </em>448 U.S. 242, 248-249 [100 S.Ct. 2636, 2641]; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Mendoza-Martinez, supra, </em>372 U.S. 144, 168-169 [83 S.Ct. 554, 568].) However, <em>Sovereign, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d 143, ignored these principles and authorities. In so doing, <em>Sovereign </em>overlooked the obvious remedial effect of increasing the period of rehabilitation in section 4852.03\u2014to ensure material improvement in the petitioner\u2019s conduct and character over a meaningful and sustained length of time. (See \u00a7 4852.05.)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Third, <em>Sovereign, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d 143, failed to consider case law in existence at the time characterizing the disabilities imposed on convicted felons as legitimate regulatory measures. These federal and state decisions have long made clear that the restrictions which <em>Sovereign </em>erroneously assumed are penal have not traditionally been viewed in this manner. (E.g., <em>De Veau, supra, </em>363 U.S. 144, 160 [80 S.Ct. 1146, 1155] (lead opn. of Frankfurter, J.); <em>Hawker, supra, </em>170 U.S. 189, 196-197 [18 S.Ct. 573, 576]; <em>Hughes v. Board of Architectural Examiners, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 763, 784-787, and cases cited; <em>Rubio v. Superior Court, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 93, 101; <em>People </em>v. <em>King, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 12, 21.) Thus, contrary to the reasoning of <em>Sovereign, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d at page 154, the amendment to section 4852.03 did not prolong punishment insofar as it \u201cprolong[ed] the time\u201d that convicted felons \u201cremain subject to\u201d these laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Fourth, and in a related vein, <em>Sovereign, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d 143, 153-154, relied upon <em>Cummings, supra, </em>71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277, and <em>Garland, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number><em>supra, </em>71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333, which are inapposite. There, irrevocable and sweeping vocational disqualifications were imposed in the form of loyalty oaths upon persons who had been sympathetic to the Confederacy during the Civil War. These postwar laws exacted retribution for political acts which, in large part, were not criminal when they occurred, and which bore no relationship to the person\u2019s fitness to practice the vocations in question. (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 23.)

(See, e.g., former \u00a7 2600 et seq., added by Stats. 1941, ch. 106, \u00a7 15, p. 1091, and repealed by Stats. 1975, ch. 1175, \u00a7 2, p. 2897.)

Adopted in 1966, the foregoing provision is based on similar provisions that have appeared in the state Constitution since 1849. (See Cal. Const., former art.

Under these provisions, pardon applications are submitted directly to the Governor (\u00a7\u00a7 4802, 4803), and then transmitted to the Board of Prison Terms for investigation and a recommendation (\u00a7\u00a7 4802, 4812, 4813). To ensure a \u201cfull and complete\u201d inquiry, the Board of Prison Terms examines the application and any related materials, and may consider witness testimony. (\u00a7 4812.) To the same end, either the Governor or the Board of Prison Terms may solicit a report and recommendation from the trial judge or the district attorney who participated in criminal proceedings involving the pardon applicant. (\u00a7 4803.) As noted earlier, article V, section 8, subdivision (a) of the state Constitution precludes a pardon for persons \u201ctwice convicted of a felony except on recommendation of the Supreme Court, 4 judges concurring.\u201d Hence, once the pardon application of a twice-convicted felon is received by the Governor and investigated by the Board of Prison Terms, special statutes govern its transmission between the executive branch and the Supreme Court.

Grant, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 157.) However, for reasons discussed at length above, the language and history of section 4852.01 (d) provide the necessary \u201c \u2018clear and compelling implication\u2019 \u201d that the statute was intended to apply in this manner. <em>(People v. Grant, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 157.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Under <em>Colder, </em>the ex post facto clause protects against limited forms of retroactive criminal legislation, as follows: \u201c1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender.\u201d <em>(Calder, supra, </em>3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390 [1 L.Ed. 648, 650] (opn. of Chase, J.).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b938-7\">The vocational and other civil disabilities upheld in <em>Hawker, supra, </em>170 U.S. 189, and later cases, are distinguishable from the unusual penal laws invalidated in <em>Cummings v. Missouri </em>(1867) 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277 [18 L.Ed. 356] <em>(Cummings), </em>and <em>Ex Parte Garland </em>(1867) 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333 [18 L.Ed. 366] <em>{Garland).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">In <em>Cummings, </em>a post-Civil-War amendment to the Missouri Constitution required public officeholders and members of numerous vocations and professions to deny under oath that they had given aid, comfort, or \u201csympathy\u201d to the Confederate cause or to any of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>supporters. <em>(Cummings, supra, </em>71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277, 317 [18 L.Ed. 356, 361].) On the one hand, false swearing of the oath was a crime punishable by imprisonment. On the other hand, failure to take the oath essentially served as an admission of guilt to the proscribed acts, and was punishable both by imprisonment and by permanent exclusion from the specified offices and vocations. Declining to apply the law to a clergyman who had not taken the oath as required, <em>Cummings </em>held that the lifetime vocational ban amounted to ex post facto punishment for conduct which was not criminal when it occurred, or which had not previously been sanctioned in the same manner. The high court emphasized that many of the proscribed acts <em>\u201chave no possible relation to [the oath </em>takers\u2019] <em>fitness for th[e </em>various] <em>pursuits and professions. . . </em>. The oath could not, therefore, have been required as a means of ascertaining whether parties were qualified or not for their respective callings or the trusts with which they were charged.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 319-320 [18 L.Ed. at pp. 361-362], italics added.) Rather, the oath was exacted \u201cbecause <em>it was thought that the several acts deserved punishment, </em>and that for many of them there was no way to inflict punishment except by depriving the parties, who had committed them, of some of the rights and privileges of the citizen.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 320 [18 L.Ed. at p. 362], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">Similarly, in <em>Garland, supra, </em>71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333, 376 [18 L.Ed. 366, 369], Congress enacted a statute permanently barring attorneys from practicing law in federal court unless they swore under oath that they had not assisted or \u201cencourage[d]\u201d the Confederacy during the Civil War. <em>Garland </em>followed <em>Cummings, </em>and held that the statute could not be applied to an attorney who had not taken the oath due to his wartime political activities. Because it resulted in perpetual exclusion from the bar for vindictive reasons unrelated to the lawyer\u2019s professional fitness and qualifications, the law inflicted new and greater criminal punishment in violation of ex post facto principles. <em>(Garland </em>at pp. 377-380 [18 L.Ed. at pp. 369-371].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
