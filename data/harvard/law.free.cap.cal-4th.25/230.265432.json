The Court of Appeal answered in the affirmative. The Attorney General urges that we adopt a categorical rule barring ineffective assistance claims based on advice concerning the immigration consequences of a guilty plea. As explained below, we conclude that affirmative misadvice regarding immigration consequences may, depending on the circumstances of the particular case, constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Nevertheless, as we agree with the Attorney General that petitioner in this case failed to carry his burden of demonstrating prejudice, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The relevant facts are largely undisputed. Petitioner Hugo Rangel Resendiz is a lawful permanent resident of the United States. He has lived and worked in this country for almost 25 years, most of his adult life. Petitioner has two children who are United States citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">In June of 1997, assisted by trial counsel Leonard Basinger, petitioner pled guilty in Orange County Superior Court to possession for sale of cocaine and marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11351, 11359) and possession of a usable amount of methamphetamine {id., \u00a7 11377, subd. (a)). On Basinger\u2019s advice, petitioner also initialed and signed a printed plea form stating, inter alia, \u201cI understand that if I am not a citizen of the United States the conviction for the offense charged may have the consequence of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d The signed form contains a paragraph, also initialed by petitioner, stating that the signer has \u201cread, understood, and personally initialed each item above and discussed them with my attorney . . . .\u201d At the plea hearing, petitioner was one of six defendants read their rights as a group, thusly: \u201cIf you are not a naturalized citizen of the United States, your conviction could result in your deportation or denial of naturalization at some later point in time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Imposition of sentence was suspended, and petitioner was placed on felony probation for three years on conditions including that he serve 180 days in jail. After petitioner served his jail sentence, he was taken into custody by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and charged with being subject to removal from the United States under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(l) [conviction of controlled substance offense other than possession of marijuana for personal use]) and section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) [conviction of \u201caggravated felony\u201d]) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq.). Immigration authorities placed petitioner in administrative detention at the Mira Loma facility in Lancaster, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Petitioner retained new counsel and filed in the superior court a motion to vacate the judgment convicting him, asking the court to permit him to withdraw the guilty plea on which it was based. At the hearing on his motion, petitioner testified that when he was faced with the question of whether to plead guilty he held a \u201cgreen card\u201d (i.e., a certificate of permanent residency) and was, therefore, a lawful permanent resident of the United States. Petitioner discussed his permanent residency status with his trial counsel, Basinger. Petitioner told counsel that it was concern about keeping his green card that had motivated him to hire a lawyer. According to petitioner, counsel told him that, if he pled guilty, he would have \u201cno problems with immigration\u201d except that he would not be able to become a United States citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Petitioner further testified that he did not remember the court saying anything to him on these topics at the time he entered his plea. But after viewing the plea form bearing his signature and initials, petitioner agreed he had read and spoken with his lawyer about the form. The form contains a general advisement about possible immigration consequences of a conviction, couched roughly in the language courts are mandated to administer on the record by Penal Code section 1016.5, subdivision (a) (hereafter section 1016.5 and section 1016.5(a)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After reading this printed advisement, petitioner stated he understood its use of the word \u201cmay\u201d to mean \u201clike it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>happen.\u201d Petitioner also affirmed on cross-examination that he had answered \u201cyes\u201d when the judge asked him at the plea proceeding if he had signed the plea form and talked with his lawyer about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Finally, petitioner testified that, at the time of the plea, he had told his trial attorney that he was innocent of the drug charges against him. According to petitioner, he nevertheless pled guilty after counsel told him that, if he did not, he would be sentenced to five years in jail and that there were \u201ca lot of innocent people going to jail.\u201d If he had known he would in fact be deported as a consequence, he would not have pled guilty and, if permitted to withdraw his guilty plea, he was willing to face the possibility of being retried and sent to prison for the maximum possible period, five years and four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In ruling on petitioner\u2019s motion, the court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think\u201d that \u201call people are being deported for possession for sale or sale of narcotics.\u201d The court opined that such concerns (i.e., concerns, apparently, about the relative certainty of deportation as a consequence of the plea) were, in any event, not dispositive, but, rather, that the important consideration was \u201cwhether or not Mr. Resendiz knew that if he entered the plea that it [i.e., deportation] could happen.\u201d The court also stated it did not credit petitioner\u2019s testimony \u201cwhen he says the Court didn\u2019t advise him at the time he entered the plea of his rights or the [immigration] consequences,\u201d noting petitioner signed and initialed the written plea form after it had been interpreted in Spanish, petitioner\u2019s native language. The court denied petitioner\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Petitioner thereupon filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Court of Appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeal issued an order to show cause returnable before the superior court. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1508, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">In the return, the district attorney acknowledged petitioner told counsel he wanted to protect his green card status, but denied that petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel. The district attorney also acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel does not remember discussing the printed plea form with petitioner. Indeed, the district attorney submitted the declaration of counsel, Basinger, stating he has \u201cno independent specific recollection\u201d of any such interaction. Basinger\u2019s declaration also states it is his \u201ccustom and habit\u201d to review plea forms carefully with his clients and to explain to noncitizen clients \u201cthat a guilty plea is likely to effect [sic] the client\u2019s ability to become a citizen. I also tell these clients that I make the assumption that the federal government is always wanting to deport non-citizen felons. I explain to them they should assume the government has a policy to deport people in their position.\u201d Finally, Basinger\u2019s declaration states that he has been an attorney, specializing in criminal defense, for 18 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Petitioner in his traverse reiterated his request to withdraw his guilty plea, reasserting both his innocence of the drug charges and his ignorance when pleading guilty that deportation was a nearly certain consequence. Petitioner argued that the police reports demonstrated he had \u201ca triable case\u201d on the merits of the drug charges, and he asserted that, had he known the immigration consequences a guilty plea would have, he would have exercised his right to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Petitioner also argued that for his trial counsel to have provided adequate advice about the likely immigration consequences of his guilty plea would not have been unduly burdensome. To his traverse, petitioner appended the INS document, a \u201cNotice to Appear,\u201d that charges him with being subject to removal from the United States on two grounds: for having been convicted of an offense involving a controlled substance, and for having been convicted of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Before ruling on the order to show cause, the superior court read into the record the following stipulation filed by the district attorney and counsel for petitioner. \u201cIn lieu of an evidentiary hearing the People and Petitioner stipulate as follows: If called as a witness, Defense Counsel Leonard Basinger would testify that even though he knew Petitioner, his client, was an immigrant, he did not independently research or investigate the immigration consequences that would result from Petitioner entering a guilty plea. Mr. Basinger also did not contact an immigration attorney to seek advice about the immigration laws of the United States. Immigration laws include the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 [Pub.L. No. 104-208 (Sept. 30, 1996) 110 Stat. 3009-546 (hereafter IIRAIRA)] and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 [Pub.L. No. 104-132 (Apr. 24, 1996) 110 Stat. 1214 (hereafter AEDPA)]. It is further stipulated that the Declaration of Leonard Dale Basinger, included as Exhibit 1 to the Return shall be admitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The superior court denied petitioner\u2019s petition. In so doing, the court stated, \u201cI\u2019m not even ruling on whether or not there are any deficiencies in Mr. Basinger\u2019s representation.\u201d The court also stated that it did \u201cnot believe it is insufficient and that it falls below an objective standard of reasonableness for Defense Counsel in this County, but even more important than that,\u201d the court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t believe anything he could have done would have resulted or that it is reasonably probable that anything additional he could have done would have resulted in a result that is more favorable to [petitioner] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Petitioner then filed a second habeas corpus petition in the Court of Appeal that is the subject of our review here. The Court of Appeal unanimously granted the writ, vacating petitioner\u2019s conviction and directing the trial court to allow him to withdraw his guilty pleas. We granted review on the Attorney General\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Plea bargaining and pleading are critical stages in the criminal process at which a defendant is entitled, under both the Sixth Amendment to the federal Constitution and article I, section 15 of the California Constitution, to the effective assistance of legal counsel. <em>(In re Alvernaz </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 924, 933 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 713, 830 P.2d 747]; see generally <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart </em>(1985) 474 U.S. 52, 57-59 [106 S.Ct. 366, 369-371, 88 L.Ed.2d 203] <em>(Hill).) </em>\u201cIt is well settled that where ineffective assistance of counsel results in the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty, the defendant has suffered a constitutional violation giving rise to a claim for relief from the guilty plea.\u201d <em>(In re Alvernaz, </em>at p. 934, citing Hill, at pp. 56-60 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 369-371]; <em>McMann v. Richardson </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 759, 771 [90 S.Ct. 1441, 1449, 25 L.Ed.2d 763] <em>(McMann).)</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">To establish ineffective assistance of counsel under either the federal or state guarantee, a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms, and that counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial, i.e., that a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s failings, the result would have been more favorable to the defendant. <em>(Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687-688 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-2065, 80 L.Ed.2d 674] <em>(Strickland); People </em>v. <em>Waidla </em>(2000) <em>22 </em>Cal.4th 690, 718 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 396, 996 P.2d 46].)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The Attorney General, relying primarily on out-of-state and federal court decisions, urges us to announce a categorical bar to immigration-based ineffective assistance claims. For the following reasons we decline to impose such a categorical bar. Rather, we hold that affirmative misadvice regarding immigration consequences can in certain circumstances constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. We do not address whether a mere failure to advise could also constitute ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">A. <em>Is petitioner\u2019s claim categorically barred?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Ordinarily, \u201ca court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>(Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 690 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2066]; see also <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Flores-Ortega </em>(2000) 528 U.S. 470, 478 [120 S.Ct. 1029, 1035, 145 L.Ed.2d 985] [rejecting per se rule that counsel must file notice of appeal unless defendant instructs otherwise as \u201cinconsistent with <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>holding that \u2018the performance inquiry must be whether counsel\u2019s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances\u2019 \u201d].) The Attorney General, however, proffers two bases, on either of which, the Attorney General implies, we may avoid the task of specifically evaluating the particulars of trial counsel\u2019s performance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">1. <em>Section 1016.5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The Attorney General argues, as does Justice Brown in her concurring and dissenting opinion, that a trial court\u2019s having provided a section 1016.5 advisement \u201cshould shield pleas from collateral attack\u201d (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Brown, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 261) based on immigration consequences. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">That defendants have a right to counsel when they undertake the plea evaluation and negotiation specifically provided for in section 1016.5, subdivisions (b) and (d) is not disputed. And that right to counsel \u201c \u2018is the right to the <em>effective </em>assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 686 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2063], italics added.) We recognize that \u201cit is the attorney, not the client, who is particularly qualified to make an informed evaluation of a proffered plea bargain.\u201d <em>(In re Alvernaz, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 933.)  Thus, whether or not the court faithfully delivers section 1016.5\u2019s mandated advisements, \u201c[t]he defendant can be expected to rely on counsel\u2019s independent evaluation of the charges, applicable law, and evidence, and of the risks and probable outcome of trial.\u201d <em>(In re Alvernaz, </em>at p. 933; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallardo, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 988, fn. 9 [as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>court gave \u00a7 1016.5 advice, \u201cthe only arrow in [defendant\u2019s quiver below was ineffective counsel and his only remedy was habeas corpus\u201d].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Under the Sixth Amendment, defendants are entitled so to rely and to expect representation \u201cwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d <em>(McMann, supra, </em>397 U.S. at p. 771 [90 S.Ct. at p. 1449].) The existence of a state statute requiring courts to deliver a specified immigration advisement cannot deprive defendants of these federal constitutional rights. <em>(In re Sutter-Butte By-Pass Assessment </em>(1923) 190 Cal. 532, 536-537 [213 P. 974] [Legislature \u201ccannot, under the guise of creating a new statutory remedy, deprive a litigant of an existing constitutionally guaranteed right\u201d].) Efforts to mine section 1016.5\u2019s history for hints the Legislature meant that statute to foreclose some kinds of ineffectiveness claims (see, e.g., cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Brown, J., <em>post, </em>at pp. 260-261) are misplaced. What constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel is a question of constitutional law, not of legislative intent. Thus, that a defendant may have received valid section 1016.5 advisements from the court does not entail that he has received effective assistance of counsel in evaluating or responding to such advisements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The Attorney General\u2019s suggestion that we construe section 1016.5 as a categorical bar to immigration-based ineffective assistance claims \u201cwould deny defendants [who prove incompetence and prejudice] a remedy for the specific constitutional deprivation suffered\u201d <em>(In re Alvernaz, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 936), viz., the Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel. Any construction that might engender such constitutional infirmity is to be avoided. <em>(People v. Superior Court (Zamudio) </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 183, 199-200 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 463, 999 P.2d 686] <em>(Zamudio); San Francisco Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 571, 581 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 245, 828 P.2d 147].)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Nothing, moreover, suggests that the drafters of section 1016.5 intended either to narrow defendants\u2019 relationships with their attorneys or to shield incompetent legal advisers. If anything, the statutory scheme contemplates an enhanced, not a diminished, role for counsel. (See \u00a7 1016.5, subds. (b) [\u201ccourt shall allow the defendant additional time to consider the appropriateness of the plea in light of the advisement\u201d] and (d) [court \u201cshall grant the defendant a reasonable amount of time to negotiate with the prosecuting agency in the event the defendant or the defendant\u2019s counsel was unaware of the possibility of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization as a result of conviction\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">For the foregoing reasons, section 1016.5 does not bar petitioner\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">2. <em>Collateral consequences doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The Attorney General also suggests we categorically bar petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance claim as based on a \u201ccollateral\u201d consequence of his criminal conviction. A defense lawyer\u2019s giving erroneous advice to a defendant about immigration consequences cannot violate the pleading defendant\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel, reasons the Attorney General, because knowledge of immigration consequences is not a prerequisite to a determination that the plea was entered voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">While potentially \u201cdire\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Giron) </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 793, 798 [114 Cal.Rptr. 596, 523 P.2d 636]), immigration consequences nevertheless are, in many jurisdictions including California, \u201cconsidered \u2018collateral\u2019 consequences of a criminal conviction.\u201d <em>(Zamudio, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 198; but see <em>Peart v. State </em>(Fla. 2000) 756 So.2d 42, 47, fn. 5 [implying that, in light of state criminal procedural rule similar to \u00a7 1016.5, the court will no longer treat immigration consequences as collateral].) We have not articulated precise definitions of \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201ccollateral\u201d in this context, but some California courts have, as the Attorney General points out, called \u201ccollateral\u201d any consequence of a plea that \u201cdoes not \u2018inexorably follow\u2019 from a conviction of the offense involved in the plea.\u201d <em>(People v. Crosby </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1352, 1355 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 159]; accord, <em>People v. Moore </em>(1998) 69 Cal.App.4th 626, 630 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 658].) Indeed, the deportation consequences of a conviction are not \u201cinexorable,\u201d in that deportation \u201ccan be instituted only \u2018upon the order of the Attorney General\u2019 (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)) of the United States, who retains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>discretion not to institute such proceedings.\u201d <em>(Zamudio, </em>at pp. 204-205.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nevertheless, for the following reasons, we conclude that the \u201ccollateral\u201d nature of immigration consequences does not foreclose petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">First, the United States Supreme Court has made clear that ineffective assistance analysis is highly case specific, noting that \u201c \u2018[attorney errors come in an infinite variety ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Hill, supra, </em>474 U.S. at pp. 57-58 [106 S.Ct. at p. 370], quoting <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 693 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2067].) Accordingly, in every case \u201cthe performance inquiry must be whether counsel\u2019s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.\u201d <em>(Strickland, </em>at p. 688 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2065]; accord, <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Flores-Ortega, supra, </em>528 U.S. at p. 478 [120 S.Ct. at p. 1035].)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Second, the collateral consequence doctrine and ineffective assistance claims have separate origins. Recognition of the right to competent representation in the guilty plea context directly \u201cstemmed from the [Sixth Amendment\u2019s] general principle that all \u2018defendants facing felony charges are entitled to the effective assistance of competent counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hill, supra, </em>474 U.S. at p. 57 [106 S.Ct. at p. 369], quoting <em>McMann, supra, </em>397 U.S. at p. 771 [90 S.Ct. at p. 1449]; see also <em>McMann, </em>at p. 770 [90 S.Ct. at pp. 1448-1449] [distinguishing between the admissibility of a coerced confession and the competence of counsel in advising the confessing defendant to plead guilty].) The collateral consequences doctrine, on the other hand, originated as a policy-based adjunct to the due process requirement that a court ensure the guilty pleas it accepts are voluntarily given.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While the right to the assistance of counsel undoubtedly is \u201c \u2018included in the conception of due process of law\u2019 \u201d <em>(Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1932) 287 U.S. 45, 67-68 [53 S.Ct. 55, 63-64, 77 L.Ed. 158, 84 A.L.R. 527]), such that claims grounded wholly or partly in the latter may include reference to the former (see, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>McMann, </em>at pp. 767, 770-771 [90 S.Ct. at pp. 1446-1447, 1448-1449]), it does not follow that every jurisprudential limitation on courts\u2019 due process responsibilities applies (or should apply) without alteration to all types of ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The Attorney General offers no logical or jurisprudential reason why we should truncate our examination of counsel\u2019s Sixth Amendment responsibilities to noncitizen clients by invoking a categorical concept adopted for policy and convenience in delineating the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process responsibilities of trial courts. Nor does any binding authority require that reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">To the contrary, even before the high court in <em>Strickland </em>expressly grounded the effective assistance guarantee in the Sixth Amendment\u2019s \u201cpresumption that counsel will fulfill the role in the adversary process that the Amendment envisions\u201d <em>(Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 688 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2065]), courts resolving ineffective assistance claims recognized a \u201cshift of scrutiny in recent cases from the rudiments of the trial to the quality of representation by counsel [that] reflects a shift from the general requirements of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ... to the more specific [Sixth Amendment] right to counsel.\u201d <em>(Krummacher </em>v. <em>Gierloff </em>(1981) 290 Or. 867 [627 P.2d 458, 461].) We acknowledged the point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1], stating there that the former \u201c \u2018farce or sham\u2019 \u201d ineffectiveness standard \u201coriginated in decisions which held that the right to competent representation derived solely from the due process clause\u201d and \u201chas been thoroughly discredited.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 422.) \u201c[C]ourts now recognize that the right to competent representation at trial is grounded in the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel. [Citation.] Accordingly, constitutionally adequate assistance can no longer be measured by the due process standard of <em>[People </em>v.] <em>Ibarra </em>[(1963) 60 Cal.2d 460 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487]], but instead must be determined by a standard bottomed on the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 15 of the California Constitution.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The United States Supreme Court has never embraced the collateral consequences doctrine the Attorney General urges us to adopt in this case. In fact, on review of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that parole eligibility \u201cis a collateral rather than a direct consequence of a guilty plea, of which a defendant need not be informed\u201d in order for the plea to be considered voluntary <em>(Hill, supra, </em>474 U.S. at p. 55 [106 S.Ct. at p. 368]), the high court, instead of itself invoking that doctrine, applied \u201c[t]he longstanding test for determining the validity of a guilty plea[, i.e.,] \u2018whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 56 [106 S.Ct. at p. 369]). Nor has the high court ever suggested that ineffective assistance claims based on the giving of erroneous immigration advice ought categorically to be barred. Rather, recognizing the tremendous personal stakes involved in deportation and exclusion, the court has admonished, \u201c[i]n this area of the law, involving as it may the equivalent of banishment or exile, we do well to eschew technicalities and fictions and to deal instead with realities.\u201d <em>(Costello v. Immigration Service </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 120, 131 [84 S.Ct. 580, 586-587, 11 L.Ed.2d 559].)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Some cases applying the collateral consequences doctrine to bar immigration-based ineffective assistance claims purport to draw legal support from the high court\u2019s observation in <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 742, 755 [90 S.Ct. 1463, 1472, 25 L.Ed.2d 747], that a defendant must be made fully aware of the \u201c \u2018 \u201cdirect consequences\u201d \u2019\u201d of a guilty plea before the plea may be considered voluntary under the Fifth Amendment. <em>(U.S. v.

Cir. 1990) 902 F.2d 55, 59.) <em>Brady, </em>however, was <em>not </em>an ineffective assistance case.

United States, </em>at p. 748 [90 S.Ct. at p. 1469]), expressly deriving that rule from the constitutional guarantee of jury trial and the Fifth Amendment\u2019s ban on compelled self-incrimination. As <em>Brady </em>did not consider the ineffective assista\u00face of counsel issues before us in this case, it is no authority for deciding them one way or the other. <em>(Trope v.

Barella </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 261, 267-272 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 248, 975 P.2d 37] for the proposition that a \u201cdefendant does not have to know the collateral consequences which follow his plea in order for the plea to be constitutional,\u201d but <em>Barella </em>also is inapposite. There, we held unanimously that \u201ca defendant is not entitled to withdraw or set aside a guilty plea on the ground that the trial court, in accepting the plea, failed to advise the defendant of a limit on good-time or work-time credits available to the defendant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 272.) In so holding, we noted that \u201c[t]he United States Supreme Court has \u2018never held that the United States Constitution requires the State to furnish a defendant with information about parole eligibility in order for the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to be voluntary\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 267) and stated that conduct and work credits are not \u201c \u2018traditional \u201cdirect consequences\u201d of a plea\u2019 \u201d because they result from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the defendant\u2019s conduct after he arrives at prison and do not \u201c \u2018follow inexorably from the plea\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 270). Thus, <em>Barella </em>addressed the court\u2019s role in meeting <em>Boykin-Tahl</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>record requirements so as to assure that a defendant\u2019s guilty plea is voluntary, not counsel\u2019s obligation to provide effective assistance at every \u201ccritical stage in the criminal process\u201d as required by the Sixth Amendment and California Constitution, article I, section 15. <em>(In re Alvernaz, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 933.) The high court, as discussed, has never equated these two sets of obligations, nor does the Attorney General offer any persuasive reason why we should reach out to do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Defense counsel clearly has far greater duties toward the defendant than has the court taking a plea. Effective counsel, for example, has a general duty to conduct a reasonable investigation of the case enabling counsel to make informed decisions about how best to represent the client. <em>(Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 691 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 2066-2067].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court has no such duty. \u201cCounsel\u2019s function is to assist the defendant, and hence counsel owes the client a duty of loyalty, a duty to avoid conflicts of interest.\u201d <em>(Strickland, </em>at p. 688 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2065].) Again, the court has no such duties. \u201cFrom counsel\u2019s function as assistant to the defendant derive the overarching duty to advocate the defendant\u2019s cause and the more particular duties to consult with the defendant on important decisions\u201d <em>(ibid.)', </em>the court\u2019s function and duties quintessentially <em>exclude </em>such assistance, advocacy and consultation.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">For the foregoing reasons, to tie defense counsel\u2019s Sixth Amendment duties to the constitutional minima the due process clause requires of courts, by carving out, for erroneous advice concerning immigration consequences, an exception to the general requirement that counsel perform with \u201creasonableness under prevailing professional norms\u201d <em>(Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 688 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2065]), would be illogical and counterproductive.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">A few cases applying the collateral consequences doctrine to bar immigration-based ineffective assistance claims have expressed a concern that, as a matter of policy, to permit such claims \u201cis to take the first step on a long, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>slippery slope\u201d that could \u201cspawn endless litigation over effective assistance of counsel claims.\u201d <em>(State v. Christie </em>(Del.Super.Ct. 1994) 655 A.2d 836, 840.) The concern has no basis in law or logic. That a particular ineffective assistance claim might, depending on the circumstances, be viable despite the collateral nature of immigration consequences simply does not entail the viability of every\u2014or even any\u2014subsequent ineffective assistance claim that happens also to refer to a consequence similarly deemed collateral, and nothing we say here should be taken as suggesting the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In <em>People v. Reed </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 593, 601-602 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 615], for example, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim based on counsel\u2019s failure to advise him of a statutory limit on \u201cgood time\u201d prison credits. The Attorney General cites <em>Reed </em>for its partial reliance on the federal courts\u2019 collateral consequences doctrine. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 597.) But <em>Reed </em>is distinguishable. Unlike this case, <em>Reed </em>did not involve allegations of an affirmative misrepresentation in response to a specific inquiry from the defendant. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in <em>Reed </em>expressly held open the possibility such misrepresentation might constitute ineffective assistance. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">On several counts, \u201cdeportation is far more significant than [some] other [collateral] consequences, such as losing one\u2019s driver\u2019s license or losing the right to vote.\u201d (Fordham Note, <em>supra, </em>16 Fordham Int\u2019l L.J. at p. 1140, fn. omitted.) \u201cPerhaps nowhere outside of the criminal law are the consequences for the individual so serious.\u201d <em>(Wallace </em>v. <em>Reno </em>(D.Mass. 1998) 24 F.Supp.2d 104, 112.) Accordingly, that we decline to bar as collateral ineffective assistance claims based on erroneous immigration consequences advice plainly cannot determine the result in another context. Ultimately, \u201c[i]n any case presenting an ineffectiveness claim, the performance inquiry must be whether counsel\u2019s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.\u201d <em>(Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 688 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2065].)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Finally, the Legislature\u2019s enactment of section 1016.5, mandating specified immigration warnings in all plea cases, is a circumstance that distinguishes this case from cases involving other types of collateral consequences. Under the statutory mandate, defendants who wish to plead guilty are entitled to receive from the court some advice regarding immigration consequences\u2014a general warning of three immigration consequences that \u201cmay\u201d occur. (See \u00a7 1016.5(a).) In evaluating the court\u2019s advice, \u201c[t]he defendant can be expected to rely on counsel\u2019s independent evaluation of the charges, applicable law, and evidence, and of the risks and probable outcome of trial.\u201d <em>(In re Alvernaz, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 933.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u201cThe [defendant\u2019s] interest underlying [an ineffective assistance] claim is his interest in having, before he judges the desirability of the plea bargain, a general knowledge of the possible legal consequences of facing trial.\u201d <em>(Wofford </em>v. <em>Wainwright, supra, </em>748 F.2d at p. 1508.) That interest will flow, presumably, more from a particular consequence\u2019s practical import than its formal categorization as collateral or direct. Classifying immigration consequences as collateral does not diminish their status as \u201cmaterial legal principles that may significantly impact the particular circumstances\u201d surrounding a given plea. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pozo </em>(Colo. 1987) 746 P.2d 523, 529.) Accordingly, that adverse immigration consequences may for certain due process purposes be collateral to petitioner\u2019s conviction should not preclude application of the ordinary <em>Strickland </em>standards to his ineffective assistance claim based on alleged immigration misadvice.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that neither the existence of section 1016.5 nor the collateral nature of immigration consequences constitutes a per se bar to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on counsel\u2019s misadvice about the adverse immigration consequences of a guilty plea. Therefore, we may not in this case avoid \u201cthe circumstance-specific reasonableness inquiry required by <em>Strickland.\u201d (Roe v. Flores-Ortega, supra, </em>528 U.S. at p. 478 [120 S.Ct. at p. 1035]; see also <em>Hill, supra, </em>474 U.S. at pp. 57-58 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 369-370]; <em>U.S. v. Mora-Gomez, supra, </em>875 F.Supp. at p. 1213.) Accordingly, we shall proceed to apply <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>familiar reasonableness standard to the circumstances of the instant case. <em>(Strickland, supra, 466 U.S. </em>at p. 688 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 2064-2065].)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">B. <em>Was trial counsel\u2019s performance objectively reasonable?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">As the Court of Appeal correctly noted, the evidentiary landscape relevant to the competence question before us was created in several superior court proceedings, including those at which petitioner\u2019s guilty plea was entered and accepted, those on petitioner\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, and those following the Court of Appeal\u2019s issuance of an order to show cause in response to petitioner\u2019s first habeas corpus petition, in which the parties stipulated as to how trial counsel would testify. Petitioner\u2019s second habeas corpus petition in the Court of Appeal, the subject of our review, incorporated all the evidence adduced in the prior proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Whether trial counsel performed competently, that is, \u201creasonably] under prevailing professional norms\u201d <em>(Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 688 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2065]), presents a mixed question of fact and law. Such questions are \u201cgenerally subject to independent review as predominantly questions of law\u2014especially so when constitutional rights are implicated\u201d\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>and \u201cinclude the ultimate issue, whether assistance was ineffective, and its components, whether counsel\u2019s performance was inadequate and whether such inadequacy prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 219 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839].)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Where, as here, the superior court has denied habeas corpus relief after an evidentiary hearing (viz., the hearing held on the order to show cause ordered in response to petitioner\u2019s first habeas corpus petition) and a new petition for habeas corpus is thereafter presented to an appellate court based upon the transcript of the evidentiary proceedings conducted in the superior court, \u201cthe appellate court is not bound by the factual determinations [made below] but, rather, independently evaluates the evidence and makes its own factual determinations.\u201d <em>(In re Wright </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 788, 801 [144 Cal.Rptr. 535].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court of Appeal was entitled, as we are now, to undertake \u201can independent review of the record [citation] to determine whether petitioner has established by a preponderance of substantial, credible evidence [citation] that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, if so, that [he] suffered prejudice.\u201d <em>(In re Alvernaz, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 944-945.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">While our review of the record is independent and \u201cwe may reach a different conclusion on an independent examination of the evidence . . . even where the evidence is conflicting\u201d <em>(In re Hitchings </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 97, 109 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 74, 860 P.2d 466]), any factual determinations made below \u201care entitled to great weight . . . when supported by the record, particularly with respect to questions of or depending upon the credibility of witnesses the [superior court] heard and observed.\u201d <em>(In re Wright, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d at p. 801; see also <em>People v. Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 219.) On the other hand, if \u201cour difference of opinion with the lower court ... is not based on the credibility of live testimony, such deference is inappropriate.\u201d <em>(In re Arias </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 667, 695 [230 Cal.Rptr. 505, 725 P.2d 664]; see also <em>In re Hitchings, </em>at p. 109.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Petitioner and amici curiae strenuously urge us to declare that trial counsel\u2019s performance in advising petitioner about his guilty plea was constitutionally deficient simply because counsel failed to investigate the likely immigration consequences. We are not persuaded that the Sixth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>imposes a blanket obligation on defense counsel, when advising pleading defendants, to investigate immigration consequences or research immigration law. In any event, petitioner in this case does not allege a mere failure to investigate, so the question is not squarely presented.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As previously noted, \u201ca court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case . . . .\u201d <em>(Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 690 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2066].)

Indeed, the People conceded below that petitioner told his trial counsel he wanted to protect his permanent residency status.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">We long have recognized that criminal convictions may have \u201cdire consequences\u201d under federal immigration law <em>(People v. Superior Court (Giron), supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 798) and that such consequences are \u201cmaterial matters\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 797) for noncitizen defendants faced with pleading decisions. Thus, even before the Legislature expressly recognized the unfairness inherent in holding noncitizens to pleas they entered without knowing the consequent immigration risks (see \u00a7 1016.5, subd. (d), added by Stats. 1977, eh. 1088, \u00a7 1, p. 3495), we held that justice may require permitting one who pleads guilty \u201cwithout knowledge of or reason to suspect [immigration] consequences\u201d to withdraw the plea. <em>(People v.

Petitioner argues that, even if believed, counsel\u2019s declaration does not <em>necessarily </em>contradict his evidence that, at some point, counsel also told him specifically that a guilty plea would in fact generate no immigration problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The Court of Appeal found counsel\u2019s characterization of his custom and habit \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d The Attorney General contends the Court of Appeal was insufficiently deferential to the trial court\u2019s stated conclusion that counsel\u2019s performance met \u201can objective standard of reasonableness for Defense Counsel in this County.\u201d Although the Court of Appeal was not bound to accept the superior court\u2019s factual findings, those findings were, as previously noted, entitled to \u201c \u2018great weight,\u2019 \u201d particularly where they involved assessment of witness credibility. <em>(People v. Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Having examined the record, we are not able to determine with certainty whether counsel conformed to his purported custom and habit or whether he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>supplemented any customary warning with a more specific, but incorrect, advisement. Ultimately, however, we need not resolve those factual questions. Even assuming that counsel affirmatively misadvised petitioner\u2014and that petitioner thus has satisfied the performance prong of his ineffective assistance claim <em>(Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at pp. 687-688 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 2064-2065])\u2014petitioner to prevail must additionally demonstrate prejudice, and this, we conclude, he has failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">C. <em>Was petitioner prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The test for prejudice that is relevant in light of the preceding is well established.  In <em>Hill, supra, </em>474 U.S. at pages 58-59 [106 S.Ct. at pages 370-371], the United States Supreme Court explained that a defendant who pled guilty demonstrates prejudice caused by counsel\u2019s incompetent performance in advising him to enter the plea by establishing that a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s incompetence, he would not have pled guilty and would have insisted, instead, on proceeding to trial. (Accord, <em>In re Alvernaz, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 933-934; see also <em>People v. Brown </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 537, 554 [223 Cal.Rptr. 66].)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Petitioner specifically avers that, if counsel had informed him he would be deported as a consequence of his guilty pleas, he would not have pled guilty and would have elected to be tried. As he points out, we previously have recognized that a noncitizen defendant with family residing legally in the United States understandably may view immigration consequences as the only ones that could affect his calculations regarding the advisability of pleading guilty to criminal charges. <em>(Zamudio, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at pp. 206-207.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The Attorney General rightly reminds us, however, that petitioner\u2019s assertion he would not have pled guilty if given competent advice \u201cmust be corroborated independently by objective evidence.\u201d <em>(In re Alvernaz, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 938; see also <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Horne </em>(D.C. Cir. 1993) 987 F.2d 833, 836.)  \u201cIn determining whether a defendant, with effective assistance, would have accepted [or rejected a plea] offer, pertinent factors to be considered include: whether counsel actually and accurately communicated the offer to the defendant; the advice, if any, given by counsel; the disparity between the terms of the proposed plea bargain and the probable consequences of proceeding to trial, as viewed at the time of the offer; and whether the defendant indicated he or she was amenable to negotiating a plea bargain.\u201d <em>(In re Alvernaz, </em>at p. 938.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Petitioner has not contended that his counsel inaccurately communicated the People\u2019s plea offer. Nor has he adduced any substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>suggesting the prosecutor might ultimately have agreed to a plea that would have allowed petitioner to avoid adverse immigration consequences. While the prosecution also did not introduce evidence in this regard, the burden remains petitioner\u2019s to prove by a preponderance of the evidence his entitlement to relief. <em>(In re Johnson </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 447, 460 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 878, 957 P.2d 299].) In the end, petitioner pled guilty as charged; no charges were dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Had petitioner proceeded to trial on the drug charges against him, and had the prosecution chosen to seek maximum penalties, petitioner faced a maximum total punishment of five years and four months of incarceration. The plea bargain that petitioner reached with the district attorney burdened him with only 180 days of local incarceration and three years of probation. The choice, moreover, that petitioner would have faced at the time he was considering whether to plead, even had he been properly advised, would <em>not </em>have been between, on the one hand, pleading guilty and being deported and, on the other, going to trial and avoiding deportation. While it is true that by insisting on trial petitioner would for a period have retained a theoretical possibility of evading the conviction that rendered him deportable and excludable, it is equally true that a conviction following trial would have subjected him to the same immigration consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In determining whether or not a defendant who has pled guilty would have insisted on proceeding to trial had he received competent advice, an appellate court also may consider the probable outcome of any trial, to the extent that may be discerned. (Cf. <em>Hill, supra, </em>474 U.S. at p. 59 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 370-371] [probable trial outcome relevant in assessing prejudice from counsel\u2019s failure to discover exculpatory evidence or present affirmative defense]; accord, <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Flores-Ortega, supra, </em>528 U.S. at p. 485 [120 S.Ct. at p. 1039].) Petitioner states that he has consistently maintained his innocence and asserts that the police report shows he has a \u201ctriable case,\u201d but nothing in his declaration or the other evidence he offered indicates how he might have been able to avoid conviction or what specific defenses might have been available to him at trial. Nor did petitioner explain at the hearing on the order to show cause how the evidence might have exonerated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Based upon our examination of the entire record, petitioner fails, ultimately, to persuade us that it is reasonably probable he would have forgone the distinctly favorable outcome he obtained by pleading, and instead insisted on proceeding to trial, had trial counsel not misadvised him about the immigration consequences of pleading guilty. (See <em>Hill, supra, </em>474 U.S. at pp. 58-59 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 370-371]; <em>In re Alvernaz, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 934.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">George, C. J., and Kennard, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">MOSK, J., Concurring and Dissenting.\u2014  I concur fully in the lead opinion\u2019s legal analysis, set out in parts A and B of the lead opinion and the three prefatory paragraphs preceding part A, as far as it goes. (Lead opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 239-253.) I would, however, go farther. I believe Penal Code section 1016.5 imposes an affirmative duty on counsel in any criminal case to inquire of the client: \u201cAre you a United States citizen?\u201d If the answer is negative, counsel must advise the client of the immigration and nationality consequences of a criminal conviction. Failure to do so accurately constitutes a breach of duty under state law given the legislative mandate of section 1016.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">And I strongly disagree with part C, in which the lead opinion concludes petitioner did not suffer prejudice. (Lead opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 253 et seq.) Unquestionably, he has proved by a preponderance of the evidence facts that establish a basis for relief <em>(In re Cudjo </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 673, 687 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 436, 977 P.2d 66]), i.e., he has established a reasonable probability that, but for his lawyer\u2019s omission, he would have gone to trial <em>(Hill v. Lockhart </em>(1985) 474 U.S. 52, 58-59 [106 S.Ct. 366, 370-371, 88 L.Ed.2d 203]; <em>Burket v. Angelone </em>(4th Cir. 2000) 208 F.3d 172, 189).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Subjective and objective reasons plainly establish petitioner\u2019s entitlement to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Turning first to the objective reasons: In recent years, the immigration consequences of criminal convictions have verged on the monstrously cruel in their harshness compared to many of the crimes on which they are imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">Petitioner has been ordered to appear in immigration court for deportation proceedings on grounds of having been convicted of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d (8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).)</p>\n<p id=\"pABR\">\u201cAggravated felony\u201d is a federal term of art that covers a broad variety of crimes, many of them relatively minor. It includes such misdemeanors as trivial batteries (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(F)), possession for sale of a marijuana cigarette (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B)), and theft resulting in a one-year suspended sentence (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G), (48)(B)). All of these, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>if misdemeanors under a state law, are aggravated felonies in federal concept. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The statutes are retroactive (110 Stat. 3009, \u00a7 321(b), p. 3009-628, codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101, foil. (a)(43)(U)), so that an individual, regardless of legal status in and ties to the United States or length of residence here is liable for removal. In recent years, the federal government has sought to deport:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\u2014a 34-year-old born in Germany who came to the United States about age 1, and who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery following a minor struggle in 1990;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">\u2014a lawful permanent resident from Guatemala with two United States citizen children who resisted her husband as he engaged in one of the periodic assaults he had inflicted on her for years;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">\u2014a Canadian who was duped by her boyfriend into selling him some controlled prescription medications.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Among the results of these laws: language classes conducted in the Bristol County, Massachusetts, jail for people about to be deported to Portugal for relatively minor crimes after decades of residence in the United States. (Chevigny, <em>This American Life, </em>episode No. 170, Immigration (WBEZ radio, Chicago, broadcast Oct. 13, 2000).) The more than 400 immigrants removed from Bristol County alone <em>(ibid.) </em>are among the \u201c[tjhousands of immigrants [who] have suffered harsh consequences from the 1996 act[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]: been tom from their families, deported after decades in America, sent to countries where they know no one and do not speak the language. Some had committed serious crimes; others . . . were marked for deportation for trivial offenses committed long ago.\u201d (Lewis, <em>Abroad at Home: Rays of Hope, supra, </em>N.Y. Times.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Under the current state of the law, the immigration court is powerless to do anything except deport petitioner. (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Neither could the state court have intervened at any point, now that judicial recommendations against deportation have been abolished. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leung </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 482, 509 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 290]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Zamudio) </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 183, 206 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 463, 999 P.2d 686].)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Because petitioner\u2019s drug convictions render him inadmissible in the future, he will never be allowed to return to the United States, even to visit his family. (8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 1182(a)(2)(C)(i).)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">If Mexico refuses to accept petitioner, he will enter an American Gulag that few know to exist. The federal government will imprison him indefinitely, as it has imprisoned countless other legally deportable but practically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>undeportable individuals. For example, some 1,750 legatees of the Mariel evacuation from Cuba have languished indefinitely in federal prisons <em>(Rosales-Garcia v. Holland </em>(6th Cir. 2001) 238 F.3d 704, 711) without constitutional remedy, and without being accused of any crime. <em>(Carrera-Valdez </em>v. <em>Perryman </em>(7th Cir. 2000) 211 F.3d 1046, 1048; but see <em>Ma </em>v. <em>Reno </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 208 F.3d 815, 821-822 [such detention barred by statute], cert, granted <em>sub nom. Reno v. Kim Ho Ma </em>(2000) 531 U.S. 924 [121 S.Ct. 297, 148 L.Ed.2d 239], and contra, <em>Rosales-Garcia, </em>at p. 715.) Some linger in prison under the legal fiction, approved in the depths of the McCarthy era, that because they were excludable from the shores of the United States, legally they <em>do not exist </em>here even though they <em>are </em>here, and they may be detained for the rest of their lives. <em>(Shaughnessy v. Mezei </em>(1953) 345 U.S. 206, 215-217 [73 S.Ct. 625, 630-632, 97 L.Ed. 956]; <em>id. </em>at p. 217 [73 S.Ct. at pp. 631-632] (dis. opn. of Black, J.).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One estimate finds some 4,000 immigration detainees floating in the limbo of indefinite imprisonment. (Marrero, <em>Nowhere to Call Home, </em>Jacksonville, Fla., Times-Union (Feb. 20, 2001).)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Those are the objective reasons that support petitioner\u2019s claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Subjective reasons confirm the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim. The undisputed corroborating evidence that he (1) is willing to risk years in state prison to gain a glimmer of a chance of escaping conviction and thereby avoiding deportation, and (2) that he has United States citizen children, establishes a reasonable probability that if he had known he would be deported, permanently banished, and involuntarily separated from his children unless they chose to move to Mexico and abandon the privileges attendant to living in the United States (all consequences of his guilty plea), he would have elected to proceed to trial. If \u201ca defendant\u2019s conclusion that success is remotely possible, if not likely, is sufficient to induce many to go trial\u201d <em>(State v. Van Cleave </em>(Ind. 1996) 674 N.E.2d 1293, 1297), how much more that must be for someone in petitioner\u2019s situation, facing lifetime banishment from his home and family.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Without a doubt, the foregoing evidence meets the <em>Hill </em>burden\u2014i.e., it establishes a reasonable probability that, but for his lawyer\u2019s omission, he would have gone to trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Few with petitioner\u2019s family and cultural ties to the United States would turn down a chance, even a slight chance, of escaping the talons of the federal law. A rational person could conclude that the great likelihood of spending some five years in a California prison, balanced against the slight chance of avoiding permanent banishment to the developing world, is a worthwhile gamble. (See <em>Peart </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla. 2000) 756 So.2d 42, 50, fn. 9 (conc. opn. of Anstead, J.).) Obviously petitioner has so concluded. To deny him his choice is tragic, defying any accurate reading of <em>Hill v. Lockhart, supra, </em>474 U.S. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">I therefore respectfully dissent with respect to part C of the lead opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Section 1016.5(a) provides that \u201c[p]rior to acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to any offense punishable as a crime under state law, except offenses designated as infractions under state law, the court shall administer the following advisement on the record to the defendant: [^] If you are not a citizen, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d Owing to changes made after section 1016.5 was enacted, federal immigration law now generally refers to \u201cremoval from the United States\u201d or simply \u201cremoval\u201d instead of \u201cdeportation.\u201d (See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1228 [\u201cExpedited removal of aliens convicted of committing aggravated felonies\u201d], 1229a [\u201cRemoval proceedings\u201d].)

If we are going to cast a cloud on the validity of hundreds\u2014perhaps thousands\u2014of guilty pleas, we should explain why concerns about immigration entitle a defendant to multiple accurate advisements when the express waiver of constitutional rights is satisfied with one.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">As courts throughout the country have held, incorrect information from counsel does not prejudice a defendant who receives correct information from the court.

The Sixth Amendment is limited by its text: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\u201d The amendment does not cover civil proceedings: \u201cThe protections provided by the Sixth Amendment are explicitly confined to \u2018criminal prosecutions.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number><em>(Austin </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 602, 608 [113 S.Ct. 2801, 2804, 125 L.Ed.2d 488].) Counsel\u2019s performance is thus measured against that of reasonably competent criminal defense counsel, not counsel specializing in civil fields like immigration. <em>(Wiley v. County of San Diego </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 532, 542 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 966 P.2d 983] [defendants entitled to \u201ccounsel acting reasonably \u2018 \u201cwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases\u201d \u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The vast majority of other courts, state and federal, have also concluded there is no Sixth Amendment right to receive advice regarding the immigration consequences of a guilty plea, and the absence of advice cannot constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>(U.S. v. Gonzalez </em>(1st Cir. 2000) 202 F.3d 20, 25; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>George </em>(7th Cir. 1989) 869 F.2d 333, 337-338, and cases cited therein; <em>State v.

We held the trial court could exercise its discretion in deciding whether to allow the defendant to withdraw his plea under those circumstances. We did not deem the absence of such an advisement to be either judicial error or ineffective assistance of counsel. We refused to hold that defendants who plead guilty have a right to information regarding a collateral consequence like deportation. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The Legislature responded to <em>Giron </em>by enacting section 1016.5. In so doing, the Legislature expressed concern \u201cabout the \u2018many instances involving [noncitizen defendants]\u2019 in which \u2018a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is entered without the defendant knowing that a conviction of such offense is grounds for deportation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Zamudio) </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 183, 193 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 463, 999 P.2d 686], quoting \u00a7 1016.5, subd. (d).) \u201c \u2018[T]o promote fairness to such accused individuals,\u2019 \u201d the Legislature mandated a specific warning about possible deportation consequences. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The statute\u2019s history discloses the Legislature considered the advisement not merely a hint to discuss the matter with counsel, but a complete and conclusive provision of the information the defendant needed. Senator Alex Garcia, the author of Senate Bill No. 276, explained, \u201c[T]his bill is primarily designed to assure that lawful aliens ... are made fully aware of the consequences of [their] plea.\u201d (Sen. Garcia, letter to Governor Brown re: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Sen. Bill No. 276 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 14, 1977.) Committee reports similarly explained the bill\u2019s purpose was to \u201cassure that a non-citizen criminal defendant is fully apprised of the consequences [of her plea].\u201d (Assem. Com. on Crim. Justice, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 276 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 25, 1977, p. 1.) There is no evidence the Legislature contemplated this full apprisal could be modified or impeached by counsel\u2019s off-the-record remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The statute would be mere surplusage if it provided defendants with advice that was already constitutionally mandated. The right to notice of the possible collateral consequence of deportation is statutory in origin; the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not entitle a defendant to immigration advice. The lead opinion does not suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\n<em>Any Misadvice from Counsel Was Harmless in Light of the Court\u2019s Correct Advisement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The lead opinion notes a clear consensus nationwide that finds an \u201caffirmative misstatement regarding deportation may constitute ineffective assistance\u201d of counsel. <em>(U.S. v. Mora-Gomez </em>(E.D.Va. 1995) 875 F.Supp. 1208, 1212; see lead opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 251 &amp; fn. 14.) The cases cited are all distinguishable; none involved a judicial advisement similar to the one required by section 1016.5. The defendants in those cases were thus vulnerable to counsel\u2019s misadvice, as Resendiz was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">The section 1016.5 advisement should shield pleas from collateral attack. The Legislature designed the advisement to combat ignorance on the part of pleading defendants; a defendant must have the correct information, but it does not matter from whom he receives it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Quesada </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 525, 536 [281 Cal.Rptr. 426] <em>(Quesada).) </em>The Court of Appeal upheld Quesada\u2019s plea because he received the correct information from counsel, even though the court failed to read the requisite advisement. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 539.) Consistent with the statute\u2019s purpose, Quesada pleaded with awareness of the potential consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">As the <em>Quesada </em>court observed, the critical question is whether the defendant received the correct information. He is not entitled to multiple warnings on the subject. As the on-the-record pronouncements of the court carry more weight than the private remarks of counsel <em>(United States v. Porrino </em>(2d Cir. 1954) 212 F.2d 919, 921), judicial advisement ensures the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>plea is intelligent, notwithstanding contrary guidance from counsel. Although the lead opinion notes the consensus holding that misadvice may constitute ineffective assistance absent judicial advisement, there is an even clearer consensus holding that misadvice, even if it amounts to deficient representation under <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674], is not prejudicial where the court provides the correct advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Most apposite to our review is the decisional authority of Florida, the other state whose large noncitizen population has prompted careful consideration of this issue. Florida courts have concluded that the very purpose of that state\u2019s section 1016.5 analogue is to guarantee defendants receive correct advice regarding deportation, rather than have them depend on their criminal counsel, who may be unfamiliar with immigration law. So long as Florida defendants receive that judicial advisement, counsel\u2019s misadvice cannot render the plea unknowing and invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In <em>State v. Ginebra </em>(Fla. 1987) 511 So.2d 960, the Florida Supreme Court cited <em>Giron, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 793, in concluding a defendant had no right to advice from either the court or counsel concerning immigration consequences, and thus a defendant\u2019s ignorance regarding the possibility of deportation did not invalidate the plea. (Ginebra, at pp. 961-962.) As California forestalled the potential unfairness of <em>Giron </em>by enacting section 1016.5, Florida answered <em>Ginebra </em>by adding subsection (c)(viii) to rule 3.172 of the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure (hereafter subsection (c)(viii)), which requires courts to inform defendants their guilty pleas could lead to deportation. (See <em>In re Amendments to Florida Rules </em>(Fla. 1988) 536 So.2d 992.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The presence or absence of this judicial advisement now determines whether counsel\u2019s misadvice regarding deportation will support vacating a plea. Misadvice may support an ineffective assistance claim when the court fails to advise the defendant. <em>(Dugart </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1991) 578 So.2d 789.) But an adequate court advisement is clearly intended to have a prophylactic effect. \u201cStarting with the cases espousing the principle that there is no right to be informed of the collateral consequences of a guilty plea, which were followed by the 1988 amendment to the Rules of Criminal Procedure instructing judges to advise a defendant that deportation could result if the defendant is not a United States citizen, it is reasonable to conclude that <em>the supreme court intended to avoid the vacating of guilty pleas on the sole ground that the non-citizen defendant may have been misinformed about deportation as a collateral consequence of pleading guilty. Otherwise, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>there was little reason for adopting subsection (c)(viii).\u201d (Bermudez </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1992) 603 So.2d 657, 658, italics added.) Because the court properly advised the defendant, <em>Bermudez </em>denied the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance based on counsel\u2019s alleged misstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Federal courts likewise hold judicial advisements safeguard pleas from collateral attack, because the court\u2019s advice cures any possible harm arising from counsel\u2019s error. There is no federal parallel to section 1016.5 or subsection (c)(viii), but analogous cases have consistently affirmed that defendants do not suffer prejudice from counsel\u2019s misadvice, even if it amounts to deficiency under <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. 668, where the court provides the correct information.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">In <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 23 F.3d 1532, the defendant pleaded guilty, received a sentence of life imprisonment, and subsequently challenged his plea as being the product of counsel\u2019s erroneous advice. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the claim: \u201c[Ejven if Thornton\u2019s attorney and the parties didn\u2019t realize the guidelines allowed a life sentence,\u201d \u201cthe district judge advised him that a life sentence was possible, [citation], thus rendering any advice given by Thornton\u2019s counsel, even if erroneous, non-prejudicial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1533-1534.) Substitute \u201cdeportation\u201d for \u201ca life sentence,\u201d and the instant analysis is the same, except that deportation, while significant, is a collateral consequence, not within the control of the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Other circuits are in accord. In <em>Barker </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(7th Cir. 1993) 7 F.3d 629, the defendant pleaded guilty after allegedly receiving misadvice from counsel about the possible sentence. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals found the trial court\u2019s advice \u201ccured\u201d any possible harm. \u201cIn this case, even if advice from [the] trial attorney had led to [Barker\u2019s] misunderstanding of the consequences of his guilty plea, any such confusion was cured by the trial court [which took] careful and appropriate measures to dispel any confusion on Mr. Barker\u2019s part before the plea was accepted.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 633; see also <em>Worthen </em>v. <em>Meachum </em>(10th Cir. 1988) 842 F.2d 1179, 1184, disapproved on other grounds in <em>Coleman v. Thompson </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 722, 749-751 [111 S.Ct. 2546, 2564-2565, 115 L.Ed.2d 640] [\u201ceven if Worthen\u2019s attorney\u2019s alleged mistaken advice about parole rendered his performance inferior to that reasonably expected of attorneys . . . , Worthen was not prejudiced by advice that the court specifically told him was incorrect\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">The rule is the same even where (1) the defendant alleges counsel informed the defendant the court\u2019s advisement will not apply due to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>defendant\u2019s particular circumstances (rather than being wrong generally); and (2) counsel confirms he provided this misadvice. In <em>Ramos v. Rogers </em>(6th Cir. 1999) 170 F.3d 560, Ramos\u2019s collateral attack on his plea included affidavits from both himself and counsel describing an off-the-record agreement that would have granted Ramos probation after he had served one year in prison. Counsel informed Ramos the deal \u201cwould not be discussed on the record during his plea\u201d and thus \u201c[Ramos should] just answer [the court\u2019s] questions at the plea as if no deals had been made,\u201d and to \u201c \u2018just go along with what the judge asked me.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 562-563.) The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Ramos\u2019s claim, noting \u201cthe state trial court specifically asked Ramos, \u2018Do you understand that [rape] is not a probation-able offense, that you are not going to receive probation under any circumstances?\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 565.) Recalling this express advisement, the Sixth Circuit found no \u201cprejudice when the court specifically informed [Ramos] that his counsel\u2019s advice was incorrect.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Ninth Circuit similarly rejected the claim of a defendant whose attorney allegedly advised him that if he pleaded guilty he would be eligible for parole in seven years, and that the court would announce there was no possibility of parole only for the benefit of the public. <em>(Dennis </em>v. <em>People of State of California </em>(9th Cir. 1969) 414 F.2d 424, 425.) The <em>Dennis </em>court refused to vacate the plea, emphasizing the colloquy in which both counsel and the court described the sentence as being \u201c <em>\u2018without </em>possibility of parole.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 426, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Furthermore, the People need not prevail in a credibility contest to protect the plea from collateral attack; the rule is the same even where the trial and appellate court agree that (1) counsel provided misadvice; and (2) it amounted to \u201cineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>(Warner v. U.S. </em>(6th Cir. 1992) 975 F.2d 1207, 1211 <em>(Warner).)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Trial counsel incorrectly advised Warner, who faced federal and state charges, that the federal district court could impose sentence concurrent to Warner\u2019s state sentence. <em>(Warner, </em>at p. 1211.) The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals found no prejudice, however, because the district court advised Warner, \u201c 1 am not in any way concerned with the State sentence .... I will impose a Federal sentence . . . [and] that Federal sentence will go into effect, but in no way will that be shortened or modified by the State sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Sixth Circuit also rejected Warner\u2019s claim he lied to the court, in denying any off-the-record promises had been made, on the instruction of counsel: \u201cEven if Warner did deny knowledge of a plea agreement in reliance on [counsel\u2019s] mistaken advice, this does not amount to prejudice when the court specifically informed him that . . . advice was incorrect.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1212.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Most tellingly, the federal district court and the circuit court did vacate Warner\u2019s plea to the state charges because the state court never corrected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>counsel\u2019s misadvice. \u201cThese . . . findings are not inconsistent. The federal court advised Warner that there would be no concurrent sentences, the state court did not.\u201d <em>(Warner, supra, </em>975 F.2d at p. 1214.) The presence of correct judicial advice thus distinguishes cases where counsel\u2019s misadvice justifies vacating a plea from those where it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\n<em>Appellate Review of the Instant Claim Requires Only a Quick Review of the Transcript to Ensure the Court Properly Advised Defendant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Appellate review of claims like Resendiz\u2019s may therefore be limited. For a plea to be valid, the record must reveal the defendant was informed he could be deported as a consequence of his plea. On-the-record advisement is necessary\u2014and sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">On-the-record advisement serves a dual purpose; it protects both the defendant and his plea. <em>(Boykin v. Alabama </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 238, 244 [89 S.Ct. 1709, 1712-1713, 23 L.Ed.2d 274] <em>(Boykin); In re Tahl </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 122, 132 [81 Cal.Rptr. 577, 460 P.2d 449].) <em>Boykin </em>prescribed on-the-record advisement of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to guarantee the plea was voluntary and knowing. On the one hand, on-the-record advisement ensured defendants did not plead guilty out of ignorance. On the other, \u201c[w]hen the judge discharges that function, he leaves a record adequate for any review that may be later sought. . . and <em>forestalls the spin-off of collateral proceedings that seek to probe murky </em>memories.\u201d <em>(Boykin, </em>at p. 244 [89 S.Ct. at pp. 1712-1713], fns. omitted, italics added.) <em>Boykin </em>advised courts to examine defendants to ensure they understand the nature of the charges, the constitutional rights being waived, and the permissible range of sentences, \u201c \u2018[i]f these convictions are to be insulated from attack.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 244, fn. 7 [89 S.Ct. at p. 1713], quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rundle </em>(1968) 428 Pa. 102 [237 A.2d 196, 197-198].)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Determining the knowing nature of a plea is a \u201csimple [] task.\u201d <em>(People v. Allen </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 424, 442 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 682, 981 P.2d 525].) Because on-the-record advisement is both necessary and sufficient, our evaluation of <em>Boykin-Tahl </em>challenges is minimal. \u201c[T]he record of the hearing . . . should clearly demonstrate the defendant was told of his rights and that he affirmatively waived them. . . . [A] quick review of the transcript of the sentencing hearing may be all that is necessary.\u201d <em>(Allen, </em>at p. 442.) Only in those \u201cunusual cases\u201d where no advisement precedes the plea will further investigation be necessary. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Review of section 1016.5 claims should be no broader in scope. The statutory preference for defendants to understand the possible collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>consequences of their pleas does not warrant more zealous protection than the constitutional imperative that defendants understand their constitutional rights and the direct consequences of their pleas. <em>(People v. Ramirez </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 519, 522 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 882].) The record reflects Resendiz received correct advice regarding deportation; no further review is warranted. (Cf. <em>People v. Allen, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Defendant, who was advised by the court he could be deported and confirmed he understood this possibility, now seeks to withdraw his plea based on his not knowing he could be deported. To credit his claim rewards disregard for the court and creates an incentive for mendacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Defendant\u2019s claim must fail because the court provided him with all the information to which he was entitled, and all the information the Legislature has deemed necessary for an intelligent plea. The judicial advisement places a defendant on notice. He may, depending on the importance he attaches to the potential consequence, seek additional time, clarification and expert advice. But if his understanding is contrary to the court\u2019s warning, \u201cit [is] imperative that [defendant] not stand mute during the plea colloquy.\u201d <em>(Resta </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1997) 698 So.2d 378, 379.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The lead opinion encourages \u201cprobfing] murky memories,\u201d contrary to <em>Boykin (supra, </em>395 U.S. at p. 244 [89 S.Ct. at p. 1713]). Memories are likely to be especially murky in cases like this one, where counsel may well be tom between protecting himself from an ineffectiveness finding and protecting a client from conviction and deportation. Even if not every collateral attack is successful, searching beyond the transcript and taking testimony from all involved parties will significantly strain judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">By enacting section 1016.5, the Legislature responded appropriately and effectively to the potential for unfairness to noncitizen defendants. The law was the first of its kind and has served as a national model.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Today\u2019s opinion signals to criminal defendants that the court\u2019s advice is wasted breath; defendants may safely ignore the pronouncement of the court, accept the benefit of the bargain, and plead ignorance years after the fact. Nothing is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>created by the lead opinion except confusion. I therefore concur in the disposition only.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Baxter, J., and Chin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Petitioner\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied June 13, 2001.
