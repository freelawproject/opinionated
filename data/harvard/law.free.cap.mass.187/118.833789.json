Writ dated February 27, 1902.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">At the trial in the Superior Court before <em>Mason, </em>C. J., the plaintiff testified that she entered the Scollay Square station of the defendant for south bound trains about five o\u2019clock in the afternoon on February 8, 1902 ; that she boarded the front platform of the last car of the train, and took a step or two in that car before she discovered that it was the smoking ear ; that she then turned and started across to the next car ahead, and while crossing between the cars her left leg went down into the space between the cars to her knee, and she fell, receiving the injuries alleged ; that there were several persons ahead of her and she did not see the space; that she saw no guard or other employee of the defendant on either of the car platforms before she fell, and that the train was standing at the station on a curve which made the space between the cars wider than when the cars were on a straight part of the track. There was no other testimony as to the width of the space between the cars. On cross-examination, the plaintiff testified that she did not look down to see how great a space there was between the cars as she was crossing. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony was corroborated by that of her daughter who was with her at the time of the accident, and there was no other testimony on the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the judge ruled that upon this evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and ordered a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A2Y\"><em>W. Burns, W. W. Clarke &amp; J. F.
