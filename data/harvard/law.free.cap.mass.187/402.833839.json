Roberts died on November 29, 1898, and the plaintiff was appointed executrix under his will. On the night of June 4, 1902, without fault on the part of either the plaintiff or the defendant, the ice houses, four in number, were destroyed completely by fire. They were not insured. After the fire the defendant made no use of the property described in the lease or contract, except to drive teams over the court adjoining the ice houses to a factory owned by the defendant, and this use of the court was not under the instrument sued upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-7\">The case was argued at the bar in November, 1904, before Knowlton, C.

If it was a lease, the ice houses were the property of the defendant for the term ending December 15, 1902, and the loss caused by their being burned to the ground is the defendant\u2019s loss for the unexpired part of that term a portion of a year. If on the other hand the defendant under the instrument here in question was as matter of contract to have the use of the ice houses as a licensee under the plaintiff, the plaintiff was the owner of them at the time of the fire, and the loss falls on her. Furthermore in that case the plaintiff has not furnished that for which by the terms of the contract she was to be paid, namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the use of her ice houses, and the sum stipulated for is not due. So much is settled by <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Calnan, </em>107 Mass. 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\">The question presented by this case therefore, is the question of the construction of this instrument originally made by Roberts on January 29, 1898, and extended by the plaintiff, his widow, on January 27, 1902. By it as originally drawn, Roberts \u201c does let to said Ice Company his ice business and privileges in . . . Lynn, at Flax Pond, with the use and benefit of his ice houses, . . . for the term ending December 15, 1898.\u201d The extension of this instrument here in question was dated January 27,1902 ; the term was extended to December 15, 1902; and it is found by the presiding judge that \u201c After the agreement of January 27, 1902, was executed, the defendant corporation by its servants and agents took possession of the ice houses and machinery and began to cut ice and filled the ice houses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">There is nothing in the defendant\u2019s contention that these ice houses are personal property. It is true that they are of such a construction that had they been put up by some one other than the owner under an agreement to that effect, they would have been personalty See <em>Antoni </em>v. Belknap, 102 Mass. 198; <em>Handforth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>150 Mass. 149. But being put on the land by the owner of it in fee they became a part of the realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The question whether an agreement as to the use of real estate is a lease of it or is a contract by which the owner enters into an agreement to give to the other party to the contract the use of it as a licensee under him, generally has arisen, in this Commonwealth, in case of contracts as to the use of specified rooms which are part of a building. That is to say, the question in those cases has been whether the other party to the contract was a lodger or a tenant. The question there and in the case now before us is decided by determining whether as matter of construction, the contract gave the other party exclusive possession of the premises against the world including the owner, or gave him a license to occupy under the owner, in which case the rights of the other party rest in contract. See on the one hand <em>Swain </em>v. <em>Mizner, </em>8 Gray, 182; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>104 Mass. <em>95; Porter </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>124 Mass. 534; <em>Fiske </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>Manuf. Co. </em>14 Pick. 491; and on the other hand, <em>White </em>v. <em>May</em>nard, 111 Mass. 250; <em>Central Mills </em>v. Hart, 124 Mass. 123; <em>Hamblett </em>v. Bennett, 6 Allen, 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The character .of the instrument in the case at bar would hardly have been questioned had the thing let been the ice houses in place of \u201c the use and benefit \u201d of them. And although the word \u201c use\u201d is ordinarily employed when the owner contracts to give another person under him a right to occupy as a licensee, yet the words here are not \u201cthe use of\u201d but \u201cthe use and benefit of \u201d the ice houses, and the defendant took exclusive possession of them under the lease. The words \u201c use and benefit \u201d are words of wide application, and mean the entire beneficial interest in the property in question. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>4 Allen, 566; <em>Paine </em>v. <em>Forsaith, </em>86 Maine, 357; <em>Lawe </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>39 Wis. 345; <em>Heaston </em>v. <em>Board of Commissioners, </em>20 Ind. 398, 403. It is conceded in the case at bar, for example, that the plaintiff took a life interest at least in the real estate of her husband under a devise to her of all the residue of his estate \u201c for her use and benefit during her life,\u201d and it would have to be conceded that the remainder vested in fee in the grandson under a devise to him after her death \u201c for his use and benefit.\u201d And see <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Shattuck, </em>173 Mass. 486. In <em>M\u2019Cullough\u2019s appeal, </em>4 Yeates, 23, it was held that a devise to a wife of \u201c the benefits of all my real estate \u201d was a devise of the real estate. The conclusion was reached on the ground that a devise of <em>\u201c </em>the benefits \u201d of real estate was equivalent to a devise of the profits of real estate, and it is settled that such a devise is a devise of the land. Co. Litt. 4 b. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Plummer, </em>1 Cro. Eliz. 190. <em>Stile </em>v. <em>Tomson, </em>Dyer, 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">A majority of the court are of opinion that the instrument in question gave the defendant exclusive possession of the ice houses and of the land under them at least, that it was a lease of this real estate and not a contract for the use of it as a licensee under the plaintiff; and therefore the case comes within <em>Fowler </em>v. Glover, 4 Dane Abr. <em>383; S. C. nom. Fowler </em>v. <em>Bott, </em>6 Mass. <em>63; Bigelow </em>v. <em>Collamore, </em>5 Cush. 226, <em>231; Kramer </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>7 Gray, 550; <em>Leavitt v. Fletcher, </em>10 Allen, 119, 121; <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Calnan, </em>107 Mass. 514, 518. Since the defendant had an estate in the land under the ice houses at least, the case does not come within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number><em>Stockwell </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>11 Met. 448, and <em>Shawmut National Bank </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>118 Mass. 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\">The only other contention made by the defendant is that whether this was such a contract or a lease is a question of fact, and so not open for review here. There is nothing in that. The question is the question of the construction of this agreement and that is a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff on the first count for $1,525, with interest, less $21.51 found to he due in set-off.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
