No executor was named in the will, and administrators with the will annexed were appointed. <em>Held, </em>that the will disposed of the proceeds of the testator\u2019s real estate as well as of his personal property, and that the legal title to the real estate vested in the five children of the testator, subject to a power coupled with a trust in the administrators with the will annexed, to sell the property to pay debts and legacies, and then to pay the net proceeds four fifths to the trustee for the testator\u2019s four daughters and one fifth to the testator\u2019s son.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-5\">Petition, filed March 14, 1904, for the registration of the title to a tract of land on the corner of State Street and Broad Street in Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-6\">In the Land Court the case was heard by Davis, J., who found title in the petitioners proper for registration, but, before a decree in accordance with such finding could issue, one of the petitioners, Frederick W.

On inspection of the probate records notice of the motion for substitution was ordered upon the trustee under the will and the administrators with the will annexed, who appeared and answered.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-8\">At the hearing upon this motion the case was submitted on the record title and agreed facts. The judge found as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-9\">Frederick W. G. May died at Boston on May 28, 1904, seised of an undivided one fifth part of the real estate in question, leaving a will, and as his only heirs at law the petitioners \"for substitution. The will was proved \u00f3n June 80,1904, and Eleanor G. May and Frank Brewster were duly appointed and qualified as administrators of the estate of Frederick, with the will an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>nexed. On September* 29, 1904, Mr. Brewster was appointed and qualified as trustee under the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">Frederick W. G. May was eighty-three years of age at the date of his death, and his will, dated August 24,1900, was in his own handwriting and was drawn by him without the aid of counsel. He died seised of sundry parcels of real estate. The estate for which registration of title was sought, of which he owned an undivided fifth part, was income producing and free from mortgage. The other parcels of land owned by him were not in a condition to produce income sufficient to meet the charges thereon, and some of them were subject to mortgages. The total value of the testator\u2019s real estate over and above mortgages, which in the aggregate amounted to $58,000, was not less than $75,000. He died' possessed also of personal estate of not less than $75,000 in value, consisting of stocks, bonds, mortgages and other securities, including the two policies of life insurance referred to in his will. The personal estate was considerably more than sufficient to pay all- legacies and known debts, including the mortgages on his real estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\">The petitioners for substitution requested the judge to rule, as matter of law, that the interest of Frederick W. G. May in the real estate, on his death, vested in them in fee simple. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-7\">The respondent Brewster, trustee, requested the judge to rule that on the death of Frederick <em>W. </em>G. May his interest in the real estate vested in Mr. Brewster as trustee for the daughters of the testator, and in Frederick G. May, son of the testator, as devisees under the will in fee, four fifths thereof in the trustee and one fifth in Frederick G. May.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-8\">The administrators requested the judge to rule that the interest of Frederick W. G. May vested at his death in the devisees under his will, one fifth in Frederick G. May and four fifths in the trustee, subject, however, to a power of sale in his administrators, for the conversion of his property into money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-9\">The judge refused to make any of the rulings as requested, but ruled instead that the interest of Frederick W. G. May vested at his death in his heirs, the petitioners for substitution, subject, however, to a power of sale in the administrators for the purpose of conversion under the terms of the will, and to any statutory lien for the payment of debts or charges of the estate within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the time allowed by law. He ordered a decree for registration of title in the original petitioners other than Frederick W. G. May, and in the present petitioners for substitution, as to his undivided interest, subject as to the latter to the power of sale and statutory lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-5\">To the refusals to rule and to the ruling given, all of the parties excepted, and, at the request of the parties, the judge reported the case for determination by this court. If the rulings and refusals to rule were right, a final decree was to issue as ordered; otherwise, such final decree was to be made as this court might direct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-6\">The will of Frederick W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5HT\">This is a report from one of the judges of the Land Court upon a petition for the registration of a title. The question arises upon a petition for substitution, suggesting the death of F. W. G. May, one of the original petitioners, and asking to be admitted as successors to his title. He left a will in his own handwriting, which was made by him without the aid of counsel. Our decision depends upon the meaning of this will.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The principal question, to which all others are subordinate, is whether he intended to have the will take effect upon his real estate, or only upon his personal property. He mentions no particular real estate, nor any particular personal property except his policies of life insurance, which he refers to as his only immediate assets of any considerable amount. He says, \u201c I direct my executors to proceed with moderation and patience but with due diligence to the winding up of my estate, wch largely consisting of real estate which is in my opinion of considerable value but more or less encumbered.\u201d The term \u201c winding up \u201d implies a disposition of the estate which will turn it into money. He follows the direction with this provision : \u201c Then after the payment of debts and the legacies above named I direct the division of the. net proceeds into parts, one for each of my children as follows,\u201d etc. The term \u201c net proceeds\u201d refers to the money which will come from the sale of the property. The will nowhere refers to any distinction between real and personal property. The estate which is to be wound up, under the direction first quoted, is immedi\u00e1tely referred to as \u201clargely consisting of real estate.\u201d This is an express statement that the real estate is to be wound up, as well as the personal. Then the statement in regard to its value and the incumbrances upon it, and the suggestion that the executors shall proceed with moderation and patience, but with diligence, strongly imply that he was considering the real estate as a part of the property with which the executors were to deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">If we look at the final disposition of the property, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>confirmed in this view. The net proceeds are to be divided equally among his children, and the shares of his four daughters are to be put in the hands of a trustee for investment, and to secure them from the interference of husbands, and \u201cfrom all anticipatory action.\u201d If the will was held to include personal property alone, there would be little, if anything, left for division and for the operation of this trust, after the payment of debts and legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">There is a presumption against an intended intestacy, and it is not to be supposed that an old man owning real estate worth more than $130,000, and having personal estate amounting to only a little more than enough to pay his debts and legacies, would make a will which should have no reference to the real estate. Taking all the provisions of this instrument together, we have little doubt that the testator intended to have the real estate sold, and the proceeds divided in the settlement of his estate in the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Where such an intention is plainly discoverable in a will, it gives to the executors a power of sale, without an express statement to that effect. <em>Going </em>v. Emery, 16 Pick. 107. <em>Chandler </em>v. Rider, 102 Mass. 268. <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Story, </em>132 Mass. 205, 212. This is a power coupled with a trust, and not a mere naked power. <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Rider, </em>102 Mass. 268, 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">In the present case the direction already referred to is to executors, and in another part of the will there is a reference to the executrix. But no executor was appointed, and the estate is being settled by administrators with the will annexed. A power of this kind, given to executors, is attached to the office and not to the persons. It therefore goes to administrators with the will annexed. <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Rider, ubi supra. Black </em>v. <em>Dexter, </em>12 Cush. 559, 568, 569, 571. <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Story, </em>132 Mass. 205, 212. We hold, therefore, that the administrators in this case have a power under the will, coupled with a trust, to dispose of this real estate and turn it into money.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Under the decisions in <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>110 Mass. 232, and <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Coughlan, </em>148 Mass. 30, it may be that, for some purposes, this real estate was constructively converted into personal property, as of the time of the death of the testator. In fact it remained in the form of real estate, and for the purposes of this case it must be dealt with as real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>The trust in Mr. Brewster* to receive and hold for the four daughters the money paid over by the administrators with the will annexed, does not affect the legal title to the real estate before it is disposed of. His first duty as trustee is to take the money when it is ready to be paid over. We are of opinion that this title is in the five children of the testator, subject to a power in the administrators with the will annexed, coupled with a trust, to sell the property, pay debts and legacies, and then divide the net proceeds between the testator\u2019s son and the trustee for his four daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\n<em>Decree accordingly..</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
