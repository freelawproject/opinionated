Slade and Leonard N. Slade, copartners under the name of John P. Slade and Son, which second mortgage was discharged on or about March 1,1900; that Joseph Fournier died testate on May 24,1901, and devised all of the premises to his wife, the defendant Deiphine Fournier, for her life, with remainders over in certain portions thereof, described in part in his will by metes and bounds, to the defendants, Elzear Fournier, Achille Fournier, Angelina Bourget, Amedee Fournier, Albert Fournier, Leda Hebert and Nelson Fournier; and that the defendants or their privies in title were in possession of the premises from January 14, 1893, to the time of the filing of the bill, and received the rents and profits thereof; praying, 1, that the foreclosure sale might be set aside and that any conveyances made under and by virtue of it might be decreed to be void, and that the defendants might be ordered to make such deeds and conveyances as might be necessary to restore the title to the premises to the same situation as it was before the sale; 2, for an accounting for the rents, profits and necessary expenditures of or on account of the premises from July 30, 1887; and 3, that the plaintiffs might be allowed to redeem the premises upon payment of the amount which might be found due upon a just and true accounting, which amount the plaintiffs offered to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\">The defendants demurred ; and the plaintiffs on January 14, 1904, filed by leave of court an amendment to their bill, a portion of which is quoted in the second paragraph of the opinion of the court, and which concluded with the following paragraph referred to in the third paragraph of the opinion : \u201c 15. The plaintiffs have from 1895 to December 1901 been delayed in bringing this action by reason of certain documentary evidence therein being beyond their control, said evidence being in the hands of one of said attorneys who refused without cause to surrender the same but put the plaintiffs off from time to time with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>assurance that he would try their said cause.\u201d The defendants demurred to the amended bill, alleging as causes of demurrer want of equity and laches. The Superior Court made a decree sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill. The plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-5\"><em>A. G.

It is not pretended that the mortgagor or her heirs, the present plaintiffs, were ignorant of the fact that the mortgage had been foreclosed. It appears that more than ten years have elapsed since the date of the later foreclosure. That convicts the plaintiffs and their ancestor of laches. <em>Learned </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>117 Mass. 865. <em>Fennyery </em>v. <em>Ransom, </em>170 Mass. 303. See also <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Sawin, </em>143 Mass. 144. Where laches appears on the face of the bill, the defence can be set up by demurrer. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Boston Blank Book Manuf. Co. </em>153 Mass. 456, 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">This defect has not been cured by the amendment. To escape from the imputation of laches it was incumbent on the plaintiffs to allege such facts as showed an excuse. The allegation here does not go far enough. It is: \u201cThe plaintiffs have heen delayed in the bringing of this action by the negligence and misconduct of certain attorneys whom they have employed to protect their interests therein, but who have either done nothing or have so unskilfully managed the said action that the plaintiffs have wholly failed to secure the relief to which they are and were entitled; said attorneys being at no time able to respond in damages for their said negligence and misconduct.\u201d Such an allegation is too general a one to put the defendants to the burden of a trial. The plaintiffs may have been delated without being excused from bringing this suit. The allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>here is like a general allegation of fraud, which it is well settled is not enough to put on a defendant the burden of going to a trial. As to this, see <em>Nye </em>v. Storer, 168 Mass. 53, where the demurrer was a general demurrer; <em>Wallingford </em>v. <em>Mutual Society, </em>5 App. Cas. 685. See also <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>139 Mass. 146; <em>Garst </em>v. <em>Hall &amp; Lyon Co. </em>179 Mass. 588; <em>Fogg </em>v. <em>Blair, </em>139 U. S. 118; <em>Van Weel </em>v. <em>Winston, </em>115 U. S. 228; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Atherton, </em>102 U. S. 372, 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The allegations in the fifteenth paragraph also are open not only to this objection but to the further objection that they do not cover three years and four months of the ten years or of the twelve years, as one or the other method of foreclosure is taken to be under attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">It is not necessary in this case to consider the cases relied on by the plaintiffs, <em>Denton </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>6 Johns. 296, <em>Dinwiddie </em>v. <em>Self, </em>145 Ill. 290, <em>Whitridge </em>v. <em>Whitridge, </em>76 Md. 54, <em>Boing </em>v. <em>Raleigh &amp; Gaston Railroad, </em>88 N. C. 62, or those relied on by the defendants, <em>Ayres </em>v. Morehead, 77 Va. 586, <em>Callaway </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>8 Leigh, 114, <em>Ives </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>119 U. S. 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
