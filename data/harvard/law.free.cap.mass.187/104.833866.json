I have decided to help him in purchasing goods of you, he says, he can buy of you on sixty days. If so, I will guarantee the payment of goods he may buy of you, not to exceed $300, on terms as above.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that, considering the circumstances under .which it was given and in the light of the correspondence, this was not a continuing guaranty, but was confined to the first sale of goods by the plaintiff to S. or to the first sales amounting to $300.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-13\">Contract on a guaranty in writing, by which it was alleged that the defendant agreed to guarantee the payment on demand after sixty days of all sums of money due to the plaintiff from one Joseph Sherin for goods purchased of the plaintiff up to the amount of $300.

Will say I am very much surprised that you should ask me to guarantee any purchases that Mr. J. Sherin might make from you, <em>not </em>because I do not think him good, for I think him a good, straight, honest man, and one that will pay all of his bills. I have known him for several years and have yet to learn of anyone having lost by him in any way. Mr. Sherin has been in my store for four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>months, has paid his rent prompt. The store he occupied before moving in to my store for one year rent was paid promptly. If I was selling goods I should not hesitate in giving him Cr. for I consider him an honest and fair dealing man. But at my time of life I do not propose to be responsible for goods bought by any one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-3\">\u201cYours truly, John Flint.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-4\">\u201cProvidence, R.

It is no wonder you were surprised at this request unless you had made a previous agreement with Mr. Sherin; this we understood him to say you had done, so for this reason we wrote for the request, he distinctly telling us to hold the goods which he might select until we received the guarantee. We beg pardon for any trouble we have caused you and remain,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\">\u201cYours very truly, Callender, McAuslan <em>&amp; </em>Troup Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-7\">\u201c Webster, Mass., January 31st, 1902.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-8\">\u201c Callender, McAuslan &amp; Troup Co.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-9\">\u201c Gents: after talking with Mr. Joseph Sherin I have decided to help him in purchasing goods of you, he says, he can buy of you on (60) sixty days.

It was agreed, that no part of this sum could be recovered unless the guaranty was a continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>one ; that the first bill for goods was about $197, that goods to a much larger amount than $800 in the aggregate were bought by Sherin from the plaintiff after the giving of the guaranty, and that Sherin had paid the plaintiff as much as $300 for goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-3\">The case was submitted on briefs at the sitting of the court in October, 1904, and afterwards was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-4\"><em>C.

And as the agreed statement of facts contains no reference to the common law of Rhode Island the presumption follows that in the case presented it is the same as our own. <em>Hazen </em>v. Mathews, 184 Mass. 388, 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The question to be decided is whether the contract was a continuing guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">If there is no ambiguity in the agreement itself, the answer must be found from the terms of the instrument alone, but as the language used is open to more than one construction, resort may be had to extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the parties. <em>Bent </em>v. Hartshorn, 1 Met. 24. <em>Sullivan </em>v. Arcand, 165 Mass. 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">It appears that Joseph Sherin, the debtor, desiring to buy goods on credit from the plaintiff, and it not being willing to open an account with him, at his suggestion the plaintiff wrote a letter to the defendant asking him if he would become responsible for the amount of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">There is no evidence that before this time the defendant had been requested by Sherin to become a guarantor, and the letter must be considered as the first intimation or request made to him that he should so act.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The language of the letter thus becomes important as expressing the nature of the pending transaction with Sherin which the defendant was asked to guarantee. It shows that the' purchase intended is limited to goods bought on the day of its date, and. though the phrase \u201c you would guarantee any purchase he might make from us \u201d is used, it is a part of the sentence which states the proposed sale and refers to it. And when the defendant had answered declining to become responsible, the reply of the plaintiff in explanation of its request, and referring to the contract of the debtor, contained this significant language, \u201c he distinctly telling us to hold the goods which he might select until we received the guarantee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\">If it was the purpose of the plaintiff to give Sherin a general credit for the sale of goods in the future for the payment of which the defendant should be bound, its letter contained no such statement, though it was written at a time when the proposed course of business between it and the debtor had been considered, and credit' had been asked for by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Obviously, when the guaranty was given, the defendant well might have understood that the debtor had contracted for specific goods on credit, and the plaintiff was unwilling to complete the sale by delivery until security for their payment had been given; and with this understanding he agreed to be liable for this transaction, but did not intend to become bound for succeeding purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">While it might be said that the plaintiff and Sherin really intended that the defendant should become responsible for a course of continuous dealing, and the language of the defendant\u2019s engagement might be found open to such a construction, yet looking at the conditions under, which it was given, it is more consistent with a construction that all the defendant intended was to aid him in a single purchase of goods from the plaintiff, and as this was followed by payment the guaranty was fully satisfied. See <em>Boston &amp; Sandwich Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>119 Mass. 435; <em>Cutler </em>v. <em>Ballou, </em>136 Mass. 337; <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Mulloy, </em>174 Mass. 41, 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">This was the finding of the Superior Court, and as no error of law appears the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
