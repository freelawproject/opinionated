Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated August 13, 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-14\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Aiken, </em>J., without a jury. The plaintiff to establish a portion of the items charged in his account introduced original memoranda signed by the defendant, and to establish other items, being charges for liquors and cigars, offered in evidence a book alleged to have been kept in the usual course of the plaintiff\u2019s business, the entries in which were made in the manner described in the opinion. The judge admitted the book entries against the defendant\u2019s objection. The judge found for the plaintiff in the sum of $168.90; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b585-15\"><em>J. H.

This book was kept by a clerk in the office of the hotel, who had no personal knowledge of the items of goods sold by the cigar department and the bar department of the plaintiff\u2019s hotel, and whose only knowledge was derived from slips sent to his office from these departments by a bell boy. The original slips were not produced, and neither of the employees who had charge of the bar or the cigar department was called to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Under these circumstances we are of opinion that the judge erred in admitting the book in evidence. This was decided in <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Garvin, </em>1 Gray, 148, and the rule there laid down has been recognized ever since to be the law. <em>Harwood </em>v. <em>Mulry, </em>8 Gray, 250, 252. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Shay, </em>145 Mass. 162. <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Boston Maine Railroad, </em>158 Mass. 450, 453. The books of a bank stand on a different footing. <em>Produce Exchange Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bieberbach, </em>176 Mass. 577, 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
