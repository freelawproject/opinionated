Writ dated November 21, 1902.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>At the trial in the Superior Court before <em>Wait, </em>J. the plaintiff testified that he was a rubber boot maker, and had worked for the defendant at its factory for about fifteen months before the accident; that on the morning of September 11, 1902, at ten minutes before eight o\u2019clock, he was walking from his bench in the factory to a chute, carrying in his arms eleven pairs of men\u2019s rubber boots weighing between fifty and sixty pounds, it being his duty each morning to take from his bench the boots upon which he had worked the previous day and carry them to this chute by which they were conducted to lower floors of the factory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\">Upon the morning in question the plaintiff was carrying the boots over the usual and shortest route from his bench. He had crossed the main aisle and had entered the passageway where on his way to the chute there were two barrel shaped tanks containing rubber cement. He had taken one step on this passageway, bringing him near the first of the two cement tanks, when he slipped and fell, breaking his leg and suffering the injuries sued for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-6\">The plaintiff testified further that he noticed after his fall that the place on the floor where he slipped was covered with thin rubber cement for a space of about three feet square; that rubber cement is used by arctic makers and is made of naphtha, rubber and litharge, and when placed upon a floor or smooth surface is very slippery; that there was another way to go but that he had almost invariably since entering this shop fifteen months previous to the accident gone over this same route with his boots, and that he almost always had seen a man, whose name he did not know and whom he took to be an Armenian, engaged at work about the cement tanks, cleaning them, drawing cement and cleaning the floor of the passageway; that the Armenian was not near the tanks at the time of the accident, and that no one was near the tanks or in the passageway; that the light was good, the place where he fell being ten or twelve feet from the windows, and that the arctic makers always got their cement in the morning from half past six to half past seven o\u2019clock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-7\">The foreman in charge of this department of the factory, called as a witness by the plaintiff, testified that it was the duty of the Armenian under orders received from him to keep the cement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>tanks clean and also the floors near the tanks clean and free from cement, and that he had directed this Armenian to remain by this tank every morning from half past six until eight o\u2019clock. The same witness was asked by the plaintiff \u201c What, if any, appliances were furnished this man with which to keep the floors from becoming slippery?\u201d This question was objected to by the defendant, and was excluded by the judge, the plaintiff excepting. It was the purpose of the plaintiff, in asking this question, to show that sand and burlap were furnished to this employee to be used upon the floors to keep them from becoming slippery by reason of cement getting upon them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-3\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the judge ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-4\"><em>H. H. Folsom, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-5\"><em>J. A.

If the condition of the floor was due to the negligence of any one, it was that of a fellow servant of the plaintiff, for whose acts the defendant is not liable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The evidence offered and excluded was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
