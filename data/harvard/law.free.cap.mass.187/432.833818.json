Writ dated February 17, 1900.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-11\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>G-askill, </em>J. The following statement of the case is taken from the opinion of the court :</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-12\">The plaintiff in this action was engaged by the defendants to work as a plasterer on a building which they had under construction. He was hired at half past eleven on the morning of the day of the accident, and immediately upon being employed was ordered to go upon a staging which was then in position. The staging was some six or seven feet above the level of the floor below and over a long hole, running the length of the building, left in the floor to give light. The staging consisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>of planks, which seem to have been laid on the main staging at one end (there was some conflict on this point but it is not material) and at the other end rested on a ledger board nailed at one end to the side of the building and at the other end to an upright on the other side of the hole in the floor. This ledger board was five or six feet long, six inches wide and one inch thick. After the plaintiff had worked on this staging about an hour and a half the ledger board broke, and the plaintiff was thrown through the hole in the floor upon a pile of bricks and rubbish in the basement, suffering the injuries here complained of.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\">It appeared from the plaintiff\u2019s evidence that this staging had been built by employees of the defendants, and had been used for some two weeks before the accident by carpenters and lathers. On the morning of the day of the accident all the planks which previously had rested on this ledger board were taken away. . The preparation of the stagings for the plasterers was left to one Lane and one Silva, both plasterers in the employ of the defendants. On the morning in question Silva was about to knock down the ledger board with a view to covering the hole in the floor with boards and to placing on these boards horses on which he intended to lay one end of the planks which were to constitute the staging for the plasterers, when he was stopped by one Beady or Beattie. Beady (for convenience be will be called Beady although he was called by both names by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses) could have been found to be a superintendent in charge of the whole work of construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-6\">Lane testified that Beady \u201ctold Mr. Silva he didn\u2019t think it was necessary to knock it down. He said other men had worked on it, and he didn\u2019t see why it wasn\u2019t good enough for us; if it was taken down, it would cause us considerable trouble to floor the place over and rig it with our staging.\u201d Silva testified that Beady said: \u201c You cannot take that down (meaning the ledger board). I want to use it. My men have worked on it; the lathers have worked on it; why isn\u2019t it fit for one or two plasterers to work on it ? \u201d Silva further testified that the reason he did not take down the ledger board was this order of Beady\u2019s. It appeared that Lane and Silva then placed planks, as already stated, resting at one end on the main staging and at the other end on the ledger board. Silva further testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>fied that he examined the ledger board after the accident and found a knot in it about an inch and a half square; that the ledger board \u201c broke right on the knot \u201d ; and that \u201c The knot was the cause of the ledger to break.\u201d This was the last answer of Silva on his direct examination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-5\">On this evidence the presiding judge directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendants, and the case is here on an exception to that ruling. The certificate of the presiding judge allowing the bill of exceptions is in these words: \u201c Allowed, subject to following statement: The answer contained in last sentence of witness Silva\u2019s direct examination was not called to my attention at the time of trial, or before I ordered verdict, and not until the allowance of exceptions. If it had been called to my attention at the time of trial, I should have excluded it as not responsive and not competent, the witness not being an expert.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-6\"><em>S. A. </em>Fuller, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-7\"><em>J. Lowell &amp; J. A. </em>Lowell, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b458-8\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtD\">[After the foregoing statement of the case.] We are of opinion that this exception must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">An employer can leave to his employees the erection of stagings which are used temporarily in the course of work. If he elects to do so and furnishes them with proper materials, and is not negligent in the selection of his employees, he is not liable. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>184 Mass. 354. But in the case at bar Beady, who could be found to be a superintendent, interfered and directed the employees to use the ledger board, without inspecting it to see if it was safe. This could be found to have been an act of superintendence and so within <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, ante, </em>18, and not within <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Wellington, </em>163 Mass. 364, and <em>Whittaker </em>v. <em>Bent, </em>167 Mass. 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">If the act could have been found to be a negligent act the defendants are liable. To direct an employee to use a ledger board which is in fact obviously defective and unfit, without inspecting it or having it inspected to see if it is fit, is as much an act of negligence as to inspect it without discovering the defect. What raises a doubt in the ease at bar is that the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified that the ledger board which broke had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>been in use for two weeks to support a staging used by carpenters and lathers which consisted of some boards or planks which Lane testified \u201cWe stripped and substituted our planks for them\u201d on the morning of the accident in question. Why the ledger board broke under the use it was put to by the plasterers after standing two weeks\u2019 use by carpenters and lathers does not appear. Neither does it appear whether the boards which were stripped off were lighter than those put on, or whether more weight was on the staging when it was used by the plasterers. We do not think that the two weeks\u2019 previous use without breaking was sufficient under this state of the evidence to control what was or might be found to be otherwise an act of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The certificate of the presiding judge as to the last answer of the witness Silva does not take that testimony out of the case. Incompetent evidence admitted without objection becomes evidence. <em>Damon </em>v. <em>Carrol, </em>163 Mass. 404. <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Columbian Fire Proofing Co. </em>182 Mass. 93. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>182 Mass. 202. <em>Brightman </em>v. <em>Buffington, </em>184 Mass. 401. The ruling must stand on the evidence as it stood when the ruling was made. It is of no consequence that the judge now certifies that if a certain piece of evidence had been called to his attention he would have excluded it, nor that he did not have that piece of evidence in mind when he made his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">But this is not of consequence. Lane testified that \u201c the ledger board broke right on the knot,\u201d and the jury were warranted in finding that the knot was the cause of the ledger board\u2019s breaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
