The Appellants moved for attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $271,527.50 and costs in the amount of $1,016.27 after the district court affirmed an administrative decision granting their child, D.B., an independent educational evaluation at public expense under the IDEA. On appeal, the defendants ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>gue that the district court erred, <em>inter alia, </em>by improperly reducing their attorneys\u2019 fees award based on factors listed in \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(F) of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">We \u201creview the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for abuse of discretion, revisiting questions of law de novo.\u201d <em>Atlanta Journal &amp; Constitution v. City of Atlanta Dep\u2019t of Aviation, </em>442 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Without calculations or citations to authority, it is difficult to meaningfully review how the district court interpreted and applied the provisions of \u00a7 1415(i)(3). <em>See Coastal Fuels Mktg., Inc. v. Fla. Express Shipping Co., </em>207 F.3d 1247, 1252 (11th Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (\u201c[A] court\u2019s order on attorney\u2019s fees must allow meaningful appellate review. The trial court should articulate and give principled reasons for its decisions and show some calculations. If the court disallows hours, it must explain which hours are disallowed and show why an award of those hours would be improper.\u201d). However, we hold the district court abused its discretion to the extent that it reduced the Appellants\u2019 fee award under \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(F). Under the plain language of the statute, the district court cannot reduce a prevailing party\u2019s fee award pursuant to \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(F) when \u201cthe court finds that the State or local educational agency unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the action or proceeding.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(G). Here, the district court made findings that both parties had \u201cneedlessly extended\u201d and \u201cover-litigated the case.\u201d <em>See Cobb Cty. Sch. Dist. v. D.B., </em>No. 1:14-cv-02794, slip op. at 7-8 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 9, 2016), EGF No. 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Therefore, we vacate the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and we remand for the court to recalculate the award of \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3); <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433-37, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939-41, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-20\">. Cobb County School District does not argue on appeal that the Appellants fail to qualify as \"prevailing parties.\" Therefore, we assume for purposes of this appeal that G.S.B. and K.B. are \"prevailing partfies] who [are] the parent[s] of a child with a disability\u201d and thus entitled to \"reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)(i); <em>Access Now, Inc. v.
