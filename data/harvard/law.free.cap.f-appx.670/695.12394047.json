The amount of the restitution is the only question. On appeal, Green argues that she was entitled to an offset on her restitution order for government benefits she would have received in the absence of the illegal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-21\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the legality of an order of restitution, but review for abuse of discretion the determination of the restitution value of lost or destroyed property.\u201d <em>United States v. Valladares, </em>544 F.3d 1257, 1269 (11th Cir. 2008). \u201cWe review for clear error factual findings underlying a restitution order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To be clearly erroneous, the finding of the district court must leave us with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rothenberg, </em>610 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-22\">The Mandatory Victim\u2019s Restitution Act (MVRA) requires the district court to order restitution \u201cin the full amount of each victim\u2019s losses as determined by the court.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A). \u201cA restitution award must be based on the amount of the loss <em>actually </em>caused by the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Huff, </em>609 F.3d 1240, 1247 (11th Cir. 2010) (emphasis in original) (quotation omitted). The government bears the burden of proving the loss amount by a preponderance of the evidence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(e); <em>Valladares, </em>544 F.3d at 1269. \u201cRestitution is not intended to provide a windfall for crime victims but rather to ensure that victims ... are made whole for their losses,\u201d <em>Huff, </em>609 F.3d at 1249 (quotation omitted). For this reason, \u201cany value of the services or items received by the victim ... must be offset against the restitution order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1248. We have said that the defendant must offer evidence about the value of an offset. <em>See United States v. Bane, </em>720 F.3d 818, 828-29, 829 n.10 (11th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-23\">The government met its burden of establishing the victims\u2019 losses by soliciting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>testimony from an employee of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The witness testified to the amounts paid by government agencies to Green as a result of her false statements on benefit applications and testified that she would not have received those payments had the agencies been aware of the false statements. Green offered no evidence to disprove this testimony or otherwise to prove her entitlement to an offset in restitution. On this record, the district court did not commit clear error by accepting the testimony from the government witness and finding that Green would have been ineligible for government benefits due to her conduct. It was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to use those factual findings to set restitution at $85,363: the uncontested amount paid to Green by the victims during the months included in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
