Chisholm is serving a 322-month sentence after he was convicted for possessing a firearm and ammunition as a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); possessing marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); possessing cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). He argues that the district court partially sentenced him using the Drug Quantity Table in USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(c), and asks for a two-level reduction in his sentence under a new guideline range calculated using Amendment 782.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Amendment 782 provides a two-level reduction in the base offense levels for most drug quantities listed in the Drug Quantity Table. USSG App. C, amend. 782. However, Chisholm\u2019s guideline range was superseded by the mandatory minimum sentence required under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). He is therefore not eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). After careful review of the record, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). United States v. Colon, 707 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir. 2013). A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has since been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In evaluating whether a defendant should receive a sentence reduction, the \u201ccourt must first determine that a reduction is consistent with [USSG] \u00a7 1B1.10 before it may consider whether the authorized reduction is warranted.\u201d Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Section 1B1.10 of the Guidelines says that the applicable guideline range must have been lowered by the Amendment to the Guidelines in order for a defendant to be eligible for a sentence reduction. See USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">Chisholm\u2019s guideline range resulted from the ACCA, so he is not eligible for a sentence reduction. Under the ACCA, if a defendant is convicted of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and has three earlier convictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or \u201cserious drug offense,\u201d then the defendant\u2019s sentence increases from a maximum of ten years, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2), to a mandato<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>ry minimum of fifteen years and a maximum of life imprisonment, id. \u00a7 924(e). The Guidelines provide that when the ACCA applies and the defendant\u2019s guideline offense level is not otherwise greater, then the defendant\u2019s base offense level is 33. USSG \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B). But if the defendant used or possessed the firearm in connection with a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d as defined in USSG \u00a7 4B1.2, his base offense level is 34. Id \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A). And under Section 4B1.4(c), if the firearm was used or possessed in connection with a crime of violence or controlled substance offense, then a criminal history category of VI applies. See id, \u00a7 4B1.4(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Although the presentence investigation report adopted by the district court did calculate Chisholm\u2019s guideline range under the Drug Quantity Table, that calculation was superseded by the ACCA\u2019s base offense level of 34 under Section 4B1.4. The district court is not authorized to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where a retroactive Guidelines Amendment does not change the guideline range that was the basis for the defendant\u2019s sentence. United States v. Thomas, 545 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam). Because Amendment 782 made no change in Chisholm\u2019s guideline range, the district court correctly found that he was not eligible for a sentence reduction. We therefore affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\">. The government misspelled Chisholm\u2019s name throughout its brief. We use the proper spelling here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b734-9\">. In his Reply Brief, Chisholm for the first time also argues that his conviction under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), was unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). However, this claim is deemed abandoned because Chisholm failed to raise it in his initial brief. United States v. Levy, 379 F.3d 1241, 1243-44 (11th Cir. 2004) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
