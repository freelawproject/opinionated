Because Rivera previously filed a \u00a7 2254 petition challenging the same judgment, that petition was adjudicated on the merits, and Rivera failed to obtain authorization from this Court before filing his current petition in district court, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">I.FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">This case represents the fourth time Rivera has filed under \u00a7 2254 a federal habeas corpus petition challenging his 1982 Florida conviction for two counts of first degree murder and three counts of attempted first degree murder. In 1983, Rivera filed his first petition for habeas corpus relief in federal district court challenging his conviction. The district court dismissed the petition without prejudice because Rivera had not yet exhausted his state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">In 1984, Rivera filed a second petition for habeas corpus relief in federal district court challenging his conviction. Because Rivera had exhausted his state court remedies, the district court considered the merits of his petition and ultimately denied relief. We affirmed the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">In 2008, Rivera filed a third habeas corpus petition in federal district court challenging his conviction. The district court dismissed the petition because Rivera had failed to obtain authorization from this Court before filing his successive petition. Rivera did not appeal the dismissal of his third petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-13\">In October 2015, Rivera filed the present \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition in federal district court, again challenging his conviction. Because Rivera failed to obtain prior authorization from this Court before filing his petition, the magistrate judge recommended that the district court dismiss the petition. After considering Rivera\u2019s objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed Rivera\u2019s petition. This is Rivera\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-14\">II.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b728-15\">We review a district court\u2019s determination that a petitioner\u2019s habeas application was second or successive <em>de novo. See Stewart v. United States, </em>646 F.3d 856, 858 (11th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-16\">III.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b728-17\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, requires that before a prisoner in custody pursuant to a state court judgment can file a \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal habeas petition under \u00a7 2254, he must \u201cmove in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). If a petitioner fails to obtain such prior authorization before filing a second or successive application, the district court must dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Magwood </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number><em>v. Patterson, </em>561 U.S. 320, 330, 130 S.Ct. 2788, 177 L.Ed.2d 592 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">To determine whether a prisoner\u2019s petition is second or successive, we must look to whether the petitioner previously filed a federal habeas petition challenging the same judgment. <em>Insignares v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dept. of Corr., </em>755 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 2014). If a previous \u00a7 2254 petition was dismissed as premature or for failure to exhaust, the dismissal was not on the merits and a later petition is not considered second or successive. <em>See Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, </em>523 U.S. 637, 644-45, 118 S.Ct. 1618, 140 L.Ed.2d 849 (1998) (explaining that \u201cthe dismissal of a first habeas petition for technical procedural reasons\u201d does not \u201cbar the prisoner from ever obtaining federal habeas. review\u201d); <em>Dunn v. Singletary, </em>168 F.3d 440, 441 (11th Cir. 1999) (\u201cWhen an earlier habeas corpus petition was dismissed without prejudice, a later petition is not \u2018second or successive\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Rivera\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition in this case qualifies as a second or successive habeas petition. In 1984, Rivera filed a habeas corpus petition in federal district court challenging the same state court judgment that he attacks in this action. After considering his 1984 petition, the district court denied relief on the merits, and we affirmed. Because Rivera failed to obtain leave from our Court before filing his successive petition, the district court properly dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
