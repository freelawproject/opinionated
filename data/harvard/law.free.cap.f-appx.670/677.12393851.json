Badali appeals his Count 2 conviction on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of the \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Badali did not move for judgment of acquittal on Count 2 on the basis of the sufficiency of the evidence. Thus, his appeal is subject to review for plain error or a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>610 F.3d 1335, 1338 (11th Cir. 2010). Under this standard of review, a conviction will be upheld \u201cunless to do so would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d \u201cThis standard requires the appellate court to find that the evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 574 (11th Cir. 2011). In making this determination, we consider all of the evidence presented at trial, drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id. </em>We find no miscarriage of justice in this case and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Under \u00a7 922(g)(1), it is unlawful for a felon to possess a firearm or ammunition having affected interstate commerce. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Section 922(g)(1) requires that the government prove: (1) that the defendant is a convicted felon; (2) that the defendant knew he was in possession of a firearm; and (3) that the firearm affected or was in interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2004). Possession can be actual or constructive and proven via direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1271 (11th Cir. 2006). Therefore, a firearm need not be on or near the defendant\u2019s person in order for the defendant to knowingly possess the weapon. <em>See United States v. Gates, </em>967 F.2d 497, 499 (11th Cir. 1992) (holding that a defendant had knowing possession of a firearm when driving a car with the weapon beneath the driver\u2019s seat). Nevertheless, a defendant has constructive possession over a firearm only if he \u201cexercises ownership, dominion, or control over the firearm ... [or] if he has the power and intention to exercise dominion or control.\u201d <em>United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1235 (11th Cir. 2004). We have accordingly determined that \u201ca defendant must, in fact, know of the firearm\u2019s existence in order to exercise dominion and control over it.\u201d <em>United States v. Pedro, </em>999 F.2d 497, 500 (11th Cir. 1993). As long as the prosecution proves, through either direct or circumstantial evidence, that the defendant: (1) was aware of or knew of the firearm\u2019s presence and (2) had the ability and intent to later exercise dominion and control over that firearm, the defendant\u2019s constructive possession of that firearm is shown. <em>Perez, </em>661 F.3d at 576-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">It cannot be disputed that the prosecution established the first and third elements of the \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense. Badali stipulated that he had been previously convicted of a felony and that the firearm was manufactured in Spain and thus had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>moved in interstate or foreign commerce. All that Badali really questions is whether he had constructive possession of the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The prosecution presented evidence, including the testimony of the FBI\u2019s confidential informant, Approvato, and recorded phone conversations, showing that Badali organized and arranged for the sale of the firearm to Approvato. Further, Approvato\u2019s testimony established that Badali was directly involved in planning the delivery of the firearm. Therefore, Badali was \u201caware of or knew of\u2019 the firearm. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 576 (11th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The evidence also demonstrated that Ba-dali \u201chad the ability and intent to later exercise dominion and control over [the] firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The recorded phone conversations and Approvato\u2019s testimony established that Badali was the point man for the transaction, orchestrated the firearm sale, and, at minimum, was a co-participant with Laakmann in the sale. Additionally, the first recorded phone conversation, in which Approvato asked Badali if he could get Laakmann to deliver the firearm or meet him halfway and Badali stated they would \u201cwork something out,\u201d indicated that Badali had control of the firearm. Also, Approvato\u2019s testimony that he and Badali had an additional telephone conversation, during which Badali confirmed he would have the firearm delivered to the meeting site, provides further proof of Ba-dali\u2019s dominion and control over the firearm. Thus, Badali\u2019s knowing participation in the firearm transaction permitted the jury to reasonably conclude that he constructively possessed the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
