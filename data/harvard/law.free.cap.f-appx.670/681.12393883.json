The bankruptcy court, while allowing the bankruptcy case to proceed, sua sponte terminated the automatic stay of the banks\u2019 state foreclosure proceedings. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 105(a), 362(d)(1). Baumann appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the sua sponte termination. After an independent review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s termination, we affirm. <em>See In re TOUSA, Inc., </em>680 F.3d 1298, 1310 (11th Cir. 2012) (\u201cAs the second court to review the judgment of the bankruptcy court, we review the order of the bankruptcy court independently of the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-25\">During a hearing in which the bankruptcy court decided to terminate the automatic stay, Baumann disputed the termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>by arguing that the banks lacked standing to move for termination, that the banks never filed the motion on paper, and that an attorney who spoke at the hearing on behalf of one of the banks had failed to file a notice of appearance. The bankruptcy court rejected his arguments, and Bau-mann repeats his arguments on appeal. Each argument relies on a false premise\u2014 that the bankruptcy court granted a motion by the banks to terminate the automatic stay. However the bankruptcy court, at the suggestion of the standing trustee, sua sponte terminated the automatic stay. Because 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a) allows the bankruptcy court to terminate sua sponte and because no evidence exists of the one bank\u2019s attorney influencing the court\u2019s decision, we reject Baumann\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Also, Baumann argues that the bankruptcy court failed, before terminating the automatic stay, to afford him \u201cnotice and a hearing,\u201d to which he is entitled under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d). However, the bankruptcy court scheduled the hearing in which it decided to terminate the automatic stay more than three weeks before the hearing. Also, the court afforded Baumann an opportunity during the hearing to speak and dispute the termination. Baumann received \u201cnotice and a hearing\u201d before the termination of automatic stay. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(1) (defining \u201cnotice and a hearing\u201d as \u201csuch notice [and opportunity for a hearing] as is appropriate in the particular circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
