He appeals the denial of his motion for a reduction of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir. 2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, with guideline interpretations reviewed de novo, and findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Simmons challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that he is ineligible for a sentence reduction on the ground that his sentence was based on a plea agreement pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) rather than a subsequently lowered guidelines range. A defendant whose sentence was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbO\">imposed under a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement might be eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where the agreement: (i) calls \u2018for the defendant to be sentenced within a particular Guidelines sentencing range;\u2019 (ii) provides \u2018for a specific term of imprisonment\u2014such as a number of months\u2014but also make clear that the basis for the specified term is a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the offence to which the defendant pleaded guilty;\u2019 or (iii) \u2018explicitly employs a particular Guidelines sentencing range to establish a term of imprisonment.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-13\"><em>United States v. Benitez, </em>822 F.3d 807, 811 (5th Cir. 2016) (quoting <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 522, 538-40, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) (Sotomayor, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">The plea agreement did not call for Simmons (i) to be sentenced within a particular sentencing range; (ii) provide for a specific term of imprisonment that was based on a sentencing range applicable to his offense; or (iii) explicitly employ any particular range for determining his sentence. <em>See Benitez, </em>822 F.3d at 811. The agreement does not reference any particular sentencing range or offense level. The parties stipulated to a sentence of 240 months, and there is nothing in the plea agreement tethering that sentence to the drug quantity involved in the offense or to the guidelines range. The only basis for the upward departure in the record is the district court\u2019s reference in its statement of reasons to the binding plea agreement accepted by the court. Because Simmons\u2019s sentence was not \u201cbased on\u201d the drug quantity involved in the offense or the advisory guidelines range, he was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Thus, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>did not abuse its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Benitez, </em>822 F.3d at 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-11\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
