The district court also imposed a substantively reasonable sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>tence. The court considered the guidelines range, weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in the light of the seriousness of the crime, considered Sosa\u2019s particular conduct and lively criminal history, noted his lack of remorse, and considered the need to promote respect for the law and the need to deter Sosa and others. Given these considerations, the sentencing court did not abuse its discretion in determining it was appropriate to vary upward from the guidelines range. For background, see <em>United States v. Osorio-Moreno, </em>814 F.3d 1282, 1288 (11th Cir. 2016); <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th Cir. 2010); <em>United States v.
