Giovinco did not appeal his conviction or sentence. Nor did Giovinco file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-22\">Five years later, in 2014, Giovinco filed a pro se a motion in his criminal case seeking relief from the final criminal judgment \u201cpursuant to Rule 60(b)\u201d of the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Rules of Civil Procedure. In his Rule 60(b) motion, Giovinco indicated that he \u201cmay at some point choose to prosecute this issue pursuant to a motion under \u00a7 2255,\u201d but maintained that the current motion was \u201ca properly filed petition pursuant to Rule 60(b).\u201d As to the merits, Giovinco argued that he was actually innocent of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The district court denied Giovinco\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Rule 60(b) provides that \u201cthe court may relieve a party ... from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d under certain circumstances. Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). Rule 60(b), however, applies only in civil cases, and a motion under that rule is not a proper way to challenge a criminal conviction or sentence. See United States v. Mosavi, 138 F.3d 1365, 1366 (11th Cir. 1998) (holding a defendant cannot challenge criminal forfeitures under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 (stating that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cgovern the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Federal courts have an obligation to look beyond the label of a motion filed by a pro se inmate and determine whether the motion is, in effect, cognizable under a different remedial statutory framework. United States v. Jordan, 915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir. 1990). Before a district court recharacterizes a pro se motion as an initial \u00a7 2255 motion, however, the district court must notify the movant of its intention to do so, warn the movant that rechar-acterization means that any subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion will be subject to the restrictions on second or successive motions, and provide the movant an opportunity to withdraw the motion or to amend it so that it contains all the \u00a7 2255 claims he believes he has. Castro v. United States, 540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">Here, Giovinco expressly stated that his motion was brought pursuant to Rule 60(b) and not pursuant to \u00a7 2255. Consistent with Giovinco\u2019s position, the district court did not construe Giovinco\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion or provide the required Castro warnings noted above. Given that Giovinco may not use Rule 60(b), a rule of civil procedure, to challenge his criminal conviction and circumvent the requirements of \u00a7 2255, see Mosavi, 138 F.3d at 1366, the district court did not err in denying Giovinco\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\">. We review a district court\u2019s denial of relief under Rule 60(b) for abuse of discretion. Jackson v. Crosby, 437 F.3d 1290, 1295 (11th Cir. 2006). We review de novo whether a district court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider a Rule 60(b) motion. Williams v. Chatman, 510 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
