Kimbrell was sentenced to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for distributing pseudoephedrine and 108 months\u2019 imprisonment for possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon. Kimbrell argues that Amendment 782 lowers his sentence for distributing pseudoephedrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-24\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir. 2012). The defendant, as the movant, bears the burden of establishing that a retroactive amendment actually lowers his guideline range. <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337 (11th Cir. 2013). However, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not grant the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues, including collateral attacks on a sentence. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-25\">Ordinarily, a district court may not modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment once it has been imposed. 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c). However, a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if the term of imprisonment was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). For a defendant to be eligible for such a reduction based on a subsequent amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines, the relevant amendment must be listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). Because Amendment 782 is one of the listed amendments that applies retroactively, it may serve as the basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1), (d). Amendment 782 revises the drug quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, resulting in a two-level reduction to the base offense level applicable to most drug offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 782 (2014). For defendants charged with 36.5 grams of pseudoephed-rine, the base offense level was reduced from 26 to 24. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.11(d)(8) (2007) <em>to </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.11(d)(8) (2015). However, under the Guidelines\u2019 grouping rules, the higher adjusted offense level determines the applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">But the grounds upon which a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are narrow. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir. 2012), A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment unless a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is inconsistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement if the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Thus, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">The district court did not err when it denied Kimbrell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 782 does not lower his guideline range. Although retroactively applying Amendment 782- decreases Kim-brell\u2019s base offense level for Count 1, his adjusted offense level for Count 2 remains higher, and under the Guidelines\u2019 grouping rules, the higher adjusted offense level determines the applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.1. Accordingly, Amendment 782 does not alter the guideline range underlying Kimbrell\u2019s sentence and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
