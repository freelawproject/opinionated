Tuttle and George W. M. Reed, both of New Haven in the state of Connecticut, as claimants of the liquors, entered a special appearance and filed a motion to dismiss the action, alleging \u201c that the court ought not to entertain jurisdiction of said complaint and proceeding, for that the statute directs that whenever the value of the liquor and vessels exceeds twenty dollars the notice to be issued and served shall be made returnable to the \u2018 term of the superior court to be held in the county next after the expiration of fourteen days from the time of issuing the notice,\u2019 and the aforesaid claimants show and aver that this is not the then next term, but that this action was justly cognizable at the October term of this court and at no other.\u201d The motion was overruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>by Pitman, J., whereupon the claimants entered a general appearance and objected that the complaint \u201c was informal and insufficient, in this, that there was no proper description of the vehicle in which said liquors were kept and deposited; and that the term \u2018two hors wags\u2019 is insensible and unintelligible as a description of said vehicle.\u201d But the judge ruled \u201c that it was immaterial what was the meaning of the words designated; that they might be rejected as surplusage; and that it was sufficient to allege that the liquors were kept and deposited in a certain vehicle, without further description of the nature of the vehicle.\u201d The claimants then further objected that the complaint, warrant and notices, and all proceedings under them, were irregular and void, because the notice \u201c as published and served did not truly and properly set forth the time of seizure, or the violation of law for which the liquors were seized ; \u201d and this objection also was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-5\">The case was then tried to the jury \u201c on an issue directed by the court.\u201d The Commonwealth called Eli P. Nichols, a deputy of the constable of the Commonwealth, as a witness, who testified that he went to the Canal Railroad station in Northampton, between eleven and twelve o\u2019clock on the night of Saturday, September 11, 1869, and found several persons there apparently engaged in removing liquor from the cars with two wagons; that it was so dark that he could not distinguish who they were, except Ansel Smith, \u201c who was the driver of a two horse wagon, with the seven casks loaded thereon, which were the same liquors now in controversy; \u201d that he \u201c halted <em>\u201d </em>Smith, who was driving the wagon; and that he saw Patrick Maloney not more than a rod from where he stopped Smith, but did not observe Maloney do anything or say anything in relation to the liquor. The attorney for the Commonwealth asked the witness if Smith told him, at the time he was thus stopped, where he was going with the liquoi and what was to be done with it. The claimants objected to the question; but the judge ruled \u201c that Smith\u2019s declarations were admissible, net as tending to charge Maloney with any violation or intended violation of the law, but to show Smith\u2019s connection with the keeping and transportation of the liquors; \u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the witness testified, under objection, that Smith told him that he was hauling the liquor for Patrick Maloney. This witness was also allowed to testify, under objection, that Maloney kept a saloon in Northampton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-5\">Hie witnesses for the Commonwealth testified that on Saturday, September 11, 1869, before midnight, \u201c the liquor was conveyed by said constable, and deposited for safe keeping, to the jail, and left in charge of the sheriff till Monday, when some time in the day the complaint was made and the warrant issued.\u201d At the close of the evidence for the Commonwealth, the claimants objected that there was a variance between the testimony and the allegations, as to the time of the illegal keeping and transportation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-6\">The verdict was in these words: \u201c The jury find that the liquor described in the complaint was at the time and by the person alleged therein kept for the purpose of being sold in violation of law.\u201d To this verdict the claimants objected, \u201c as not covering any proper issue in the case,\u201d and moved \u201c that judgment be arrested thereon, and that said verdict be set aside; \u201d but the judge ruled \u201c that said verdict was regular, formal and sufficient, and that judgment should be entered thereon,\u201d and ordered judgment accordingly, and the claimants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-7\"><em>0. </em>Delano, for the claimants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3s\">1. A magistrate has no jurisdiction to receive a complaint, or issue a warrant, for the purpose of seizing liquors kept or deposited in a vehicle or other place by a person who has no intent to sell them and is merely transporting them to another person who is known to have such an intent. St. 1869, <em>c. </em>415, \u00a7\u00a7 44,46, 51, 57. The statute is to be construed strictly. There is nothing in it to show that this extraordinary power of search and seizure is to run against mere carriers. It clearly does not reach a carrier of liquors already sold. See \u00a7 37; <em>Kennedy </em>v. Favor, 14 Gray, 200, 202; <em>Kent </em>v. Willey, 11 Gray, 368.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-8\">2. This complaint contains no such formal, particular and sufficient designation of the \u201c building, structure or piare \u201d to be iearched, as is required by \u00a7 46 ; and the warrant cannot remedy defects in the complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-9\">3. All the proceedings in the case are irregular and void, because there was no proper notice duly served and published, truly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>setting forth, the time , of seizure and the violation of law for which the liquors were seized. They were in fact seized on Saturday, September 11, in the vehicle, and were kept in the jail till Monday, September 13, when the complaint was first made and the warrant issued. The officer\u2019s return on the warrant, and the notices issued by the trial justice, all falsify the time of seizure. The complaint should have set out the original seizure without warrant on the 11th; the detention two days to procure a warrant ; and then the seizure on the warrant, not as an original seizure, but according to the facts. The allegation that the liquors were on the 11th of September, and \u201c still are\u201d on the 13th, kept and deposited in a \u201c vehicle,\u201d was not according to the fact or the proof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-5\">4. On an issue between the Commonwealth and the claimants, the declarations of Ansel Smith were inadmissible for the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-6\">5. The evidence that Maloney kept a saloon was immaterial and incompetent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-7\">6. The verdict covers no proper issue. It finds, if anything, that on the 11th and thence to the 13th of September the liquor was kept by Ansel Smith, for the purpose of being sold by him in violation of law, when there is no allegation that Smith intended to sell the liquor. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, 4 </em>Allen, 601.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-8\"><em>C. Allen, </em>Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b399-9\">Chapman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abz\">The magistrate properly made his proceedings returnable to the criminal term of the superior court to be held in December, instead of the civil term to be held in October; for civil business only can be done at the civil term, and criminal business at the criminal term.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">The complaint contains a sufficient description of the vehicle in which the liquors were kept, without the words which are said to be insensible and unintelligible, and these words were properly rejected as surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">The allegation of the intent to sell conforms to the provisions of the St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>415. The seizure, the complaint and the warrant were under \u00a7\u00a7 37, 44, 57. The criminal intent of the person who has the liquor in the vehicle arises from his having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>reasonable cause to believe that it is intended for sale in violation of the act. The proceeding is <em>in ram, </em>the liquor being regarded by the statute, under these circumstances, as a nuisance. It may be seized and taken into custody, but a complaint must then be made, and when made it relates to the time when the seizure was made and not to a subsequent period when the officer has the liquor in custody.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">If the person having it in the vehicle has reasonable cause to believe that the person to whom he is carrying the liquor intends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>to sell it illegally, he is aiding and abetting him in making it subject to seizure. The allegation of intent in the complaint is in conformity with this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">His declarations as to what he is doing with the liquors, and how he intends to dispose of them, are admissible, being evidence against him. It was- also pertinent to prove that Maloney, to whom he was carrying the liquors, kept a saloon, for it tended to prove the purpose for which he was procuring the liquors.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">It is objected that the verdict finds no proper issue, and that judgment should not be rendered thereon. The judgment is not to be against Smith or Maloney, but against the liquor and casks. The verdict therefore ought to relate to the condition of the liquor, in respect to its being a nuisance. It should also follow the complaint, which is, that the liquor was kept by Smith in a vehicle, and was being conveyed to Maloney, who intended to sell it in violation of law, Smith having reasonable cause to believe, &amp;c. The defect in this verdict is, that it does not find that Smith had the reasonable cause alleged for believing the intent of Maloney. This is a material fact, and should have been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\n<em>Exceptions as to the verdict sustained; and the other exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AEo\">Before the jury were empanelled for the new trial, the claimant moved that the proceedings be quashed for want of jurisdictian, \u201c because the process of seizure would not he against a carrier transporting liquor to a person other than himself, and intended for illegal sale by that other person; \u201d and the motion was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">At the trial, before Dewey, J., Nichols was called again as a witness for the Commonwealth, and testified that about half past eleven o\u2019clock on the night of Saturday, September 11, 1869, he went, with assistants, to the freight depot of the railroad station in Northampton, \u201c and found Ansel Smith just driving away with a load of the liquor in controversy, and required him to stop, and asked him where he was going; that the load was made up oi seven barrels of liquor; and that another wagon was at the depot, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>being loaded, but at the approach of the witness and before he could reach the second wagon the liquor was rolled from it back into the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In the course of this testimony, Nichols was asked by the attorney for the Commonwealth what Smith replied when the witness asked him where he was going with the liquor; the claimants objected to the admission of Smith\u2019s declarations for any other purpose than to show his own violation of the law; and the answer of the witness, that Smith replied \u201c that he was going to Patrick Maloney\u2019s,\u201d was admitted only for that purpose. It also appeared that Smith made a similar statement to Ignatius L. Randall, another witness for the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u201c Nichols also testified that, as Smith was driving out of a narrow lane which leads from the railroad station into Main Street, he stopped and hesitated to go on in the direction in which he was told to go by the constables; and that near the wagon at this point he saw Maloney in company with three or four others, but could only distinguish Maloney, and could not say whether he stopped or riot, and did not hear him say anything. Randall, who was also accompanying the team, testified that he saw Maloney and the others, but could only recognize Maloney; that Maloney said \u2018 Drive on; \u2019 and that that was all he heard him say.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\u201c Nichols and Randall both testified that Maloney at the time of this seizure kept a saloon on Main Street in Northampton, and had been keeping such saloon; and that he had since added a grocery; but there was no testimony that he kept intoxicating \u00ab liquors in said saloon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The testimony as to the disposition made of the liquors after their seizure, and as to all the subsequent proceedings, was the same in substance as on the former trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The claimants, after the evidence was all in, requested the judge to rule that there was not sufficient evidence to show that the liquor was intended for sale by Patrick Maloney; but he refused so to rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Upon proper issues framed for the jury, they returned the fol lowing verdict: \u201c The jury find that the liquors described in the complaint were by Ansel Smith kept as alleged therein and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>tended fcr sale by Patrick Maloney, in violation of the provisions of the four hundred and fifteenth chapter of the statutes of this Commonwealth for the year eighteen hundred and sixty-nine, and that Ansel Smith had reasonable cause to believe that Patrick Maloney intended to sell the same in violation of the provisions of said statutes.\u201d The claimants alleged exceptions, which were argued at September term 1872.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b403-6\"><em>C. R. Train, </em>Attorney General, for the Commonwealth,</attorneys>\n<p id=\"APp\">to the point of the sufficiency of the evidence for the jury, cited <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gillon, </em>2 Allen, 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Delano, for the claimants, upon the point of want of jurisdiction, repeated his former argument on that question; and'argued further as follows: There was no sufficient evidence of an intent on the part of Maloney illegally to sell the liquors, and the judge should have ruled so. Smith\u2019s statements were hearsay so far as Maloney was conoemed, and were properly rejected m the question of Maloney\u2019s intent to sell. The only other evidence came from Nichols and Randall. They saw Maloney on the street, and one of them heard him say \u201c Drive on; \u201d and they both, testified that he kept a saloon, but there was no evidence that he kept intoxicating liquors in his saloon. The question then is, whether, assuming, as the law presumes, that Maloney was walking the streets as an innocent man, it is enough to overcome that presumption, that one witness heard him say \u201c Drive on,\u201d the only other fact being that he kept a saloon; or, in other words, if a saloon-keeper says \u201c Drive on,\u201d to a truckman who has liquor on his cart, is it either a conclusion of law or presumption of fact that the saloon-keeper intends illegally to sell that liquor. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>5 Gray, 101. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Breed, </em>Ib. 440. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>14 Gray, 385. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Merrill Ib. 415. <em>Cochrane </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>4 Allen, 177.</p>\n<author id=\"b403-7\">Chapman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACk\">The point is again made, that the seizure process does not lie against a carrier transporting liquor to a third person as the owner, to be illegally sold by that person. The decision at the former hearing covered that point, and was affirmed at November term 1871 for Essex, in the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, Hugh Owen, claimant. </em>We see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>no reason to doubt its correctness. The language of the thirty-seventh section of the St. of 1869, <em>e. </em>415, describes a carrier who does not intend to sell the liquor himself, but has reasonable cause to believe that the person to whom he is carrying it intends to sell it unlawfully, and makes him liable \u201eo a fine. Section 44 makes the liquor liable to be seized in his vehicle, upon complaint as specified. Section 57 authorizes the seizure by certain officers without warrant. These provisions are not modified by the language of any other section. The seizure is a proceeding <em>in rem </em>against liquor <em>in transitu. </em>If the person to whom it is to be carried intends to sell it unlawfully, and the carrier has reason to believe this, it is subject to forfeiture as a nuisance. When a claimant comes in, it is the liquor that is the subject of controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The evidence in this case, as to the business, the acts and the language of Maloney, was pertinent, and also the acts and language of the carrier; and we think it was sufficient to authorize the findings of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"A2r\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\"> A similar decision upon this point was made at November term 1871 in Essex, in the case of</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Commonwealth <em>vs. </em>Certain Intoxicating Liquors, Hugh Owen, claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Complaint under the St. of 1869, c. 415, to a trial justice in Essex, on September 10, 1869, for a warrant to search \u201c a certain vehicle, to wit, a certain wagon, driven by said Owen,\u201d for intoxicating liquors which it alleged were on September 9, 1869, \u201cand still are\u201d kept and deposited by him-therein, \u201c said liquor kept, deposited and being conveyed to another person other than the said Owen, whose name to the said complainants is now unknown, and said unknown person intending to sell said liquor in violation of\u201d the St. of 1869, c. 415, \u201c and the said Owen then and there having reasonable cause to believe that the said liquor \u201d \u201c is so intended for illegal sale,\u201d &amp;e.

Thereupon the defendant objected that the proceedings could not 3e maintained; but I overruled this objection and instructed the jury that the variance was not material.
