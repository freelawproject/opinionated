Writ dated May 27, 1870. The declaration contained two counts. The first was for the conversion of a horse belonging to the plaintiff to the defendant\u2019s use. The second alleged that the defendant found and took up, in West Roxbury, a stray horse belonging to the plaintiff, and neglected to cause it to be entered and cried and notice thereof to be posted up as directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>by the Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>79, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u201c wherefore the plaintiff hath a right to recover of the defendant the value of said horse, to wit, three hundred dollars, as a forfeiture, the said horse not having been delivered or otherwise accounted for by the defendant \u201d to the plaintiff. The answer was a general denial to the first count, and set up the statute of limitations against the second count. At the trial in the superior court, before <em>Brigham,, </em>C. J., without a jury, the facts were found as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-5\">On October 26, 1867, a horse of the value of $250, belonging to the plaintiff, escaped from a pasture in Milford, and appeared a day or two afterwards in a highway in West Roxbury near an avenue which led from the travelled road into the messuage of Matthew Bolles. The defendant, who was in the employment of Bolles, supposing that the horse belonged to a neighbor, one of whose beasts had previously strayed upon the land of Bolles and done damage there, drove it from the highway into an inclosed pasture belonging to Bolles, for the purpose of preventing it from straying on Bolles\u2019s cultivated land. This was done without the direction, knowledge or authority of Bolles, who was not aware of what had been done until the horse had been in his . pasture for two nights and a day, when he immediately directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>the defendant to turn it into the highway again, and the defendant did so, and the plaintiff never recovered it. The defendant never caused any notice of the horse to be entered with the town clerk and posted up, or the horse to be cried. Both counts related to the same horse, and to the acts and omissions of the defendant relating to it on the same occasion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-5\">The judge ruled that these facts would not sustain the action, and ordered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-6\"><em>H. B. </em>Staples, <em>(F. P. G-oulding </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaQ\">1. By taking up the horse in the highway, the defendant assumed the rights and duties of a voluntary bailee, and was bound to keep it with reasonable care for its owner. His act of discarding it was a violation of his trust, and may be treated as a conversion. Story on Bailments, \u00a7\u00a7 85, 621. <em>McAvoy </em>v. Medina, 11 Allen, 548. <em>Nelson </em>v. Merriam, 4 Pick. 249. His failure to comply with the statute, after having taken up the horse, also makes the taking tortious, so that trover can be maintained against him. 4 Pick. 249. <em>Brake </em>v. Shorter, 4 Esp. 165. <em>Stevens </em>v. Curtis, 18 Pick. 227.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-7\">2. The action can be maintained on the second count, under the Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>79, \u00a7 10. The forfeiture is not imposed as a punishment for an offence, but for the violation or neglect of a duty prescribed by statute. This avoids the plea of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-8\"><em>J. S.

It appears that, when the horse was taken up, he was going at large in the highway, and was supposed to be about to enter upon the premises of the defendant\u2019s employer. Under such circumstances, the act of turning him into an inclosed pasture was not an interference with the owner\u2019s possession, or a conversion of the horse to the defendant\u2019s own use. Ho thing is shown at all inconsistent with a purpose on the defendant\u2019s part to keep the horse for the owner; and it has been decided that the finder of an estray may keep it for the owner, and is not liable in trover unless he uses the estray, or refuses to deliver it on demand. <em>Nelson </em>v. Merriam, 4 Pick. 249. We do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>understand the plaintiff to complain of this act, except on the ground that the defendant afterwards violated his trust as a voluntary bailee by turning the horse into the highway again. But this, it appears to us, was the act of his employer, and not of himself. He could not keep the horse on another man\u2019s land, against the will of such other man. The turning out into the highway was therefore an act which he could not prevent, and for which he cannot be held <em>responsible; </em>and the plaintiff has no cause of action under his first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">2. The second count also is attended with difficulties, at least equally great. If the defendant incurred a forfeiture by reason of not proceeding according to Gen. Sts. c. 79, \u00a7 2, his offence was committed more than one year before the date of the suit. By Gen. Sts. c. 155, \u00a7 20, all actions for a penalty or forfeiture on a penal statute, brought by any person to whom the penalty or forfeiture is given in whole or in part, shall be commenced within one year next after the offence is committed, and not after-wards. This provision is an effectual bar to the plaintiff\u2019s claim in his second count.</p>\n<p id=\"AIh\">\n<em>jExceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
