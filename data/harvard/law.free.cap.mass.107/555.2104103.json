It does not appear that the persons who were induced to leave the plaintiffs\u2019 employment had not a perfect right to do so. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Hunt, 4 Met. 111, 130. <em>Bowen </em>v. Matheson, 14 Allen, 499. <em>Campbell </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>Cooper, </em>34 N. H. 49. <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Aldridge, </em>Cowp. 54. Nor does it appear that they were induced to leave by illegal means; and without such an allegation the count contains no cause of action. Cowp. 54. 4 Met. 126, 132.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-5\">Nor can an action be maintained upon the allegation that the defendant \u201c persuaded and induced \u201d persons who were about to enter the plaintiffs\u2019 employment to refrain from so doing, no illegal methods being stated. 4 Met. 111. See also the allegations held to be defective in 14 Allen, 499. And this allegation cannot be rejected as surplusage, for it may go to the whole damage, and is so closely connected with the charge of inducing -persons actually in the employment to leave it, as to make one charge in substance. The allegation that the defendant did molest, obstruct and hinder the plaintiffs is limited and qualified by the specification that he \u201c persuaded and induced.\u201d If regarded as an independent allegation, it also is insufficient in law for wail of any allegation of the use of unlawful means. 4 Met. 134,135. <em>Winsmore </em>v. <em>Greenbank, </em>Willes, 577. <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>Longman, </em>4 B. &amp; S. 376.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-6\">2. As to the second count. It contains more than one cause of action. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>129, \u00a7 2, <em>cl. </em>4. It does not appear that the persons specified in it were induced to refuse to perform their contracts by the use of any illegal means by the defendant. And the relation of master and servant, without which it cannot be sustained, did not exist between them and the plaintiffs. Cowp. 54. <em>Hilliard </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>3 Gray, 349. <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Lubke, </em>4 Allen, 138. <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>11 Allen, 419. <em>Coomes </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>102 Mass. 211.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-7\">3. As to the third count. The contract alleged between the plaintiffs and Temple did not create the relation of master and servant. See cases last above cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-8\">The allegations that he was in their employment and service, and was enticed to leave their service, are mere legal inferences as to the relation created by his contract, and do not constitute a substantive charge against the defendant; or they may be regarded as a general description of the cause of action more particularly set forth in the allegations concerning the contract, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>therefore as limited and explained by such allegations, or as a mere recital of the relation between the parties when the contract was entered into which terminated such relation. But ( yen if the allegations of service and employment, and enticement therefrom, be considered substantive, independently of all reference to the contract, then the first proposition maintained by the defendant as to the first count, and the cases cited in its support, apply o to this count also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-5\">The defendant is alleged to have enticed Temple to refuse to perform his contract before the time agreed on for its performance had arrived; and Temple\u2019s refusal to perform it is alleged to have taken place at the same time. The count only states that on or about the 1st of February, by the enticement of the defendant, Temple refused to perform a contract under which his right of performance extended to the 1.9th of February, whereby it alleges that the plaintiffs lost the benefits that would have accrued from its performance on the 1st of February. If the statement be correct, no legal cause of action existed at the time of the enticement. <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>1 W. Bl. 373.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-6\">The allegation \u201ccontriving to defraud,\u201d &amp;c., is mere recital, and not traversable. 4 Met. 128. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>3 Cush, 558.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-7\">4. Under both the second and third counts, the question arises whether it is actionable for one person to entice another to refuse to perform a contract made with a third, where no relation of master and servant exists. If the defendant is hable in this case, then every man is liable to an action who entices his neighbor not to pay a note which he owes, not to convey real estate under a contract for its conveyance, not to carry out a contract to lend money, or not to comply with a bail bond, or a thousand other contracts into which men enter daily. There is no precedent for such an action as this; except where the domestic relations, or the relations of master and servant, are involved. In all cases, the service or contract interfered with must be either one where wages are paid and the term of service fixed, or else one where the employer retains the control and constant direction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>of the work. See dissenting opinion of Coleridge, J., in <em>Lumley </em>v. <em>Gye, 2 </em>El. &amp; Bl. 216, 244. So extensive a right of action as these plaintiffs contemplate would be inconsistent with the rights of a citizen under a free government.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b570-5\">\"W ells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Als\">The declaration, in its first count, alleges that the defendant did, \u201c unlawfully and without justifiable cause, molest, obstruct and hinder the plaintiffs from carrying on \u201d their business of manufacture and sale of boots and shoes, \u201c with the unlawful purpose of preventing the plaintiffs from carrying on their said business, and wilfully persuaded and induced a large number of persons who were in the employment of the plaintiffs,\u201d and others \u201c who were about to enter into \u201d their employment, \u201c to leave and abandon the employment of the plaintiffs, without their consent and against their will; \u201d whereby the plaintiffs lost the services of said persons, and the profits and advantages they would otherwise have made and received therefrom, and were put to large expenses to procure other suitable workmen, and suffered losses in their said business.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">This sets forth sufficiently (1) intentional and wilful acts (2) calculated to cause damage to the plaintiffs in their lawful business, (3) done with the unlawful purpose to cause such damage and loss, without right or justifiable cause on the part of the defendant, (which constitutes malice,) and (4) actual damage and loss resulting.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The general principle is announced in Com. Dig. Action on the Case, A.: \u201c In all cases where a man has a temporal loss or damage by the wrong of another, he may have an action upon the case to be repaired in damages.\u201d The intentional causing of such loss to another, without justifiable cause, and with the malicious purpose to inflict it, is of itself a wrong. This proposition seems to be fully sustained by the references in the case' of <em>Carew </em>v. <em>Rutherford, </em>106 Mass. 1,10, 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">In the case of <em>Keeble </em>v. <em>Hickeringill, </em>as contained in a note to <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>11 East, 571, 574, both actions being for damages by reason of frightening wild fowl from the plaintiff\u2019s decoy, Chief Justice Holt alludes to actions maintained for scandalous words which are actionable only by reason of being inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>lions to a man in his profession or trade, and adds: \u201c How much more, when the defendant doth an actual and real damage to another when he is in the very act of receiving profit in his employment. Now there are two sorts of acts for doing damage to a man\u2019s employment, for which an action lies ; the one is in respect of a man\u2019s privilege, the other is in respect of his property.\u201d After considering injuries to a man\u2019s franchise or privilege, he proceeds : \u201c The other is where a violent or malicious act is done to a man\u2019s occupation, profession, or way of getting a livelihood; there an action lies in all cases.\u201d From the several reports of this case it is not clear whether the action was maintained on the -ground that the wild ducks were frightened out of the plaintiff\u2019s decoy, as would appear from 3 Salk. 9, and Holt, 14, 17, 18; or upon the broader one, that they were driven away and prevented from resorting there, as the case is stated in 11 Mod. 74, 130. But the doctrine thus enunciated by Lord Holt covers both aspects of the case; as does his illustration of frightening boys from going to school, whereby loss was occasioned to the master. Of like import is the case of <em>Tarleton </em>v. <em>McGawley, </em>Peake, 205, in which Lord Kenyon held that an action would lie for frightening the natives upon the coast of Africa, and thus preventing them from coming to the plaintiff\u2019s vessel to trade, whereby he lost the profits of such trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">There are indeed many authorities which appear to hold that to constitute an actionable wrong there must be a violation of some definite legal right of the plaintiff. But those are cases, for the most part at least, where the defendants were themselves acting in the lawful exercise of some distinct right, which furnished the defence of a justifiable cause for their acts, except so far as they were in violation of a superior right in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Thus every one has an equal right to employ workmen in his business or service; and if, by the exercise of this right in such manner as he may see fit, persons are induced to leave their employment elsewhere, no wrong is done to him whose employment they leave, unless a contract exists by which such other person has a legal right to the further continuance of their services. If such a contract exists, one who knowingly and intentionally pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>cures it to be violated may be held liable for the wrong, although \u25a0\u00bbe did it for the purpose of promoting-his own business.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">One may dig upon his own land for water, or any other purpose, although he thereby cuts off the supply of water from his neighbor\u2019s well. <em>Grreenleaf </em>v. Francis, 18 Pick. 117. It is intimated, in this case, that such acts might be actionable if done maliciously. But the rights of the owner.of land being absolute therein, and the adjoining proprietor having no legal right to such a supply of water from lands of another, the superior right' must prevail. Accordingly it is generally held that no action will lie against one for acts done upon his own land in the exercise of his rights of ownership, whatever the motive, if they merely deprive^ another of advantages, or cause a loss to him, without violating any legal right; that is, the motive in such cases is immaterial. <em>Frazier </em>v. Brown, 12 Ohio State, 294. <em>Chatfield </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>28 Verm. 49. <em>Mahan </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>13 Wend. 261. <em>Delhi </em>v. <em>Youmans, </em>50 Barb. 316. A similar decision was made in <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Baugh, </em>25 Penn. State, 528 ; but the suggestion in <em>Grreenleaf </em>v. <em>Francis </em>was approved so far as this, namely, that malicious acts without the justification of any right, that is, acts of a stranger, resulting in like las\u00a7 or damage, might be actionable; and the case of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Boston \u00a7 Maine Railroad, </em>3 Cush. 107, was referred to as showing that such loss of advantages previously enjoyed, although not of vested legal right, might be a ground of damages recoverable against one who caused the loss without superior right or justifiable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Every one has a right to enjoy the fruits and advantages of his own enterprise, industry, skill and credit. He has no right to be protected against competition; but he has a right to be free from malicious and wanton interference, disturbance or annoyance. If disturbance or loss come as a result of competition, or the exercise of like rights by others, it is <em>damnum absque injuri\u00e9, </em>unless some superior right by contract or otherwise is interfered with. But if it c):me from the merely wanton or malicious acts of others, without the justification of competition or the service of any interest or lawful purpose, it then stands upon a different footing, and .falls within the principle of the authorities first referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>It is a well settled principle, that words, not actionable in themselves as defamatory, will nevertheless subject the party to an action for any special damages that may occur to another thereby. Bac. Ab. Slander, C. The same is true of words spoken in relation to property, or the title thereto, whereby the party is defeated of a sale, or suffers damage in any way. Bac. Ab. Action on the Case, I. Com. Dig. Action on the Case, C. So also, if, by a wrongful claim of title or lien, the owner is prevented from perfecting a sale, or a purchaser from obtaining delivery to himself of goods, an action will lie. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Button, </em>2 Cr., M. &amp; R. 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In all these cases, the damage for which the recovery is had is not the loss of the value of actual contracts by reason of their non-fulfilment, but the loss of advantages, either of property or of personal benefit, which, but for such interference, the plaintiff would have been able to attain or enjoy. Indeed, it has been held that loss by the breach of contract, or the wrongful conduct of another than the defendant, would not be recoverable as damages under a <em>per quad. Vicars </em>v. <em>Wilcocks, </em>8 East, 1. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Langdale, </em>2 B. &amp; P. 284. Bac. Ab. Slander, C.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">This doctrine has been doubted, especially in <em>Lumley </em>v. <em>Gye, </em>2 El. &amp; Bl. 216, 239, where the case of <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Zachary, </em>Aleyn, 3, is cited to the contrary. That was an action on the case, maintained for wrongfully representing to the bailiff of a manor that a sheep was an estray, in consequence of which it was wrongfully seized; the reason for the decision being, \u201c because the defendant, by his false practice, hath created a trouble, disgrace and damage to the plaintiff.\u201d But the distinction is unimportant in a case like the present, where the damage to the plaintiffs is alleged to have been the direct result of the wrongful conduct of the defendant, and so intended by him ; except that it is significant of the point that the existence and defeat of rights by contract are not essential to the maintenance of an action for mali clous wrong, when the defendant has no pretext of justifiable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The case of <em>Green </em>v. <em>Button, </em>2 Cr., M. &amp; R. 707, is especially 'su point in this connection. The defendant, by means of a false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>claim of a lien, and of words discrediting the plaintiff, induced one who had sold goods to the plaintiff to refuse to deliver them, whereby he was injured in his business. The court, alluding to the doubts that had been expressed as to <em>Vicars </em>v. <em>Wilcocks </em>and <em>Morris </em>v. Langdale, and without deciding that question, distinguished the case under consideration, on the ground that, the goods not having been paid for, there was no absolute contract to deliver, upon which the plaintiff could have his remedy against the seller; that is, as the delivery was prevented by the wrongful conduct of the defendant, and there was no binding contract broken by the seller, therefore the plaintiff was entitled to recover in his action on the case <em>per quad.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In <em>Gunter </em>v. <em>Astor, </em>4 J. B. Moore, 12, an action was maintained for enticing away workmen from their employment for a piano manufacturer. They were not hired for a limited time, but worked by the piece. The discussion indicates that damages were considered to be recoverable for the breaking up or disturbance of the business of the plaintiff, whereby he suffered the loss of his usual profits for a long period. The grounds of damage were apparently regarded as altogether independent of the mere loss of any contracts with the workmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">In <em>Benton </em>v. Pratt, 2 Wend. 385, it is held that proof of loss by the plaintiff of what he would otherwise have obtained, though there was no contract for it which he could enforce, will sustain an action for the wrongful conduct by which the loss was occasioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The difficulty in such cases is to make certain, by proof, that there has been in fact such loss as entitles the party to reparation ; but that difficulty is not encountered in the present stage of this case, where all the facts alleged are admitted by the demurrer. The demurrer also admits the absence of any justifiable cause whatever. This decision is made upon the case thus presented, and does not apply to a case of interference by way of friendly advice, honestly given; nor is it in denial of the right of free expression of opinion. We have no occasion now to consider what would constitute justifiable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>The second and third counts recite contracts of the plaintiffs with their workmen for the performance of certain work in tht manufacture of boots and shoes ; and allege that the defendant, well knowing thereof, with the unlawful purpose of hindering and preventing the plaintiffs from carrying on their business, induced said persons to refuse and neglect to perform their contracts, whereby the plaintiffs suffered great damage in their business.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">It is a familiar and well established doctrine of the law upon the relation of master and servant, that one who entices away a servant, or induces him to leave his master, may be held liable in damages therefor, provided there exists a valid contract for continued service, known to the defendant. It has sometimes been supposed that this doctrine sprang from the English statute of laborers, and was confined to menial service. But we are satisfied that it is founded upon the legal right derived from the contract, and not merely upon the relation of master and servant; and that it applies to all contracts of employment, if not to contracts of every description.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In <em>Hart </em>v. Aldridge, Cowp. 54, it was applied to a case very much like the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In <em>Gunter </em>v. <em>Astor, </em>4 J. B. Moore, 12, it was applied to the enticing away of workmen not hired for a limited or constant period, but who worked by the piece for a piano manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">In <em>Sheperd </em>v. <em>Wakeman, </em>Sid. 79, it was applied to the loss of a contract of marriage by reason of a false and malicious letter claiming a previous engagement.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">In <em>Winsmore </em>v. <em>Greenbank, </em>Willes, 577, the defendant was held liable in damages for unlawfully and unjustly \u201c procuring, enticing and persuading \u201d the plaintiff\u2019s wife to remain away from him, whereby he lost the comfort and society of his wife, and the profit and advantage of her fortune.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">In <em>Lumley </em>v. <em>Gye, </em>2 El. &amp; Bl. 216, the plaintiff had engaged Miss Wagner to sing in his opera, and the defendant knowingly induced her to break her contract and refuse to sing. It was objected that the action would not lie, because her contract was merely executory, and she had never actually entered into the service of the plaintiff; and Coleridge, J., dissented, insisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>that the only foundation for such an action was the statute of laborers, which did not apply to service of that character; but after full discussion and deliberation it was held that the action would lie for the damages thus caused by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In <em>Boston Glass Manufactory </em>v. Binney, 4 Pick. 425, which was for inducing workmen, skilled in several departments of glass- . making, to leave the employment of the plaintiff, it was not suggested that the defendants would not have been liable if there had been an existing contract between the plaintiff and the workmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Upon careful consideration of the authorities, as well as of the principles involved, we are of opinion that a legal cause of action is sufficiently stated in each of the three counts of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"A52\">\n<em>Demurrer overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
