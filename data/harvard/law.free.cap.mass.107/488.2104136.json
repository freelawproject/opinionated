J., the defendant admitted tho; the tenement was so kept and maintained, but contended that before June 1,1870, he sold out to Morris O. Connor all interest in the business there carried on, and that he had no interest in or control of the premises and business since that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-6\">Sebeas C. Couch and Hannibal H, Billings, both deputies of the constable of the Commonwealth, were witnesses for the Commonwealth. The defendant, on cross-examination, asked Couch, who testified after Billings, if Billings had not had trouble and angry conversation with the defendant; and Couch replied that such was the fact. Upon reexamination, the district attorney asked what the difficulty was between the defendant and Billings, the defendant objected to the question, but the judge ruled that it was competent to ascertain the extent of the ill will which the trouble would occasion ; and Couch thereupon testified \u201c that he and Billings made a seizure at the tenement in question in March 1870 ; that the defendant came to their office the next day and said that if he had been there when they made the seizure they would have made it over his dead body; and that other hard talk passed between the parties.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-7\">Couch further testified without objection that he made a seizure at the tenement in October 1870, when the defendant was not present; and that some kegs stood near the door, with bright and fresh express tags attached to them. The district attorney asked how the kegs came there, and the witness said he did not know, except what the tags said. The district attorney asked what was on the tags, and the defendant objected. The judge over ruled the objection, and admitted the evidence to show that the tenement was kept and used by the defendant at the time alleged in the indictment; and the witness answered that the tags were marked \u201c J. J.,\u201d and also with the name of the express from Ware. No further evidence was given as to these tags; and all the testimony in relation to them was excepted to by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Elisha C. Pettis, a witness called by the Commonwealth, was allowed, against the objection of the defendant, to testify as follows : \u201c In the summer of 1870, since June 1, the defendant said he did not wish me to say anything about his having liquor coming there. In one or two instances, iron-bound barrels and half barrels of liquors have come to the freight-house of the Boston <em>&amp; </em>Albany Railroad at Springfield, marked in the defendant\u2019s own name. The team that runs to the tenement drew them away. Other barrels have come to the freight-house, marked \u201c J. T. &amp; Co.\u201d and \u201c J. J.\u201d underneath. I suppose \u201c J. T. &amp; Co.\u201d means John Tracy <em>&amp; </em>Company, of. Albany.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-5\">The judge instructed the jury, among other things not now material, that \u201c if the defendant was interested in the profits of the business, or was a partner, he could be held under this indictment ; that if Connor was the sole owner in fact, the defendant must be acquitted; and that if the jury entertained a reasonable doubt as to who was the proprietor, or that the defendant was such, they must acquit.\u201d The defendant was convicted, and alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b498-6\">6r. <em>M. </em>Stearns, <em>(M. P. Knowlton </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-7\">1. Although personal controversy may be shown, particulars cannot be inquired into; to do so would lead to the trial of numerous collateral issues.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-8\">2. The writing on the tags should not have been admitted; it was admitting evidence of the doings of the Ware Express Company, which were <em>res inter alios.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-9\">3. The testimony of Pettis was inadmissible. The fact that barrels of liquor came to the freight-house, marked with the defendant\u2019s name, and were drawn to the tenement in question, had no tendency to prove that the defendant kept the tenement. His knowledge was not shown. The evidence as to the other barrels was even more objectionable. The opinion of the witness that \u201c J. T. &amp; Co.\u201d meant John Tracy <em>&amp; </em>Company was not competent. The witness could not give his opinion that the barrels came from a noted liquor firm in Albany.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-10\">4. The judge instructed the jury that if \u201c the defendant, was interested in the profits of the business, or was a partner,\u201d he war <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>guilty; but the defendant might be interested in the profits as a compensation for doing some lawful business for Connor, and yet not be a partner, nor a keeper of the tenement.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-5\"><em>O. </em>Allen, Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b499-6\">Moktoe, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABn\">1. The defendant offered evidence to show that there had been an angry controversy between him and Billings, one of the witnesses for the government. The purpose was to affect the credit of Billings. It was competent for the government to show what the nature of the controversy was, so that the jury might judge how far it would bias the witness and affect his credit. The extent to which such inquiry shall be carried is within the discretion of the presiding judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">2. The testimony as to the tags was admissible. It constituted a part of the description of the kegs found at the tenement in question, and in connection with the evidence of the defendant\u2019s continued presence there, and acts of control, had some tendency to show that he was still keeping the tenement. It was for the jury to say whether the kegs were thus marked with his knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">3. The testimony of Pettis was admissible. The facts that barrels of liquor, marked with the defendant\u2019s name or initials, arrived at the depot, and were, in part or in whole, taken off by teams running to this tenement, if known to the defendant, were competent to show that he still kept the place; and the request of the defendant to the witness not to say anything about his having liquors coming there, and the other evidence in the case, would authorize the jury to find that he knew that the barrels were thus marked. The statement of the witness that he supposed the mark \u201c J. T. &amp; Co.\u201d meant John Tracy &amp; Company of Albany, furnishes no ground for a new trial. If the witness knew, by the admission of the defendant or otherwise, that the initials were those of John Tracy <em>&amp; </em>Company, the evidence was competent. It does not appear that he had not such knowledge. Nor does it appear that John Tracy &amp; Company were, as is now claimed, \u201c a noted liquor firm in Albany.\u201d The bill of exceptions does not show that the testimony was incompetent, nor that it was material.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>4. The instructions were sufficiently favorable to the defendant. The only part now objected to is the ruling that, if the Refendant \u201cwas interested in the profits of the business, or was a partner, he could be held under this indictment.\u201d The argument of the defendant\u2019s counsel is, that this ruling authorized the jury to convict the defendant, if he was not a partner, but was to receive a part of the profits as compensation for doing any lawful business for Connor. But we think it is clear from the context, that the instruction meant that he must be interested in the profits as a proprietor of the tenement, and must have been so understood by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap8\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled!.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
