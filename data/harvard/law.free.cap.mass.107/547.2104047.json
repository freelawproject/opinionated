The answer set up the statute of frauds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>At the trial in the superior court, before Pitman, J., the plaintiff testified to the contract as above set forth; and also that bending-stuff was the butts of trees sawed so as to render them suitable to be manufactured into wagon shafts, and that \u201c the defendant was to saw all the logs not suitable for bending-stuff into plank of various dimensions, under the direction of the plaintiff.\u201d The judge ruled that the action could not be maintained, and directed a verdict for the defendant, which was returned; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-5\"><em>A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJB\">As the contract is stated in the bill of exceptions, we think it was a contract to sell and deliver the bending-stuff and plank, and not a contract for labor in manufacturing the articles. It is not therefore like the cases of <em>Mixer </em>v. <em>Howarth, </em>21 Pick. 205, and <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Cone, </em>1 Met. 283; but like <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Joy, </em>9 Met. 177; <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>12 Met. 353; and <em>Waterman </em>v. <em>Meigs, </em>4 Cush. 497 ; and was within the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"A67\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
