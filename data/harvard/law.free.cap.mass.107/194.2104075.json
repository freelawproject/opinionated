Held, that he had no ground of exception to instructions to the jury, that, in the absence of proof of any previous contract to supply milk to the customer, the delivery might be deemed an act of sale; nor to an instruction framed on a supposition that the jury might find that he was in the employment of his father, although there was no averment in the indictment to that effect.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b202-7\">The provision of the St. of 1868, c. 263, \u00a7 2, that the penalties prescribed by \u00a7 1 for knowingly selling adulterated milk may be recovered on* complaint before any court of competent jurisdiction, and one half of the fine imposed go to the complainant or informer, does not exclude the superior court from jurisdiction of an indictment for the offence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b202-8\">A defendant in a criminal case, who obtains by writ of error a reversal of the judgment against him and is thereupon sentenced to a lesser punishment under the Gen.

Whoever sells or exchanges, or has in his possession, with intent to sell or exchange, or offers for sale or exchange, adulterated milk, or milk to which water or any foreign substance has been added, knowing the same to be adulterated or to contain water or any foreign substance, shall, for the first offence, be punished by a fine of one hundred dollars, and, for any subsequent violation, a fine not less than one hundred dollars, nor exceeding three hundred dollars, and imprisonment in the house of correction not less than thirty nor more than ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">\u201c Section 2. The penalties provided in the preceding section, and those provided in the act to which this is in addition, [St. 1864, c. 122,] may he recovered on complaint before any court of competent jurisdiction; and one half of the amount of fine imposed shall go to the complainant or informer, and the remainder to the treasurer of the city or town where the offence was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">\u201c Section 3. It shall he the duty of every inspector of milk to institute complaint on the information of any person who may lay before him satisfactory evidence on which to sustain the same, and he shall be entitled to receive one half the amount of any penalty recovered therefor, and shall pay over the same to the person who has first given him the information on which the complaint was made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b204-9\">Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3t\">The first instruction appears to have been applied to the absence of proof that there was any previous contract for supplying milk to Mary Cogan, or any express contract of sale at the time of delivery. The instruction, that a delivery of' milk by a dealer to a customer might be deemed an act of sale, was correct, and proper to be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">The instruction was also correct that both parties engaged in the distribution of milk from the same wagon, and cooperating therein, knowing it to be adulterated, were severally liable, as well as jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">The act of sale is the same, and the offence the same, whether the defendant sold for himself or for another.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">At April term 1871 of the superior court, after this decision, the defendant filed a motion to arrest the judgment for want ol jurisdiction of the offence, and <em>Dewey, </em>J., by his request, reported the question for the determination cf this court, before whom it was argued in November 1871.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Heard, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"A4l\">By the St. of 1868, <em>c. </em>263, \u00a7 2, the superior court had not original, but only an appellate jurisdiction. The term \u201c complaint \u201d is technical, descriptive of proceedings before magistrates. Shaw, C. J., in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>11 Pick. 432, 436. See also <em>Rex </em>v. Robinson, 2 Burr. 799, 805; <em>Commonwealth </em>v.

The mention of other methods of proceeding impliedly excludes that by indictment 2 Hawk. <em>c. </em>25, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b205-5\"><em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL7\">This is an indictment under the St. of 1868, <em>c. </em>263, \u00a7 1, for selling adulterated milk, knowing the same to be adulterated. The penalty for the first offence is $100. By \u00a7 2, the penalty may be recovered on complaint before any court of competent jurisdiction. The defendant contends that the word \u201c complaint \u201d is technical; and that the language of the statute is exclusive, and does not authorize an indictment. But the usual import of the term \u201c may,\u201d as used in the statute, is permissive, and not exclusive; and the whole legislation on the subject shows it to be so in this case. By the Gen. Sts. <em>o. </em>114, \u00a7 6, the superior court has jurisdiction of all crimes, offences and misdemeanors. By <em>e. </em>176, \u00a7 2, when the fine does not exceed $100, police courts have jurisdiction concurrently with the superior court. The method of prosecution in the superior court is by indictment, and not by complaint; but in the police court it is by complaint; and the words \u201c may be recovered on complaint before any court of competent jurisdiction, and one half of the amount of fine imposed shall go to the complainant or informer,\u201d are used here with reference to the appropriation of the fine in cases where there is a complainant, and not for the purpose of excluding the jurisdiction of the superior court in cases where no person desires to obtain a part of the fine. We think the superior court has jurisdiction to proceed by indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar0\"><em>Motion </em>overruled.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b206-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>Heard, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b206-8\"><em>Q. B. Train, </em>Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Judgment and sentence to pay a fine of $300 were then rendered by the superior court against the defendant, who ther\u00e9upon sued out a</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Writ of error to reverse the judgment for the reason that the indictment did not aver any previous violation of the statute by him and therefore no other punishment than a fine of $100 was warranted by its provisions. The judgment was reversed, with the consent of the attorney general, and judgment and sentence for a fine of $100 were rendered in this court under the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>146, \u00a7 16, which provide that, \u201c when a final judgment in a criminal case is reversed by the supreme judicial court on account of error in the sentence, the court may render such judgment therein as should have been rendered, or may remand the case for that purpose to the court before which the conviction was had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The plaintiff in error moved for costs, under \u00a7 17, which provides that \u201c if the defendant in a criminal case is discharged on a writ of error, the legal costs shall be borne by the Commonwealth; \u201d and the motion was argued in March 1872.</p>\n<author id=\"b206-9\">Gray, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aig\">The provision, now incorporated into the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>146, \u00a7 17, that if the defendant in a criminal case is discharged upon a writ of error the legal costs shall be borne by the Commonwealth, was first enacted by St. 1842, <em>e. </em>54, \u00a7 3. At that time, upon the reversal of a judgment in error for excess in the sentence, the only judgment which could be given was for the discharge of the prisoner. <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Met. <em>419 Britton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 1 </em>Cush. 302. The subsequent enactment of St. 1851, <em>c. </em>87, repeated in the Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>146, \u00a7 16, authorizing this court, upon reversing a judgment for error in the sentence, to render such judgment as should have been rendered, or to remit the case for that purpose to the court before which the conviction was had, cannot be construed to deprive a party'of his costs, who has prevailed upon the writ of error; and in effect obtained his discharge from the original judgment, al though he is sentenced anew to a lesser punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">\n<em>Judgment for costs against the Commonwealth</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
