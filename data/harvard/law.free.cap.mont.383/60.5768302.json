We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">Issue One: Whether Russell received effective assistance of counsel at trial based upon allegations that counsel failed to research and understand the principles of felony murder; failed to properly move for dismissal of that charge; and failed to offer proper instructions on felony murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">Issue Two: Whether Russell received effective assistance of counsel on appeal based upon allegations that counsel failed to understand the principles of felony murder and failed to attack the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction of that charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">\u00b63 On April 25, 2005, Russell and an acquaintance named Spotted Wolf spent a day \u201cdrinking across Billings.\u201d In the middle of the night they went into an alley-type area behind some buildings to continue drinking in a place where they would not be seen by police. In the alley Spotted Wolf saw a sleeping transient (Wallin). Spotted Wolf confronted Wallin, striking him with his hands, demanding alcohol or money. Russell then handed Spotted Wolf a knife that Russell had stolen earlier in the day, and Spotted Wolf used it to slash Wallin across the face. Spotted Wolf then gave the knife back to Russell, telling him to show what he was made of and what he could do. Russell used the knife to stab Wallin several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">\u00b64 Russell then walked a few steps to where another transient (Gewanski) was sleeping. Russell beat Gewanski and stabbed him multiple times with the knife, killing him. Russell walked back to Wallin, and he and Spotted Wolf continued the assault as Wallin tried to get away. Another man named Rideshorse was present and intervened to stop the renewed attack on Wallin. Russell struck Rideshorse and said \u201cLet\u2019s do this guy.\u201d Spotted Wolf declined, and he and Russell fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">\u00b65 Rideshorse went out into the street and hailed a police car. Wallin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>was seriously and permanently injured by Russell and Spotted Wolf. Upon arrest, police found blood from both Wallin and Gewanski on Russell\u2019s clothing. Police recovered the knife from Spotted Wolf and DNA from both victims was on it. Spotted Wolf pled guilty to charges of deliberate homicide by accountability, to aggravated assault and to robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b66 The State charged Russell with deliberate homicide for the death of Gewanski (charged as felony murder under \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA); aggravated assault upon Wallin; accountability for Spotted Wolfs robbery of Wallin; and accountability for Spotted Wolfs aggravated assault of Wallin. The State charged the aggravated assault upon Wallin as the underlying felony to support the felony murder charge against Russell. In May 2005 a jury in Yellowstone County convicted Russell of each of the charged offenses, and the District Court sentenced Russell to terms of imprisonment. Russell appealed to this Court, which reversed the conviction for aggravated assault against Wallin because it was an included offense of the charge of felony murder. This Court affirmed the remainder of the convictions. State <em>v. Russell, </em>2008 MT 417, 347 Mont. 301, 198 P.3d 271 <em>(Russell I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b67 In March 2010 the Criminal Defense Clinic at the University of Montana School of Law filed a petition for postconviction relief on behalf of Russell. The petition contended that Russell\u2019s trial counsel were ineffective for failing to argue that the murder of Gewanski did not occur in the course of the assault on Wallin, and therefore the facts did not support the charge of felony murder. The petition further contended that Russell\u2019s appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that the aggravated assault on Wallin was not sufficiently casually related to the attack on Gewanski to support the felony murder charge. Eventually Russell filed an amended and a second amended petition; the State responded; and both sides filed affidavits. The District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing on March 19, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b68 Several witnesses testified at the hearing on postconviction relief. Penny Strong was Russell\u2019s lead attorney at trial and at that time was the Chief Public Defender for Yellowstone County. She testified that she was experienced in the defense of homicide cases, and that she had an adequate support staff and an excellent investigator who identified and interviewed witnesses and examined the physical evidence. Strong personally examined the crime scene, describing it as a passage between two buildings, covering a very small area. She estimated that the distance between the attack upon Wallin and the attack upon Gewanski was smaller than the courtroom in which the hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>held. She testified that \u201cthere really wasn\u2019t a separate crime scene for the homicide that involved Mr. Gewanski. It was all one in the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Alx\">\u00b69 In a statement, Spotted Wolf described the distance between the attack upon Wallin and the attack upon Gewanski as \u201ca few steps.\u201d The District Court found that the area in which the crimes occurred was small, 30 to 40 feet long, and that both assaults \u201cwere committed <em>close in time and space\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b610 Strong testified that she researched felony murder issues and their application to Russell\u2019s case. She was unable to provide details of the research because she no longer worked as a Public Defender and her work materials were not available to her for review prior to the hearing. She was familiar with felony murder charges and believed that from the defense perspective they made convictions easier to obtain. She recalled raising these concerns in her trial brief and through proposed jury instructions. She believed that a specific unanimity instruction was important in the context of a felony murder charge and she offered one, which the District Court refused. She made a general motion to dismiss all charges at the close of the State\u2019s casein-chief, based upon failure of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b611 Strong testified that she could not find any evidence to support Russell\u2019s claim that he was not present at the assaults and the murder. She stated that the State offered plea agreements to both Russell and Spotted Wolf; that Spotted Wolf accepted the plea agreement; and that Russell rejected it and chose to go to trial. She understood that the State\u2019s theory of felony murder against Russell was that he started the chain of events that led to Gewanski\u2019s death by giving his knife to Spotted Wolf to use in the initial attack upon Wallin. Strong\u2019s co-counsel, attorney Claus, explained that prior to sentencing he filed a motion on double jeopardy grounds to dismiss the felony murder predicate offense of assault. In doing so, he argued that the attack upon Wallin and the attack upon Gewanski were part of the same transaction and that therefore the aggravated assault was a lesser included offense of the homicide charge. That argument was ultimately successful in this Court on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u00b612 Mark Murphy, the chief criminal deputy for the Yellowstone County Attorney, prosecuted the case against Russell. He testified that he had no doubt that the death of Gewanski happened during the course of the assault upon Wallin. Murphy described his opinion of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">With the review of all the evidence we had at the time, it seemed that all of the homicide flowed from the initial robbery, that that was the motivating factor that tied all of the activity together, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>was the cause of the homicide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">He described the factual connection between the events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">Well, it \u2014 it\u2019s all part of a kind of a seamless whole, I mean there isn\u2019t any break in the action, <em>it happened in a very, very short time span, it happened in a very small area. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU1\">Murphy believed that the evidence demonstrated that Spotted Wolfs assault upon Wallin was the \u201cprecipitating factor\u201d in the events but that \u201cit\u2019s impossible to separate out any one factor, they all moved in that direction [the murder of Gewanski] and followed from the underlying felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u00b613 Murphy affirmed that during the course of the trial there were extensive discussions among the District Court, the prosecution, and defense counsel about felony murder, the analysis of continuous conduct, and numerous Montana cases bearing upon the felony murder issues. He recalled that there was a \u201cvery vigorous discussion\u201d about jury instructions and that \u201cMs. Strong put forward her theory of the case in a very professional manner.\u201d Murphy also testified that Strong was \u201cextremely competent\u201d during the trial, giving as an example her cross-examination of witness Rideshorse, which raised points that the prosecution had not previously considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\u00b6 14 Attorney Shannon McDonald, as an Assistant Appellate Defender, prepared the brief for Russell\u2019s direct appeal to this Court. She testified that her analysis of the trial evidence convinced her that it did not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">permit an argument that the assaults on one victim were a separate transaction from the homicide of the other victim, or that there was a temporal break between the attacks. My memory of the evidence presented was that <em>the crimes occurred in a short period of time, in a relatively small place, with the victims close together. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">She testified that the evidence presented at trial did not support an argument that the crimes were separate transactions. She believed that the events, starting with the attack on Wallin and ending with the murder of Gewanski, were <em>\u201cinextricably tied together.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">\u00b615 On July 8,2014, the District Court issued detailed findings of fact regarding Russell\u2019s postconviction claims that his attorneys at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>and on appeal provided him with ineffective assistance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court found that Strong understood the felony murder charge and the evidence that the State would present. The District Court found that Strong had adequate time to prepare and that after examining the crime scene she believed that the assault on Wallin and the death of Gewanski did not involve \u201ctwo crime scenes.\u201d She understood the State\u2019s theory of the case that the assault on Wallin \u201cstarted the incident that included the death of Gewanski.\u201d The District Court found that \u201cStrong understood the charge correctly.\u201d She \u201cresearched application of the felony murder rule\u201d; believed that it made a conviction more likely; and believed that the specific unanimity instruction that she offered would address her concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b616 The District Court found that the crime scene was small and that \u201cthe events were committed close in time and space.\u201d The entire scene from where Wallin was assaulted to where Gewanski was killed was \u201conly about 30-40 feet long.\u201d The District Court noted the testimony of attorneys Kelleher and Snodgrass, who represented co-defendant Spotted Wolf. They investigated the scene and the facts and were \u201cwell aware of the nature of the events.\u201d They ultimately concluded that the State had properly charged their client. Spotted Wolf pled guilty to charges of deliberate homicide by accountability, to aggravated assault and to robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b617 As to appellate counsel McDonald, the District Court found that she raised three issues on appeal, one of which was the successful argument that Russell could not be convicted of both felony murder and the predicate offense of assault. The District Court noted that McDonald believed at the time of direct appeal that the trial evidence did not permit an argument that the Wallin and Gewanski attacks were separate and unrelated events. At the time of the postconviction hearing, McDonald still construed the evidence that way, and did not agree with Russell\u2019s arguments on application of the felony murder statute. The District Court noted the testimony of prosecutor Murphy that his construction of the facts was that \u201cthe initial assault [against Wallin] with the knife caused everything that happened after that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">\u00b618 The District Court noted the testimony of Assistant Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Defender Koan Mercer, who represented Russell on direct appeal after attorney McDonald left her appellate defender position. Mercer testified that in his opinion there was insufficient evidence at trial to support a felony murder conviction based upon his belief that there were separate crimes involving the two victims. Mercer testified that no reasonable attorney could hold a different opinion and that failure to reach such a conclusion fell below the duty of care for attorneys. Because McDonald construed the facts differently, Mercer testified that she provided ineffective assistance to Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b619 The District Court acknowledged the conflicting testimony on the viability of the felony murder charge under the facts of Russell\u2019s case. The District Court found that Strong provided zealous representation throughout the trial, understood the charges, and was knowledgeable and prepared. The District Court concluded that Strong\u2019s representation was \u201canything but ineffective.\u201d The District Court similarly found that on appeal McDonald understood the felony murder charge and that after a \u201cthorough review of the record\u201d determined that it did not support a two-crimes argument. The District Court found that McDonald\u2019s representation did not breach the standard of care and was not ineffective. The District Court concluded that it was \u201centirely reasonable\u201d for McDonald to interpret the evidence as showing that the assault and the homicide were \u201cinextricably intertwined.\u201d The District Court determined that it was reasonable for McDonald to conclude that the homicide would not have occurred but for the predicate felony of the assault on Wallin.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b620 The District Court concluded that there was \u201cno defect in the charging\u201d of felony murder and no deficiency in the State\u2019s proof of the charge. The District Court concluded that Russell failed to establish that his attorneys at trial and on appeal were ineffective with regard to the felony murder charge. The District Court concluded that Russell killed Gewanski \u201cin furtherance of the initial aggravated assault\u201d upon Wallin. The District Court concluded that when Spotted Wolf paused his attack upon Wallin, handed the knife back to Russell and then exhorted him to show what he\u2019s made of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\"><em>Russell then acted immediately </em>in furtherance of that initial aggravated assault by further escalating the violence against another victim. There was no break in time or space. These events took place within feet of one another.... The homicide occurred because of Spotted Wolfs aggravated assault. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACr\">The District Court concluded that this was sufficient to support the charge and conviction for felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b621 The District Court denied Russell\u2019s petition for postconviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>relief. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b622 This case arises from a petition for postconviction relief filed pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA. A district court considering a petition for postconviction relief may hold an evidentiary hearing, \u00a7 46-21-201, MCA, and must enter findings of fact and conclusions of law, \u00a7 46-21-202, MCA. The petition may not be based upon grounds for relief that were or could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal. <em>Rukes v. State, </em>2013 MT 56, \u00b6 8, 369 Mont. 215, 297 P.3d 1195; \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. The petition must identify all facts that support the claims for relief, <em>Kelly v. State, </em>2013 MT 21, \u00b6 9,368 Mont. 309, 300 P.3d 120, and the petitioner has the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the facts justify relief. <em>Griffin v. State, </em>2003 MT 267, \u00b6 10, 317 Mont. 457, 77 P.3d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b623 We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Brimstone Mining, Inc. v. Glaus, </em>2003 MT 236, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 236, 77 P.3d 175. A finding of fact may be clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record; if the district court misapprehended the evidence; or when our review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Brimstone, </em>\u00b6 20. A district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is a conclusion of law which we review for correctness. <em>Montana State Fund v. Simms, </em>2012 MT 22, \u00b6 15, 364 Mont. 14, 270 P.3d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\u00b624 This Court evaluates claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the test established in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. First the defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient by demonstrating that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 14. There is a strong presumption that the attorney\u2019s performance fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance, <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 15, because there are \u201ccountless ways to provide reasonable assistance in any given case.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065. A petitioner seeking to reverse a district court\u2019s order denying postconviction relief based upon an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel has a heavy burden. <em>Bomar v. State, </em>2012 MT 163, \u00b6 5, 365 Mont. 474, 285 P.3d 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\u00b625 Second, the defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10. This requires a showing of a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b626 <em>Issue One: Whether Russell received effective assistance of counsel at trial based upon allegations that counsel failed to research and understand the principles of felony murder; failed to properly move for dismissal of that charge; and failed to offer proper instructions on felony murder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b627 The offense referred to as felony murder is provided by \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">(1) A person commits the offense of deliberate homicide if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">(b) the person attempts to commit, commits, or is legally accountable for the attempt or commission of robbery, sexual intercourse without consent, arson, burglary, kidnapping, aggravated kidnapping, felonious escape, assault with a weapon, aggravated assault, or any other forcible felony and in the course of the forcible felony or flight thereafter, the person or any person legally accountable for the crime causes the death of another human being....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The underlying or predicate felony is \u201cboth an included offense and an element of felony homicide.\u201d NusseZZ <em>I, </em>\u00b6 24. The only causal connection required to constitute felony murder is that \u201cthe death actually occurred during the underlying felony or the flight thereafter.\u201d <em>State v. Burkhart, </em>2004 MT 372, \u00b6 36, 325 Mont. 27, 103 P.3d 1037. When a person commits a felony like aggravated assault, he initiates conduct that creates a dangerous circumstance, and the intent to commit the felony supplies the intent for the consequences that arise from it. <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">\u00b628 Russell contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial because his attorneys failed to adequately research the law on felony murder and then \u201cproceeded under a fundamental misunderstanding of its elements.\u201d Russell contends that the fundamental correlation of \u201ctime and place\u201d between the underlying felony and the death, as well as a causal connection between the underlying (predicate) felony and the death are all missing from this case. He contends that all of the attorneys involved in the case, both prosecution and defense, fundamentally misconstrued the facts and the law by assuming that \u201cclose proximity of time and place was sufficient to prove felony murder.\u201d He contends that if only his attorneys had understood this, and had made the proper motions and arguments, he would not have been convicted of felony murder. Russell contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the District Court fundamentally erred in the present proceeding by concluding that Spotted Wolfs exhortation of Russell to \u201csee what he could do\u201d with the knife constituted the underlying felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b629 The District Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law do not support Russell\u2019s contentions. The District Court and all the attorneys involved on both sides of the prosecution against Russell (except for Mr. Mercer) generally agreed about the facts and how they related to felony murder. The amended information in Russell\u2019s case clearly establishes the aggravated assault upon Wallin as the predicate or underlying felony in the felony murder charge. There is no support for Russell\u2019s assertion that the District Court (or any of the attorneys) failed to understand this. Specifically there is no support for Russell\u2019s assertion that the District Court determined that Spotted Wolfs exhortation of Russell after handing back the knife \u201cconstituted the underlying felony.\u201d That assertion makes little sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b630 The fact that Spotted Wolf handed the knife back to Russell and exhorted him to do something is, however, critical in analyzing the <em>causal </em>connection of the events that began when Russell and Spotted Wolf entered the alley and that ended with Gewanski\u2019s death. The overwhelming evidence is that the events in this assault and murder spree occurred in a small area in a very short period of time. Those facts lay the groundwork for determining whether there was a causal connection to the events that then happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b631 As detailed in the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, the events of that evening were set in motion when Spotted Wolf began the assault upon Wallin in an attempt to extort alcohol or money from him. The facts demonstrate that the assault dramatically escalated when Russell handed Spotted Wolf the knife Russell had stolen earlier in the evening. Spotted Wolf used Russell\u2019s knife to slash the hapless Wallin across the face and then he returned the knife to Russell with an admonition or exhortation to do something with it. Russell took the knife the short distance to where Gewanski slept and stabbed and killed him. Russell then immediately returned to Wallin, and he and Spotted Wolf continued the initial assault, from which Wallin narrowly escaped with his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b632 These events form a continuing narrative from the assault to the murder. While Spotted Wolfs exhortation of Russell to do something with the knife was an important factor, there is no support for Russell\u2019s assertion that the District Court (or anyone else) considered the exhortation itself to be the underlying felony. \u201cThe felony homicide charge in Count 1 was predicated on the charge for aggravated assault in Count II.\u201d <em>Russell I, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u00b633  the District Court properly determined, murder took place in close proximity as to time and place, and the murder flowed in a continuous series of actions from the assault against Wallin by both Spotted Wolf and Russell. Therefore Russell was properly charged with and convicted of felony murder. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, and Russell has not met his burden to demonstrate that the facts as found by the District Court were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"AUm\">\u00b634 The District Court found, after hearing the testimony of those directly involved, that lead trial attorney Strong properly understood the charge and the facts. The District Court, having presided over both Russell\u2019s trial and the postconviction relief proceeding, was in a unique position to evaluate the performance of trial counsel with regard to the felony murder charge. Russell failed to establish at the postconviction hearing that attorney Strong was deficient as a matter of fact, and failed to establish on appeal that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact in that regard were clearly erroneous. Russell has not demonstrated that the legal assistance provided to him fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 14. Russell has not overcome the strong presumption that the attorney\u2019s performance fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance, <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b635  Further, Russell failed to demonstrate that the outcome of the trial would have been any different had Strong argued that the events in this case were insufficient to constitute felony murder. There is no showing that such an argument would have been successful in avoiding the charge of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b636 We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s decision that Russell did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b637 <em>Issue Two: Whether Russell received effective assistance of counsel on appeal based upon allegations that counsel failed to understand the principles of felony murder and failed to attack the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction of that charge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b638 All of these same considerations lead to the conclusion that the District Court correctly determined that attorney McDonald did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal. The District Court found that the evidence showed that McDonald understood the law on felony murder, that she thoroughly reviewed the trial record, and that she determined that the evidence would not support an argument that the facts failed to support the charge of felony murder. Rather, she adopted a strategy, which was ultimately successful, to challenge the convictions for both the homicide and the underlying predicate felony assault. Other than offering attorney Mercer\u2019s opinion, the most that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Russell established below was that attorneys might disagree about how to apply the facts of this case to the felony murder statute. The District Court properly determined that McDonald\u2019s performance did not fall below the objective standard of reasonableness for attorney representation. As noted above, there are \u201ccountless ways to provide reasonable assistance in any given case.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b639 We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s decision that Russell did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b640 We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to deny Russell\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-7\">JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-6\"> The District Court noted that Russell\u2019s petition for postconviction relief raised numerous other allegations that were not addressed at the hearing, but that were also not withdrawn. In the present appeal Russell has likewise focused on the IAC claims and has not addressed the other issues. We have no basis to review any other claims and decline to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b95-8\">JUSTICE COTTER,</author>\n<p id=\"ARZ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">\u00b641 The Court concludes that the District Court and the attorneys on both sides of the case generally agreed about how the facts related to and established felony murder. Opinion, \u00b6 28. Respectfully, I disagree. There was confusion \u2014 not agreement \u2014 about what constituted the predicate felony for the felony murder charge. In addition, there was a failure of proof of a causal connection between the two crimes so as to satisfy the requirements of the felony murder rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">\u00b642 At \u00b6 6, the Court asserts that the State charged the aggravated assault upon Wallin as the underlying felony to support the felony murder charge; notably, the Court does not state whether it was Spotted Horse\u2019s aggravated assault of Wallin or Russell\u2019s aggravated assault of Wallin that constituted the predicate offense. (Both were charged with aggravated assault.) Trial counsel Penny Strong testified that the basis of the felony murder charge against Russell was that Russell started the chain of events by giving his knife to Spotted Wolf, who used it in the initial assault upon Wallin. Opinion, \u00b6 11. The District Court concluded that the predicate felony was <em>Spotted Wolfs </em>assault on Wallin. Opinion, \u00b6 20. However, this Court concluded in Russell\u2019s direct appeal that the predicate offense was <em>Russell\u2019s </em>assault upon Wallin. <em>Russell I, </em>\u00b6 28. The fact that there is still no clarity about whose offense constituted the predicate for the felony murder charge against Russell underscores the flaw in the manner in which this case was charged and tried, and the ineffective assistance of trial counsel in failing to grasp the elements of the felony murder rule and pin down who committed the predicate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">\u00b643 If as the District Court concluded, the predicate felony was Spotted Wolfs assault on Wallin, then under \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>would arguably be he who would be guilty of felony murder, not Russell, because he would be the person who committed a felony and in the course of that felony became accountable for the death of Gewanski. Spotted Wolfs malicious intent for the predicate offense cannot be transferred to Russell. As we stated in <em>State v. Weinberger, </em>206 Mont. 110, 115, 671 P.2d 567, 569 (1983): \u201cIn adjudging a felony-murder, it is to be remembered at all times that the thing which is imputed to a felon for a killing incidental to <em>his </em>felony is malice and not the act of killing.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b644 I also submit trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the charge of felony homicide given the circumstances of the two crimes. Regardless of whose act constituted the predicate offense, the fact is that no causal connection existed between the aggravated assault on Wallin and the death of Gewanski. According to Spotted Wolfs testimony at trial, after he and Russell slashed and stabbed Wallin, he and Russell then decided <em>\u201cto go </em>around to the other side [of the building] and just leave out to the North Side\u201d; however, when they discovered their passage through that end of the alley was blocked, \u201cwe just stopped for, you know, not too long, we just stood there and then, you know, [Russell] went over here ... [and] he was hitting another person\u201d (Gewanski). <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 51 (Nelson, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b645 In order for the felony murder rule to apply, \u201ca causal connection between the felonious act and the death must be present.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Murphy v. McKinnon, </em>171 Mont. 120, 127, 556 P.2d 906, 910 (1976). As Justice Nelson observed in his dissent in \u00b6 53 of <em>Russell I, </em>we quoted with approval these statements by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in State <em>v. Weinberger, </em>206 Mont. 110, 671 P.2d 567 (1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">The mere coincidence of homicide and felony is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the felony-murder doctrine. It is necessary ... to show that the conduct causing death was done in furtherance of the design to commit the felony. Death must be a consequence of the felony... and not merely coincidence. (Internal quotations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The facts as related by Spotted Wolf simply do not establish that the stabbing of Gewanski was done \u201cin furtherance of the design to commit\u201d a robbery or assault upon Wallin. Gewanski\u2019s death was not a consequence of the assault upon Wallin; his death was the result of a spontaneous drunken decision by Russell to kill a person sleeping by a dumpster who had no connection whatsoever to Wallin.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\u00b646 For these reasons, I would conclude that trial counsel was ineffective. I would further conclude that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the State\u2019s proof of a causal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>connection between the two crimes so as to justify the felony murder conviction, as well as the District Court\u2019s conclusion that it was Spotted Wolfs actions that constituted the predicate felony for the charge of felony murder against Russell. I therefore dissent from the Court\u2019s Opinion. I would add that all of these problems could have been forestalled had the State charged and tried this case in a straightforward manner in the first place.</p>\n<judges id=\"b97-4\">JUSTICE McKINNON joins in the Dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
