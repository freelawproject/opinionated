Mossberg &amp; Sons, Inc., and Burns Auction &amp; Appraisal, LLC (collectively \u201cMossberg\u201d), appeal the Order of the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, granting Luke and Stephanie Keuffers\u2019 motion to disqualify Mossberg\u2019s counsel. The District Court disqualified Mossberg\u2019s out-of-state counsel, Renzulli Law Firm, and its local counsel, Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher, pursuant to Rule 1.20(c) of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct. The basis for the court\u2019s disqualification order was a prospective client consultation that Luke Keuffer had with an attorney from Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher, which was later used in a deposition of Stephanie Keuffer by John Renzulli of the Renzulli Law Firm. The court found that the continued involvement in the case by Mossberg\u2019s counsel gave the Keuffers reason to question whether their case can proceed fairly and cause to question what they may have disclosed in the consultation to Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher that may later be used against them in the current litigation. The court also found that Mossberg\u2019s counsel\u2019s actions undermine the public\u2019s trust in the legal profession. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order disqualifying Renzulli and Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">\u00b62 We restate the dispositive issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-14\">\n<em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in disqualifying Mossberg\u2019s counsel.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b63 In October 2008, Luke Keuffer (\u201cLuke\u201d) and his wife, Stephanie Keuffer (\u201cStephanie\u201d), were hunting outside White Sulfur Springs, Montana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stephanie was hunting with a .308 Mossberg model 800 rifle (\u201cMossberg rifle\u201d). The Keuffers allege that the Mossberg rifle fell and struck Luke\u2019s rifle and then discharged and shot Luke in the face, causing serious and permanent injury. On August 10, 2010, Luke called Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher, PLLC, and spoke to attorney Margaret Weamer \u201cregarding [Luke\u2019s] possible claim against [a] gun manufacturer for injuries sustained in [a] hunting accident.\u201d Weamer\u2019s time record indicates that she spoke with Luke for six to twelve minutes. After discussing the case with Luke, Weamer advised him that Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher would not be interested in taking the case.</p>\n<p id=\"AB_\">\u00b64 Luke and Stephanie retained other counsel and, in June 2011, filed a personal injury action against Mossberg. Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher later agreed to represent Mossberg as local counsel against Luke in the litigation. Prior to agreeing to represent Mossberg, Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher ran a conflict check that revealed the phone conversation between Luke and Weamer. Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher determined that the phone conversation did not create a conflict with their representation of Mossberg. The firm disclosed the phone conversation to Mossberg\u2019s national counsel John Renzulli \u2014 who appears pro hac vice in this case \u2014 but did not disclose the phone conversation to Luke\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"A3V\">\u00b65 The Keuffers\u2019 counsel remained unaware of the telephone conversation between Luke and Weamer until Renzulli deposed Stephanie on June 24-25, 2014. Renzulli began his deposition of Stephanie with an inquiry into other law firms that the Keuffers may have consulted regarding this case. Five questions into the deposition, Renzulli asked Stephanie: \u201cDid anyone from - either you or Luke have any conversations with anybody from Tarlow - T-A-R-L-O-W - Law Firm here in Bozeman?\u201d When Stephanie responded that she did not remember, Renzulli pushed forward, stating: \u201cAll right. Let me be very direct .... This was not the first law firm that you talked to, correct, about taking this case?\u201d When Stephanie acknowledged that she had made calls to other law firms before the Keuffers hired their current counsel, Renzulli followed up with the ensuing exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">Q. [W]hen you made a couple of calls, did some of the firms say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>that they weren\u2019t interested in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\">A. Yeah. I don\u2019t remember who, which firms they were exactly, though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">Q. So you told them the facts, and they weren\u2019t interested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">A. Pretty much, yeah, from what I can remember.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u00b66 Following the deposition, the Keuffers filed a motion to disqualify both Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher and the Renzulli Law Firm, LLP, based on the consultation between Luke and Weamer, and Renzulli\u2019s use of the consultation at Stephanie\u2019s deposition. Mossberg opposed the motion and filed two affidavits from Weamer regarding her recollection of the phone conversation with Luke. Mossberg also requested a hearing to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">\u00b67 The District Court held a hearing on April 10, 2015. During the hearing, the District Court questioned both Weamer and Renzulli. The court specifically questioned Renzulli regarding why he asked Stephanie about contacting other law firms during the deposition. Renzulli responded that he typically asks such questions in these types of cases because he likes \u201cto know if [the plaintiffs are] shopping the case.\u201d Renzulli indicated further that he intended to introduce that information at trial. The District Court permitted Weamer to testify for the limited purpose of addressing the conflict check conducted by Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher. She confirmed that Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher did not disclose the conflict check results to the Keuffers\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">\u00b68 Following the hearing, the District Court issued an order granting the Keuffers\u2019 motion to disqualify both Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher and the Renzulli firm. The District Court determined that Mossberg\u2019s counsel violated Rule 1.20(b) and (c). The court found that Renzulli improperly used the Keuffers\u2019 consultation against them during Stephanie\u2019s deposition. The court found that the purpose of Renzulli\u2019s questioning was to intimidate the Keuffers and create an impression they have a bad case. The court indicated the uniqueness of the situation as Renzulli did not use \u201cinformation learned\u201d from the consultation, but used the fact that the consultation occurred. The court concluded that this was equally a violation of the Rules because Renzulli used the consultation to intimidate and create an adverse inference about the Keuffers\u2019 case. The District Court disqualified Mossberg\u2019s counsel because their actions defeat the purpose of the Rules of Professional Conduct which threatens the public\u2019s trust in the legal system. Mossberg appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">\u00b69 A district court possesses broad discretion in ruling on a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>to disqualify counsel. We review a court\u2019s grant of a motion to disqualify for an abuse of discretion. <em>Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 26, 303 Mont. 274, 16 P.3d 1002. A district court abuses its discretion when \u201cit acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 248, \u00b6 53, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649. Application of the Rules of Professional Conduct to a given set of facts is a question of law; \u201c[u]ltimately, it is this Court\u2019s \u2018constitutional mandate to fashion and interpret the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Krutzfeldt Ranch, LLC v. Pinnacle Bank, </em>2012 MT 15, \u00b6 15, 363 Mont. 366, 272 P.3d 635 (quoting In <em>re Rules of Prof'l Conduct, </em>2000 MT 110, \u00b6 9, 299 Mont. 321, 2 P.3d 806). As a question of law, the district court\u2019s application of the Rules to disqualify an attorney is reviewed for correctness. <em>In re Marriage of Perry, </em>2013 MT 6, \u00b6 16, 368 Mont. 211, 293 P.2d 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u00b610 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in disqualifying Mossberg\u2019s counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\u00b611 The Montana Constitution provides that the Montana Supreme Court may \u201cmake rules governing ... admission to the bar and the conduct of its members.\u201d Mont. Const. art. VII, sect. 2, cl. 3; <em>See also Harlen v. City of Helena, </em>208 Mont. 45, 49, 676 P.2d 191, 193 (1984) (concluding the Court possesses exclusive authority to promulgate rules governing the conduct of attorneys); <em>Schuff </em>\u00b6 33 (upholding the Court\u2019s authority in all matters involving the conduct of attorneys practicing law in this state); <em>In re Rules of Prof'l Conduct, </em>\u00b6 9 (concluding that this Court has a mandate to fashion and interpret the rules); <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\u00b612 In <em>Schuff, </em>we noted that although a rule violation is not <em>prima facie </em>grounds for disqualification, \u201ca trial court may consider attorney violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct if that misconduct results in prejudice or adversely impacts the rights of the parties in the case pending before it.\u201d <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35-37. There, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">[T]he gravamen of a motion to disqualify is not that an attorney or firm violated one of the conflict of interest rules under our Rules of Professional Conduct (see, <em>e.g., </em>Rules 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.16, M. R. Pro. C.); rather, a motion to disqualify must offer sufficient proof that the continued representation of one party by the attorney or firm will prejudice or adversely impact the rights of another party in the matter pending before the court. Evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>demonstrating that an attorney or firm did, in fact, violate a professional conduct rule merely serves as additional weight that may tip the scales in favor of disqualification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u00b613  The application of the Rules of Professional Conduct in this case turns on how Mossberg\u2019s out-of-state counsel used the information gained from Luke\u2019s prospective client consultation with Mossberg\u2019s local co-counsel and whether that use warranted disqualification. Rule 1.20 governs attorneys in their dealings with prospective clients; it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">(a) A person who consults with or has had consultations with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship with respect to a matter is a prospective client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">(b) Even when no client-lawyer relationship ensues, a lawyer who has had consultations with a prospective client shall not use or reveal information learned in the consultation(s), except as Rule 1.9 would permit with respect to information of a former client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">(c) A lawyer subject to paragraph (b) shall not represent a client with interests materially adverse to those of a prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter if the lawyer received information from the prospective client that could be significantly harmful to that person in the matter, except as provided in paragraph (d). If a lawyer is disqualified from representation under this paragraph, no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in such a matter, except as provided in paragraph (d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">(d) Representation is permissible if both the affected client and the prospective client have given informed consent, confirmed in writing, or:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">(1) the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-12\">(2) written notice is promptly given to the prospective client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVJ3\">M. R. Pro. C. 1.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">The dissent interprets Rule 1.20 narrowly and in a compartmentalized manner. For the Rule to have any teeth and be an effective tool for the district courts to utilize in regulating the conduct of attorneys, it must be broadly construed whereby all the sub-sections work together as a whole. There is a logical progression from one subsection to the next which clearly supports a construction of the Rule as a whole. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>case it is evident that the District Court correctly applied the Rule as a whole in making its decision. While we recognize that disqualification is a harsh remedy, under the circumstances of this case we cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in imposing such a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Rule 1.20(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u00b614 Neither party disputes that under Rule 1.20(a) Luke became a prospective client to Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher when he called the law firm and discussed his case with Weamer. Because Luke was a prospective client of Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher, certain duties were triggered under the Rule. These duties must be followed by the attorneys that participate in the prospective client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Rule 1.20(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">\u00b615  Under Rule 1.20(b), a prospective client\u2019s conversation is protected and no information gained from the consultation may be used or revealed by the lawyer with whom the client consults. The District Court found that Mossberg\u2019s counsel improperly used the Keuffers\u2019 consultation against them during Stephanie\u2019s deposition. The court indicated the uniqueness of the situation as Mossberg did not use \u201cinformation learned\u201d from the consultation, but used the fact that the consultation occurred. The court determined that this was equally a violation of the Rule because Mossberg used the consultation to intimidate the Keuffers and cause them to question the merits of their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u00b616  Mossberg argues on appeal that a conflict occurs not because of the fact of the consultation, but because of the passing of confidential information from the client to the attorney that may be \u201csignificantly harmful.\u201d Mossberg asserts no such information was passed and implies that the \u201cuse\u201d of information as determined by the District Court is error. We disagree. When the fact of a consultation is used to attack and intimidate a party, such conduct constitutes a violation of Rule 1.20 and will support a motion for sanctions, including disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">\u00b617 In his deposition of Stephanie, Renzulli questioned her about Luke\u2019s consultation with Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher. Renzulli\u2019s line of questioning was not idle chit-chat about whether Stephanie was generally familiar with Bozeman law firms and Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher in particular. He began the deposition by questioning her about law firms either she or her husband had contacted about this case. He then asked her point blank whether one of those firms was Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher. Renzulli pressed on by asking, \u201c[s]o you told them the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>facts, and they weren\u2019t interested.\u201d Pertaining to Luke\u2019s consultation with Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher, the record is clear that before he started his deposition of Stephanie, Renzulli knew that Luke had talked to Weamer, provided her with facts about his case, and been told that her firm was not interested. Thus, Renzulli used information learned in the consultation in violation of Rule 1.20(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b618 Rule 1.20(b) does not require that an attorney use a verbatim transcript of the information obtained during a prospective client consultation in order for it to constitute a violation of the rule. Nor does Rule 1.20(b) require that the information used or revealed be \u201csignificantly harmful,\u201d as would be required to form the basis for disqualification under Rule 1.20(c). Rule 1.20(b) places an absolute prohibition against using or revealing <em>any </em>information learned in the consultation. It should be clarified that the mere use of information learned in a prospective client consultation, if inadvertent or harmless, may not by itself form the basis for disqualification. In this case, however, Renzulli consciously used the information learned in Luke\u2019s consultation with Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher for tactical litigation purposes. Specifically, the District Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">[T]he purpose of Renzulli\u2019s questioning regarding the fact that Plaintiffs consulted with Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher was to intimidate Plaintiffs and to create an impression that Plaintiffs have a bad case - so bad that Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher, having heard the facts, decided to represent the Defendants instead of Plaintiffs. Using the consultation in this manner gives Plaintiffs reason to question whether their case can proceed fairly. It also gives Plaintiffs cause to question what they may have disclosed to Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher that may later be used against them. While Plaintiffs claim they cannot remember what they told Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher, they believe they told all attorneys they consulted with the same information and some of that information is harmful to them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_Z\">The District Court also found that Renzulli\u2019s conduct undermined the public\u2019s trust in the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\u00b619 In <em>Schuff, </em>we noted that although a rule violation is not <em>prima facie </em>grounds for disqualification, \u201ca trial court may consider attorney violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct if that misconduct results in prejudice or adversely impacts the rights of the parties in the case pending before it.\u201d <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35, 37. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">[A] motion to disqualify must offer sufficient proof that the continued representation of one party by the attorney or firm will prejudice or adversely impact the rights of another party in the matter pending before the court. Evidence demonstrating that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>attorney or firm did, in fact, violate a professional conduct rule merely serves as additional weight that may tip the scales in favor of disqualification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b620 After finding that Renzulli\u2019s questioning was designed to intimidate the Keuffers and to create an impression that they had a bad case; that it caused the Keuffers to question whether their case can proceed fairly and whether they may have disclosed to Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher information that may later be used against them; and that Renzulli\u2019s conduct undermined the public\u2019s trust in the legal profession, the District Court concluded that disqualification was appropriate. We do not find that this ruling constituted an abuse of the broad discretion the district court possesses when ruling on a motion to disqualify. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 26. Although the District Court did not use the precise words \u201cprejudice or adversely impact the rights of another party,\u201d it does not take the Rosetta Stone to decipher the District Court\u2019s assessment of Renzulli\u2019s conduct. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s Order disqualifying Renzulli.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b621 Mossberg argues the District Court wrongfully imputed the conflict to Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher. The District Court determined that \u201cwhile Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher did not find it necessary to disclose Weamer\u2019s consultation with Luke to Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, they did find it to have sufficient pertinence to inform Renzulli....\u201d The court also determined that because the information came from Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher, it gives the Keuffers reason to question what they may have disclosed to Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher that might later be used against them. Based on these findings, the court imputed Renzulli\u2019s conduct to Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher. Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher are implicated with Renzulli because, after becoming local co-counsel for Mossberg, they communicated the substance of the phone call and thereafter participated in the development and prosecution of the case. The continued participation of Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher in this case would undermine the remedy imposed on Renzulli. Thus, we affirm the District Court\u2019s Order disqualifying Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">\u00b622  The District Court\u2019s disqualification of Renzulli and Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher was not an abuse of discretion. Although the District Court based its ruling on Rule 1.20(c), we conclude the disqualification was proper because of the violation of Rule 1.20(b) and the prejudice to the Keuffers resulting from the violation. It is well-established that a district court\u2019s ruling may be sustained under the \u201cwrong-reason, right-result\u201d appellate rule. <em>Tipp v. Skjelset, </em>1998 MT 263, \u00b6 16, 291 Mont. 288, 967 P.2d 787. The District Court incorrectly relied on Rule 1.20(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>as the basis for disqualifying defense counsel; however, it correctly concluded that Renzulli\u2019s conduct warranted disqualification of Renzulli as well as Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b623 We conclude that defense counsel improperly used information obtained from the prospective client meeting with Luke, causing prejudice to the Keuffers and leading them to question the merits of their case. For this and the additional reasons set forth above, the District Court\u2019s Order disqualifying defense counsel is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b472-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\"> Stephanie and Luke have since divorced and she is now Stephanie Peer.

When Luke Keuffer contacted the Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher firm \u201cabout the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship,\u201d he became a prospective client pursuant to M. R. Prof. Cond. 1.20(a). It is undisputed, however, that the Keuffers never established a client-attorney relationship with the Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher firm. In <em>Perry, </em>we recognized that Rule 1.20 requires examination of whether a lawyer received information from a prospective client that could be significantly harmful to the prospective client in the matter. <em>Perry, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21, 24. We noted that different analyses apply to the duties a lawyer owes to a current or former client. <em>Perry, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19, 22-23. <em>See Pro-Hand Servs. Trust v. Monthei, </em>2002 MT 134, 310 Mont. 165, 49 P.3d 56 (relying on M. R. Prof. Cond. 1.9 \u2014 which applies to former clients \u2014 to determine if there was a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that confidences were disclosed) <em>superseded by rule as stated in Perry, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Krutzfeldt </em>(relying on M. R. Prof. Cond. 1.7 and 1.10 \u2014 which apply to current clients \u2014 to determine whether disqualification is required because counsel breached its duty of loyalty).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">\u00b626 Rule 1.18 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct \u201cis nearly identical\u201d to Montana\u2019s Rule 1.20. Perry, \u00b6 21. Similar to our discussion in <em>Perry, </em>the comments to Model Rule 1.18 make clear that while the rule imposes certain duties on a lawyer relating to prospective clients, those duties do not provide prospective clients with the same protections as the duties imposed on lawyers relating to current or former clients.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">Prospective clients, like clients, may disclose information to a lawyer, place documents or other property in the lawyer\u2019s custody, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>or rely on the lawyer\u2019s advice. A lawyer\u2019s consultations with a prospective client usually are limited in time and depth and leave both the prospective client and the lawyer free (and sometimes required) to proceed no further. <em>Hence, prospective clients should receive some but not all of the protection afforded clients.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Model R. Prof. Cond. 1.18 cmt. 1 (emphasis added). This difference in duties and consequent protections makes sense \u201c[b]ecause the relationship between a prospective client and a lawyer by definition never reaches the stage where the duty of loyalty attaches with full force.\u201d 1 Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. &amp; W. William Hodes, <em>The Law Governing Lawyers </em>\u00a7 21A.6, 21A-15 (3d ed. Supp. 2012). Accordingly, Model Rule 1.18 \u201cimposes a less stringent regime on the lawyer than where actual clients and former clients are involved. Put another way, the protections afforded to prospective clients are not as extensive as those provided to \u2018real\u2019 clients.\u201d Hazard &amp; Hodes, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 21A.6, 21A-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b627 The District Court disqualified Mossberg\u2019s counsel on the basis of Rule 1.20(c). The court concluded properly that, because Luke was a prospective client, \u201cTarlow &amp; Stonecipher is prohibited from using or revealing information learned in the consultation,\u201d and that \u201cif Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher received information from Luke that could be significantly harmful to his case, Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher is prohibited from representing Mossberg in this case.\u201d The court emphasized that Renzulli\u2019s \u201cmotivation\u201d behind his deposition questions to Stephanie was \u201cimproper,\u201d and it found \u201ctroubling\u201d the fact that Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher did not disclose the phone conversation to the Keuffers\u2019 counsel at the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u00b628 The District Court found that Mossberg\u2019s counsel did not use or reveal information learned from the phone conversation in violation of Rule 1.20(b). The court concluded, however, that there was \u201cno reason why the rule should not be equally applicable when an attorney uses the fact that they consulted with a party and declined to represent that party to intimidate that party or to create an adverse inference about that party\u2019s case.\u201d The court concluded further that \u201cknowing that certain information was not disclosed may be just as harmful as information that was disclosed.\u201d The District Court made no finding that Luke disclosed information that could be significantly harmful to him in the case, and acknowledged that \u201cit is not clear what information was disclosed/learned during Luke\u2019s 6-12 minute consultation with Weamer.\u201d It found nonetheless that \u201cdefense counsel used the fact that a consultation even occurred against the [Keuffers] in a significantly harmful manner. Thus, the Court finds that Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>1.20(c), Mont. R. Prof. C. is applicable to the particular circumstances of this case.\u201d The court therefore concluded that \u201cRule 1.20(c), Mont. R. Prof. C. requires the disqualification of both Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher and the Renzulli Law Firm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b629 Our rule requiring a finding of prejudice or adverse impact \u2014 which we originally articulated in <em>Schuff </em>\u2014 \u201capplie[s] to current clients.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>\u00b6 23. <em>See Pro-Hand, Servs. Trust </em>(analyzing whether there was a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that confidences were disclosed rather than looking to whether the prospective client would be prejudiced or adversely impacted). In contrast, with a prospective client, if the information disclosed to the attorney could be significantly harmful, disqualification is automatic regardless of prejudice or adverse impact, unless the requirements of Rule 1.20(d) are met.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By its plain language, Rule 1.20(c) would disqualify Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher from representing Mossberg in the proceeding \u2014 irrespective of any prejudice to the Keuffers \u2014 only if Weamer \u201creceived information from [Luke] that could be significantly harmful to [Luke] in the matter,\u201d subject to the exceptions allowed by Rule 1.20(d). M. R. Prof. Cond. 1.20(c). The inquiry under Rule 1.20(c) is not \u201cwhether information was divulged by the prospective client but whether such information could be significantly harmful to that person in that or a related matter.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>\u00b621.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b630 Model Rule 1.18(c), which is identical to Rule 1.20(c), \u201csets the bar preventing adverse <em>representation </em>against a former prospective client <em>lower than normal </em>in several ways.\u201d Hazard &amp; Hodes, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 21A.6, 21A-15 (second emphasis added). Model Rule 1.18(c) most significantly lowers the bar on adverse representation by providing that \u201cthe lawyer consulting with the prospective client is not personally barred from later opposing the client, <em>even in the same or a substantially related matter, </em>unless <em>in addition </em>the information learned \u2018could be significantly harmful.\u2019 \u201d Hazard &amp; Hodes, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 21A.6, 21A-15 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u00b631 The District Court made no finding that Luke divulged any such Information in this case. Although the court correctly recognized that disqualification under Rule 1.20 is proper only if it could find that Mossberg\u2019s counsel violated Rule 1.20(c), the court exceeded the proscriptions of the Rule by concluding that Rule 1.20(c) \u201cis applicable to the particular circumstances of this case\u201d because \u201cdefense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>used <em>the fact that a consultation even occurred </em>against the [Keuffers] in a <em>significantly harmful manner.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The court observed that Luke could not remember what he may have said to Weamer. But the court\u2019s resulting finding that \u201cknowing that certain information was not disclosed may be just as harmful as information that was disclosed\u201d is not relevant to an inquiry under Rule 1.20(c), which focuses on information the \u201clawyer received\u201d from the prospective client. <em>Perry, </em>\u00b6 21. Moreover, after considering the evidence, the court found that \u201cit is not clear what information was disclosed/learned during Luke\u2019s 6-12 minute consultation with Weamer.\u201d The District Court did not, and could not, make the requisite finding under Rule 1.20(c) that Weamer received information that is \u201csignificantly harmful\u201d to the Keuffers based upon a finding that it is unclear what information Luke disclosed. Accordingly, there was no justification for disqualification under Rule 1.20(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b632 The District Court also considered Rule 1.20(b) and found as a matter of fact that Mossberg\u2019s counsel \u201cdid not use or reveal information learned\u201d during the phone conversation. The District Court determined, however, that Rule 1.20(b) should be \u201cequally applicable when an attorney uses the fact that they consulted with a party ... to intimidate that party or to create an adverse inference about that party\u2019s case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u00b633 The Preamble to the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct provides that \u201c[a] lawyer should use the law\u2019s procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or intimidate others,\u201d and be \u201cguided by personal conscience and the approbation of professional peers.\u201d M. R. Prof. Cond. Preamble \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8. The Preamble continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASb\">Within the framework of these Rules ... many difficult issues of professional discretion can arise. Such issues must be resolved through the exercise of sensitive professional and moral judgment guided by the basic principles underlying the Rules. These principles include the lawyer\u2019s obligation to protect and pursue a client\u2019s legitimate interests, within the bounds of the law, while maintaining a professional, courteous and civil attitude toward all persons involved in the legal system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">M. R. Prof. Cond. Preamble \u00b6 10. It is within this context that Rule 1.20(b)\u2019s prohibition against \u201cus[ing] or reveal[ing] information learned in the consultation(s)\u201d with a prospective client must be analyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"Abc\">\u00b634 Here, Renzulli used Luke\u2019s communication with Weamer during his deposition of Stephanie as a litigation tactic to imply that the Keuffers had a weak case. Renzulli\u2019s questioning demonstrated a lack of professional, courteous, and civil attitude toward not only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Keuffers, but to the legal system. Renzulli\u2019s attempt to harass and intimidate the Keuffers was out of bounds. Even though the District Court found as a matter of fact that Renzulli did not reveal any specific information that Luke divulged to Weamer, the District Court properly recognized that Luke\u2019s communication to Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher of \u201cthe facts\u201d that prompted him to seek legal assistance was not to be \u201cused\u201d against him by counsel for the adverse party. <em>Accord Perry, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-30 (analyzing whether an attorney violated her duty of confidentiality to a prospective client). <em>See also </em>M. R. Prof. Cond. Preamble \u00b6 18. Renzulli acknowledged that he was attempting to do just that by suggesting that the Keuffers had to shop the case around before they could find a lawyer who was willing to take it.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b635 But the Court misapplies Rule 1.20(b) by upholding disqualification on this basis. As discussed above, Rule 1.20 does not trigger disqualification where no significantly harmful information was disclosed. The Court proves the point by its acknowledgment that Rule 1.20(b) does not \u201crequire that the information used or revealed be \u2018significantly harmful,\u2019 as would be required to form the basis for disqualification under Rule 1.20(c).\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 18. See Model R. Prof. Cond. 1.18 cmt. 6 (a \u201clawyer is <em>not prohibited </em>from representing a client with interests adverse to those of the prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter <em>unless </em>the lawyer has received from the prospective client <em>information that could be significantly harmful </em>if used in the matter\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b636 When a lawyer has not received information that could be significantly harmful to a prospective client, the concerns regarding the adverse use of information by the lawyer under Rule 1.20(b) are minimized. Stated another way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">If no client relationship is formed, the principle of Rule 1.9 \u2014 explicitly cross-referenced by Rule 1.18(b) \u2014 prohibits adverse use of information gained during the earlier consultations with the \u201calmost former clients.\u201d Of course, if the unfruitful discussions were truly non-substantive, or involved little or no information \u201cthat could be significantly harmful,\u201d in the language of Rule 1.18(c), the danger that confidentiality will be compromised is correspondingly small. In such cases the lawyer should not be prohibited from \u201cusing\u201d information that he does not really have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvY\">Hazard &amp; Hodes, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 21A.5, 21A-10 (citing <em>Pro-Hand Servs. Trust </em>(concluding that a telephone conversation between a prospective client and a lawyer\u2019s secretary does not bar the lawyer from subsequently representing the other side, especially where the prospective client makes no showing that any confidential information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>was provided)). Without disclosure of information \u201cthat could be significantly harmful\u201d to the Keuffers, the conclusion follows that disqualification under Rule 1.20 is not proper because Mossberg\u2019s counsel \u201cis not prohibited from representing\u201d Mossberg under the plain language of Rule 1.20. Model R. Prof. Cond. 1.18 cmt. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b637 Absent a basis for disqualification under Rule 1.20(c), disqualification is not appropriate without the proper showing of harm. We have made clear that \u201ca party cannot receive relief from a district court for the mere misconduct of an attorney or firm.\u201d <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 34. But</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmzX\">a trial court may consider attorney violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct if that misconduct results in prejudice or adversely impacts the rights of the parties in the case pending before it.... A district court\u2019s discretion in this regard flows from its inherent authority to control trial administration in the interest of fairness and justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 35 (citations omitted). <em>See also </em>\u00a7 3-1-111, MCA (granting all courts the power to \u201cprovide for the orderly conduct of proceedings,\u201d and \u201ccontrol, in furtherance of justice, the conduct\u201d of all other persons \u201cin any manner connected with a judicial proceeding\u201d). \u201cIn order to succeed on a motion to disqualify opposing counsel, a party \u2018must offer sufficient proof that the continued representation of one party by the attorney or firm will prejudice or adversely impact the rights of another party in the matter pending before the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 36). Prejudice in this context means that, irrespective of how the Keuffers understandably felt after Stephanie\u2019s deposition, in order to invoke the harsh remedy of disqualification, they must demonstrate how their rights in the litigation would be adversely impacted by Renzulli\u2019s and Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher\u2019s continued representation of Mossberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b638 In analyzing attorney disqualification, we have recognized that \u201cdisqualification has a significant effect on litigation and should be imposed sparingly.\u201d <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 33. \u201cIf there are good reasons to disqualify counsel, then we accept the burdens that disqualification imposes. But there should be good reasons.\u201d <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 33 (quoting Ronald D. Rotunda &amp; John S. Dzienkowski, <em>Legal Ethics: The Lawyer\u2019s Deskbook on Professional Responsibility </em>\u00a7 1.7-3, 352 (2011-2012 ed. 2011)). Moreover, because \u201c[disqualification burdens the judicial system with delays and it burdens the party that must retain and reeducate new counsel in the proceedings,\u201d disqualification is a remedy that should be imposed only if other remedies are lacking. <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 33. In <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>we ordered disqualification because of Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>1.10(a)\u2019s automatic imputed disqualification when there is a concurrent conflict of interest, <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 34; hence, \u201cthere is no course short of disqualifying [the opposing party\u2019s lawyer] which would respect [counsel]\u2019s duty of loyalty to the Krutzfeldts,\u201d who were his current clients. <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 32. The dearth of cases in which this Court has required disqualification of an attorney for violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct \u2014 particularly when related to a party with whom the lawyer has formed no attorney-client relationship \u2014 demonstrates the rare imposition of such a harsh remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b639 The District Court has ample discretion to impose alternate remedies or to consider whether any sanction may be appropriate against Renzulli personally. Chief among those remedies would be an order in limine precluding the offensive line of questioning and any mention of the consultation before a jury. The District Court also has authority under M. R. Civ. P. 30(d)(2) to impose an appropriate sanction on a person who frustrates the fair examination of a deponent. As we have recognized, \u201cthe Office of Disciplinary Counsel is the appropriate forum to raise violations of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct under Rule 1 of the Montana Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship &amp; Conservatorship of A.M.M., </em>2015 MT 250, \u00b6 77, 380 Mont. 451, 356 P.3d 474. The Rules of Professional Conduct \u201care designed to provide guidance to lawyers and to provide a structure for regulating conduct through disciplinary agencies.\u201d M. R. Prof. Cond. Preamble \u00b6 21. Accordingly, a \u201cviolation of a Rule does not necessarily warrant any other nondisciplinary remedy, such as disqualification of a lawyer in pending litigation.\u201d M. R. Prof. Cond. Preamble \u00b6 21. Furthermore, the Rules are not to be invoked as a tool in litigation to sanction an attorney. <em>See </em>M. R. Prof. Cond. Preamble \u00b6 21. Rather, \u201c[t]he Rules exist for the protection of clients.\u201d <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b640 The interests of Renzulli\u2019s client \u2014 about whom the Court is noticeably silent \u2014 also are entitled to consideration before disqualifying counsel of its choice. Recognizing that a party \u201cmust not be lightly separated from her counsel of choice,\u201d we have suggested that disqualification of counsel should not be used for punitive purposes. <em>Mowrer v. Eddie, </em>1999 MT 73, \u00b6 23, 294 Mont. 35, 979 P.2d 156. In <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>we acknowledged the impact on the client of the disqualified firm but, because \u201cthere was no opportunity to implement a screen before [the Krutzfeldts\u2019 attorney] began working\u201d at the firm of opposing counsel, the prejudice to them could not be undone. <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 33. Neither the District Court nor the Court today offer any consideration of the interests of Mossberg or whether the Keuffers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>substantial rights may be protected by other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u00b641 Finally, the Court does not address the Keuffers\u2019 argument that Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher should have disclosed Luke\u2019s phone call to the Keuffers\u2019 counsel after discovering the consultation during the conflict check. That argument is not supported by the Rule. Rule 1.20(c) provides that a lawyer \u201cshall not represent a client with interests materially adverse to those of a prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter if the lawyer received information from the prospective client that could be significantly harmful to that person in the matter, except as provided in paragraph (d).\u201d M. R. Prof. Cond. 1.20(c). Rule 1.20(d), in turn, governs disclosure to the prospective client and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">(d) Representation is permissible if both the affected client and the prospective client have given informed consent, confirmed in writing, or:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">1. the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">2. written notice is promptly given to the prospective client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYgv\">M. R. Prof. Cond. 1.20(d). In other words, Rule 1.20(d) requires disclosure to the prospective client only <em>if </em>a lawyer receives information that could be significantly harmful to the prospective client.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">\u00b642 Similarly, Model Rule 1.18(d) provides that disclosure to a prospective client is required only \u201c[w]hen the lawyer has <em>received disqualifying information as defined in paragraph (c).\u201d </em>Model R. Prof. Cond. 1.18(d) (emphasis added). Model Rule 1.18(c) defines \u201cdisqualifying information\u201d as \u201cinformation ... that could be significantly harmful to [the prospective client] in the matter.\u201d Model R. Prof. Cond. 1.18(c). Accordingly, \u201cinformed consent, confirmed in writing,\u201d \u201cwritten notice,\u201d and screening under Model Rule 1.18(d) are not necessary unless the \u201clawyer has received disqualifying information.\u201d Model R. Prof. Cond. 1.18(d). Stated another way, disclosure under \u201cRule 1.18(d) comes into effect when [the Rule] disqualifies the lawyer who personally dealt with the former prospective client.\u201d Rotunda &amp; Dzienkowski, <em>Legal Ethics: The Lawyer\u2019s Deskbook on Professional Responsibility </em>\u00a7 1.18-2, 743 (2015-2016 ed. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">\u00b643 As the Court implicitly acknowledges, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, no showing was made that significantly harmful information was received by Weamer during her phone conversation with Luke. Mossberg\u2019s counsel, therefore, was not required to disclose the consultation to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Keuffers under Rule 1.20(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b644 In summary, the Court effectively adopts a lower disqualification threshold with respect to prospective clients than the standards that apply to current and former clients \u2014 at odds with the express language and stated purpose of Rule 1.20. Without a showing that significantly harmful information was communicated, the Court\u2019s application of Rule 1.20 in these circumstances is gravely mistaken.</p>\n<judges id=\"b480-5\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE BAKER.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\"> Rule 1.20(d) allows continued representation under certain exceptions, discussed below.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b480-6\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"AiC\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\u00b645 I agree with the Court that there was a violation of Rule 1.20(b) and that the Keuffers were prejudiced as a result of counsel\u2019s use of Luke\u2019s prospective client consultation with Mossberg5s local counsel, Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher. I similarly agree that there was no violation of Rule 1.20(c) because no showing was made that \u201csignificantly harmful information\u201d was conveyed by the Keuffers in the consultation with Weamer. I also agree with the Court that, pursuant to <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 36, violations of professional conduct rules serve as weight which may tip the scales in favor of disqualification, even though the particular rule violated does not mandate disqualification. I part company with the Court, however, in its conclusion that the remedy of disqualification imposed by the District Court was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">\u00b646 In my opinion, the District Court abused its discretion in imposing the severe remedy of disqualification, particularly given that the relationship between a prospective client and a lawyer do not impose duties as stringent as between an actual and/or former client and his lawyer. Imposition of such a severe remedy as disqualification should be sparingly imposed, in light of its significant effect in disrupting litigation. <em>Krutzfeldt, </em>\u00b6 33. Under the circumstances here, disqualification of Mossberg\u2019s counsel was an abuse of discretion when the District Court could have simply precluded the offensive line of questioning by both Renzuilli and Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher and thereby maintained the integrity of the proceeding. The public\u2019s trust in the legal system in not undermined when a trial court perceives an abuse by counsel and corrects it by a fair, proportionate, and measured remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">\u00b647 As a final consideration, I think it is evident, that the District Court found the facts of this case \u201cunique\u201d but, nonetheless, that a Rule 1.20(b) violation had been substantiated. With respect to Rule 1.20(b), the District Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">The Court finds that defense counsel improperly used Plaintiffs consultation with Tarlow &amp; Stonecipher against them during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Stephanie\u2019s deposition. This situation is unique in that Rule 1.20(b), Mont. R. Prof. C., states that the attorney \u201cshall not use or reveal information learned in the consultation ...\u201d and in this case the attorney did not use or reveal information learned, but rather used the fact that the consultation even occurred. The Court finds no reason why the rule should not be equally applicable when an attorney uses the fact that they consulted with a party and declined to represent that party to intimidate that party or to create an adverse inference about that party\u2019s case. This is precisely what occurred in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">While I would not, under the circumstances of this case, find that a violation of Rule 1.20(b) warranted disqualification, I believe the District Court correctly found that Rule 1.20(b) had been violated. As we have held, the violation of a professional conduct rule \u2014 even Rule 1.20(b) \u2014 could tip the scales in favor of disqualification. <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 36. Nonetheless, while a trial court is in the best position to control and monitor the conduct of trial counsel, under the circumstances presented here, disqualification of Mossberg\u2019s counsel was not a measured or fair remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u00b648 To the extent we conclude otherwise, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
