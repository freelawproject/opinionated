Appellees, the Lower Teton Joint Objectors<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Joint Objectors), appeared as interested parties in the District Court proceeding. We restate the dispositive issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-14\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Eldorado\u2019s dissatisfied water user complaint.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-16\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-17\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b548-18\">\u00b63 The Water Court currently is in the process of adjudicating the existing water right claims of all appropriators in the Teton River Basin \u2014 Basin 410. As part of that process, the Water Court has issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>a temporary preliminary decree for Basin 410. Various claims subject to the temporary preliminary decree have been at issue in numerous cases before this Court. <em>E.g., Fellows v. Saylor, </em>2016 MT 45, 382 Mont. 298, 367 P.3d 732 (hereafter <em>Fellows </em>I); <em>Teton Co-Op Canal Co. v. Teton Coop Reservoir Co., </em>2015 MT 344, 382 Mont. 1, 365 P.3d 442; <em>Teton Coop. Reservoir Co. v. Farmers Coop. Canal Co., </em>2015 MT 208, 380 Mont. 146, 354 P.3d 579; <em>Skelton Ranch, Inc. v. Pondera County Canal &amp; Reservoir Co., </em>2014 MT 167, 375 Mont. 327, 328 P.3d 644. Both Eldorado and the Joint Objectors have been involved in a number of these disputes. <em>E.g., In re Eldorado Coop Canal Co., </em>2016 MT 94, 383 Mont. 205, 369 P.3d 1034 (hereafter <em>Eldorado I); Eldorado Co-Op Canal Co. v. Lower Teton Joint Objectors, </em>2014 MT 272, 375 Mont. 420, 337 P.3d 74 (hereafter <em>Eldorado II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\u00b64 Eldorado is a water supply entity that distributes water to shareholders from the Teton River northwest of Choteau, Montana. Eldorado owns four water rights that were decreed in <em>Perry v. Beattie, </em>Case No. 371 (Mont. 11th Judicial Dist. Ct., March 28, 1908). Eldorado\u2019s water rights historically have been administered under the terms of the <em>Perry </em>Decree by a water commissioner appointed by the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 85-5-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u00b65 In November 2014, the Water Court issued an order addressing objections by various parties \u2014 including the Joint Objectors \u2014 to Eldorado\u2019s existing water right claims as established under the temporary preliminary decree. The order determined the elements of Eldorado\u2019s existing water right claims and modified the temporary preliminary decree. The Water Court concluded that Eldorado\u2019s water right claims included a cumulative annual volume quantification of 15,000 acre-feet. The Water Court determined that this volume quantification represented Eldorado\u2019s historic beneficial use of its existing water rights. The Water Court incorporated the volume quantification into the post-decree abstracts for each of Eldorado\u2019s water right claims and concluded that \u201cEldorado\u2019s rights shall appear in the Final Decree for the Teton River Basin (410) in accordance with the [amended] abstracts attached hereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u00b66 Eldorado appealed the Water Court\u2019s order, which we recently addressed in <em>Eldorado I. </em>In <em>Eldorado I, </em>we concluded that the Water Court acted within its discretion under \u00a7 85-2-234(6)(b)(iii), MCA, in determining that Eldorado\u2019s claims required a volume quantification in order to adequately administer its water rights. <em>Eldorado I, </em>\u00b6 25. We concluded further that the Water Court did not err in determining that Eldorado historically put to beneficial use 15,000 acre-feet of water under its existing water rights. <em>Eldorado I, </em>\u00b6 34. Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>upheld the Water Court\u2019s determination that Eldorado\u2019s water rights are subject to an annual volumetric quantification and affirmed the Water Court\u2019s order. <em>Eldorado I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34, 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u00b67 The Joint Objectors are downstream Teton River water rights holders whose predecessors were not parties to the <em>Perry </em>Decree. In July 2015, the Joint Objectors informed Water Commissioner Ben Hoge that Eldorado was approaching the volumetric quantification established by the Water Court\u2019s order and requested that Water Commissioner Hoge cap the distribution of Eldorado\u2019s water to the volumetric quantification. After learning of the request, Eldorado petitioned the Water Court to stay the volume quantification order pending Eldorado\u2019s appeal to this Court in <em>Eldorado I. </em>The Water Court denied Eldorado\u2019s request in August 2015. Later that same month, Water Commissioner Hoge ceased delivering water to Eldorado.</p>\n<p id=\"AOT\">\u00b68 On August 23, 2015, Eldorado filed a dissatisfied water user complaint in the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 85-5-301, MCA. Eldorado filed its complaint against Hoge in his capacity as Water Commissioner for the <em>Perry </em>Decree. In its complaint, Eldorado sought an order directing the Water Commissioner to deliver water under Eldorado\u2019s flow rates as decreed in <em>Perry </em>and to refrain from imposing the volumetric quantification. The Joint Objectors opposed Eldorado\u2019s complaint as interested parties. The District Court held a hearing on the matter on September 16, 2015. Two days later, the District Court issued its order denying Eldorado\u2019s dissatisfied water user complaint. Eldorado appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u00b69 On appeal from a dissatisfied water user proceeding we review findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence and conclusions of law for correctness. <em>In re Water Complaint of Kelly, </em>2010 MT 14, \u00b6 25, 355 Mont. 86, 224 P.3d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\u00b6 10 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Eldorado\u2019s dissatisfied water user complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">\u00b611 As an initial matter, we decline to address Eldorado\u2019s challenge to the Water Court\u2019s determination that its existing water rights are subject to a cumulative annual volume quantification of 15,000 acre-feet. We upheld the Water Court\u2019s determination regarding the elements of Eldorado\u2019s existing water rights in <em>Eldorado I </em>and affirmed the 15,000 acre-foot volume quantification. <em>Eldorado I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34, 43. Accordingly, the volumetric quantification issue no longer presents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>an actual controversy and has been rendered moot. <em>See Havre Daily News, LLC v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6 31, 333 Mont. 331, 142 P.3d 864. The issues related to enforcement of the volumetric quantification are not moot, however, and we will consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u00b612 In its order, the District Court first concluded that the Water Court has \u201cjurisdiction over all matters relating to the determination of existing water rights\u201d in Montana and that a district court \u201conly has jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of a final decree or a temporary preliminary decree as issued and modified by a water court.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court determined that it did not have the authority to stay the volumetric quantification imposed on Eldorado\u2019s water rights. The court concluded further that it must enforce the Water Court\u2019s volumetric quantification because its jurisdiction in a dissatisfied water user action is limited to determining \u201cwhether [or not] the water commissioner is distributing water to existing water rights holders pursuant to the adjudication decree.\u201d (Quoting <em>Baker Ditch Co. v. Dist. Ct., </em>251 Mont 251, 256, 824 P.2d 260, 260 (1992).) Accordingly, the District Court denied Eldorado\u2019s dissatisfied water user complaint because it concluded that it had \u201cno power to override the decision of the Water Court\u201d to establish a volumetric quantification for Eldorado\u2019s existing water rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u00b613 On appeal, Eldorado asserts several points of error. Eldorado first contends that the purpose of a dissatisfied water user action is limited to enforcing the rights determined by a prior decree. In this case, Eldorado asserts, the prior decree that should be enforced is the <em>Perry </em>Decree. As such, Eldorado claims that the District Court erred by not enforcing the <em>Perry </em>Decree\u2019s terms and by instructing the Water Commissioner to enforce the volumetric quantification established in the modified temporary preliminary decree. Furthermore, Eldorado contends, the Water Court\u2019s order imposing a volumetric quantification is not enforceable because the statutory procedures for enforcing a water court decree were not initiated. Finally, Eldorado claims that the District Court\u2019s order violated its due process rights because it was not given notice or any opportunity to be heard before the District Court enforced the 15,000 acre-feet volumetric quantification.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u00b614 The Joint Objectors counter that Eldorado\u2019s dissatisfied water user complaint is a collateral request for a stay of the Water Court\u2019s order imposing a volumetric quantification. The Joint Objectors therefore contend that Eldorado waived its right to challenge the volumetric quantification here because Eldorado did not challenge the Water Court\u2019s denial of its request for a stay of the volumetric quantification. The Joint Objectors next assert that under Montana\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>water rights system the Water Court has exclusive jurisdiction to quantify the extent of Eldorado\u2019s existing water rights based on beneficial use. The Joint Objectors contend that the Water Court\u2019s volumetric quantification order therefore supersedes the <em>Perry </em>Decree under the plain language of the Water Use Act. Accordingly, the Joint Objectors claim, the District Court did not err in denying Eldorado\u2019s dissatisfied water user complaint because the Water Commissioner lacks the authority to deliver water in excess of the volumetric quantification established by the Water Court. Finally, the Joint Objectors assert that Eldorado received all the notice it was due because it participated during every stage of the proceedings that resulted in the volumetric quantification.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Waiver by Eldorado\u2019s failure to seek review of the Water Court\u2019s denial of its stay request</p>\n<p id=\"AKF\">\u00b615 M. R. App. P. 22 allows a party that has unsuccessfully sought to stay judgment pending appeal to seek relief in this Court. We agree with Eldorado that it did not waive its right to file a dissatisfied water user complaint by failing to seek such relief in its prior appeal. Montana statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">A person owning or using any of the waters of the stream ... who is dissatisfied with the method of distribution of the waters of the stream ... by the water commissioner ... and who claims to be entitled to more water than the person is receiving ... may file a written complaint, duly verified, setting forth the facts of the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Section 85-5-301(1), MCA. The \u201cwhole question\u201d in a dissatisfied water user proceeding under \u00a7 85-5-301, MCA, \u201cis whether the water commissioner is distributing water to the respective users according to the applicable decree.\u201d <em>Fellows v. Office of Water Comm\u2019r, </em>2012 MT 169, \u00b6 16, 365 Mont. 540, 285 P.3d 448 (citations omitted) (hereafter <em>Fellows IT)-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\u00b616  While Eldorado\u2019s dissatisfied water user complaint did challenge the Water Court\u2019s volumetric quantification that was then pending on appeal, it also challenged the Water Commissioner\u2019s distribution of Teton River water and contested which water rights decree is applicable to that distribution. Eldorado\u2019s complaint therefore involved the distribution of water, while Eldorado\u2019s motion to stay the Water Court\u2019s order involved the adjudication of its existing water rights. Montana\u2019s water rights system distinguishes water adjudication from water distribution. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 3-7-501, MCA (granting exclusive jurisdiction to the Water Court to determine existing water rights), <em>with </em>\u00a7 85-2-406, MCA (granting jurisdiction to district courts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>supervise the distribution of water among appropriators). <em>See also Baker Ditch </em>Co., 251 Mont. at 255, 824 P.2d at 260 (concluding that \u201cthe statutes governing [the distribution of water] are for the purpose of expeditious administration and not for the purpose of adjudication\u201d). As such, Eldorado\u2019s failure to seek relief from the W ater Court\u2019s denial of its motion to stay the order establishing a volumetric quantification did not result in waiver of its right to challenge the distribution of water through a dissatisfied water user action.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Enforcement of the Water Court\u2019s volumetric quantification</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u00b617 Eldorado contends that the District Court erred because the only enforceable decree for the Teton River is the <em>Perry </em>Decree; therefore, the District Court is authorized to direct the Water Commissioner to administer water according to the terms of the <em>Perry </em>Decree only. The Joint Objectors counter that the District Court properly enforced the provisions of the modified temporary preliminary decree for Basin 410 because that decree supersedes the <em>Perry </em>Decree. Both Eldorado and the Joint Objectors rely on provisions of the Montana Water Use Act in support of their arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u00b618 It is well-established that \u201cstatutes should be construed according to the plain meaning of the language used therein.\u201d <em>Fellows I, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 229, \u00b6 47, 311 Mont. 439, 57 P.3d 42) (internal quotations omitted). Furthermore, a statute \u201cmust be read as a whole, and its terms should not be isolated from the context in which they were used by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Fellows I, </em>\u00b6 21 <em>(quoting Price, </em>\u00b6 47) (internal quotations omitted). We accordingly must interpret a statute \u201cas a part of a whole statutory scheme and construe it so as to forward the purpose of that scheme.\u201d <em>Stokes v. Mont. Thirteenth Judicial Dist. Ct., </em>2011 MT 182, \u00b6 15, 361 Mont. 279, 259 P.3d 754 (quoting <em>Wright v. Ace Am. Ins. Co., </em>2011 MT 43, \u00b6 24, 359 Mont. 332, 249 P.3d 485) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\u00b619 While Montana\u2019s Constitution recognizes and confirms \u201cexisting rights to the use of any waters for any useful or beneficial purpose,\u201d Mont. Const, art. IX, \u00a7 3(1), it requires also that the Legislature \u201cprovide for the administration, control, and regulation of water rights\u201d and \u201cestablish a system of centralized records,\u201d Mont. Const. art. IX, \u00a7 3(4). In implementing this constitutional mandate, the Legislature created the Water Court and granted it exclusive jurisdiction over \u201call matters relating to the determination of existing water rights within the boundaries of the state of Montana.\u201d Section 3-7-224(2), MCA. The Legislature correspondingly granted jurisdiction to district courts to enforce the provisions of water rights decrees and to supervise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>distribution of adjudicated water. Title 3, Ch. 7, Pt. 2, MCA; Title 85, Ch. 2, MCA. The Legislature therefore has established a statutory scheme for water rights in which the Water Court is responsible for interpreting and determining the nature and extent of existing water rights while the district courts are responsible for supervising the distribution of water as adjudicated by the Water Court and for enforcing water rights decrees. <em>In re Deadman\u2019s Basin Water Users Ass\u2019n, </em>2002 MT 15, \u00b6 15, 308 Mont. 168, 40 P.3d 387. One of the Legislature\u2019s purposes in implementing this statutory scheme was \u201cto quantify the many water users\u2019 rights in Montana\u2019s water and to speed up decisions on those water rights.\u201d <em>Hill v. Merrimac Cattle Co., </em>211 Mont. 479, 489, 687 P.2d 59, 65 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u00b620  Under Section 85-2-406(1), MCA, a district court\u2019s supervisory authority over the distribution of adjudicated water \u201cincludes the supervision of all water commissioners.\u201d <em>See also Luppold v. Lewis, </em>172 Mont. 280, 287, 563 P.2d 538, 542 (1977) (concluding that in order to \u201cachieve a uniform method of [water] distribution, the instructions given by the district court must be binding upon the office of water commissioner\u201d). In effectuating its supervisory authority, \u201c[a] district court may order the distribution of water pursuant to a district court decree entered prior to July 1, 1973, until an enforceable decree is entered under part 2 of this chapter.\u201d Section 85-2-406(2)(a), MCA. The District Court, therefore, had the authority to order Water Commissioner Hoge to distribute water pursuant to the <em>Perry </em>Decree \u2014 a district court decree entered prior to July <em>1,1973 </em>\u2014 until an enforceable decree was entered under Part 2 of Title 85, Chapter 2, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\u00b621 Part 2 of Title 85, Chapter 2, MCA, provides that the Water Court \u201cmay issue a temporary preliminary decree ... if the temporary preliminary decree is necessary for the orderly adjudication or administration of water rights,\u201d \u00a7 85-2-231(1), MCA, and prescribes procedural requirements for issuing such a decree, \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-231(2)-(6), -232, MCA. Once a temporary preliminary decree is issued, interested parties have the right to object to water right claims as they appear in the decree and the Water Court must hold a hearing on those objections. Section 85-2-233, MCA. The determinations made as a result of this objection and hearing process modify the water right claims established in the temporary preliminary decree. <em>See </em>\u00a7 85-2-234(1), MCA (\u201cThe water judge shall... on the basis of any hearing that may have been held ... enter a final decree affirming or modifying the preliminary decree\u201d); W. R. Adj. R. 21(e) (\u201cFollowing the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing... the water court shall review the evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the record, render its written decision ..., and modify the abstract of each applicable claim in accordance with the written decision\u201d). \u201cA temporary preliminary decree ... or a portion of a temporary preliminary decree ... as modified after objections and hearings is enforceable and administrable according to its terms.\u201d Section 85-2-406(4), MCA. Outside the Water Use Act, the Legislature has confirmed that, \u201c[i]n the absence of any final decree having been issued, the district court having jurisdiction may enforce the provisions of a temporary preliminary decree ... entered under 85-2-231, as modified by a water judge after objections and hearings.\u201d Section 3-7-212, MCA. The plain language of the statutory scheme makes clear that a temporary preliminary decree \u2014 as modified after objections and hearings \u2014 is an enforceable decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u00b622 Here, it is undisputed that the Water Court properly issued a temporary preliminary decree for Basin 410 pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-231, MCA. The Water Court then conducted a hearing on the objections to Eldorado\u2019s water rights as established in the temporary preliminary decree. Based on the objection and hearing process, the Water Court issued an order modifying Eldorado\u2019s rights under the decree \u2014 which we upheld in <em>Eldorado I. Eldorado I, </em>\u00b6 43. The portion of the temporary preliminary decree pertaining to Eldorado\u2019s rights \u2014 as modified by the Water Court after objections and hearings \u2014 is therefore an enforceable decree under the plain language of the Water Use Act. Sections 85-2-406(2)(a), (4), -231(1), MCA. As such, the District Court has the authority to enforce and administer Eldorado\u2019s water rights according to the terms of the modified temporary preliminary decree. Sections 85-2-406(4), 3-7-212, MCA. See <em>also Eldorado II, </em>\u00b6 28 (concluding that a district court\u2019s authority to supervise the distribution of water among appropriators \u201cincludes enforcement of Temporary Preliminary and Preliminary Decrees of the Water Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u00b623  We are unpersuaded by Eldorado\u2019s claim that the District Court \u201cimproperly strayed\u201d from the <em>Perry </em>Decree\u2019s terms by instructing the Water Commissioner to impose the volumetric quantification established in the modified temporary preliminary decree. The Water Use Act clearly provides that \u201c[f]or purposes of administering water rights, the provisions of a temporary preliminary decree or a preliminary decree, as modified after objections and hearings, <em>supersede a claim of existing right </em>until a final decree is issued.\u201d Section 85-2-227(1), MCA (emphasis added). Accordingly, for purposes of administering Eldorado\u2019s water rights, the modified temporary preliminary decree supersedes Eldorado\u2019s claims of existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>right under the <em>Perry </em>Decree until a final decree for Basin 410 is issued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the District Court correctly instructed the Water Commissioner to distribute Eldorado\u2019s water rights pursuant to the modified portion of the temporary preliminary decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Procedure for enforcing the modified temporary preliminary decree</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\u00b624 Eldorado argues that the temporary preliminary decree was not enforceable because the appropriators in Basin 410 did not initiate procedures prescribed in \u00a7 85-5-101, MCA, for enforcing a decree. Section 85-5-101, MCA, governs the appointment of water commissioners and provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">(1) Whenever the rights of persons to use the waters of any stream ... or other source of supply have been determined by a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, including temporary preliminary, preliminary, and final decrees issued by a water judge, it is the duty of the judge of the district court having jurisdiction of the subject matter, upon the application of the owners of at least 15% of the water rights affected by the decree, in the exercise of the judge\u2019s discretion, to appoint one or more commissioners. The commissioners have authority to admeasure and distribute to the parties owning water rights in the source affected by the decree the waters to which they are entitled, according to their rights as fixed by the decree and by any certificates, permits, and changes in appropriation right issued under chapter 2 of this title....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">(2) When the existing rights of all appropriators from a source or in an area have been determined in a temporary preliminary decree, preliminary decree, or final decree issued under chapter 2 of this title, the judge of the district court may, upon the application by both the department of natural resources and conservation and one or more holders of valid water rights in the source, appoint a water commissioner. The water commissioner shall distribute to the appropriators, from the source or in the area, the water to which they are entitled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Section 85-5-101(1), (2) MCA. Section 85-5-101, MCA, prescribes procedural requirements for appointing a water commissioner to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>distribute water according to an applicable water rights decree; the statute does not prescribe procedural requirements for enforcing a temporary preliminary decree when a water commissioner already has been appointed to distribute the water in the source affected by a decree.

As stated above, the Water Use Act makes clear that, \u201c[f]or purposes of administering [Eldorado\u2019s] water rights, the provisions of [Basin 410\u2019s] temporary preliminary decree ... as modified after objections and hearings, supersede [Eldorado\u2019s] claim of existing right\u201d under the <em>Perry </em>Decree. Section 85-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>2-227(1), MCA. Therefore, it is Water Commissioner Hoge\u2019s duty to admeasure and distribute Eldorado\u2019s water rights according to the provisions of the modified temporary preliminary decree insofar as it supersedes the <em>Perry </em>Decree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b627 We find no support for Eldorado\u2019s additional procedural arguments under \u00a7 85-2-406(4), MCA, and W. R. Adj. R. 31, both of which apply in the commencement of an action to enforce a Water Court decree. Again, the District Court already had appointed a water commissioner to distribute water pursuant to the applicable decree \u2014 and the decree applicable to Eldorado\u2019s rights is the modified temporary preliminary decree. Section 85-2-227(1), MCA. Moreover, Water Commissioner Hoge had the authority to distribute Eldorado\u2019s water rights \u201caccording to their rights as fixed ... by any ... changes in appropriation right issued under chapter 2 of this title.\u201d Section 85-5-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u00b628 Eldorado\u2019s interpretation of the applicable statutes is contrary \u201cto the plain meaning of the language used therein.\u201d <em>Fellows I, </em>\u00b6 21. Moreover, such an interpretation conflicts with the \u201cwhole statutory scheme\u201d for water rights the Legislature has implemented pursuant to its constitutional mandate. <em>Stokes, </em>\u00b6 15. Here, the Water Court entered a temporary preliminary decree establishing the water rights in Basin 410. The Water Court \u2014 acting within its exclusive jurisdiction \u2014 then interpreted and determined the nature and extent of Eldorado\u2019s existing water rights after objections and hearings. At that point, the provisions of the temporary preliminary decree relating to Eldorado\u2019s rights \u201csuperseded] [Eldorado\u2019s] claim of existing right\u201d under the <em>Perry </em>Decree, \u00a7 85-2-227(1), MCA, and the modified portion of the temporary preliminary decree became \u201cenforceable and administrable according to its terms,\u201d \u00a7 85-2-406(4), MCA. The District Court \u2014 acting within its jurisdiction \u2014 then correctly enforced the modified temporary preliminary decree and supervised the distribution of Eldorado\u2019s water as adjudicated by the Water Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u00b629  As stated above, the \u201cwhole question\u201d in a dissatisfied water user proceeding under \u00a7 85-5-301, MCA, \u201cis whether the water commissioner is distributing water to the respective users according to the applicable decree.\u201d <em>Fellows II, </em>\u00b6 16. Based on the foregoing analysis, we conclude that the District Court correctly directed Water Commissioner Hoge to distribute Eldorado\u2019s water rights according to the modified temporary preliminary decree for Basin 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u00b630 Eldorado contends that its due process rights were violated because it was not provided with notice and had no opportunity to be heard prior to the volumetric quantification being enforced. Eldorado \u201cparticipated in a four-day trial in front of a Water Master\u201d following the objections to its water right claims as established in the temporary preliminary decree. <em>Eldorado I, </em>\u00b6 7. The Water Master then issued a report \u201cregarding each of Eldorado\u2019s claimed water rights.\u201d <em>Eldorado I, </em>\u00b6 8. The Master\u2019s report received objections from all parties \u2014 including Eldorado. Based on these objections, the Water Court amended the Master\u2019s report to include a combined annual volume for Eldorado\u2019s claims of 15,000 acre-feet. <em>Eldorado I, </em>\u00b6 15. Eldorado appealed the Water Court\u2019s order to this Court and argued that \u201cthe Water Court impermissibly constrained its water rights by quantifying the volume of [its] rights as it did.\u201d <em>Eldorado I, </em>\u00b6 23. We concluded that the Water Court correctly determined the extent of Eldorado\u2019s rights and we therefore upheld \u201cthe Water Court\u2019s findings regarding volume.\u201d <em>Eldorado I, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u00b631 Once Water Commissioner Hoge informed Eldorado that he had been requested by the Joint Objectors to administer Eldorado\u2019s rights by the volumetric quantification, Eldorado sought a stay of the volume quantification order from the Water Court, which the Water Court denied. The Water Court\u2019s order denying the stay concluded that the \u201cWater Commissioner is subject to direction by the local district court judge. Future enforcement of the 15,000 acre foot limit will be pursuant to the district court\u2019s authority to administer water rights.\u201d As detailed above, the Water Court\u2019s imposition of the volumetric quantification modified the temporary preliminary decree, and the District Court accordingly had authority to enforce the volumetric quantification. Eldorado exercised its statutory right to file a dissatisfied water user complaint and was heard on its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"A3us\">\u00b632  \u201cUnder both federal and state jurisprudence the requirements for procedural due process are (1) notice, and (2) opportunity for a hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\u201d <em>Montanans for Justice v. State, </em>2006 MT 277, \u00b6 30, 334 Mont. 237, 146 P.3d 759 (citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>omitted). These requirements \u201care \u2018flexible\u2019 and are adapted by the courts to meet the procedural protections demanded by the specific situation.\u201d <em>Montanans for Justice, </em>\u00b6 30 (citation omitted). Here, Eldorado participated in every step of the process that resulted in the establishment of its existing water rights under the modified temporary preliminary decree. We conclude that Eldorado had adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard before the volumetric quantification was enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u00b633 We affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Eldorado\u2019s dissatisfied water user complaint.</p>\n<judges id=\"b560-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, COTTER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-19\"> The Lower Teton Joint Objectors are Steven Kelly, Monte Giese, William Rieehelt, and Kalanick Ranches, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b556-10\"> As noted above, the Water Court\u2019s order modifying Eldorado\u2019s water right claims under the temporary preliminary decree concluded, \u201cEldorado\u2019s rights shall appear in the Final Decree for the Teton River Basin (410) in accordance with the [amended] abstracts attached hereto.\u201d The Water Court therefore made clear that the final decree for Basin 410 would not alter Eldorado\u2019s rights further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b558-7\"> Eldorado\u2019s argument that the Water Commissioner appointed under the <em>Perry </em>Decree can only distribute water pursuant to that decree is undermined by the fact that, historically, the Water Commissioner apparently has distributed water to appropriators whose water rights were not subject to the <em>Perry </em>Decree.
