We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied Langley\u2019s motion to withdraw his no contest plea.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b62 We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b63 On February 6, 2014, the State charged Langley with one count of Arson, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-103(l)(a), MCA. Langley entered into a plea agreement with the State on January 22,2015. The written plea agreement provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">Pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(b), MCA, and conditioned upon the understandings specified below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">The Defendant will enter into a Nolo Contendere plea to Count I, Arson, pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-212(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">The State will recommend to the Court that SENTENCING BE DEFERRED FOR 6 YEARS UNDER THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">The State agrees that the Defendant shall be entitled to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-12\">A. Enter a Nolo Contendere plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-13\">B. Withdraw his plea subsequent to the entry of it in the event the State fails to perform its obligations pursuant to this agreement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-14\">C. If the Court refuses to accept the Defendant\u2019s Nolo Contendere plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-15\">The agreement\u2019s Acknowledgment of Rights section provides that \u201cin exchange for a particular plea, the prosecutor will recommend a particular sentence\u201d and that \u201cthe recommendation of the county attorney in no way binds the court when imposing sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-16\">\u00b64 At the January 22,2015 change of plea hearing, the District Court conducted a colloquy to establish that Langley was entering into a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea. During questioning, Langley acknowledged his understanding that the court was not bound by the sentencing recommendation in the plea agreement and that the court could impose \u201csomething different than what the plea agreement calls for.\u201d The court then set a sentencing hearing date for March 12, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"AKG\">\u00b65 During the March sentencing hearing, the District Court informed the parties that it was not inclined to impose a deferred sentence and asked how counsel would prefer to proceed. Langley\u2019s attorney moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>to withdraw the plea. The court replied, \u201cI would normally grant that motion if it was a binding plea agreement but it\u2019s not, so I think that would have to be filed and formally briefed.\u201d The court stated that it would give Langley more time to present evidence as to why he should be given a deferred sentence, and postponed sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b66 Before the next hearing, Langley filed a motion to withdraw his no contest plea and requested a hearing. Langley\u2019s motion asserted, in part, that the District Court did not comply with the statutory procedures for rejecting plea agreements and that the court must allow him to withdraw his plea pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(b) and (4), MCA. The State opposed Langley\u2019s motion, arguing that the plea agreement did not allow Langley to withdraw his plea, and that any ambiguity should be resolved against Langley because his attorney drafted it.</p>\n<p id=\"As5\">\u00b67 The court held a hearing on May 27, 2015, to discuss Langley\u2019s motion to withdraw his no contest plea; however, Langley\u2019s attorney informed the court that he was not prepared to proceed with the hearing because he \u201cjust got back into town last night, and [he] missed [the hearing] on the calendar.\u201d The court allowed Langley\u2019s attorney to file a reply brief despite missing the filing deadline. The court informed the parties that it had not yet decided whether to accept or reject the plea agreement. The court also determined that the motion to withdraw the no contest plea would be decided without a hearing and Langley\u2019s attorney agreed to waive that hearing. Langley filed his reply brief two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b68 On June 3, 2015, the court denied Langley\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. The court based its order primarily on the conclusion that Langley entered the plea \u201cvoluntarily\u201d and \u201cknowingly.\u201d The court concluded that it \u201cfully complied with the statutory pleas [sic] agreement procedure set forth in Section 46-12-211, MCA,\u201d because the court \u201cdiscussed the fact that it was not bound by the plea agreement\u201d and \u201cspecifically inquired whether, despite the fact that [Langley] could receive a different sentence, [Langley] was willing to enter a plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b69 The District Court held a sentencing hearing on June 11, 2015. After presenting witness testimony, Langley and the State \u2014 which had admitted to being bound by the agreement \u2014 both asked the court to follow the plea agreement. The court then explained why it would not follow the plea agreement based on the facts of the case, and pronounced that it would sentence Langley to the DOC for ten years with five years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00b610 On July 20,2015, Langley filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with this Court. In his petition, Langley asserted that his sentence was illegal because the plea agreement was of the type contemplated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u00a7 46-12-211(1)(b), MCA, and therefore the District Court should have allowed him to withdraw his plea pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-211(4), MCA. We denied Langley\u2019s petition, concluding that habeas relief was not available and that Langley\u2019s remedy was a direct appeal. <em>Langley v. Batista, </em>No. OP 15-0430, Or. (Mont. Sept. 1, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b611 Thereafter, on August 5, 2015, the District Court entered final judgment, sentencing Langley to the DOC for ten years with five years suspended and recommending that Langley be placed in an appropriate treatment facility. Represented by a different attorney, Langley appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u00b612 The appeal of an order denying a motion to withdraw a plea presents a question of law that we review de novo. <em>State v. Zunick, </em>2014 MT 239, \u00b6 10, 376 Mont. 293, 339 P.3d 1228. A plea agreement is a contract and is subject to contract law standards. <em>State v. Shepard, </em>2010 MT 20, \u00b6 8, 355 Mont. 114, 225 P.3d 1217. The construction and interpretation of a contract are questions of law that we review for correctness. <em>Ophus v. Fritz, </em>2000 MT 251, \u00b6 19, 301 Mont. 447, 11 P.3d 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">\u00b613 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied Langley\u2019s motion to withdraw his no contest plea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">\u00b614 Section 46-12-211, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">(1) The prosecutor and the attorney for the defendant, or the defendant when acting pro se, may engage in discussions with a view toward reaching an agreement that, upon the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a charged offense or to a lesser or related offense, the prosecutor will do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-11\">(a) move for dismissal of other charges;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-12\">(b) agree that a specific sentence is the appropriate disposition of the case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-13\">(c) make a recommendation, or agree not to oppose the defendants\u2019 request, for a particular sentence, with the understanding that the recommendation or request may not be binding upon the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-14\">(2) ... [I]f a plea agreement has been reached by the parties, the court shall, on the record, require a disclosure of the agreement in open court or, on a showing of good cause in camera, at the time that the plea is offered. If the agreement is of the type specified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>subsection (l)(a) or (l)(b), the court may accept or reject the agreement or may defer its decision as to the acceptance or rejection until there has been an opportunity to consider the presentence report. If the agreement is of the type specified in subsection (l)(c), the court shall advise the defendant that, if the court does not accept the recommendation or request, the defendant nevertheless has no right to withdraw the plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\">(4) If the court rejects a plea agreement of the type specified in subsection (l)(a) or (l)(b), the court shall, on the record, inform the parties of this fact and advise the defendant that the court is not bound by the plea agreement, afford the defendant an opportunity to withdraw the plea, and advise the defendant that if the defendant persists in the guilty or nolo contendere plea, the disposition of the case may be less favorable to the defendant than that contemplated by the plea agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Section 46-12-211(1), (2), (4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u00b615 The State argues that the plea agreement is facially ambiguous because its language \u201cis not reasonably susceptible to just one interpretation regarding the statutory type of plea agreement the parties formed.\u201d The State contends that the language stating that \u201cthe prosecutor will recommend a particular sentence\u201d and that \u201cthe court [is not] bound by the agreement\u201d tracks some of the critical statutory language in \u00a7 46-12-211(1)(c), MCA. Such language, according to the State, contradicts the agreement\u2019s express reference to \u00a7 46-12-211(1)(b), MCA. The State claims that the plea agreement is ambiguous because the two types of plea agreements implicated in the agreement are irreconcilable \u2014 each agreement entails different specific procedures owed to the defendant if a court chooses not to follow the recommendation. The State therefore argues that the rule of contract construction set forth in \u00a7 28-3-206, MCA, requires this Court to construe the agreement against Langley because his attorney drafted it. The State further argues that Langley\u2019s acknowledgments during the plea colloquy support interpreting the plea agreement under \u00a7 46-12~211(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\u00b616 Langley asserts that he and the State entered into an unambiguous plea agreement of the type contemplated in \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(b), MCA, because the plea agreement specifically references that section. Langley argues that the language about the court being \u201cbound\u201d by the agreement is insignificant because a district court is not bound by the parties\u2019 plea agreement under any circumstances. Langley contends that the District Court\u2019s confusion of the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>surrounding plea agreements does not render the agreement ambiguous. Consequently, Langley asserts that the court was required to afford Langley the opportunity to withdraw his plea under \u00a7 46-12-211(4), MCA, and, by not doing so, the court committed reversible error. Langley asks this Court to remand his case to the District Court with instructions to conduct another sentencing hearing and either accept the agreed sentence or give Langley the opportunity to withdraw the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b617 \u201c \u2018A plea agreement is a contract between the State and a defendant and is subject to contract law standards.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shepard, </em>\u00b6 14 (quoting <em>State v. Rardon, </em>2002 MT 345, \u00b6 18, 313 Mont. 321, 61 P.3d 132). If the contract language is clear and unambiguous, it is a court\u2019s duty to enforce the contract as drafted and executed by the parties. <em>Shepard, </em>\u00b6 14. An ambiguity exists when the language of a contract, as a whole, is reasonably subject to two different interpretations. <em>Richards v. JTL Group, </em>Inc., 2009 MT 173, \u00b6 26, 350 Mont. 516, 212 P.3d 264 (citation omitted). \u201cAn ambiguity\u2019s existence must be determined on an objective basis.\u201d <em>Richards, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b618 Objectively, the plea agreement, as whole, could reasonably be interpreted as invoking either \u00a7 46-12-211(1)(b), MCA, or \u00a7 46-12-211(1)(c), MCA. While the plea agreement explicitly references \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(b), MCA, it also contains language that closely tracks \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(c), MCA. Section 46-12-211(l)(c), MCA, allows the prosecutor to \u201cmake a recommendation\u201d for a particular sentence \u201cwith the understanding that the recommendation or request may not be binding upon the court.\u201d The plea agreement\u2019s Acknowledgment of Rights section includes the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">j) I understand that a plea bargain agreement is an agreement between a defendant and a prosecutor and that in exchange for a particular plea, the <em>prosecutor will recommend </em>a particular sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">1) I understand that on my plea alone, I could lawfully be sentenced to the maximum punishment authorized for the offense to which I plead guilty and that <em>the recommendation of the county attorney in no way binds the court when imposing sentence.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ass\">(Emphasis added.) The agreement also states that Langley is entitled to withdraw his plea if the State fails to perform its obligations or if the court refuses to accept the nolo contendere plea, but does not state that Langley may withdraw if the court refuses to accept the recommended sentence. Because there is an incongruity between the language of the agreement and the type of agreement invoked by the statutory provision referenced in the plea agreement, we conclude that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b619 Once we determine that a contract is ambiguous, we resolve the ambiguity by applying rules of construction, <em>Morning Star Enterprises v. R.H. Grover, Inc., </em>247 Mont. 105, 111, 805 P.2d 553, 557 (1991), and by considering extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent, <em>Ophus, </em>\u00b6 29. We generally construe uncertainties in contracts \u201cagainst the party who caused the uncertainty to exist,\u201d Section 28-3-206, MCA, which typically is the party who drafted the agreement, <em>Ophus, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b620 We have not had occasion to determine whether to apply this rule of construction to plea agreements. We have, however, resolved doubts and ambiguities in favor of criminal defendants in other circumstances. <em>State v. Hendrickson, </em>2014 MT 132, \u00b6 14, 375 Mont. 136, 325 P.3d 694 (\u201cIf any doubt exists on the basis of the evidence presented regarding whether a guilty plea was voluntarily or intelligently made, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the defendant.\u201d); <em>State v. Garcia, </em>2003 MT 211, \u00b6 36, 317 Mont. 73, 75 P.3d 313 (\u201c \u2018[C]lose questions\u2019 regarding motions to continue should be resolved in favor of the defendant....\u201d); <em>State </em>v. Van <em>Robinson, </em>248 Mont. 528, 534, 813 P.3d 967, 971 (1991) (\u201cAny ambiguity regarding the applicability of [a statutory exception] must be resolved in favor of the defendant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b621 Federal courts consistently hold that ambiguities or inconsistencies in plea agreements are construed \u201c \u2018in favor of the defendant, ordinarily placing on the government responsibility for any lack of clarity.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Avery, </em>719 F.3d 1080, 1084 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting <em>United States v. Franco-Lopez, </em>312 F.3d 984, 989 (9th Cir. 2002)), <em>accord United States v. Giorgi, </em>840 F.2d 1022, 1026 (1st Cir. 1988) (holding that \u201cthe government must shoulder a greater degree of responsibility for lack of clarity in a plea agreement\u201d); <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>791 F.2d 294, 300 (4th Cir. 1986) (holding that \u201cboth constitutional and supervisory concerns require holding the Government to a greater degree of responsibility than the defendant (or possibly than would be either of the parties to commercial contracts) for imprecisions or ambiguities in plea agreements\u201d); <em>Innes v. Dalsheim, </em>864 F.2d 974, 979 (2d Cir. 1988) (concluding that \u201cthe state must bear the burden for any lack of clarity in the [plea] agreement and ambiguities should be resolved in favor of the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b622  We find this authority persuasive and conclude that an ambiguity in a plea agreement should be construed in favor of the defendant. Accordingly, we construe this plea agreement\u2019s ambiguity in Langley\u2019s favor and examine the record to ascertain evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>parties\u2019 intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b623 We are unconvinced by the State\u2019s argument that the District Court\u2019s statements during the January 2015 plea colloquy about not being \u201cbound\u201d by the sentencing recommendation in the plea agreement resolve the ambiguity in favor of \u00a7 46-12-211(1)(c), MCA. As Langley correctly points out, a court is not bound by a plea agreement between the parties \u2014 whether the agreement is made pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-211(1)(a), (b), or (c), MCA. Section 46-12-211(2), MCA (\u201cIf the agreement is of the type specified in subsection (1)(a) or (1)(b), the court <em>may </em>accept or reject the agreement ....\u201d); \u00a7 46-12-211(1)(c) (providing that the \u201crecommendation or request <em>may not </em>be binding upon the court\u201d) (emphases added). Moreover, the court did not advise Langley at the time the plea was offered that he would have no right to withdraw the plea if the court chose not to accept the plea agreement \u2014 which is required for a \u00a7 46-12-211(1)(c), MCA, plea agreement. Section 46-12-211(2), MCA (providing that \u201cthe court shall advise the defendant that, if the court does not accept the recommendation or request, the defendant nevertheless has no right to withdraw the plea\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b624 The plea agreement states expressly that it is entered pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(b), MCA, and does not mention \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(c), MCA. Defense counsel\u2019s statements during the sentencing hearing illustrate that he believed the plea agreement to be a \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(b), MCA, agreement. Immediately after the court indicated that it was not inclined to follow the plea agreement, Langley\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw the plea. After the court deferred imposing a sentence during that hearing, Langley filed a motion to withdraw the plea pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(b), MCA. Again, Langley asserted that the plea was \u201cspecifically entered pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-211(1)(b)\u201d in his reply brief on that motion. Defense counsel\u2019s contemporaneous motion as soon as the court indicated rejection of the recommended sentence is strong indication of the Defendant\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b625  Resolving the ambiguities in Langley\u2019s favor, and upon consideration of the record, we conclude that the plea agreement in this case should be construed as a \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(b), MCA, agreement. At the time the court rejects a \u00a7 46-12-211(1)(b), MCA, plea agreement, it must, on the record, inform the parties of this fact and provide the ensuing advisories: 1) advise the defendant that the court is not bound by the plea agreement, 2) afford the defendant the opportunity to withdraw the plea, and 3) advise the defendant that if he persists in the nolo contendere plea, the disposition of the case may be less favorable to him than contemplated by the plea. <em>Zunick, </em>\u00b6 16; \u00a7 46-12-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>211(4), MCA. As such, the District Court erred by not following the required procedures for rejecting the parties\u2019 plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b626 We reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to conduct another sentencing hearing. If the court accepts the plea agreement at that time, the court shall sentence Langley in accordance with the plea agreement. If the court rejects the plea agreement again, it must issue the full statutory advisement and give Langley the opportunity to withdraw his plea and proceed to trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b71-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, SHEA and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
