They appealed their convictions to the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County. After the District Court affirmed the convictions, they appealed separately to this Court. While the factual backgrounds differ slightly, the legal issue and analysis are identical; therefore we have consolidated these cases for the purpose of appeal and this Opinion. Attorney Greg Rapkoch represented each of the Appellants in the Municipal and District Courts. Assistant Appellate Defender Natalie Wicklund represented all of the Appellants before this Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">ISSUES</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err in failing to determine whether \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA, imposed absolute liability on each of the Appellants'?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by holding that the evidentiary \u201cletters of suspension\u201d were admissible as \u201ccertified copies of public records\u201d under M. R. Evid. 902(4) (Rule 902(4))?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">\n<em>Gloria Ferrari</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b44-15\">\u00b62 On June 20, 2010, Gloria Ferrari was cited by Kalispell Police Officer A. J. McDonnell for various traffic violations including driving with a suspended license. The Kalispell Municipal Court conducted a bench trial on May 30, 2013. Ferrari was represented by appointed counsel Rapkoch but was not in attendance. McDonnell presented Ferrari\u2019s \u201cCertified Driver Record\u201d generated by the State of Montana Department of Justice, Motor Vehicle Division (MVD), as well as six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>letters from MVD to Ferrari informing her that her license was suspended. Counsel objected to the suspension letters as hearsay and in violation of Ferrari\u2019s United States and Montana constitutional rights to confrontation. The Municipal Court admitted the evidence over counsel\u2019s objection. Ferrari was found guilty and sentenced to 180 days in jail with 178 suspended and fined $325.00. She appealed to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\n<em>Calvin Athy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b63 On September 10, 2012, Calvin Athy was cited by Officer Stan Ottosen of the Kalispell Police Department for multiple traffic violations including driving with a suspended license. At the May 30, 2013 Municipal Court bench trial, Athy was represented by Rapkoch but Athy did not attend the trial. Ottosen testified at Athy\u2019s trial and presented Athy\u2019s \u201cCertified Driver Record\u201d as well as three letters from MVD to Athy notifying him that his license was suspended. Counsel objected to the letters on hearsay and Confrontation Clause grounds but the Municipal Court admitted the evidence and found Athy guilty. Athy was sentenced to a 180-dayjail sentence with 178 days suspended and fined $325.00. On June 11, 2013, Athy appealed his judgment to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\n<em>Tyler Omyer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b64 On December 8, 2012, Tyler Omyer was cited by Sargent Allen Bardwell of the Kalispell Police Department for multiple traffic violations including driving a motor vehicle with a suspended license. The Kalispell Municipal Court conducted a bench trial on June 27, 2013, at which Omyer was present and represented by Rapkoch. Bardwell presented Omyer\u2019s \u201cCertified Driver Record\u201d as well as six letters sent by MVD to Omyer notifying him that his driver\u2019s license was suspended for reasons stated in the letters. Omyer objected to the admission of the MVD suspension letters on hearsay and Confrontation Clause grounds. The Municipal Court admitted the evidence, convicted Omyer of all offenses, and sentenced him to 180 days in jail with 178 suspended. The court allowed him to serve his time at the community car wash or the animal shelter. Additionally, he was fined $325.00. On July 25, 2013, Omyer appealed to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u00b65 The three cases were consolidated by the District Court for purposes of appeal. Counsel for the Appellants had not objected to, nor did he appeal, the Municipal Court\u2019s admission of the \u201cCertified Driving Record\u201d for each defendant as each record unequivocally established that the license for each driver was suspended at the time of the traffic stops and of citations to each. Rather, counsel argued that conviction of the offense of driving with a suspended license required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the City to prove that each defendant had a culpable mental state, <em>i.e., </em>that they \u201cknew\u201d their licenses were suspended at the time of their offenses. Counsel claimed that the only evidence presented of the Appellants\u2019 knowledge of their suspensions were the MVD suspension letters. Counsel asserted that these letters were inadmissible because they contained \u201ctestimonial hearsay\u201d subject to the protections of the Confrontation Clauses of the United States and Montana Constitutions. The certificate of mailing language stamped onto the bottom of each notification letter and challenged by the Appellants read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\">The undersigned hereby testifies that on the date below, he or she, as an officer or employee of the motor vehicle division, deposited in the United States mail at Helena, Montana, a copy of the paper to which this is affixed, in an envelope with the postage prepaid, addressed to the person named in the paper at his or her last address as shown by the records of the Department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Date Officer or Employee of Department</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Counsel argued that this language constituted testimony and was included in letters that were \u201cprepared in anticipation of use at trial to prove historical facts relevant to prosecution.\u201d Counsel claimed that had the evidence been properly excluded, there would have been no evidence presented at trial establishing a \u201cknowing\u201d culpable mental state and Appellants could not have been convicted under \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b66 The City of Kalispell responded that the MVD letters were properly admitted as self-authenticating business records under \u00a7 61-11-102, MCA, and Rule 902(4) of the Montana Rules of Evidence. The City further argued that the challenged letters did not constitute testimonial evidence triggering the Confrontation Clause and were admissible under Rule 803(8), M. R. Evid. Lastly, the City countered that under \u00a7 26-1-602(24), MCA, it is presumed that a correctly addressed and mailed letter is received by the intended recipient and none of the Appellants rebutted this presumption at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b67 The District Court determined that the stamped certificates of mailing included in each suspension letter did not constitute testimonial hearsay; rather, the letters were certified copies of public records and were admissible under Rules 902(4) and 803(8) of the Montana Rules of Evidence. The court also concluded that Appellants had not rebutted the statutory presumption that they had received the suspension letters; therefore, the court presumed receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">\u00b68 Appellants filed timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b69 Section 3-6-110, MCA, governing a district court\u2019s review of a municipal court\u2019s ruling, confines the district court\u2019s review to the record and questions of law. Section 3-6-110(1), MCA. In turn, when this Court reviews the district court, we undertake an independent examination of the record apart from the district court\u2019s decision and will \u201caffirm the district court when it reaches the right result, even if it reaches the right result for the wrong reason.\u201d <em>State v. Gai, </em>2012 MT 235, \u00b6 11, 366 Mont. 408, 288 P.3d 164. Based upon our review of the trial court\u2019s record, we review the trial court\u2019s factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard, its discretionary rulings for an abuse of discretion, and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>State v. Ellison, </em>2012 MT 50, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 276, 272 P.3d 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b610 Each of the Appellants was convicted under \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">(l)(a) A person commits the offense of driving a motor vehicle without a valid license or without statutory exemption or during a suspension or revocation period if the person drives:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">(i) a motor vehicle on any public highway of this state at a time when the person\u2019s privilege to drive or apply for and be issued a driver\u2019s license is suspended or revoked in this state or any other state ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\u00b611 Appellants assert on appeal that the District Court abused its discretion by admitting testimonial hearsay evidence at trial in violation of the Confrontation Clauses of the Montana and the United States Constitutions. They claim that testimonial hearsay is \u201can out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted and where the declarant spoke in a manner as to create evidence.\u201d They explain that in this case \u201cunknown government agents purport to testify in writing that [defendant] should have had notice and knowledge of her [or his] suspended license.\u201d Appellants claim that testimonial hearsay is only permissible if a court determines a declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. They argue this did not occur. They request that we reverse and remand for new trials with instructions that the trial court reject admission of the suspension letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">\u00b612 The State counters that the suspension letters were not testimonial hearsay but were contemporaneous business records created for the administration of the MVD\u2019s operations and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial. As such the letters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>were admissible. Additionally, the State asserts that even if the letters were erroneously admitted, the error was harmless because \u201cdriving with a suspended license\u201d is an absolute liability offense that does not require knowledge of the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b6 13 <em>1. Did the District Court err in failing to determine whether \u00a761-5-212, MCA, imposed absolute liability on each of the Appellants?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b614 We first address the State\u2019s assertion that \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA, establishes that driving with a suspended license is an absolute liability offense which does not require proof of a mental state. Notably, we have not decided previously whether this offense requires proof of a mental state or is an absolute liability offense. To determine whether the legislature intended an offense to be an absolute liability offense we look to the language of the statute and the statute\u2019s apparent purpose. <em>State v. Huebner, </em>252 Mont. 184, 827 P.2d 1260 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b615 In <em>Huebner, </em>we concluded that \u00a7 87-3-102, MCA, prohibiting someone from killing a game animal and abandoning the meat, or removing only the parts suitable for trophy mounting, was an absolute liability statute based upon the State\u2019s responsibility for protecting public wildlife resources. <em>Huebner, </em>252 Mont. at 188, 827 Mont. at 1263. We relied upon \u00a7 45-2-104, MCA, which currently provides that \u201cA person may be guilty of an offense without having, as to each element of the offense, one of the mental states of knowingly, negligently, or purposely only if the offense is punishable by a fine not exceeding $500 or the statute defining the offense clearly indicates a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability for the conduct described.\u201d <em>Huebner, </em>252 Mont. at 188, 827 Mont. at 1263. Applying a previous, but similar, version of \u00a7 45-2-104, MCA (1991), <em>the Huebner </em>Court determined that the language of the statute indicated a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">\u00b616 Turning to \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA, the statute does not contain any reference to a mental state, such as knowingly or purposely. It is clear based upon the many statutes in which the Legislature requires a specific mental state, for example, \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-102,45-5-201,45-5-202, and 45-6-204, MCA, that had the Legislature intended to require one for this statute, it would have done so. Additionally, the legislative purpose of the statute is not difficult to discern. The State has a compelling interest in keeping unsafe drivers off the road, especially drivers whose privileges have been suspended for various reasons such as unsafe driving, driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or driving without liability insurance. <em>State v. Pyette, </em>2007 MT 119, \u00b6 27, 337 Mont. 265, 159 P.3d 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u00b617  Furthermore, while we note that \u00a7 45-2-104, MCA, is written in the disjunctive and requires only that the statutory penalty not exceed $500 <em>or </em>that the statute clearly indicates a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability, in this case both requirements are met in that \u00a7 61-5-212(l)(b)(i), MCA, provides with some exceptions, that a person convicted of driving during a period of license suspension may be fined \u201cnot more than $500.\u201d For these reasons, we conclude that the statute clearly indicates a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability and that conviction under this statute does not require a culpable mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b618 The elements of driving while suspended include driving \u201ca motor vehicle on any public highway\u201d when the driver\u2019s \u201cprivilege to drive ... is suspended.\u201d The evidence presented in each of the Appellant\u2019s trials through admission of their Certified Driver Records established that they drove vehicles upon the public roads of this State while their licenses were suspended. As these were the only requirements necessary for conviction under \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA, the Municipal Court did not err in convicting the Appellants nor did the District Court err in affirming the Municipal Court. As we indicated above, we will not overturn a district court when it reaches the right result, even if it reaches the right result for a different or a wrong reason. <em>Gai, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">\u00b619 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by holding that the evidentiary \u201cletters of suspension\u201d were admissible as \u201ccertified copies of public records\u201d under M. R. Evid. 902(4)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b620 We next address the Appellants\u2019 assertion that the letters notifying them of their suspensions contained \u201ctestimonial hearsay\u201d and should not have been admitted or used to support their convictions. As indicated above, the District Court affirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s admission of the suspension letters, finding them to be certified copies of public records under Rule 902(4). The court further determined they were not testimonial in nature and were appropriately admitted under the public records hearsay exception set forth in Rule 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b621 Rule 803(8), M. R. Evid. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">(8) Public records and reports. To the extent not otherwise provided in this paragraph, records, reports, statements, or data compilations in any form of a public office or agency setting forth its regularly conducted and regularly recorded activities, or matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law and as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>which there was a duty to report, or factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law. The following are not within this exception to the hearsay rule: (i) investigative reports by police and other law enforcement personnel; (ii) investigative reports prepared by or for a government, a public office, or an agency when offered by it in a case in which it is a party; (iii) factual findings offered by the government in criminal cases; (iv) factual findings resulting from special investigation of a particular complaint, case, or incident; and (v) any matter as to which the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trust worthiness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Rule 902(4), M. R. Evid. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">Extrinsic evidence of authenticity as a condition precedent to admissibility is not required with respect to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">(4) Certified copies of public records. A copy of an official record or report or entry therein, or of a document authorized by law to be recorded or filed and actually recorded or filed in a public office, including data compilations in any form, certified as correct by the custodian or other person authorized to make the certification, by certificate complying with paragraph (1), (2), or (3) or complying with any law of the United States or of this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\u00b622  In <em>Billings v. Lindell, </em>236 Mont. 519, 771 P.2d 134 (1989), we addressed the self-authenticating nature of the MVD\u2019s driving records. We explained that the MVD has the duty to maintain records of license convictions and that it would be unreasonable for a custodian of the department to be present in court each time a record was necessary for a trial. <em>Billings, </em>236 Mont. at 521, 771 P.2d at 136. We discussed some of the various methods developed by the Legislature through which authenticity is taken as established for purposes of admissibility. Two such methods were Rules 803(8) and 902(4), M. R. Evid. <em>Billings, </em>236 Mont. at 521-22, 771 P.2d at 136. Based upon the plain language of these rules, the statutorily-mandated purpose of MVD\u2019s record-keeping, and our analysis in <em>Billings, </em>we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the suspension letters were admissible under Rules 803 and 902(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">\u00b623 Lastly, we note that our ruling is consistent with multiple U. S. Supreme Court decisions. That Court distinguishes between testimonial and non-testimonial hearsay, but has repeatedly declined to offer an exhaustive or comprehensive definition of \u201ctestimonial.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 1374 (2004). <em>See also Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 2273 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>(2006). However, in <em>Davis, </em>the U. S. Supreme Court declared that statements are testimonial when their \u201cprimary purpose ... is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S. Ct. at 2273-74. Subsequently, <em>in Melendez-Diaz v. Mass., </em>557 U.S. 305, 129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009), the Court further elaborated that \u201c[b]usiness and public records are generally admissible absent confrontation not because they qualify under an exception to the hearsay rules, but because \u2014 having been created for the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial \u2014 they are not testimonial.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S. at 324, 129 S. Ct. at 2539-40.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">\u00b624 In the case at bar, as in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the primary purpose of the MVD\u2019s suspension letters is not to provide evidence in future criminal prosecutions but rather to notify drivers of a license suspension and to create a statutorily-mandated database of driver\u2019s license records. It is realistic to presume that the vast majority of suspension letters, and other MVD documentation, exist within the agency\u2019s database and printed copies are never generated for purposes of criminal prosecutions. This analysis supports our conclusion that driver\u2019s records are created for the administration of the MVD\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of proving a fact at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b625  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the District Court neither erred nor abused its discretion in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s convictions and judgments of the Appellants.</p>\n<judges id=\"b51-7\">JUSTICES SHEA, COTTER, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
