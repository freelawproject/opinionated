The referendum, codified at \u00a7 1-1-411, MCA, served to deny certain state services to individuals defined by the law to be \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d Before the law went into effect, the Montana Immigrant Justice Alliance (MIJA) sought declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>and injunctive relief from its provisions. The District Court granted MIJA\u2019s request in part, denied it in part, and awarded MIJA attorney fees. The State appeals both the District Court\u2019s order granting MIJA summary judgment and its order awarding MIJA attorney fees. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in concluding that MIJA has standing to challenge LR 121?</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err in concluding that LR 121 is preempted by federal law?</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">\u00b65 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by awarding attorney fees to MIJA?</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">\u00b66 During the 2011 legislative session, the Montana legislature passed House Bill 638, an act denying certain state-funded services to people deemed \u201cillegal aliens,\u201d and submitted the act to the voters of Montana as a legislative referendum. The referendum, LR 121, appeared on the November 6,2012 ballot and was adopted by Montana voters by a wide margin. LR 121 was then codified at \u00a7 1-1-411, MCA, and went into effect on January 1, 2013. (For the sake of brevity, we generally refer to the law as \u201cLR 121.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">\u00b67 The statute, entitled \u201cCertain state services denied to illegal aliens,\u201d reads in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">(1) To the extent allowed by federal law and the Montana constitution and notwithstanding any other state law, a state agency may not provide a state service to an illegal alien and shall <em>comply </em>with the requirements of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-13\">(2) To determine whether an applicant for a state service is an illegal alien, the agency may use the systematic alien verification for entitlements [SAVE] program provided by the United States department of homeland security or any other lawful method of making the determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-14\">(3) A state agency shall notify appropriate personnel in immigration and customs enforcement under the United States department of homeland security or its successor of any illegal alien applying for a state service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-15\">(4) An agency shall require a person seeking a state service to provide proof of United States citizenship or legal alien status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-16\">(5) A state agency shall execute any written agreement required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>by federal law to implement this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-3\">(6) As used in this section, the following definitions apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\">(a) \u201cAgency\u201d means a department, board, commission, committee, authority, or office of the legislative or executive branches of state government, including a unit of the Montana university system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">(b) \u201cIllegal alien\u201d means an individual who is not a citizen of the United States and who has unlawfully entered or remains unlawfully in the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">(c) \u201cState service\u201d means a payment of money, the grant of a state license or permit, or the provision of another valuable item or service under any of the following programs and provisions of law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">(i) employment with a state agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">(ii) qualification as a student in the university system for the purposes of a public education, as provided in 20-25-502;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">(iii) student financial assistance, as provided in Title 20, chapter 26;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">(iv) issuance of a state license or permit to practice a trade or profession, as provided in Title 37;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">(v) unemployment insurance benefits, as provided in Title 39, chapter 51;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">(vi) vocational rehabilitation, as provided in Title 53, chapter 7;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\">(vii) services for victims of crime, as provided in Title 53, chapter 9;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-15\">(viii) services for the physically disabled, as provided in Title 53, chapter 19, parts 3 and 4;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-16\">(ix) a grant, as provided in Title 90.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-17\">Section 1-1-411, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-18\">\u00b68 The Montana Immigrant Justice Alliance is a Helena based nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the rights of immigrants in Montana. Among its members are Mexican citizens who entered the United States without being inspected by a customs or immigration official, but who have since obtained lawful permanent residence status. Immigrants in this situation fear that LR 121\u2019s definition of \u201cillegal alien\u201d includes them because they entered the United States unlawfully, and that accordingly they will be deprived of state services even though they now are considered documented, lawful immigrants by the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-19\">\u00b69 Motivated in part by this fear, MIJA filed a complaint in District Court on December 7, 2012, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from LR 121. The labor association, MEA-MFT, and a 22 year old Montana resident named Alisha Blair joined MIJA as plaintiffs. The complaint named as defendants various government officials tasked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>with enforcing provisions of LR 121, including the Governor, the Attorney General, and the Commissioner of Higher Education, as well as the Board of Regents of Higher Education and the State of Montana (collectively the State).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b610 In support of their request for a preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs argued they were entitled to injunctive relief because the referendum violated certain constitutional rights and was preempted by federal law. The District Court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction as to the majority of LR 121, but enjoined the use of the definition of \u201cillegal alien\u201d in section l(6)(b) (codified at \u00a7 1-1-411(6)(b), MCA) so as to preclude the State from using an individual\u2019s unlawful entry into the United States as a factor in determining that individual\u2019s entitlement to state benefits. The District Court also issued a limiting construction to Section 1(2) of LR 121 (codified at \u00a7 1-1-411(2), MCA) so that when determining who is entitled to benefits, the State may not rely solely on the SAVE program but \u201cwill further use other lawful methods of making a determination based on federal resources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b611 The State then filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of standing, arguing that any alleged injury to plaintiffs caused by LR 121 was abstract and speculative because the law had not been enforced against anyone to date. The District Court agreed that MEA-MFT and Alisha Blair did not have standing and granted the State\u2019s motion as to those two plaintiffs. However, the District Court denied the State\u2019s motion to dismiss MI JA for lack of standing, finding MIJA\u2019s members\u2019 \u201cfear of trouble from LR 121 is reasonable\u201d and that declining to review LR 121 would \u201cimmunize the referendum from review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b612 In the spring of 2014, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment and assured the District Court that no factual issues prevented a ruling on the motions. MI JA moved for summary judgment on the issue of federal preemption. The State moved for summary judgment on MIJA\u2019s constitutional claims as well as the preemption claim. Following full briefing and a hearing on the motions, the District Court found that LR 121 was preempted in its entirety, with one exception, and granted MIJA\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to all but section 1(3) of LR 121 (codified at \u00a7 1-1-411(3), MCA), which requires the State to notify the US Department of Homeland Security of any illegal alien applying for a state service. The District Court simultaneously denied the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment, except as to section 1(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b613 After the District Court found that LR 121 was preempted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>federal law, MIJA filed a motion for attorney fees. The District Court denied the motion. However, four days after the District Court denied MIJA\u2019s motion for attorney fees, this Court decided the case of <em>City of Helena v. Svee, </em>2014 MT 311, 377 Mont. 158, 339 P.3d 32. MIJA then filed a motion to amend the District Court\u2019s earlier ruling denying attorney fees, arguing that this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Svee </em>constituted a notable change in the law concerning the award of attorney fees in declaratory judgment actions. The District Court agreed with MIJA\u2019s interpretation of <em>Svee, </em>vacated its November 21, 2014 order denying fees, and awarded MIJA attorney fees. The State now appeals the District Court\u2019s June 20, 2014 order on cross motions for summary judgment and the order awarding attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment de novo. <em>McClue v. Safeco Ins. Co., </em>2015 MT 222, \u00b6 8, 380 Mont. 204, 354 P.3d 604 (citing <em>Albert v. City of Billings, </em>2012 MT 159, \u00b6 15, 365 Mont. 454, 282 P.3d 704). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Albert, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing M. R. Civ. P. 56). If there is no dispute of material fact, we review whether the district court correctly applied the law. <em>Svee, </em>\u00b6 7 (citing <em>Kalispell Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>2011 MT 154, \u00b6 9, 361 Mont. 115, 255 P.3d 199). A district court\u2019s determinations regarding standing and federal preemption are questions of law which we review for correctness. <em>Aspen Trails Ranch, LLC v. Simmons, </em>2010 MT 79, \u00b6 30, 356 Mont. 41, 230 P.3d 808; <em>see e.g. Fenno v. Mountain West Bank, </em>2008 MT 267, 345 Mont. 161, 192 P.3d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b615 \u201cThis Court reviews for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusion regarding the existence of legal authority to award attorney fees.\u201d <em>Svee, </em>\u00b6 7 <em>(citing Hughes v. Ahlgren, </em>2011 MT 189, \u00b6 10, 361 Mont. 319, 258 P.3d 439). If legal authority exists, we review a district court\u2019s order granting or denying attorney fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Svee, </em>\u00b6 7 (citing <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u00b616 <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that MIJA has standing to challenge LR 121 ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\u00b617 As noted above, the District Court issued a limited preliminary injunction concerning section l(6)(b) of LR 121 (codified at \u00a7 1-1-411(6)(b), MCA) so that it reads as follows: (b) \u201cIllegal alien\u201d means an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>individual who is not a citizen of the United States and who-has unlawfully entered-or- remains unlawfully in the United States.\u201d Following the District Court\u2019s injunction, the State filed a notice of stipulation in which it informed the court that the State \u201cwill not use an individual\u2019s unlawful entry into the country as a factor in determining whether that person is eligible for benefits.\u201d The State then couched its stipulation as a \u201cdisavowal\u201d of that part of the law and used its disavowal to argue that MIJA no longer had standing to challenge LR 121 because there was no longer a credible threat of enforcement. The District Court determined that the State\u2019s disavowal was insufficient to deprive MIJA of standing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b618 The judicial power of Montana\u2019s courts is limited to \u201cjusticiable <em>controversies. \u201dReichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6 53, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455. This limitation derives from the \u201ccases at law and in equity\u201d language of Article VII, Section 4(1) of the Montana Constitution, which \u201cembodies the same limitations as are imposed on federal courts by the \u2018case or controversy\u2019 language of Article III\u201d of the United States Constitution. <em>Plan Helena, Inc. v. Helena Reg\u2019l Airport Auth. Bd., </em>2010 MT 26, \u00b6 6, 355 Mont. 142, 226 P.3d 567. Among the central components of justiciability are the doctrines of standing and ripeness. <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b619 \u201cThe question of standing addresses whether a litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of a particular dispute.\u201d <em>Chipman v. Northwest Healthcare Corp., </em>2012 MT 242, \u00b6 25, 366 Mont. 450, 288 P.3d 193. In order to have standing, \u201cthe complaining party must clearly allege past, present or threatened injury to a property or civil right, and the alleged injury must be one that would be alleviated by successfully maintaining the action.\u201d <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 26. Although we generally prohibit a litigant from vindicating the legal rights of a third party,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">[i]t is well established that an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members, even without a showing of injury to the association itself, when (a) at least one of its members would have standing to sue in his or her own right, (b) the interests the association seeks to protect are germane to its purpose, and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the individual participation of each allegedly injured party in the lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\"><em>Heffernan v. Missoula City Council, 2011 </em>MT 91, \u00b6 43, 360 Mont. 207, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>255 P.3d 80. In this case, MIJA is claiming associational standing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Acg\">\u00b620 Ripeness can be viewed as one of \u201cthe time dimensions of standing\u201d because it is called into question when a party is complaining of a threat of future injury. <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 55 (quoting Charles Alan Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>vol. 13B, \u00a7 3531.12, 163 (3d ed. West 2008)). \u201cRipeness asks whether an injury that has not yet happened is sufficiently likely to happen or, instead, is too contingent or remote to support present adjudication.\u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 55. \u201cRipeness is predicated on the central perception that courts should not render decisions absent a genuine need to resolve a real dispute; hence, cases are unripe when the parties point only to hypothetical, speculative, or illusory disputes as opposed to actual, concrete conflicts.\u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 54. In this case, the State has challenged both MIJA\u2019s associational standing and the ripeness of MIJA\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\">\u00b621 MIJA easily satisfies the second and third requirements of associational standing. MIJA\u2019s mission statement declares that the organization seeks \u201c[t]o combat the mistreatment of immigrants from xenophobia, discrimination, harassment, or racial profiling[,] ... to promote policies that welcome and support the growth of immigrant communities in our state, and to combat policies that marginalize migrant communities.\u201d LR 121 was enacted to deter \u201cillegal aliens\u201d from coming to Montana and to prevent them from accessing state services if they do come. Because the interests MIJA is seeking to protect by challenging the constitutionality of LR 121 are germane to its purpose, MIJA satisfies the second requirement of associational standing. <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 43. Additionally, \u201ca request for declaratory and injunctive relief does not require participation by individual association members,\u201d so MIJA satisfies the third requirement for associational standing. <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 46. MIJA has associational standing then if \u201cat least one of its members would have standing to sue in his or her own right.\u201d <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b622 MIJA\u2019s members claim standing to challenge LR 121 based on a threat of future injury. This is the intersection of the doctrines of standing and ripeness: MIJA\u2019s members must show their claims are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>sufficiently ripe to afford them standing to challenge the law before it is enforced against them. MIJA submitted affidavits from multiple immigrants who arrived in the United States unlawfully but who have since obtained lawful immigration status. LR 121\u2019s definition of \u201cillegal alien\u201d \u2014 \u201can individual who is not a citizen of the United States and who has unlawfully entered or remains unlawfully in the United States,\u201d \u00a7 1-1-411(6)(b), MCA \u2014 clearly encompasses these individuals. Thus, by its own terms, LR 121 would deprive the affiants of state services even though they currently have lawful immigration status. The State maintains that its disavowal of the definition of \u201cillegal alien\u201d renders the threat of enforcement against these affiants sufficiently \u201chypothetical, speculative, or illusory\u201d to make their claims unripe, thereby depriving the affiants of standing. <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b623 MIJA points to <em>Gryczan v. State, </em>283 Mont. 433, 942 P.2d 112 (1997), as an example of a case in which this Court determined plaintiffs had standing to challenge a law before the law was enforced against them. In <em>Gryczan, </em>we were asked to review Montana\u2019s statute criminalizing consensual sexual relations between adults of the same gender. The challenge to the statute was brought by three men and three women who were homosexuals and who had engaged in conduct that violated the statute. <em>Gryczan, </em>283 Mont. at 439, 942 P.2d at 115-16. At the time the case was brought, the statute was 24 years old and had been amended as recently as six years prior, but it had never been enforced and no one had ever been prosecuted under it for engaging in consensual homosexual sexual conduct. <em>Gryczan, </em>283 Mont. at 443, 942 P.2d at 118. The plaintiffs brought a declaratory judgment action, claiming that although they had never been arrested or prosecuted under the statute, they had been injured by its existence because the statute damaged their self-esteem and dignity and made them fearful that they would be prosecuted, they would lose their livelihood, and they would lose custody of their children. <em>Gryczan, </em>283 Mont. at 441, 942 P.2d at 117. The State maintained that mere apprehension of prosecution was insufficient to confer standing because \u201cthere is no evidence of a credible threat of prosecution under the statute.\u201d <em>Gryczan, </em>283 Mont. at 441, 942 P.2d at 117. We agreed with the plaintiffs and held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">[bjecause the legislature does not regard the statute as moribund and because enforcement has not been foresworn by the Attorney General, we agree that Respondents suffer a legitimate and realistic fear of criminal prosecution along with other psychological harms. Respondents are precisely the individuals against whom the statute is intended to operate. This is sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>to give Respondents standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. Moreover, to deny Respondents standing would effectively immunize the statute from constitutional review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A17\"><em>Gryczan, </em>283 Mont. at 446, 942 P.2d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\">\u00b624 The State in this case distinguishes our holding in <em>Gryczan </em>from the case at bar by highlighting the fact that the Attorney General in this case has \u201cforesworn\u201d enforcement of LR 121\u2019s definition of \u201cillegal alien.\u201d The State would have us deny MIJA standing because the current Attorney General has \u201cdisavowed\u201d one part of the law. However, we noted in <em>Gryczan </em>that \u201cthere is nothing to prevent a county attorney from enforcing the statute against consenting adults,\u201d and the same concern operates here. <em>Gryczan, </em>283 Mont. at 444, 942 P.2d at 119. A new Attorney General would not be bound by the present Attorney General\u2019s decision not to enforce the challenged definition, nor would the present Attorney General be legally bound by his earlier promise not to enforce the definition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, LR 121 prohibits a state agency from providing a state service to an \u201cillegal alien.\u201d The statute defines \u201cagency\u201d as \u201ca department, board, commission, committee, authority, or office of the legislative or executive branches of state government, including a unit of the Montana university system.\u201d Section 1-1-411(6)(a), MCA. Thus, the number of government officials to whom enforcement of LR 121 might fall vastly exceeds the number of officials who could have enforced the deviate sexual conduct statute at issue in <em>Gryczan, </em>rendering the Attorney General\u2019s disavowal of the definition of \u201cillegal alien\u201d of even less consequence here than would have been the case in <em>Gryczan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b625 Furthermore, \u201cdisavowal\u201d does not address the other concerns raised in <em>Gryczan </em>and raised here. The legislature certainly does not consider LR 121 moribund, as it was submitted to the voters in 2012. MIJA\u2019s members suffer a legitimate and realistic fear that LR 121\u2019s definition of \u201cillegal alien\u201d will be interpreted by many state officials to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>include them, which would render them ineligible for state services for which they would otherwise be eligible. The MIJA members who came to the United States unlawfully and settled in Montana are precisely the individuals against whom the law is intended to operate, and denying them standing to challenge LR 121 would effectively immunize the statute from constitutional review. In fact, if the State\u2019s disavowal was enough to deprive MIJA of standing in this case, the invocation of disavowal \u2014 which has no basis in Montana law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and is at odds with the executive branch\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201csee that the laws are faithfully executed,\u201d Mont. Const. art. VI, \u00a7 4(1) \u2014 would enable the State in any case to negate a claim of standing premised on the threat of future injury.

The State\u2019s assurance that LR 121 will not be enforced against them under the current administration is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>insufficient to render MIJA\u2019s claims \u201chypothetical, speculative, or illusory.\u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 54.

Congress may preempt state law in three ways, generally referred to as express preemption, field preemption, and conflict preemption, the latter two being forms of implied preemption. <em>Valle Del Sol Inc. v.

Ct. at 2501. This determination is evident where there is \u201ca framework of regulation so pervasive ... that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it or where there is a federal interest ... so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.\u201d <em>Arizona, </em>132 S.

Conflict preemption occurs when a state law conflicts with a federal law, including cases in which \u201ccompliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\u201d and cases in which \u201cthe challenged state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Arizona, </em>132 S.

Because the \u201c[p]ower to regulate immigration is unquestionably exclusively a federal power,\u201d a state law is field preempted if it attempts a regulation of immigration. <em>De Canas v. Bica, </em>424 U.S. 351, 354, 96 S. Ct. 933, 936 (1976). A regulation of immigration is \u201cessentially a determination of who should or should not be admitted into the country, and the conditions under which a legal entrant may remain,\u201d but not \u201cevery state enactment which in any way deals with aliens is a regulation of immigration and thus <em>per se </em>pre-empted by this constitutional power.\u201d <em>De Canas, </em>424 U.S. at 355, 96 S.

Although in many areas state laws are entitled to a presumption of non-preemption, when a state law attempts to regulate an area of significant and historical federal concern, like immigration, the state law is entitled to no such presumption. <em>Valle Del Sol Inc., </em>732 F.3d at 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">A. Express preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b631 Some federal immigration statutes contain express preemption clauses, but many do not. <em>Compare </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(2), <em>with </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621.

The State asserts that LR 121 is not field preempted as a regulation of immigration because it does not \u201cpurport! ] to determine who can and cannot remain in the country.\u201d The State also maintains that LR 121 does not conflict with federal law because \u201cfederal law either requires or expressly allows what LR 121 does.\u201d In support of its position, the State notes that federal law occasionally uses the term \u201cillegal alien.\u201d <em>See e.g. </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621(d); <em>De Canas, </em>424 U.S. at 353, 96 S.

It also notes that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 provides that aliens who are not \u201cqualified aliens\u201d are \u201cnot eligible for any State or local public benefit.\u201d But the federal statute\u2019s use of the defined term \u201cqualified alien\u201d underscores one of the essential problems with LR 121: it utilizes the term \u201cillegal alien,\u201d which is not a defined term in federal immigration law. This essentially leaves the decision about who qualifies as an \u201cillegal alien\u201d up to multiple state officials, and the definition\u2019s applicability to various provisions of LR 121 creates eligibility determinations that are at odds with federal laws on the same subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\">1. Field Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b633 LR 121\u2019s definition of \u201cillegal alien\u201d attempts a regulation of immigration by creating an immigration status that does not exist under federal law. Federal law uses many defined terms for various purposes, including \u201cqualified alien,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1641(b), \u201cunauthorized alien,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3), and \u201celigible noncitizen,\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 668.131, but it does not define the term \u201cillegal alien,\u201d and it does not have a comprehensive definition of \u201clawfully <em>present,\u201d Chaudhry v.

These federally defined terms may encompass individuals who entered the country unlawfully but who have since been granted lawful immigration status pursuant to the discretion of federal officials. <em>See e.g. </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. The State acknowledged that LR 121\u2019s \u201cdefinition of \u2018illegal alien\u2019 may be imperfect because it could be read to apply to those who entered the country unlawfully, but now have legal immigration status,\u201d but the State maintains \u201cthat is not a defect of constitutional proportions.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b634 The federal government occupies the field of classifying non-citizens for various purposes. As the Supreme Court stated, \u201c[t]he central concern of the [Immigration and Nationality Act] is with the terms and conditions of admission to the country and the subsequent treatment of aliens lawfully in the country.\u201d <em>De Canas, </em>424 U.S. at 359, 96 S. Ct. at 938. For this reason, \u201c[t]he States enjoy no power with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>respect to the classification of aliens.\u201d <em>Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 225, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 2399 (1982). Many cooperative state and federal programs require state agencies to verify an applicant\u2019s immigration status, but \u201cstate agents perform a ministerial rather than a discretionary function in verifying immigration status. That is, state agents merely access INS information to verify an applicant\u2019s immigration status \u2014 no independent determinations are made and no state-created criteria are applied.\u201d <em>League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Wilson, </em>908 F. Supp. 755, 770 (C.D. Cal. 1995). There is an essential difference between a state agency performing a ministerial function and a state agency performing a discretionary function:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">Permitting state agents, who are untrained \u2014 and unauthorized \u2014 under federal law to make immigration status decisions, incurs the risk that inconsistent and inaccurate judgments will be made. On the other hand, requiring state agents simply to verify a person\u2019s status with the INS involves no independent judgment on the part of state officials and ensures uniform results consistent with federal determinations of immigration status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\"><em>League of United Latin Am. Citizens, </em>908 F. Supp. at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b635  When a state law authorizes a state official to perform what is essentially a discretionary function with regard to immigration, courts have found that law to be preempted as an impermissible regulation of immigration. The Third Circuit held that certain Pennsylvania housing ordinances preventing \u201cunauthorized aliens\u201d from renting housing \u201cconstitute an impermissible regulation of immigration and are field pre-empted because they intrude on the regulation of residency and presence of aliens in the United States.\u201d <em>Lozano v. City of Hazleton, </em>724 F.3d 297, 317 (3d Cir. 2013). The Fifth Circuit held \u201cthat because the power to classify non-citizens is reserved exclusively to the federal government,\u201d a section of a Texas ordinance that allows state officials to assess whether a noncitizen is \u201clawfully present\u201d is preempted by federal law. <em>Villas at Parkside Partners v. City of Farmers Branch, Texas, </em>726 F.3d 524, 536-37 (5th Cir. 2013). The Eleventh Circuit held that an Alabama law prohibiting courts from enforcing contracts to which \u201cunlawfully present\u201d aliens are parties \u201cconstitutes a thinly veiled attempt to regulate immigration under the guise of contract law\u201d and is thus preempted. <em>United States v. Alabama, </em>691 F.3d 1269, 1296 (11th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b636 Citing the Third, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuits\u2019 rulings, the Ninth Circuit recently reviewed an Arizona law that required applicants for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>a driver\u2019s license to submit proof of \u201cauthorized presence\u201d in the United States. <em>Ariz. Dream, Act Coalition v. Brewer, </em>2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 6256, **27-29 (9th Cir. 2016). The Ninth Circuit held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-3\">Arizona\u2019s policy of denying drivers\u2019 licenses to DACA recipients based on its own notion of \u201cauthorized presence\u201d is preempted by the exclusive authority of the federal government under the INA to classify noncitizens, [...] not because it denies state benefits to aliens, but because the classification it uses to determine which aliens receive benefits does not mirror federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><em>Ariz. Dream Act Coalition, </em>2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 6256 at **34-35. For the same reason, we now hold that LR 121 attempts a regulation of immigration and is preempted by federal law, not because it denies state benefits to \u201cillegal aliens,\u201d but because the term \u201cillegal aliens\u201d is unknown to federal law, thus placing in the hands of state agents immigration status decisions not authorized under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b637  Furthermore, LR 121\u2019s mechanism for determining whether an applicant for state services is an \u201cillegal alien\u201d is in effect an attempt to regulate immigration, and is also field preempted by federal law. LR 121 requires that \u201c[t]o determine whether an applicant for a state service is an illegal alien, the agency may use the systematic alien verification for entitlements [SAVE] program provided by the United States department of homeland security or any other lawful method of making the determination.\u201d Section 1-1-411(2), MCA. The State has failed to point to any federal resource or database apart from SAVE that can be used in a benefit eligibility inquiry, so we concern ourselves only with the SAVE program.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b638 The limitations of the SAVE program have been addressed by courts before. In a case similar to the one at bar, the Fifth Circuit was asked to determine whether a city ordinance requiring a license to occupy a rented apartment was preempted by federal law. <em>Villas, </em>726 F.3d at 526. Under the terms of the ordinance, in order to obtain a license to rent, an individual had to be \u201clawfully present\u201d in the United States. The determination of who was \u201clawfully present\u201d was to be made by querying the SAVE database. <em>Villas, </em>726 F.3d at 533. \u201c[T]he chief of that program testified that SAVE can provide only a non-citizen\u2019s specific immigration status; it does not answer lawful presence or not.\u201d <em>Villas, </em>726 F.3d at 533 (internal quotations omitted). In other words, SAVE will tell a state official that a certain alien entered the United States on an F-l visa, a K-l visa, a green card, etc., but SAVE cannot tell a state official whether the alien originally entered the United States unlawfully or whether that alien remains unlawfully. Under LR 121, the information about lawful entry and presence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>required for a state official to make a determination about whether an applicant for state services is an \u201cillegal alien,\u201d but that determination cannot be made solely by querying the SAVE database. As a result, the determination must be made by the state official.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b639 During discovery, MIJA deposed various state officials to elicit precisely how the state officials intended to determine whether an applicant is an \u201cillegal alien.\u201d When asked how a state agency would determine if someone \u201cunlawfully remains\u201d in the United States, none of the deponents representing administrative agencies could identify how the determination would be made. This \u201cincurs the risk that inconsistent and inaccurate judgments will be made,\u201d <em>League of United Latin Am. Citizens, </em>908 F. Supp. at 770, and is one of the many reasons determinations about lawful presence are to be made solely by qualified federal agents, <em>see Arizona, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2502. The risk of inconsistent and inaccurate judgments is further multiplied by LR 121\u2019s authorizing state agents to make immigration status determinations using the SAVE program \u201cor any other lawful method of making the determination.\u201d Section 1-1-411(2), MCA. The \u201cany other lawful method\u201d language invites state agents to embark on an expedition through immigration laws and regulations without the benefit of guidance from qualified federal agents. The risk of inconsistent and inaccurate judgments issuing from a multitude of state agents untrained in immigration law and unconstrained by any articulated standards is evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b640  As the Supreme Court said in <em>Arizona v. United States, </em>\u201c[wjhere Congress occupies an entire field, ... even complementary state regulation is impermissible. Field preemption reflects a congressional decision to foreclose any state regulation in the area, even if it is parallel to federal standards.\u201d 132 S. Ct. at 2502. Thus the fact that LR 121 attempts to limit its own interpretation to \u201cthe extent allowed by federal law,\u201d \u00a7 1-1-411(1), MCA, is insufficient to save it from preemption because Congress has occupied the particular field LR 121 attempts to regulate. The District Court did not err in finding that LR 121 was field preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">2. Conflict preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b641 LR 121 is also conflict preempted because it \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Arizona, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2501 (internal quotations omitted). LR 121\u2019s definition of \u201cillegal alien\u201d disqualifies for state services certain aliens who would otherwise be qualified for those services under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u00b642 For example, \u201cemployment with a state agency\u201d is one of the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>services to which \u201cillegal aliens\u201d are not entitled under LR 121. Section 1-1-411(6)(c)(i), MCA. But employment of aliens is regulated by federal law and is to be decided by the definition of \u201cunauthorized alien.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(a)(1)(a). An \u201cunauthorized alien\u201d is one who is not \u201c(A) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or (B) authorized to be so employed by this Act or by the Attorney General.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3). As discussed above, there are many circumstances in which an alien originally enters the country unlawfully but is later admitted for permanent residence. In fact, many MIJA members who submitted affidavits in this case are in precisely this situation. Under federal law, they are not \u201cunauthorized aliens,\u201d and thus they would be eligible for employment with a state agency, but for LR 121\u2019s expansive definition of \u201cillegal alien.\u201d This is a clear conflict with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\">\u00b643 Another example is LR 121\u2019s disqualification of \u201cillegal aliens\u201d from attendance at a state university. Section 1-1-411(6)(c)(ii), MCA. Eligibility for federal public benefits, including attendance at a public university, is regulated by federal law and is to be decided by the definition of \u201cqualified alien.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1611(c)(1)(B). A \u201cqualified alien\u201d includes aliens who are lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the INA, aliens who are granted asylum or refugee status under the INA, aliens whose deportation is being withheld under the INA, aliens who have been granted conditional entry under the INA, and several other classifications of aliens. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1641(b). This definition also encompasses individu\u00e1is, like many of the MIJA affiants, who may have entered the country unlawfully but who now have lawful immigration status. Under federal law, the MIJA members who are permanent residents are \u201cqualified aliens\u201d for purposes of postsecondary education, and thus they would be eligible to attend a Montana university, but for LR 121\u2019s expansive definition of \u201cillegal alien.\u201d This too is a clear conflict with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b644 There are many other instances in which LR 121\u2019s definition of \u201cillegal alien\u201d conflicts with federal law\u2019s classification of various immigrants. LR 121 is therefore an \u201cobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Arizona, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2501 (internal quotations omitted). The District Court did not err in concluding that LR 121 is conflict preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"Arb\">\u00b645 Finally, we turn to the provision of LR 121 that was saved from preemption by the District Court. LR 121 contains a severability clause. H.B. 638, 62d Leg., Reg. Sess. (Mont. 2011). The District Court determined that LR 121\u2019s mandatory reporting requirement was not preempted by federal law because \u201cthe federal government encourages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>this sort of notification,\u201d <em>see e.g. </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373(a); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1644, and the notification could be effectuated independently of the preempted portions of the law. The District Court severed the reporting requirement, codified at \u00a7 1-1-411(3), MCA, from the remainder of LR 121 and sustained it, pursuant to the \u201cwell-established principle that a statute is not destroyed in toto because of an improper provision.\u201d <em>Reichart, </em>\u00b6 86. However, the mandatory reporting requirement, like the other improper provisions of LR 121, uses the term \u201cillegal alien\u201d: \u201c[a] state agency shall notify appropriate personnel in immigration and customs enforcement under the United States department of homeland security or its successor of any illegal alien applying for a state service.\u201d Section 1-1-411(3), MCA. A state official would not be able to carry out his or her reporting duty without first determining whether the person applying for a state service is an \u201cillegal alien.\u201d This raises all the problems discussed above. Because the reporting requirement is also dependent upon LR 121\u2019s definition of \u201cillegal alien,\u201d we hold that it cannot be severed from the rest of the law; it too is preempted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b646 LR 121 was intended to force \u201cillegal aliens ... to leave Montana rather than use our services and take our jobs.\u201d The definition of \u201cillegal alien\u201d is an essential part of the law; indeed, the law would serve no purpose if the definition of \u201cillegal alien\u201d were removed. Because the entirety of \u00a7 1-1-411, MCA, is infected with a definition of \u201cillegal alien\u201d that is unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause, the entire statute is preempted by federal law. We therefore affirm the District Court to the extent it found LR 121 was preempted by federal law, and we reverse the District Court to the extent it found \u00a7 1-1-411(3), MCA, to be severable and sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b647 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by awarding attorney fees to MIJA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b648 The prevailing party in a civil action brought against the State of Montana is entitled to costs and reasonable attorney fees if the court finds that the State\u2019s claims or defenses were \u201cfrivolous or pursued in bad faith.\u201d Section 25-10-711(1)(b), MCA. \u201cA claim or defense is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>frivolous or in bad faith when it is outside the bounds of legitimate argument on a substantial issue on which there is a bona fide difference of opinion.\u201d <em>Western Tradition P\u2019ship v.

In fact, in its original order denying MI JA\u2019s motion for attorney fees, the District Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\">in none of the matters [raised by MIJA] did the State operate in bad faith.

The Attorney General was defending, as is his duty, an enactment passed by 80 percent of the voting citizens of Montana. This topic was one which was important to a large number of Montanans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We agree with the District Court that the State\u2019s defense of LR 121 was not frivolous or in bad faith. MIJA is therefore not entitled to attorney fees under \u00a7 25-10-711(l)(b), MCA, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b650 However, the District Court reconsidered its denial of attorney fees because it found that our decision in <em>Svee </em>\u201cchanged significantly\u201d the allowance of attorney fees in declaratory judgment actions. We do not agree. Our holding in <em>Svee </em>did not change the rule that \u201ccourts analyzing a claim for fees in a declaratory judgment proceeding [must] make a threshold determination that equitable considerations support an award of attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Western Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>Mungas v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, </em>2009 MT 426, \u00b6 45, 354 Mont. 50, 221 P.3d 1230; Hughes, \u00b6\u00b6 13, <em>21; United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 269, \u00b6 39, 352 Mont. 105, 214 P.3d 1260). Rather, <em>Svee </em>was one of the rare instances in which equitable considerations did support an award of attorney fees in a declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u00b651 We found that equitable considerations supported an award of attorney fees in <em>Svee </em>because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\">[t]he Svees sought to accomplish a low-cost repair of their roof in response to a notice from their insurance company about cancellation of their coverage. By so doing, they were named as defendants in both criminal and civil actions filed by the municipal government, in comparison to whom they had significantly less resources to litigate the alleged violation of the ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><em>Svee, </em>\u00b6 21. That was a very different factual scenario than the one presented in <em>Western Tradition Partnership. </em>In <em>Western Tradition Partnership </em>we noted that \u201c[t]he courts necessarily must use caution in awarding fees against the State in a \u2018garden variety\u2019 declaratory judgment action that challenges the constitutionality of a statute that the Attorney General, in the exercise of his executive power, has chosen to defend.\u201d <em>Western Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 17. We held in that case that equitable considerations did not support an award of attorney fees even though the plaintiff \u201cvindicated principles of constitutional magnitude\u201d because \u201cthe State\u2019s defense [of the challenged statute] also was grounded in constitutional principles and in an effort to enforce interests the executive deemed equally significant to its citizens.\u201d <em>Western Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b652 <em>Svee </em>did not change the law regarding awards of attorney fees in declaratory judgment actions; it merely represents one of the rare instances in which equitable considerations necessitated an award. The case at bar, however, is more like <em>Western Tradition Partnership </em>than <em>Svee. </em>In this case, the Attorney General exercised his power to defend a legislative referendum that had the support of the vast majority of Montana voters. In defending LR 121, the Attorney General grounded his arguments in constitutional principles, and although he was unsuccessful, his defense of the law was not frivolous or in bad faith. Moreover, LR 121 has not been enforced to date against MIJA\u2019s members or anyone else. Central to our award of attorney fees in <em>Svee </em>was the fact that the Svees were named as defendants in both criminal and civil actions brought by the City of Helena. While the preenforcement nature of this case did not deprive MIJA of standing, it does weigh against MIJA in an analysis of the equitable considerations regarding an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u00b653 \u201cWe reverse a district court for abusing its discretion only when it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason[,] resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number><em>Western Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>B Bar J Ranch, LLC v. Carlisle Wide Plank Floors, Inc., </em>2012 MT 246, \u00b6 10, 366 Mont. 506, 288 P.3d 228) (internal quotations omitted). Because the District Court read <em>Svee </em>as a significant change to the allowance of attorney fees in declaratory judgment actions, and proceeded to award MIJA attorney fees without analyzing the facts of this case in comparison to the facts in <em>Svee </em>and the facts in <em>Western Tradition Partnership, </em>we hold that the District Court abused its discretion. We reverse the District Court\u2019s order awarding \u201csupplemental relief\u2019 to MIJA in the form of attorney fees against the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b654 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s June 20, 2014 Order granting MIJA\u2019s motion for summary judgment to the extent it found LR 121 was preempted by federal law, and we reverse the District Court\u2019s Order to the extent it found \u00a7 1-1-411(3), MCA, was severable and not preempted. We also reverse the District Court\u2019s February 10, 2015 Order awarding MIJA attorney fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON, WHEAT, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-5\"> MIJA argued for the first time on appeal that in addition to associational standing, it also has standing in its own right to challenge LR 121 because the law threatens to divert MIJA\u2019s resources and frustrate its mission. However, it is well established that we will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal, nor will we address a party\u2019s change in legal theory. <em>Becker v. Rosebud Operating Servs., </em>2008 MT 285, \u00b6 17, 345 Mont. 368, 191 P.3d 435. Accordingly, we decline to address MIJA\u2019s argument that it has direct, as opposed to associational, standing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-5\"> Attorney General Opinions are binding on state-employed attorneys, but they are not binding on District Courts or the Supreme Court. Section 2-15-501(7), MCA; <em>O\u2019Shaughnessy v. Wolfe, </em>212 Mont. 12, 17, 685 P.2d 361, 364 (1984). \u201cCourts never look to administrative interpretation when the language [of a statute] is clear beyond cavil. To hold otherwise would be to say that administrators and executive officials, interpreting the effect of statutes, could undermine the enactments by official action and nullify otherwise validly adopted laws.\u201d <em>O\u2019Shaughnessy, </em>212 Mont. at 17, 685 P.2d at 364. In this case, the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cdisavowal\u201d of the definition of \u201cillegal alien\u201d is not even set forth in an official Attorney General Opinion and is thus of no precedential value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b352-5\"> The State\u2019s use of the term \u201cdisavowal\u201d seems to come from our use of the term in <em>Gryczan, </em>when we said \u201cat least one circuit court has held that nothing short of an express unconditional statement that the law will not be enforced will bar plaintiffs from challenging a law. Here, the State has made no such disavowal.\u201d <em>Gryczan, </em>283 Mont. at 445, 942 P.2d at 119-20 (internal citation omitted). However, in the Eight Circuit case we referenced in <em>Gryczan, </em>the court went on to say that \u201c[p]ast arrests or threats of arrest, while relevant, are not necessary to establish the justiciability of plaintiffs\u2019 claim .... Where plaintiffs allege an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest which is clearly proscribed by statute, courts have found standing to challenge the statute, even absent a specific threat of enforcement.\u201d <em>United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Int\u2019l Union v. IBP, Inc., </em>857 F.2d 422, 427-28 (8th Cir. 1988). The justiciability of a pre-enforcement challenge necessarily depends on the facts of the particular case and the language of the statute in question. Contrary to the State\u2019s interpretation, our phrasing in <em>Gryczan </em>did not establish a bright line test for justiciability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b354-8\"> There is some debate in the briefing about whether MIJA has brought a facial challenge or an as applied challenge. Because we are deciding this case on preemption grounds, the distinction is of no consequence. <em>Green Mt. R.R. Corp. v. Vermont, </em>404 F.3d 638, 644 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\"> Of course, this holding does not prohibit state officials from communicating with the federal government about an individual\u2019s immigration status, since state officials are entitled to do so absent LR 121. <em>Ga. Latino Alliance for Human Rights v. Governor of Ga., </em>691 F.3d 1250, 1267 (11th Cir. 2012) (\u201cPursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(g)(10), state officers may permissibly communicate with the federal government about \u2018the immigration status of any individual,\u2019 even absent a formalized agreement between the locality and federal government.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b363-6\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"Ak9\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u00b655 With respect to the matter of attorney fees, I continue to believe that the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Svee </em>was incorrect. The District Court understandably awarded fees to MIJA in light of that ruling. This case demonstrates, however, that <em>Svee </em>was based on its very unique facts, and our Opinion today reaffirms that \u201c \u2018garden variety\u2019 declaratory judgment action[s]\u201d do not justify an award of attorney fees under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA. <em>Western Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 11 (quoting <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 44).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
