The clinic employed numerous employees and was a small business member of the Montana Chamber of Commerce. Ibsen purchased health insurance coverage for its employees from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana (BCBSMT) through the Chamber of Commerce\u2019s program known as \u201cChamber Choices.\u201d In July 2013, Health Care Service Corporation (Health Care) acquired BCBSMT\u2019s existing health insurance business and BCBSMT changed its name to Caring for Montanans, Inc. (Caring). In April 2014, Ibsen filed a complaint and class action against Caring and Health Care alleging that they had violated the Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA or the Act) by charging Ibsen and other similarly situated employers, excessive premiums and using the excess collections to pay kickbacks to the Chamber of Commerce. Following removal to federal court and a remand back to the First Judicial District Court, Helena, Montana, in March 2015, the District Court granted Health Care\u2019s motion to dismiss and Caring\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court determined that the UTPA did not provide private litigants such as Ibsen with a private right of action to seek enforcement of the Act. Ibsen appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether Ibsen may maintain a private right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>of action for violation of \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-208 and -212, MCA, of the UTPA, or, in the alternative, whether Ibsen\u2019s claims can be sustained as common law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b63 For several years and until December 2015, Ibsen owned and operated the Urgent Care Plus Clinic in Helena, Montana. Ibsen became a small business member of the Montana Chamber of Commerce and during 2011, 2012, and 2013, it elected to provide health insurance coverage for its employees through a Chamber program known as \u201cChamber Choices.\u201d It chose BCBSMT, a \u201cChamber Choice\u201d vendor, as its provider and paid monthly premiums to BCBSMT.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b64 In accordance with applicable oversight statutes, the Montana Department of Insurance (MDOI) conducted a Market Conduct Examination of BCBSMT in which it reviewed the insurer\u2019s business practices between July 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010. In February 2014, the Montana State Auditor issued an Order fining BCBSMT $250,000 for numerous discrepancies, including improper medical premium billing in violation of Unfair Trade Practices \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-208 and -212, MCA. Caring did not challenge or appeal the fine and paid it within the required 30-day payment period.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b65 In April 2014, Ibsen filed a \u201cComplaint Putative Class Action\u201d against Caring and Health Care. An amended complaint was filed shortly thereafter. Ibsen alleged that from 2007 through 2012, BCBSMT violated \u00a7 33-18-212, MCA, by improperly charging consumers padded premiums that included undisclosed amounts exceeding the medical premium. It claimed that BCBSMT used the overcharges to provide kickbacks to the Chamber of Commerce, the organization that marketed BCBSMT\u2019s insurance plan to its members. It further argued that these kickbacks were given to ensure that BCBSMT remained as a \u201cChamber Choice\" provider and thus were in violation of \u00a7 33-18-208, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">\u00b66 In addition to asserting class allegations, the amended complaint set forth the following four counts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\"><em>Count I </em>- Breach of Fiduciary Duty:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">Ibsen claimed that Caring and Health Care owed it and the putative class fiduciary duties under the UTPA that it breached by \u201ccollecting excessive and/or improper medical premiums and by paying rebates in violation of the Montana Insurance Code [MIC].\u201d Ibsen asserted that it and the class were injured by these breaches and were entitled to appropriate relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>Count II </em>- Unfair/Deceptive Trade Practices/Violation of Insurance Billing Statutes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">Ibsen maintained that BCBSMT violated \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-208 and -212, MCA, by charging and collecting improper and excessive medical premiums from it and the class and by paying kickbacks. It claimed that BCBSMT\u2019s conduct was an unfair and/or deceptive trade practice under Title 33. Ibsen sought appropriate relief, treble damages, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\"><em>Count III </em>- Breach of Contract:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">Ibsen alleged that it and the class entered into written insurance contracts with BCBSMT and that these contracts \u201cimpliedly\u201d contained all sections of the Montana Insurance Code, including \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-208 and -212, MCA. Ibsen asserted that under the contracts, BCBSMT \u201cimplied and covenanted that it would act in good faith and follow the law and the contracts with respect to its billing practices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\"><em>Count IV </em>- Unjust Enrichment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">Lastly, Ibsen declared that BCBSMT\u2019s collection of premiums and fees beyond those authorized by applicable law and the payment of rebates to secure business for itself were violations of the MIC and constituted unjust enrichment. It requested that BCBSMT be disgorged of all excessive premiums collected and that those funds be returned to the class members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">\u00b67 Caring promptly filed a Notice of Removal from the First Judicial District Court to the United States District Court for Montana. Caring asserted that Ibsen\u2019s claim fell within the scope of \u00a7 502(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and consequently should be decided in federal court. Ibsen countered with a motion to remand to District Court arguing that its complaint raised state law claims similar to those adjudicated in the federal decision, <em>Fossen v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mont., </em>660 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir. 2011), in which the court held that almost-identical state claims were not completely preempted by federal law. Without legal analysis or ruling on other pending motions, in June 2014, the federal court granted Ibsen\u2019s motion and remanded the case to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab3\">\u00b68 In rendering its March 2015 ruling on the motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, the District Court held that the legislature did not provide private citizens with the right to bring a cause of action to enforce \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-208 and -212, MCA. The court noted that \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, offers the sole statutory exception to the Commissioner\u2019s exclusive authority to enforce the UTPA by allowing \u201cinsureds\u201d to assert claims involving \u201cclaims handling or settlement practices.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>District Court reasoned that because Ibsen was not an insured nor was it asserting a cause of action based upon claims handling or settlement practices, \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b69 Ibsen asserted that three of its four claims were common law claims rather than statutory claims brought under the UTPA. The District Court disagreed. The court pointed out that \u201cCount II clearly alleges a statutory violation and purports to allow [Ibsen] to enforce the two provisions of the insurance code ([S]ections -208 and -212).\u201d It therefore held that \u201cCount II ... is strictly and explicitly a statutory claim [and] is not allowed to be brought by private claimants.\u201d The District Court also invoked Ibsen\u2019s assertions in the federal court proceeding that its \u201cseveral causes of action\u201d were \u201call based on violations of the two insurance code sections.\u201d Consequently, the District Court held that each remaining count set forth in the Complaint was not a common law claim. Citing \u00a7 33-1-311(1), MCA, the \u201cGeneral powers and duties\u201d section of the MIC, the court found that the clear intent of the legislature is that the insurance code is to be enforced by the insurance commissioner and not private litigants, with exceptions not applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b610 Ibsen filed a timely appeal. The Montana Commissioner of Insurance (Commissioner) and the Montana Trial Lawyers Association (MTLA) have filed amicus briefs in support of Ibsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling de novo, applying the same rule, M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3), that a district court does when ruling on summary judgment. Summary judgment \u201cshould be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Victory Ins. Co. v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2015 MT 82, \u00b6 10, 378 Mont. 388, 344 P.3d 977 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss under the standards set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would entitle him to relief. A district court\u2019s determination that a complaint has failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted is a conclusion of law which we review for correctness. <em>Victory Ins.

The defendants counter that the UTPA precludes private rights of action for claims arising from the UTPA provisions relied upon by Ibsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">\u00b621 We deem it appropriate to briefly review the history of the UTPA. In 1959, the Montana legislature enacted the Montana Insurance Code (MIC), codified at Title 40, R.C.M.1947. The legislation was derived from the Model Act drafted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The MIC, subsequently renumbered, spans forty chapters in Title 33 of the MCA, and governs numerous facets of the relationship between and among insurers, insurance companies, insurance consumers, and others. The UTPA constitutes one chapter of the MIC and is codified at Chapter 18 of Title 33, \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-101 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>through 33-18-1006, MCA. Its purpose is to regulate trade practices in the business of insurance by defining and prohibiting practices constituting unfair acts or methods of competition. Section 33-18-101, MCA. While the UTPA regulates the relationship among an insured, a claimant, and an insurer, it also provides broader governance by, among other things: (1) restricting the relationship between insurers and mortuaries, \u00a733-18-301, MCA; (2) penalizing insurer political contributions, \u00a7 33-18-305, MCA; (3) regulating how credit information for personal insurance may be used, \u00a7 33-18-605, MCA; and (4) prohibiting insurer discrimination on the basis of genetic traits, \u00a7 33-18-903, MCA. Notably, under the original UTPA, the Commissioner was solely responsible for enforcement of the entire UTPA and no express private right of action was codified in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b622 In 1977, the legislature adopted amendments to the law that provided the Commissioner with greater regulatory authority. In 1980, NAIC issued a report in which it expressly stated, \u201cthe intent of the NAIC, as evidenced by the language of the [Act] and the NAIC Proceedings, and supplemented by this Report, was clearly not to create a new private right of action for trade practices which are prohibited by the Model Act.\u201d 2 NAIC Proc. 344, 350 (1980). At that time, the Montana legislature did not incorporate into Montana\u2019s UTPA any provision precluding private rights of action or referencing the NAIC\u2019s 1980 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u00b623 The first Montana case to reference the \u201cUnfair Trade Practices Section of the Montana Insurance Code\u201d was <em>Klaudt v. Flink, </em>202 Mont. 247, 658 P.2d 1065 (1983) (overruled in part on other grounds and superseded in part by \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA). <em>Klaudt </em>presented a case of first impression to this Court: Does the Unfair Trade Practices Section of the MIC, specifically \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA, confer a private right of action against an insurer by a third-party claimant? In <em>Klaudt, </em>18-year-old Klaudt died of injuries sustained in a high-speed automobile accident. Klaudt was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Calvin Flink, who was intoxicated at the time. Flink admitted fault for the accident and pleaded guilty to reckless driving. Flink\u2019s insurer, State Farm, refused to negotiate with the Klaudts and denied liability. Klaudt\u2019s parents sued Flink and State Farm alleging that State Farm breached its duty under the UTPA to fairly negotiate and settle claims. The district court granted State Farm\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds that the Klaudts did not have standing. Klaudts appealed. <em>Klaudt, </em>202 Mont. at 249, 658 P.2d at 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\u00b624 To determine whether the insurer\u2019s duty to settle claims under \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA, ran to a third-party in addition to the insured, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>reviewed cases from other jurisdictions with similar statutes and discovered a split of authority on the issue. We then set forth the four-prong test we subsequently applied in <em>Wombold v. Assocs. Fin. Servs. Co. of Mont., Inc., </em>2004 MT 397, 325 Mont 290, 104 P.3d 1080. <em>Klaudt, </em>202 Mont. at 250-51, 658 P.2d at 1066-67. After applying the test, the Court held that Section 201(6), conferred a duty on insurers and claims adjusters covered by the unfair trade practices section to settle claims with insureds and third-party claimants promptly, fairly, and in good faith, and held that a civil action could be maintained for failure to do so. <em>Klaudt, </em>202 Mont. at 252, 658 P.2d at 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b625 Following <em>Klaudt, </em>the 1987 Montana Legislature enacted \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA. Section 242(1) expressly grants an insured or a third-party claimant a right to bring an independent cause of action against an insurer for actual damages caused by the insurer\u2019s violation of subsections (1), (4)-(6), (9), and (13) of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA. These subsections, set forth above at \u00b6 16, prohibit unfair claim handling and settlement practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b626 The legislative history indicates that the Legislature intended to limit the expansion of private causes of action following <em>Klaudt. </em>On January 27,1987, Representative Fred Thomas sponsored House Bill 240, a bill drafted to revise the law on insurance bad faith claims. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">These are claims against insurers arising out of unfair claims settlement practices, which is essentially an administrative remedy that has been on the books for many years. The Supreme Court has expanded the administrative remedy into a court created right of action called the Tort of Insurance Bad Faith. Based on <em>[Klaudt], </em>the [CJourt not only allows insureds to sue their own insurer for the Tort of Insurance Bad Faith but also allows an injured third party to sue the wrong doer\u2019s insurance company. Montana is one of a handful of liberal right of action states. The right of action has also substantially increased premiums to businesses and individuals across the state. Availability, affordability and fairness are the issues of this bill. Our [CJourt has swung the pendulum so far in favor of the trial lawyers that it has stacked the deck against insurers, as a result, all of us pay. This bill swings the pendulum back towards the middle. It limits the action where an insurer should be held accountable for an injury it causes to a person through highly improper conduct. This bill also encourages alternative dispute resolution; this should cut down on court congestion and unnecessary litigation processes. [The bill] moves us toward the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>original intent of the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act but courts will still be able to hear those insurance bad faith actions that in the past have given insurance companies such a black eye.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aoi\">\u00b627 The legislative history also contains written proposed amendments to HB 240 as well as a transcript of discussions about the bill by proponents and opponents. Then-Commissioner of Insurance Andrea Bennett supported the original bill in which Section 242 granted but limited private rights of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b628 Opponents to the bill complained that it was too limiting and did not allow for private rights of action for all fourteen unfair claim settlement practices identified in Section 201. In fact, the original HB 240 contained a statement that Section 242 was to apply to all provisions in Title 33, chapter 18, part 2, \u201cInsurer\u2019s Relations with Insured and Claimant.\u201d However, the Commissioner urged deletion of this statement and it was deleted from the bill; thus, only a violation of the enumerated sections set forth in Section 242(1) are actionable. \u00b629 At present, Section 242 allows an insured or third-party claimant to bring an independent cause of action against an insurer for actual damages caused by the insurer\u2019s violation of the six enumerated subsections of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA. Caring and Health Care argue that Section 242 is the only provision of the UTPA that affords a private right of action, and that it does not supply any authority for the claims made by Ibsen. First, Caring and Health Care point out that Ibsen is neither an insured nor a third-party claimant; thus, it has no standing to invoke the provisions of Section 242. Second, they note that Section 242 does not in any event permit a private right of action by any person for claims arising either from the unlawful extension of rebates (Section 208) or the illegal dealing in premiums (Section 212).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b630 Ibsen counters that Section 242 merely codified <em>Klaudt\u2019s </em>common-law-recognized private right of action for an insurer\u2019s violation of claims handling practices because \u201cclaims handling practices\u201d was the only issue with which the legislators were concerned in 1987. Ibsen argues that Section 242 does not preclude private rights of action generally or for other claimed violations of the UTPA, nor does it preclude common law claims based upon statutorily-prohibited conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u00b631 We have addressed previously whether an individual claimant has the right to bring a private action to enforce a statute that primarily was intended to be regulated by a governing agency. In <em>Wombold, </em>we were asked to determine whether the Consumer Loan Act (CLA) created or implied a private right of action to enforce the provisions of the statute. Wombolds brought an action against Associates Financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Services Company (AFS), a licensed lender under the CLA, alleging that AFS employed illegal lending practices in its real estate-secured loans with the Wombolds. <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 1. AFS argued that the Department of Administration (DOA), the enforcement agency over the CLA, was \u201cthe sole entity authorized to seek a remedy for violations of the act in the Courts.\u201d <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 33. The district court disagreed and granted Wombolds\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment holding that the CLA afforded a private right of action. <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 2. AFS appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u00b632 In our review, we first noted that the CLA did not expressly authorize a private right of action, nor did the legislative history indicate an intent to expressly grant or deny such a right. <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 34. We then considered the following factors to determine if the statute implied such a right: (1) is the interpretation [allowing a private right of action] consistent with the statute as a whole; (2) does the interpretation reflect the intent of the legislature considering the statute\u2019s plain language; (3) is the interpretation reasonable so as to avoid absurd results; and (4) has the agency charged with the administration of the statute placed a construction on the statute. <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 35. (As noted in \u00b6 24, this is the same test we applied in <em>Klaudt.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b633 We determined that the CLA had the beneficent purpose to regulate consumer lenders and protect borrowers; it should therefore be construed liberally. <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 36. We observed that the statute granted certain rights to borrowers regarding the structure of their loans and that those rights would be meaningless if the borrowers could not enforce them. <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 37. We attributed the presence of an attorney fee provision in the law as confirmation of legislative intent to grant a private right of action. <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 42. We also concluded that implying a private right of action would not lead to absurd results. <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 45. Lastly, in holding that a <em>limited </em>private right of action was implied under the CLA, we acknowledged that the DOA had issued no statement addressing this issue; therefore, we considered the Montana Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of the statute to include a private right of action. <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 46. Based upon this analysis, we determined that the CLA did not prohibit Wombolds\u2019 private cause of action. <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u00b634 We revisited this analysis in <em>Faust v. Util. Solutions, LLC, </em>2007 MT 326, 340 Mont. 183, 173 P.3d 1183, when we were asked to determine whether the Montana Water Use Act (WUA) created a private right of action. <em>Faust, </em>\u00b6 4. Faust owned real property and water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>rights in Gallatin County at the time of this suit. <em>Faust, </em>\u00b6 5. Utility Solutions operated a water and wastewater system to service private developments, and while awaiting appropriate permits began pumping groundwater before final regulatory approval had been granted. <em>Faust, </em>\u00b6 6. Faust, arguing his water rights would be adversely affected by Utility\u2019s groundwater appropriations and violation of the WUA, sought injunctive relief and civil penalties. <em>Faust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8. The district court granted Utility\u2019s motion to dismiss holding that Faust lacked standing to sue under the WUA. <em>Faust, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\u00b635 On appeal, the Court determined that Faust\u2019s injunctive relief claim was moot because the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC), the permitting and regulatory agency, had issued the final permit to Utility and the company was extracting groundwater legally. Therefore, we addressed \u201conly whether the [WUA] creates a right of action that allows private citizens to enforce its civil penalty provisions.\u201d <em>Faust, </em>\u00b6 23. Turning to the express language of the statute, we reviewed, among other provisions, the WUA\u2019s \u201cjudicial enforcement\u201d provision and observed that it referred only to actions initiated by the DNRC, not by private citizens. <em>Faust, </em>\u00b6 25. As in <em>Wombold, </em>we noted the existence of an attorney fee provision but ruled it inapplicable to Faust\u2019s claim for civil penalties because it pertained expressly and exclusively to claims for injunctive relief. <em>Faust, </em>\u00b6 26. Additionally, reviewing the statute as a whole, we noted that the fines and penalties that could be imposed by a district court must be deposited into a special fund to finance departmental regulatory enforcement of the Act; thus, the district court was not authorized to award fines and penalties to a private citizen. <em>Faust, </em>\u00b6 27. Relying on these findings as well as the legislative history which supported the absence of a private right of action, we affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling and concluded that the WUA tasked the DNRC, the attorney general, or the county attorney with enforcing the Act\u2019s civil penalty provisions, but it conferred no such right upon a private citizen. <em>Faust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b636 Turning back to the UTPA, the United States District Court for Montana concluded that the UTPA did not create or imply a private right of action to enforce \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-204 and -212, MCA, in <em>Shupak v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>780 F. Supp. 1328, 1338 (D. Mont. 1991). Ibsen acknowledges this but argues that <em>Shupak </em>is not controlling and has been contradicted by several subsequent Montana Supreme Court cases. Relying on <em>O\u2019Fallon v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>260 Mont. 233, 859 P.2d 1008 (1993), <em>Thomas v. Northwestern Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>292 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>357, 973 P.2d 804 (1998), and <em>Williams v. Union Fid. Life Ins. Co., </em>2005 MT 273, 329 Mont. 158, 123 P.3d 213, Ibsen maintains it is entitled to bring common law tort claims based upon insurer conduct that is not expressly listed in \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b637 In <em>O'Fallon, </em>O\u2019Fallon was injured in an automobile accident caused by an insured of Farmers. <em>O\u2019Fallon, </em>260 Mont. at 235, 859 P.2d at 1009. O\u2019Fallon brought an action to recover damages for Farmers\u2019 violation of \u00a7 33-18-201(4) and (6), MCA (refusal to investigate, pay claims, and settle in good faith). The district court dismissed O\u2019Fallon\u2019s complaint and he appealed. <em>O\u2019Fallon, </em>260 Mont. at 236, 859 P.2d at 1010. This Court reversed the district court, determining that O\u2019Fallon was a \u201cthird-party claimant\u201d under the UTPA, and therefore his Sections 201 and 242 statutory claims were not barred. <em>O\u2019Fallon, </em>260 Mont. at 242, 859 P.2d at 1013. The claims asserted in <em>O\u2019Fallon </em>were clearly statutory claims expressly permitted under Section 242; they were not common law tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b638 In <em>Thomas, </em>the Thomases, plumbing and heating contractors, submitted a claim to Northwestern Insurance, their CGL insurer, arising out of damages to a client\u2019s property resulting from a spill that occurred during an installation. The insurer denied the claim based upon a modified \u201ctotal pollution exclusion\u201d that had been added to Thomases\u2019 renewal policy but had not been pointed out by the insurer. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Thomases claimed that the insurer failed to provide adequate notice of the revised and more-restrictive exclusion provision, was negligent, and breached its fiduciary duty as well as its duty of good faith and fair dealing. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 11. The insurer asserted that Section 242 precluded Thomases from seeking recovery under their common law theories. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 12. The district court agreed and granted the insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 13. We reversed, holding that Section 242 did not preclude common law claims for insurer misconduct pertaining to contract renewal. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 37. Notably, we observed that the provisions of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, did not address the conduct which was the subject matter of the tort claims <em>(Thomas, </em>\u00b6 34), and that appellants \u201callege pure common law claims without adding violations of the UTPA.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 36. This case is distinguishable from the case at hand because the Thomases\u2019 common law claims fell completely outside of the UTPA, and were not premised upon any violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u00b639 Similarly, in <em>Williams, </em>the insured filed a civil action against Union alleging breach of contract, fraud, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of Union\u2019s statutory obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>under the MIC and the Unfair Claim Settlement Practices Act. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 13. Following a jury ruling that Union did not breach its contract, Williams appealed and Union cross-appealed. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 16. On cross-appeal, Union claimed that Williams\u2019 fraud and bad faith claims were barred under Section 242. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b640 In arguing that her common law claims were not barred, Williams observed that while the legislature prohibited post-claim underwriting in \u00a7 33-18-215, MCA, she was not asserting that the post-claim underwriting violation could form the basis of an independent claim; rather, she claimed that the statutory violation was relevant to her claims of bad faith, fraud, and malice, as well as to her claim for breach of contract. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 30. She further maintained that her common law actions were premised upon conduct that occurred prior to the application phase of the insurance transaction (which by definition would have preceded any claims handling or settlement practices that are the subject of Sections 201 and 242), and thus her claims were not governed or barred by Section 242. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 55. Without discussion, we agreed that Section 242 did not govern. We then affirmed the district court on the grounds that Union had failed to satisfy its summary judgment burden. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u00b641  As the foregoing cases establish, purely common law causes of action based upon insurer misconduct are not precluded. However, there is a distinction between pursuing damages for violation of a statute, and pursuing an independent common law cause of action. As addressed further below, Ibsen, the plaintiff here, seeks to privately enforce a regulatory statute so as to recover damages. In <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Williams, </em>by contrast, the plaintiffs were pursuing common law claims, and not claims that were predicated upon a statutory violation. While Williams referenced a statutory violation as evidentiary support for her common law claims, she affirmatively stated she was not seeking to enforce the statute as a basis for the recovery of damages. The distinction is not semantical. A party may always allege and recover damages in a common law cause of action upon proof of a common law claim, but a party is not entitled to obtain private enforcement of a regulatory statute that is not intended by the legislature to be enforceable by private parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\u00b642 We now return to Ibsen\u2019s Complaint. Ibsen acknowledges that Count II is premised expressly upon violation of Sections 208 and 212 of the UTPA, but asserts that the remaining three counts for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment are common law claims. We disagree. It is clear from the contents of the Complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>as well as the express representations made by Ibsen in the federal proceeding that Ibsen is seeking private enforcement of the foregoing provisions on behalf of the class. Its breach of fiduciary duty count is premised upon the unlawful collection of excessive medical premiums and the payment of rebates \u201cin violation of the Montana Insurance Code.\u201d Its unjust enrichment count seeks disgorgement of the illegal or excessive premiums and rebates \u201cin violation of the Montana Insurance Code.\u201d It is not possible to conduct an informed analysis of Ibsen\u2019s breach of contract claim because Ibsen does not identify a particular contract that was breached; it simply asserts that all of the parties entered into written insurance contracts and impliedly incorporated all sections of the Montana Insurance Code into those various contracts. Again, however, this count relies upon incorporation of the MIC. These are not purely common law causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b643 We are mindful that premising the class complaint upon a violation of the insurance code that has already been established and sanctioned by the Insurance Commissioner would pave a clear path to recovery on behalf of the class. If the UTPA allowed a private right of action for rate discrimination and premium overcharges, we would not hesitate to reverse the decision of the District Court. However, we conclude that the UTPA does not expressly or impliedly create a private right of action for violation of Sections 208 and 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b644 Our conclusion here finds support in <em>Fossen v. Caring for Montanans, Inc., </em>993 F. Supp. 2d 1254 (D. Mont. 2014), and <em>Fossen v. Caring for Montanans, Inc., </em>617 Fed. Appx. 737 (9th Cir. 2015). While we are not bound by the decisions of the U. S. District Court of Montana or the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, when federal courts have ruled on issues substantially similar to those before us, it is proper for us to review their opinions for guidance. <em>Kafka v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks, </em>2008 MT 460, \u00b6 162, 348 Mont. 80, 201 P.3d 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u00b645 In <em>Fossen, </em>the Fossens brought a breach of contract claim against Caring for Montanans alleging that Caring had unfairly discriminated against them by charging a higher premium rate in violation of UTPA provision \u00a7 33-18-206(2), MCA. The U. S. District Court for the District of Montana analyzed the UTPA in detail to determine whether the statutes expressly or impliedly created a private right of action. <em>Fossen, </em>993 F. Supp. 2d at 1258-1260. The court concluded that \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, was the sole provision in the UTPA granting to insureds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>and third-party claimants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> private rights of action arising from certain specified claims handling and settlement practices identified in \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, but for no other purpose. <em>Fossen, </em>993 F. Supp. 2d at 1260. As the Fossens\u2019 claims rested upon rate discrimination in violation of \u00a7 33-18-206(2), MCA, and not the insurer\u2019s claims handling practices, Fossens had no right to bring an action under the UTPA. <em>Fossen, </em>993 F. Supp. 2d at 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b646 The U. S. District Court addressed Fossens\u2019 reliance on <em>State ex rel. Larson v. Dist. Court, </em>149 Mont. 131, 423 P.2d 598 (1967) and <em>First Sec. Bank v. Goddard, </em>181 Mont. 407, 593 P.2d 1040 (1979) by noting that both of these cases were claims handling breach of contract cases decided before the enactment of Section 242, and they did not support Fossens\u2019 claims. The court held that there \u201cis no common law or statutory private right of action pertaining to ... claims of rate discrimination in violation of subsection 206 of the UTPA.\u201d <em>Fossen, </em>993 F. Supp. 2d at 1263. Subsequently, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the U. S. District Court decision. <em>Fossen, </em>617 Fed. Appx. at 739. The Ninth Circuit observed that since the 1987 legislative amendments, \u201cthe Montana Supreme Court has never recognized a private right of action for the violation of a UTPA provision other than those provisions identified in \u00a7 33-18-242(1).\u201d <em>Fossen, </em>617 Fed. Appx. at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b647 Finally, our conclusion here is buttressed by application of the four-part test we applied in <em>Klaudt </em>and <em>Wombold </em>to determine whether a statutory scheme implies a private right of action. (See \u00b6\u00b6 24 and 32 herein). The first prong of the test is whether the interpretation allowing a private right of action is consistent with the statute as a whole. <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 35. Ibsen\u2019s interpretation fails this component of the test for two reasons. First, the statute contains an express \u201cEnforcement\u201d section at \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-1001 through -1006, MCA. These provisions charge the Commissioner with the enforcement of the UTPA, and provide it with the authority to investigate alleged violations of the Code, conduct hearings, impose fines, and issue cease and desist orders. Second, Section 242 expressly grants insureds and third-party claimants, \u201can independent cause of action against an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>insurer\u201d for the insurer\u2019s violation of discrete provisions of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA. Section 242 provides the narrow exception to the rule that it is the Commissioner who will enforce the UTPA. Thus, an interpretation allowing a private right of action for violation of Sections 208 and 212 is inconsistent with the statute as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b648 The second prong of the test is whether the interpretation allowing for a private right of action reflects the intent of the legislature considering the statute\u2019s plain language. <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 35. Our discussion above at \u00b6\u00b6 25-27 establishes that the legislature did intend to limit the expansion of private causes of action when it enacted Section 242. The third prong of the test is whether the interpretation urged by Ibsen is reasonable so as to avoid absurd results. <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 35. We conclude, premised upon the foregoing statutory and case history, that expanding the private right of action as Ibsen urges is neither reasonable nor required to avoid absurd results.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b649 Lastly, we turn to the final prong of the test, which is whether the agency charged with the administration of the statute has placed a construction on the statute. <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 35. The Commissioner of Insurance has been involved in the adoption and interpretation of the Montana Insurance Code since its enactment. Then-Commissioner John Holmes attended the January 1959 hearings pertaining to a proposed bill to dramatically revise Montana insurance law. In 1977, counsel for the Commissioner introduced a senate bill to revise the unfair insurance claim settlement and enforcement procedures, giving greater authority to the Commissioner. Subsequently, in 1987, the Commissioner was a consistent participant in the January, February, and March meetings leading to the enactment of Section 242. During these meetings there was lengthy discussion pertaining to the extent of private rights of action to be provided under proposed Section 242. The legislative history clearly states that \u201can insured or third-party claimant has a separate cause of action against an insurer for <em>certain </em>unfair claim settlement practices.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Mont. Sen. Business &amp; Industry Comm., Meeting on House Bill 240, 50th Legis., Reg. Sess. (March 9, 1987). As noted above, the sponsor of the bill emphasized that the bill was designed to \u201cswing the pendulum back towards the middle\u201d rather than continuing a trend favoring trial lawyers and disfavoring insurers. Opponents to the bill urged the committee to reject the bill because proposed Section 242 \u201climit[ed] the kinds of prohibitive acts which give rise to an individual or a private cause of action.\u201d The Commissioner supported the bill and actively engaged in discussion and proposed amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\u00b650 In the Commissioner\u2019s amicus brief in the case before us, the Commissioner argues that the Model UTPA contains a provision that explicitly states the Act does not create a private right of action, but the Montana UTPA does not contain such a statement. She acknowledges that if a claimant has a dispute with an insurer based upon the insurer\u2019s claims handling or settlement practices, the claimant is expressly authorized to bring a private cause of action under Section 242. She goes on to argue that if a claimant has a dispute with an insurer based upon any type of UTPA misconduct that is unrelated to claims and settlement handling, Section 242 simply does not restrict such claims. We respectfully decline the present Commissioner\u2019s invitation to announce an open-ended private right of action for all violations of the UTPA. Because the Commissioner\u2019s understanding of the intent of the statute at the time the statute was enacted comports with the intent of the Legislature when enacting Section 242, we defer to the construction placed on the statute by the Commissioner directly involved with Section 242\u2019s passage. We therefore conclude that the UTPA does not imply a private right of action. Rather, it expressly confers enforcement authority upon the Commissioner and narrowly provides a limited private right of action only in Section 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b651 Ibsen and amicus MTLA urge us to consider \u00a7 27-1-202, MCA, which states \u201cEvery person who suffers detriment from the unlawful act or omission of another may recover from the person in fault a compensation therefor in money, which is called damages.\u201d Our decision here does not run afoul of this statute. Ibsen and other members of the class were entitled to pursue common law claims for fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation against these defendants premised upon their actions, and to recover damages for the detriment they suffered as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b652 As we are affirming the District Court, we need not address the ERISA arguments presented by the parties nor the claims pertaining to Health Care.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u00b653  For the reasons set forth in this Opinion, we conclude Ibsen\u2019s private enforcement claims against BCBSMT, Caring for Montana, and Health Care Services Corp. for violations of Sections 208 and 212 of the UTPA are precluded. We therefore affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b387-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\"> The District Court determined that Ibsen was neither an insured nor a third-party claimant under the UTPA and Ibsen did not dispute this initially. Ibsen now claims that it was an \u201cinsured employer.\u201d As our disposition of this case does not require resolution of Ibsen\u2019s status nor what benefits such a status commands, we do not disturb the District Court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
