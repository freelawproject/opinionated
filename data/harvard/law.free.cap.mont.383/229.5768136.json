We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-10\">\n<em>(1) Whether the District Court erred in denying Crawford\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of methamphetamine that law enforcement officers found on Crawford\u2019s person after conducting a search incident to his arrest for violating the terms of his parole.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-11\">\n<em>(2) Whether Crawford received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel did not file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law following the evidentiary hearing relating to Crawford\u2019s suppression motion.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-12\">\n<em>(3) Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying Crawford\u2019s third discovery request.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-13\">\n<em>(4) Whether the District Court erred by denying Crawford\u2019s posttrial motion to dismiss based upon the Court\u2019s failure to arraign him on the Second Amended Information.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-14\">\n<em>(5) Whether the District Court adequately addressed Crawford\u2019s complaints concerning his assigned counsel.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b254-16\">\u00b63 On December 23,2010, Crawford was released on parole in Butte-Silver Bow County after his incarceration at the Montana State Prison for multiple drug-related felony convictions. As a condition of his parole, a travel restriction was imposed upon Crawford, which required that he obtain written permission from his parole officer, Karley Kump (Officer Kump), before travelling outside the counties of Silver Bow, Beaverhead, Jefferson, and Deer Lodge.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\u00b64 On March 13,2012, Flathead Tribal Police Officer Casey Couture (Officer Couture) was on patrol in Lake County when he observed a vehicle with a single operating headlight. Officer Couture initiated a traffic stop and identified Crawford as the driver of the vehicle. Officer Couture noticed that there were four passengers in the vehicle, one of whom Officer Couture recognized as Asa Lehrke (Lehrke) based upon Lehrke\u2019s prior involvement in the sale of illegal drugs. Officer Couture arrested Lehrke on an outstanding warrant and issued a warning to Crawford regarding his inoperative headlight. While being transported, Lehrke told Officer Couture that two of the men in the vehicle were armed robbery suspects and another one of the men produced methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b65 After returning to the Flathead Tribal Police Station, Officer Couture searched the Montana Correctional Offender Network database and learned that Crawford was on parole in Silver Bow County. Officer Couture contacted the Butte-Silver Bow County Probation and Parole Office and left a voice message, inquiring as to whether Crawford was in violation of his parole. Officer Kump returned Officer Couture\u2019s call and spoke with Northwest Drug Task Force Agent Arlen Auld (Agent Auld). Officer Kump advised Agent Auld that Crawford was in violation of his parole, explaining that Lake County was outside his assigned travel district and Crawford did not have permission to travel outside the district. Officer Kump requested that Officer Couture arrest Crawford for violating the terms of his parole, and Agent Auld relayed this information to Officer Couture.</p>\n<p id=\"A7k\">\u00b66 On March 17, 2012, while on patrol in Lake County, Officer Couture and Lake County Sheriffs Deputy Levi Read (Deputy Read) observed Crawford\u2019s vehicle pull into a local gas station. Based upon the information received from Officer Kump, Officer Couture and Deputy Read initiated a traffic stop of Crawford\u2019s vehicle and placed Crawford under arrest for violating his parole. After conducting a search incident to arrest, the officers discovered two vials in Crawford\u2019s pants pocket. Subsequent testing at the Montana State Crime Lab revealed that the vials contained methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b67 On March 29, 2012, the State charged Crawford by Information with criminal possession of dangerous drugs with the intent to distribute. The Court subsequently arraigned Crawford on that charge. On April 25, 2012, the State amended the Information and added a charge of felony criminal forfeiture. On August 17,2012, the State filed a Second Amended Information, dismissing the charge of criminal forfeiture and reducing the charge of criminal possession with intent to the lesser-included offense of criminal possession of dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>drugs. The District Court did not arraign Crawford on the Second Amended Information.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b68 On July 26, 2013, Crawford filed a third request for discovery in which he requested that the State provide copies of email exchanges between law enforcement and parole officers and information regarding Lehrke as an informant. Crawford also maintained that the arrest video the State provided was not the original video, and Crawford requested he be allowed to view the original video because he believed that the video produced by the State had been altered. The District Court denied Crawford\u2019s request, concluding that the State had complied fully with its discovery obligations under \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b69 On February 5, 2013, Crawford filed a motion to suppress the evidence of methamphetamine found on his person and alleged that the arresting officers had no authority to detain him. Crawford maintained that the search was unlawful because the arresting officers used Crawford\u2019s parole status as a false pretense for their real intent, which Crawford argued was to seek out a purported \u201cmeth lab.\u201d After Crawford and the State submitted briefing, the District Court conducted a hearing on Crawford\u2019s motion to suppress. The State thereafter filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law with the District Court, but Crawford\u2019s trial counsel did not. The District Court denied Crawford\u2019s motion to suppress, concluding that Officer Couture and Deputy Read lawfully arrested Crawford for violating the terms of his parole and the officers performed a legal search incident to arrest whereupon they discovered the two vials of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b610 On the first day of trial on December 2,2013, Crawford requested that he be given a copy of the Second Amended Information. The court informed Crawford that he would need to discuss the Second Amended Information with his attorney, which led to the following exchange regarding Crawford\u2019s trial counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">Court: Mr. Crawford, you have very able counsel. You would be well-advised to work through him and in front of the jury let him\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">Crawford: I don\u2019t have a whole lot of faith here, your Honor. Court: Well, he\u2019s a very competent attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">Crawford: I\u2019m the one facing 100 years here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">\u00b611 On the second day of trial on December 3,2013, Crawford and the District Court again engaged in an exchange regarding Crawford\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">Court: Mr. Stenerson has been your attorney since August. Have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>you been satisfied with the services of Mr. Stenerson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">Crawford: He has been my attorney since November of 2012. And he has done more in my case than anybody else has. But as far as things getting done in a timely manner, things being followed through with, no. I think \u2014 I feel strongly there\u2019s prejudice against me because there\u2019s items that have been brought in in front of the jury, a whole file full of pictures that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">Court: As to the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, given the fact that Mr. Stenerson, it sounds like, has done a professional job and he has been your counsel for a year now, there isn\u2019t anything that at this stage of the proceedings would lead a court to say that this \u2014 that this has been proven. This is going to require a separate hearing. It\u2019s going to require a written motion, and we are not going to do that in mid trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">Crawford: I was going say, we\u2019re at trial, and I have tried to bring these issues up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b612 On December 3, 2013, a jury found Crawford guilty of criminal possession in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA. The District Court sentenced Crawford as a persistent felony offender and committed him to the Montana State Prison for a term of 20 years, with 10 of those years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\u00b613 On December 31, 2013, Crawford filed a posttrial motion to dismiss, arguing that the State\u2019s failure to arraign him on the Second Amended Information constituted reversible error. The District Court denied the motion, concluding that, because the Second Amended Information merely dropped one charge, reduced another charge to a lesser-included offense, and did not add any new charges, the Second Amended Information included no substantive amendments. The court explained that pursuant to \u00a7 46-11-205, MCA, a defendant is required to be arraigned on an amended information only if an amendment is substantive.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">\u00b614 Crawford timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress to determine whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its interpretation and application of the law are correct. <em>State v. Fischer, </em>2014 MT 112, \u00b6 8, 374 Mont. 533, 323 P.3d 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">\u00b616 Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are mixed questions of law and fact that this Court reviews de novo. <em>State v. Crosley, </em>2009 MT 126, \u00b6 27, 350 Mont. 223, 206 P.3d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b617 <em>(1) Whether the District Court erred in denying Crawford\u2019s motion to suppress evidence ofmethamphetamine that law enforcement officers found on Crawford\u2019s person after conducting a search incident to his arrest for violating the terms of his parole.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b618 Both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. Under Montana law, warrantless searches are per se unreasonable. <em>State v. Galpin, </em>2003 MT 324, \u00b6 54, 318 Mont. 318, 80 P.3d 1207. However, when a lawful arrest is made, a police officer may conduct a search incident to arrest without a warrant and \u201creasonably search the person arrested and the area immediately within his reach in order to locate any weapons the person might use or any evidence that might otherwise be destroyed.\u201d <em>Galpin, </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b619 Crawford argues that the District Court erred by denying his motion to suppress the evidence of methamphetamine found on his person because \u201cthe arresting officers used his parole status as a false pretense for their real intent, which was to conduct a criminal investigation and seek out a purported \u2018meth lab.\u2019 \u201d Although Crawford does not dispute that the arresting officers possessed sufficient cause to arrest Crawford for violating the terms of parole under \u00a7 46-23-1023(2), MCA, Crawford contends that the search incident to his arrest was nonetheless unlawful under the so-called \u201cstalking horse\u201d theory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Fritz, </em>2006 MT 202, 333 Mont. 215, 142 P.3d 806, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>United States v. Harper, </em>928 F.2d 894 (9th Cir. 1991), Crawford maintains that pursuant to the stalking horse theory, an otherwise lawful parole search may be invalidated under the Fourth Amendment if the search was not for a parole purpose, but was a mere subterfuge for a criminal investigation. Thus, Crawford asks this Court to inquire into the subjective motivations of the arresting officers \u2014 Officer Couture and Deputy Read \u2014 to determine whether the officers intended to detain Crawford for a \u201cparole purpose\u201d or intended to detain him for a \u201ccriminal investigative purpose.\u201d If the officers intended the former Crawford concedes that the search was lawful, but if the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>actually intended the latter then according to Crawford the search was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b620 We decline Crawford\u2019s request to inquire into the subjective motivations of Officer Couture and Deputy Read to determine the legality of his arrest for a number of reasons. First, we have never adopted the stalking horse theory to invalidate an otherwise lawful parole search. In <em>Fritz, </em>the defendant maintained that an otherwise lawful search was unlawful because the \u201cpolice officers ... used the probation officers as subterfuge for a criminal investigation.\u201d <em>Fritz, </em>\u00b6 13. However, contrary to Crawford\u2019s contention, we did not recognize in <em>Fritz </em>the validity of the stalking horse theory. The facts in <em>Fritz </em>simply did not require us to do so because there was no merit to Fritz\u2019s argument that the officers were not conducting a valid criminal investigation unrelated to Fritz\u2019s status as a probationer. <em>Fritz, </em>\u00b6 13. Thus, it was unnecessary in <em>Fritz </em>to consider the validity of the stalking horse theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b621 Second, our precedent has long established that inquiry into the subjective motivations of law enforcement, necessarily required by the stalking horse theory, is inappropriate in assessing the validity of an arrest. In <em>State v. Farabee, </em>2000 MT 265, 302 Mont. 29, 22 P.3d 175, we made clear that an otherwise lawful traffic stop under either the Fourth Amendment or the Montana Constitution remained valid despite the subjective motivations of the individual officers involved. We reasoned that the United States Supreme Court had expressly rejected such an inquiry into the subjective motivations of law enforcement in its decision in <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 116 S. Ct. 1769 (1996), and we concluded that nothing in Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution provided an independent justification for deviating from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision. <em>Farabee, </em>\u00b6 30. We explained that our precedent clearly demonstrates that \u201cthe lawfulness of a traffic stop under the Montana Constitution depends on whether the officer had a particularized suspicion that an occupant of the vehicle has committed or is committing an offense,\u201d not on the actual motivations of individual officers. <em>Farabee, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b622 Third, notwithstanding Crawford\u2019s citation to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Harper, </em>we have not been supplied, nor has our research discovered, any authority from other jurisdictions supporting the stalking horse theory. In the wake of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 122 S. Ct. 587 (2001), the Ninth Circuit overruled its decision in <em>Harper, see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>United States v. Stokes, </em>292 F.3d 964, 967 (9th Cir. 2002) (explaining that the \u201ccircuit\u2019s line of cases holding searches of probationers invalid on the ground that they were subterfuges for criminal investigations is, in that respect, no longer good law\u201d), and federal and state courts alike have followed suit in repudiating the stalking horse theory. In <em>Knights, </em>a unanimous Supreme Court overturned a Ninth Circuit decision that had invalidated a search of a probationer on the basis that the search was not for probationary purposes, but was a mere subterfuge for a criminal investigation. <em>See United States v. Knights, </em>219 F.3d 1138, 1145 (9th Cir. 2000). The Supreme Court upheld the search as supported by reasonable suspicion in light of the totality of the circumstances and expressly stated that \u201cthere is no basis for examining official <em>purpose.\u201d Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 122, 122 S. Ct. at 593. Since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Knights, </em>those courts that have addressed the continued validity of the stalking horse theory have concluded that <em>Knights </em>dealt the theory a fatal blow, reasoning that \u201cwhen [the Supreme Court] rejected any challenge based on the \u2018actual motivations\u2019 of the officers, the Court confirmed that the Fourth Amendment does not require a stalking horse inquiry.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>346 F.3d 808, 812 (8th Cir. 2003). <em>Accord United States v. Reyes, </em>283 F.3d 446, 463-64 (2d Cir. 2002); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>417 F.3d 373, 378 (3d Cir. 2005); <em>Stokes, </em>292 F.3d at 967; <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>305 F.3d 1193, 1199-1200 (10th Cir. 2002); <em>State v. Kottman, </em>2005 S.D. 116, \u00b6 14, 707 N.W.2d <em>114; Helphenstine v. Commonwealth, </em>423 S.W.3d 708, 716 (Ky. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b623 Lastly, even if we were to breathe new life into the stalking horse theory, we would not extend its application to the facts of this case. Although the exact parameters of the theory are ill-defined, the underlying premise of the theory was to prevent parole officers from using their parole authority to conduct a home visit and a subsequent warrantless search to help law enforcement evade the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant and probable cause requirements for police searches and seizures. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>849 F.2d 439, 441 (9th Cir. 1988). Here, however, the law enforcement officers did not conduct a home visit or a warrantless search of Crawford\u2019s home. Rather, the officers arrested Crawford outside of his home pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1023(2), MCA, for violating the terms of his parole. Section 46-23-1023(2), MCA, provides that \u201c[a]ny probation and parole officer may arrest the parolee without a warrant or may deputize any other officer with power to arrest to do so by giving the officer oral authorization ....\u2019\u2019Accordingly, based upon this statutory procedure and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>authorization from Crawford\u2019s parole officer, Crawford\u2019s arrest was lawful. After making the arrest, the officers conducted a lawful search incident to arrest of Crawford and discovered the methamphetamine. We know of no case, nor does Crawford cite a case, wherein the stalking horse theory has been applied to invalidate an otherwise lawful search incident to arrest outside of the parolee\u2019s home. Thus, the stalking horse theory, assuming its validity, would not be applicable to the facts of this case where the law enforcement officers were not attempting to gain entry into Crawford\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b624  We decline to inquire into the subjective motivations of Officer Couture and Deputy Read. Because the officers lawfully arrested Crawford pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1023(2), MCA, for violating the terms of his parole, the search incident to his arrest was lawful. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in denying Crawford\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence of methamphetamine found on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b625 <em>(2) Whether Crawford received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel did not file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law following the evidentiary hearing relating to Crawford\u2019s suppression motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b626 Both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, \u00a7 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee an individual the right to the effective assistance of counsel in all criminal prosecutions. We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel using the two-part test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 67, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74. The test requires that a defendant show: (1) that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 67. Because a defendant must satisfy both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test, \u201cif a defendant makes an insufficient showing regarding one prong of the test, there is no need to address the other prong.\u201d <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b627 Crawford argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law following the evidentiary hearing relating to his motion to suppress the evidence of methamphetamine found on his person. He maintains that his counsel\u2019s failure in this regard caused him substantial prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u00b628 In light of our resolution of Issue I, we cannot agree with Crawford that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Crawford\u2019s sole argument for invaliding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the search at both the suppression hearing and in his briefing to the District Court was that the arresting officers used the parole officer as a stalking horse. Similarly, on appeal, Crawford offers no explanation for invalidating the search other than the stalking horse theory. As we have rejected the stalking horse theory, Crawford cannot establish that he was prejudiced. Even if Crawford\u2019s counsel had submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and better articulated the stalking horse theory, the theory was fatally flawed. Thus, given our resolution of Issue I, Crawford\u2019s argument that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s performance necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b629 <em>(3) Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying Crawford\u2019s third discovery request.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b630 Crawford argues that the District Court abused its discretion by denying Crawford\u2019s third discovery request. He maintains that the State unlawfully withheld: (1) email communications between law enforcement and parole officers; (2) documentation regarding Lehrke as an informant; and (3) an original recording of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b631 The State counters that it complied with discovery by providing all relevant information in its possession. The State maintains that email communications between law enforcement and the parole officers as well as any documentation regarding Lehrke are irrelevant to Crawford\u2019s guilt as to the offense charged. Regarding the original recording of the arrest, the State maintains that no video exists other than the video it provided in discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u00b632 In all criminal cases the prosecution has a long-established constitutional duty under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Brady <em>v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963), to provide to the defense any exculpatory or impeachment evidence in its possession. <em>McGarvey v. State, </em>2014 MT 189, \u00b6 16, 375 Mont. 495, 329 P.3d 576 (citing <em>State v. Ellison, </em>2012 MT 50, \u00b6 15, 364 Mont. 276, 272 P.3d 646; <em>State v. Cooksey, </em>2012 MT 226, \u00b6 34, 366 Mont. 346, 286 P.3d 1174). The Montana Legislature has further adopted a statutory scheme that places affirmative duties on the prosecution to provide evidence to the defendant. Section 46-15-322, MCA. Section 46-15-322(1)(e), MCA, requires the State, upon request, to produce \u201call material or information that tends to mitigate or negate the defendant\u2019s guilt as to the offense charged ....\u201d Additionally, if the defense requests evidence under subsections (1)(a) through (1)(d) or (2)(a) through (2)(c) of \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA, the State has an obligation to disclose relevant evidence regardless of whether the evidence is exculpatory or inculpatory. <em>State v. Hatfield, </em>269 Mont. 307, 312, 888 P.2d 899, 902 (1995). The party seeking to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation or a violation of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>disclosure bears the burden of establishing a violation. <em>State v. Giddings, </em>2009 MT 61, \u00b6 48, 349 Mont. 347, 208 P.3d 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b633 We agree with the State that Crawford has failed to show that the State suppressed exculpatory or otherwise relevant evidence. Crawford maintains that correspondence between law enforcement and parole officers was relevant to show that the arresting officers concealed their true intent to investigate the purported meth lab and that the information \u201cwould have assisted in the aforementioned \u2018stalking horse\u2019 defense.\u201d This information may have been relevant to the stalking horse theory advanced during the suppression motion of these proceedings, but its relevance to Crawford\u2019s guilt or innocence regarding whether he had methamphetamine on his person when arrested has not been advanced. And, as explained above, we reject the stalking horse theory under the facts of this case. Thus, any information concerning the subjective motivations of the arresting officers was irrelevant and not exculpatory evidence during proceedings related to Crawford\u2019s suppression motion. Regarding information related to Lehrke as an informant, Crawford does not attempt on appeal to explain the relevance of the information requested or specify what information or document he is actually requesting. Lehrke did not testify at trial or at the suppression hearing and any information regarding the officers\u2019 motivation in arresting Crawford is irrelevant. We are thus unable to conclude that the information was potentially exculpatory and relevant to Crawford\u2019s \u201cguilt as to the offense charged.\u201d Section 46-15-322(1)(e), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b634  Lastly, with respect to Crawford\u2019s claim that he was unable to view the original video, Crawford failed to introduce evidence, at the suppression hearing or at trial, casting doubt on the authenticity of the video provided by the State. Crawford did not provide expert testimony demonstrating that video produced by the State was not an original. Nor did Crawford elicit any testimony from law enforcement showing an original video existed. Therefore, we conclude that Crawford has failed to demonstrate that the State withheld relevant evidence as to the offense charged. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Crawford\u2019s third discovery request.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b635 <em>(4) Whether the District Court erred by denying Crawford\u2019s posttrial motion to dismiss based upon the Court\u2019s failure to arraign him on the Second Amended Information.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b636 Section 46-11-205, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">(1) The court may allow an information to be amended in matters of substance at any time, but not less than 5 days before trial, provided that a motion is filed in a timely manner, states the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>nature of the proposed amendment, and is accompanied by an affidavit stating facts that show the existence of probable cause to support the charge as amended. A copy of the proposed amended information must be included with the motion to amend the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">(2) If the court grants leave to amend the information, the defendant must be arraigned on the amended information without unreasonable delay and must be given a reasonable period of time to prepare for trial on the amended information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">(3) The court may permit an information to be amended as to form at any time before a verdict or finding is issued if no additional or different offense is charged and if the substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b637 We have explained that under \u00a7 46-11-205(2), MCA, \u201ca defendant must be arraigned on any amendment to the information of substance.\u201d <em>State v. Geren, </em>2012 MT 307, \u00b6 64, 367 Mont. 437, 291 P.3d 1144. However, a defendant need not be arraigned under \u00a7 46-11-205(3), MCA, on any amendment to the information as to form. <em>Geren, </em>\u00b6 64. To differentiate between amendments of form and substance, \u201cwe examine whether an amendment to an information or complaint alters the nature of the offense, the essential elements of the crime, the proofs, or the defenses.\u201d <em>Geren, </em>\u00b6 59 (quoting <em>State v. Scheffer, </em>2010 MT 73, \u00b6 38,355 Mont. 523,230 P.3d 462) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AQd\">\u00b638 Crawford argues that the District Court\u2019s failure to arraign him on the Second Amended Information constitutes reversible error. Although Crawford concedes that based on our decision in <em>State v. Adkins, </em>2009 MT 71, 349 Mont. 444, 204 P.3d 1, the State did not substantively amend the information by reducing the charge of criminal possession with intent to the lesser-included offense of criminal possession, he maintains that the State did substantively amend the information by dismissing the charge of criminal forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"Aaf\">\u00b639  We disagree with Crawford that the State substantively amended the information by dismissing the charge of criminal forfeiture. In <em>Adkins, </em>we explained that when the State amends an information to charge an alternate, lesser included offense which is supported by an identical factual basis, such an amendment is not a \u201csubstantive changeQ to the information\u201d under \u00a7 46-11-205, MCA. <em>Adkins, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17. In light of our conclusion in <em>Adkins </em>that an amendment which adds a lesser-included offense is not a substantive amendment, we have no trouble concluding that an amendment which dismisses a charge is also not a substantive amendment. Indeed, considering that the purpose of the information is to \u201capprise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>accused of the charges against him,\u201d <em>Geren, </em>\u00b6 55, it would make little sense to conclude that the dismissal of a charge is a substantive change to the information. Such a conclusion would require a district court to arraign a defendant on a non-existent charge. The State did not substantively amend the information within the meaning of \u00a7 46-11-205, MCA, by reducing the charge of criminal possession with intent to the lesser-included offense of criminal possession and by dismissing the charge of criminal forfeiture. The District Court correctly denied Crawford\u2019s posttrial motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b640 <em>(5) Whether the District Court adequately addressed Crawford\u2019s complaints concerning his assigned counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b641 Crawford argues that the District Court erred by failing to conduct an \u201cadequate initial inquiry\u201d into his complaints concerning his trial counsel. Crawford maintains that after he complained that he did not have \u201cfaith\u201d in his counsel and that his counsel\u2019s performance had caused him \u201cprejudice\u201d the court should have inquired into his complaints to determine whether they were \u201cseemingly substantial\u201d pursuant to <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>1998 MT 70, \u00b6 14, 288 Mont. 180, 955 P.2d 1371. The State counters that an initial inquiry was not required under the facts of this case because Crawford never requested that the District Court appoint new counsel. Alternatively, the State argues that the District Court conducted an adequate initial inquiry into Crawford\u2019s complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b642 The United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to effective assistance of counsel. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 24. We have explained that \u201c[i]f a defendant asserts denial of effective assistance and requests appointment of new counsel, a district court must conduct an \u2018adequate initial inquiry\u2019 to determine whether the defendant\u2019s claim is \u2018seemingly substantial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Happel, </em>2010 MT 200, \u00b6 14, 357 Mont. 390, 240 P.3d 1016. In the event that the initial inquiry \u201creveals a seemingly substantial complaint, the court must hold a hearing to address the validity of the complaints, and appoint separate counsel to represent the defendant.\u201d <em>Happel, </em>\u00b6 14. When a defendant does not request substitute counsel, however, \u201cthe defendant \u2018fails to implicate the \u201cseemingly substantial\u201d analysis and the need for a subsequent hearing\" on his complaints about his lawyer.\u201d <em>State v. Clary, </em>2012 MT 26, \u00b6 28, 364 Mont. 53, 270 P.3d 88 (quoting <em>State v. Racz, </em>2007 MT 244, \u00b6 20, 339 Mont. 218, 168 P.3d 685) (brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u00b643  Here, while Crawford complained to the District Court about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>his counsel, there is no evidence in the record showing that Crawford ever requested that the District Court appoint new counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Crawford never filed a motion requesting the District Court do so. Nor did Crawford ever make an oral request at any of the pretrial hearings or during trial. Absent <em>\u201ca </em>request for another attorney, the District Court was not required to conduct further inquiry into the matter.\u201d <em>Clary, </em>\u00b6 28. Based on the record before us, we conclude that the District Court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b644 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\"> The term \u201cstalking horse\u201d is often used to refer to a \u201cdecoy.\u201d Safire\u2019s New Political Dictionary 750 (1993). <em>See also </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2221 (1976) (\u201c1: a horse or a figure like a horse behind which a hunter stalks game 2: something used to cover up a secret project: MASK, PRETENSE\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\"> Crawford also argues that he sent the District Court several handwritten documents that he refers to as \u201ckites.\u201d Crawford maintains that in the kites he requested new counsel. However, Crawford concedes that the kites were not admitted in the record, and it is unclear whether the District Court ever saw or was made aware of the documents. To the extent Crawford is attempting to rely on these \u201ckites,\u201d non-record-based trial issues must be addressed first in a postconviction relief proceeding rather than on direct appeal. <em>State v.
