We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">\n<em>Whether the District Court correctly determined that claim preclusion bars Asarco\u2019s claims.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">\u00b63 For over one hundred years, Asarco and its predecessors operated a lead smelting facility in East Helena, Montana (the Site). From 1927 to 1972, Atlantic Richfield\u2019s predecessor operated a zinc fuming plant on land leased from Asarco at the Site.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1972, Atlantic Richfield sold the zinc fuming plant and related property to Asarco. Under the 1972 sale agreement (1972 Agreement), Atlantic Richfield agreed to indemnify Asarco for liabilities arising out of Atlantic Richfield\u2019s operations at the Site. Additionally, the 1972 Agreement\u2019s terms contained a disclosure clause in which Atlantic Richfield agreed to deliver all relevant documents and records to Asarco and a representation clause in which Atlantic Richfield represented and warranted that it had delivered all the information required by the disclosure clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">\u00b64 In 1984, due to extensive contamination of the soil, surface water, and groundwater at the Site and the surrounding area, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) added the Site and surrounding area to the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), commonly known as \u201cSuperfund.\u201d The EPA requested information from Asarco and Atlantic Richfield regarding their operations at the Site because it had identified both as potentially responsible for the contamination. The EPA ultimately determined that Asarco was obligated to fund and conduct cleanup efforts at the Site based on the information provided by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b65 In the 1990s the EPA and Asarco entered into several consent decrees regarding Asarco\u2019s responsibility to remediate contamination at the Site. In 2005, Asarco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. During its bankruptcy proceeding, Asarco entered into two settlements with the State and federal governments regarding its environmental liabilities at the Site. To date, Asarco has paid approximately $138 million for remediation at the Site.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b66 In June 2012 Asarco filed a complaint against Atlantic Richfield in the United States District Court for the District of Montana. Asarco sought contribution \u2014 pursuant to CERCLA \u2014 from Atlantic Richfield for costs incurred in cleaning up the Site. Asarco claimed that Atlantic Richfield was responsible, in part, for the Site\u2019s contamination due to the zinc fuming plant\u2019s operation. Asarco therefore asserted that Atlantic Richfield was liable under CERCLA for its equitable share of costs related to the Site\u2019s cleanup.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b67 In June 2014, following extensive discovery between the parties, Atlantic Richfield moved for summary judgment on the ground that Asarco\u2019s claims were untimely under CERCLA\u2019s statute of limitations. The federal district court agreed that the claims were time-barred and granted Atlantic Richfield\u2019s motion for summary judgment in August 2014. <em>Asarco LLC v. Atl. Richfield </em>Co., 73 F. Supp. 3d 1285, 1296 (D. Mont. 2014) (hereafter <em>Asarco I). Asarco I </em>is currently on appeal to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b68 Following the federal court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in <em>Asarco I, </em>Asarco commenced the present action against Atlantic Richfield in the First Judicial District Court. Asarco\u2019s complaint alleged the following claims under state law: breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and constructive fraud. Asarco claimed that it learned the basis for its state-law claims during discovery in <em>Asarco I. </em>Asarco claimed further that it was entitled to indemnification from Atlantic Richfield for Atlantic Richfield\u2019s \u201cshare of the claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses attributable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Claims, including attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, that arose out of or resulted from [Atlantic Richfield\u2019s] construction, ownership and operation\u201d of the zinc fuming plant at the Site. Asarco premised its state-law claims on Atlantic Richfield\u2019s alleged breach of the 1972 Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b69 In March 2015 Atlantic Richfield moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(c) (Rule 12(c)) on the ground that the doctrine of claim preclusion barred Asarco\u2019s claims. The District Court issued its order in June 2015 following briefing and oral argument. The District Court determined: that Asarco could have amended its complaint in <em>Asarco I </em>to include its state-law claims; that the federal district court would have had supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims; that it was not clear whether the federal district court would have refused to continue exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims after dismissing Asarco\u2019s CERCLA claim; and that the elements of claim preclusion were met. Accordingly, the court granted Atlantic Richfield\u2019s motion and dismissed the matter. Asarco appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b610 A district court\u2019s decision on a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings is a conclusion of law that we review de novo for correctness. <em>Firelight Meadows, LLC v. 3 Rivers Telephone Coop., Inc., </em>2008 MT 202, \u00b6 12, 344 Mont. 117, 186 P.3d 869. A Rule 12(c) motion is appropriate when the moving party establishes that no material issues of fact exist and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Firelight Meadows, LLC, </em>\u00b6 9. In evaluating a Rule 12(c) motion, a court must assume that all of the well-pleaded factual allegations in the nonmovant\u2019s pleadings are true and that all contravening assertions in the movant\u2019s pleadings are false. <em>Firelight Meadows, LLC, </em>\u00b6 11. Because \u201c[a]ll exhibits and materials referred to in a pleading are incorporated into the pleading,\u201d a court may consider any such exhibits and materials in deciding a Rule 12(c) motion. <em>Firelights Meadows, LLC, </em>\u00b6 15. Furthermore, only \u201cwell-pleaded factual allegations\u201d are assumed to be true for purposes of deciding a Rule 12(c) motion; questions of law are \u201clegal determination[s] for a court to decide based upon well-established legal precedent.\u201d <em>Firelights Meadows, LLC, </em>\u00b6 18. A district court\u2019s application of claim preclusion presents an issue of law that we review de novo for correctness. <em>Brilz v. Metro. Gen. Ins. Co., </em>2012 MT 184, \u00b6 13, 366 Mont. 78,285 P.3d 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court correctly determined that claim preclusion barred Asarco\u2019s claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b612 In its order, the District Court first observed that Asarco\u2019s state-law claims were not raised in <em>Asarco I. </em>The court noted that the doctrine of claim preclusion applies equally to claims that could have been raised in the first action. The District Court therefore analyzed several issues pertinent to its conclusion that Asarco\u2019s state-law claims could have been raised <em>in. Asarco I </em>and therefore were barred by claim preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b613 The District Court first found that Asarco discovered the grounds underlying its state-law claims during discovery in <em>Asarco I; </em>therefore, the court concluded that Asarco could have amended its <em>Asarco I </em>complaint to include those claims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), which governs amendments to pleadings. The court concluded further that the federal district court would have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over Asarco\u2019s state-law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a) because those claims were part of the same case or controversy as its CERCLA claim. The court next noted that under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c), a federal court may continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim if the court has dismissed the federal claims. Relying on the Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 25 and decisions from the Ninth Circuit, the court determined that it was unclear whether the federal district court would have declined to exercise continuing jurisdiction over the state-law claims after dismissing Asarco\u2019s CERCLA claim on summary judgment. Finally, the court determined that the subject matter and the issues were the same in both actions because \u201c[b]oth actions concern [Atlantic Richfield\u2019s] operation of the East Helena zinc fuming plant, its alleged pollution of the ground and water in that area, and its attempted concealment of those operations.\u201d The District Court concluded that claim preclusion barred Asarco\u2019s state-law claims, granted Atlantic Richfield\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u00b614 Asarco contends that the District Court erred in several respects. First, Asarco asserts that the court incorrectly presumed that the federal district court would have continued to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over its state-law claims following the federal court\u2019s dismissal of the CERCLA claim on summary judgment. Next, Asarco contends that it did not have knowledge of its fraud claims in sufficient time to raise them in federal court prior to the court\u2019s summary judgment ruling in <em>Asarco I. </em>Finally, Asarco argues that the subject matter and issues in both cases are different. Therefore, it asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>claim preclusion is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b615 Claim preclusion bars a party from \u201crelitigating claims that were or could have been raised\u201d in a previous action in which a final judgment was reached. <em>Brilz, </em>\u00b6 18. The doctrine embodies \u201ca judicial policy that favors a definite end to litigation.\u201d <em>Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2006 MT 51, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 281, 130 P.3d 1267 (citations omitted). Claim preclusion deters \u201cplaintiffs from splitting a single cause of action into more than one lawsuit, thereby conserving judicial resources and encouraging reliance on adjudication by preventing inconsistent judgments.\u201d <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 15 (citations omitted). Claim preclusion applies if the following elements are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">(1) the parties or their privies are the same in the first and second actions; (2) the subject matter of the actions is the same; (3) the issues are the same in both actions, or are ones that could have been raised in the first action, and they relate to the same subject matter; (4) the capacities of the parties are the same in reference to the subject matter and the issues between them; and (5) a valid final judgment has been entered on the merits in the first action by a court of competent jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\"><em>Brilz, </em>\u00b6 22. Here, it is undisputed that the parties are the same, that the capacities of the parties are the same, and that the federal district court entered a final judgment on the merits in <em>Asarco I. </em>Thus, the elements in dispute are whether the actions involve the same subject matter and, if so, whether the issues in the instant case are ones that could have been raised in the first action.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u00b616 Asarco argues that the subject matter of the cases is different because \u201cthe federal case is about contamination, while the very different state case is about concealment.\u201d The federal case, Asarco asserts, related to \u201cwhether [Atlantic Richfield] released contaminates at the [Site], what type of contaminates it released, how much of these contaminates it released, and accordingly how much it should contribute to the clean up costs.\u201d On the other hand, Asarco contends, the instant case relates to \u201cwhat documents and information were withheld by [Atlantic Richfield], what affirmative misrepresentations and misstatements were made by [Atlantic Richfield], and whether such withholdings and misstatements violated the terms of the 1972 Agreement.\u201d In other words, Asarco claims that the federal case concerned Atlantic Richfield\u2019s conduct prior to the sale of its zinc fuming plant and the instant case concerns Atlantic Richfield\u2019s conduct after selling its zinc fuming plant. Asarco contends further that the \u201clevel of technicality,\u201d the witnesses necessary to each case, and when the claims accrued underscores the differences between both cases. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Finally, Asarco alleges that the \u201cstate law claims are based on facts independent of the previous federal court action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b617 The subject matter element of claim preclusion \u201cis concerned with whether the two actions arise from the same underlying basis.\u201d <em>Touris v. Flathead Cnty., 2011 </em>MT 165, \u00b6 17, 361 Mont. 172, 258 P.3d 1 (citing <em>Wiser v. Mont. Bd. of Dentistry, </em>2011 MT 56, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 360 Mont. 1, 251 P.3d 675; <em>State ex rel. Harlem Irrigation Dist. v. Mont. Seventeenth Judicial Dist. Ct., </em>271 Mont. 129, 133-34, 894 P.2d 943, 945 (1995)); <em>Olsen v. Milner, </em>2012 MT 88, \u00b6 23, 364 Mont. 523, 276 P.3d 934. The parties\u2019 pleadings make clear that concealment of contamination from Atlantic Richfield\u2019s zinc fuming plant is at the heart of both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"A2T\">\u00b618 In its briefing on appeal, Asarco asserts that <em>Asarco Is </em>subject matter concerned \u201cthe contamination that resulted from [Atlantic Richfield\u2019s] ownership and operation of its zinc fuming plant at the East Helena site.\u201d In its first amended complaint in <em>Asarco I, </em>referenced in Asarco\u2019s complaint in the instant case, Asarco asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4_\">[Atlantic Richfield] (including through its corporate predecessors) owned and operated a zinc fuming facility adjacent to the East Helena site .... These operations lead to disposals or discharges of lead, arsenic, copper, zinc, cadmium and other hazardous substances into the soil, surface water and groundwater of the Helena Valley. Asarco\u2019s East Helena Settlements have paid to remediate these metals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Because Atlantic Richfield was responsible for the release of hazardous substances from its zinc fuming plant, Asarco asserted that it was entitled to contribution from Atlantic Richfield for the claims Asarco paid to remediate the contamination at the Site arising out of the zinc fuming plant\u2019s operation by Atlantic Richfield. In its response in opposition to Atlantic Richfield\u2019s motion for summary judgment in <em>Asarco </em>I \u2014 again referenced in Asarco\u2019s complaint in the instant case \u2014 Asarco alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">[Atlantic Richfield] responded to information requests and demands for payment from EPA stating that it never released any hazardous substances at the site. Contrary to those sworn statements, [Atlantic Richfield\u2019s] records reveal 45 years of massive, unreported releases of arsenic .... [Atlantic Richfield] employees now admit that [Atlantic Richfield] wrongly kept this record of pollution from the EPA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Asarco alleged further that the EPA looked solely to Asarco to remediate the Site\u2019s contamination because the EPA was \u201c[u]naware of [Atlantic Richfield\u2019s] misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u00b619 In its pre-trial proposed conclusions of law in <em>Asarco I, </em>attached to Atlantic Richfield\u2019s answer in the instant case, Asarco asserted that \u201c[i]n formulating an allocation for contribution, the court may consider factors other than the actual amounts contributed to the Site.\u201d One factor Asarco cited was \u201cthe degree of cooperation by the parties with Federal, State, or local officials to prevent any harm to public health or the environment.\u201d During a deposition in <em>Asarco I, </em>attached to Atlantic Richfield\u2019s answer in the instant case, Asarco\u2019s counsel brought up this cooperation factor and asked whether certain documents \u201cshould have been provided to the United States in response\u201d to the EPA\u2019s request for information regarding Atlantic Richfield\u2019s historical waste disposal practices at the Site. Asarco\u2019s counsel made clear that the purpose of his questions relating to Atlantic Richfield\u2019s response to the EPA\u2019s information request was \u201cto determine whether [Atlantic Richfield] co-operated [sic]\u201d with the EPA. In other words, Asarco was attempting to demonstrate in <em>Asarco I </em>that Atlantic Richfield\u2019s failure to cooperate with the EPA by not disclosing certain documents relating to contamination at the Site violated CERCLA and therefore justified reimbursing Asarco for costs related to the Site\u2019s clean-up. The pleadings demonstrate that Asarco\u2019s CERCLA contribution claim in <em>Asarco I </em>arises, in part, from Atlantic Richfield\u2019s alleged concealment of contamination from the zinc fuming plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b620 Asarco asserts that the instant case\u2019s subject matter nonetheless differs from that of <em>Asarco I </em>because this case concerns Atlantic Richfield\u2019s \u201cconcealment of schematics and design documents it was under an obligation to disclose, and its affirmative misrepresentations to Asarco, and to the EPA.\u201d In its state court complaint, Asarco asserts that Atlantic Richfield deceived the EPA by \u201cnot disclosing] any of its own releases of hazardous substances at the Site in response to [the EPA\u2019s] requests [for information regarding Atlantic Richfield\u2019s historical waste disposal practices], [Atlantic Richfield] represented that it operated a closed circuit, noncontact cooling system [at the zinc fuming plant].\u201d Asarco asserts further that Atlantic Richfield\u2019s modification of the cooling system contributed to the Site\u2019s contamination. Asarco\u2019s breach of contract claim alleges that Atlantic Richfield \u201cfailed to supply Asarco with copies of all authorizations, permits, plans, drawings, design, records, and licenses, which showed its release and discharge of hazardous substances into the environment during [Atlantic Richfield\u2019s] ownership and operation of the\u201d zinc fuming plant. Its breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim alleges that Atlantic Richfield \u201cwrongfully withheld the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Contamination Documents and actively concealed its contamination of the environment during its ownership and operation of the [zinc fuming plant] as a pretext to avoid its contractual obligations.\u201d Asarco\u2019s factual allegations demonstrate that its claims of \u201cconcealment\u201d and \u201caffirmative misrepresentations\u201d arise from the Site\u2019s contamination during Atlantic Richfield\u2019s ownership and operation of the zinc fuming plant. Moreover, Asarco\u2019s indemnification claim alleges that Atlantic Richfield is obligated to indemnify Asarco for Atlantic Richfield\u2019s \u201cshare of the claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses attributable to the Claims ... that arose out of or resulted from [Atlantic Richfield\u2019s] construction, ownership and operation of the\u201d zinc fuming plant. Asarco therefore is seeking the same relief it sought in <em>Asarco </em>I \u2014 that Atlantic Richfield was \u201cliable for [its] equitable share[ ] of any overpayment incurred by Asarco\u201d in remediating contamination at the Site.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b621  Based on our review of the pleadings and their incorporated exhibits and materials, we conclude that the subject matter is the same in both cases because both cases \u201carise from the same underlying basis\u201d \u2014 Atlantic Richfield\u2019s responsibility for contamination at the Site that allegedly resulted from its ownership and operation of the zinc fuming plant. <em>Touris, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Olsen, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b622 Asarco\u2019s contentions ring somewhat hollow when considering its representation during oral argument on the motion for judgment on the pleadings. Asarco stated that if the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals were to reverse the federal district court\u2019s decision in <em>Asarco I, </em>it \u201cwould seek removal\u201d of its state-law claims to the federal district court. In other words, Asarco acknowledged that it would seek to have the federal district court exercise supplemental jurisdiction over its state-law claims. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 governs supplemental jurisdiction and provides federal courts with \u201csupplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a). In determining whether a federal court has the authority to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims, the United States Supreme Court looks to whether the federal claims and the state-law claims \u201cderive from a common nucleus of operative fact.\u201d E.g., <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, </em>547 U.S. 332, 351, 126 S. Ct. 1854, 1866 (2006); <em>City of Chi. v. Int\u2019l College of Surgeons, </em>522 U.S. 156, 165, 118 S. Ct. 523, 529 (1997); <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 1138 (1966). In seeking to remove the instant case to the federal district court, Asarco therefore would have to demonstrate that its claims in both cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u201cderive from a common nucleus of operative fact.\u201d <em>See DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>547 U.S. at 351, 126 S. Ct. at 1866.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b623 In like manner, our claim preclusion precedent counsels that the issues in two actions are the same, or relate to the same subject matter, when \u201c[t]here is a common nucleus of operative facts underlying\u201d the claims in both cases. <em>Brilz, </em>\u00b6 25. Whether the subject matter is the same in both cases requires similar analysis. <em>Brilz, </em>\u00b6 23 (analyzing whether the issues in two cases are the same and concluding that \u201cclaim preclusion applies where the second suit arises from the same underlying basis or subject matter as the first suit\u201d). As shown above, the pleadings demonstrate that \u201cthere is a common nucleus of operative facts underlying\u201d both actions \u2014 Atlantic Richfield\u2019s alleged acts, and concealment of those acts, that produced contamination at the Site. <em>Brilz, </em>\u00b6 25. Accordingly, we conclude that the issues in both cases relate to the same subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoj\">\u00b624 Because the subject matter is the same and the issues in both cases relate to Atlantic Richfield\u2019s alleged concealment of its contamination, we consider whether Asarco could have raised in <em>Asarco I </em>the claims it advances here. Asarco first asserts that the District Court erred by not applying the \u201cfraud exception\u201d to claim preclusion. Asarco contends that its claims cannot be barred by claim preclusion because Atlantic Richfield \u201cfraudulently concealed the information giving rise to Asarco\u2019s state law claims, and thereby prevented Asarco from timely bringing such claims under the federal court\u2019s supplemental jurisdiction during the CERCLA litigation.\u201d Asarco alleges that it \u201cdid not have the information necessary to fully realize the ramifications of [Atlantic Richfield\u2019s] fraudulent conduct and the existence of state law claims until May 1,2014.\u201d By that point, Asarco contends, \u201cdiscovery had closed, expert deadlines had passed and expert disclosures had been made, and the deadline to amend pleadings had long since passed.\u201d Consequently, Asarco contends that it did not have sufficient time to raise its state-law claims in <em>Asarco I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9A\">\u00b625 Atlantic Richfield counters that Asarco\u2019s suggested rule \u201cwould allow a plaintiff with both state and federal claims arising from the same facts to file only its federal claims in a federal court action, wait to see if those claims were successful, and, if not, turn around and file its state claims in a state court action.\u201d Atlantic Richfield contends that \u201cAsarco had ample means in the federal court to develop its allegations of fraud and, in fact, did develop the very evidence it now wants to bring in Montana\u2019s courts.\u201d Accordingly, Atlantic Richfield claims that Asarco could have added its state-law claims under \u201cthe federal court\u2019s liberal rules of amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\u00b626 The law of claim preclusion \u201creflects the expectation that parties who are given the capacity to present their \u2018entire controversies\u2019 shall in fact do <em>so.\u201d Brilz, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24 cmt. a). As such, claim preclusion bars a party from litigating claims that <em>\u201ccould have been </em>litigated in the first action.\u201d <em>Brilz, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Wiser, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Somont Oil Co. v. A &amp; G Drilling, Inc., </em>2008 MT 447, \u00b6 11, 348 Mont. 12, 199 P.3d 241) (emphasis in original). Consequently, claim preclusion may bar a party \u201cfrom litigating a matter that has never been litigated and that may involve valid rights to relief. The rationale here is to force parties to raise such matters in their first suit in the interest of judicial economy and avoiding the expense and vexation of multiple suits.\u201d <em>Brilz, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b627 Asarco\u2019s assertion that the District Court erred by not applying claim preclusion\u2019s \u201cfraud exception\u201d is misplaced. We have not recognized a blanket \u201cfraud exception\u201d to claim preclusion. In fact, we recently concluded that a party\u2019s fraud claims were barred by claim preclusion because those claims could have been raised in the first action. <em>Estate of Kinnaman v. Mt. West Bank, N.A., </em>2016 MT 25, 382 Mont. 153, 365 P.3d 486 (concluding that a party was \u201cbarred from reopening issues [including fraudulent inducement, constructive fraud, and actual fraud] that were or should have been determined in the prior suit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b628 We are unpersuaded by Asarco\u2019s further assertions that it did not have sufficient time to raise its state-law claims in <em>Asarco I. </em>Asarco alleges that it knew the facts underlying its claims on May 1,2014; the federal district court entered its summary judgment order in <em>Asarco I </em>on August 26, 2014. The District Court found that despite Asarco\u2019s \u201callegations of fraud and concealment, it is fairly clear that Asarco knew generally of [the facts underlying its state-law claims] in March 2013 and at least by February 2014.\u201d Even taking Asarco\u2019s factual representation as true, the facts that form the basis of its complaint in the instant action \u2014 e.g., the contractual relationship between the parties, the Site\u2019s alleged contamination by Atlantic Richfield\u2019s zinc fuming plant, Asarco\u2019s payments to clean up the Site, and Atlantic Richfield\u2019s concealment of facts and misrepresentations to Asarco and the EPA \u2014 were known to Asarco more than three months before the federal district court\u2019s final judgment on the merits in <em>Asarco I. </em>Because the subject matter of both cases arose from the same underlying basis, the federal district court could have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over Asarco\u2019s state-law claims in <em>Asarco I. See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a) (providing that a federal court may exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims \u201cthat are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b629  Although, as Asarco asserts, the deadline to amend its pleadings as a matter of course had passed, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that when a party seeks leave to amend the party\u2019s pleading, \u201cleave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). In the Ninth Circuit, \u201cthere exists a <em>presumption </em>... in favor of granting leave to amend,\u201d if there is no showing of undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, undue prejudice to the opposing party, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, or futility of amendment. <em>Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc., </em>316 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003) (emphasis in original); <em>Brilz, </em>\u00b6 29 (analyzing Ninth Circuit policy regarding leave to amend under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) and citing <em>Eminence Capital, LLC, </em>316 F.3d at 1052). \u201cIn light of this policy towards amendments ... it is clear that [Asarco] could have sought to amend [its] complaint in the federal proceeding.\u201d <em>Brilz, </em>\u00b6 29. Accordingly, we conclude that Asarco\u2019s claims at issue here could have been raised in <em>Asarco I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b630 Finally, Asarco takes issue with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the federal court would have retained supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims following the court\u2019s dismissal of the CERCLA claim in <em>Asarco I. </em>Asarco asserts that the general rule under federal case law is for federal courts to not exercise continuing supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims when all federal claims are dismissed in advance of trial. Montana federal district courts, Asarco contends, adhere to this general rule. Moreover, Asarco asserts, the language of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 25 \u201cestablishes that dismissal of federal claims in advance of trial is one situation in which it is \u2018clear\u2019 that the federal court would decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.\u201d Asarco therefore alleges that the federal district court would have declined to exercise continuing supplemental jurisdiction over its state-law claims because those claims were not developed, additional discovery would have been required, and the state-law claims had not been litigated in the federal forum by the time summary judgment was granted on the CERCLA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b631 The Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 25, entitled \u201cExemplifications of General Rule Concerning Splitting,\u201d provides that claim preclusion applies even when a party is prepared \u201c(1) To present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>evidence or grounds or theories of the case not presented in the first action, or (2) To seek remedies or forms of relief not demanded in the first action.\u201d Comment e illustrates an exception to this general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA8\">A given claim may find support in theories or grounds arising from both state and federal law. When the plaintiff brings an action on the claim in a court, either state or federal, in which there is no jurisdictional obstacle to his advancing both theories or grounds, but he presents only one of them, and judgment is entered with respect to it, he may not maintain a second action in which he tenders the other theory or ground. If however, the court in the first action would clearly not have had jurisdiction to entertain the omitted theory or ground (or, having jurisdiction, would clearly have declined to exercise it as a matter of discretion), then a second action in a competent court presenting the omitted theory or ground should be held not precluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV6\">Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 25 cmt. e (1982). Comment e therefore illustrates that claim preclusion would not apply in the instant case if it could be shown that the federal district court would have clearly declined to maintain jurisdiction over Asarco\u2019s supplemental state-law claims following its dismissal of the CERCLA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b632  We decline to speculate whether the federal district court would have continued to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Asarco\u2019s state-law claims \u2014 had Asarco raised them \u2014 after granting Atlantic Richfield\u2019s summary judgment motion in <em>Asarco I. </em>Such speculation defeats the policy of judicial economy and \u201ca definite end to litigation\u201d that the claim preclusion doctrine is intended to advance. <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 15. The question arises here only because the federal district court was not given the opportunity to decide for itself whether to retain jurisdiction over Asarco\u2019s state-law claims. Because Asarco could have brought its state-law claims before the federal district court in <em>Asarco I, </em>we conclude that the District Court correctly determined that claim preclusion bars Asarco\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b633 We affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting Atlantic Richfield\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b210-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-15\"> Atlantic Richfield refers to itself and its predecessor, the Anaconda Company, as \u201cAtlantic Richfield\u201d and we will do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
