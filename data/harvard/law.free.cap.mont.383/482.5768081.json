We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u00b62 We address the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">\n<em>DidHislop\u2019s aggravated DUI conviction violate the prohibition on ex post facto laws?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">\u00b63 In 2007, Hislop\u2019s license was suspended because she declined to submit to the preliminary alcohol screening test after being arrested for DUI. Ultimately, she was acquitted of the criminal charge after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">\u00b64 In 2011, the Montana Legislature enacted \u00a7 61-8-465, MCA, the aggravated DUI statute. Section 61-8-465, MCA, provides that a person commits aggravated DUI if the person operates a vehicle under the influence of alcohol and refuses to provide a breath or blood sample as required under \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, the implied consent law, and has had his or her license suspended for a prior refusal to provide a breath or blood sample under \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, within ten years of the current offense. Section 61-8-465(l)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">\u00b65 In 2013, Hislop was arrested for DUI. Hislop did not provide a breath or blood sample as required under \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA. Hislop was charged with aggravated DUI based on her 2007 refusal to submit a breath or blood test. Hislop filed a motion to dismiss the charge on the ground it violated the prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws. The Justice Court denied the motion, reasoning that if Hislop were convicted she would be punished for her 2013 conduct \u2014 committing DUI andrefusing a breath or blood test after having refused a breath or blood test within the last ten years \u2014 rather than her 2007 conduct of refusing a breath or blood test. The jury convicted Hislop of aggravated DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">\u00b66 Hislop appealed the denial of her motion to dismiss to the District Court. The District Court affirmed the Justice Court, agreeing the conviction did not violate the prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws. Hislop appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b67 This Court\u2019s review of constitutional issues is plenary. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2015 MT 221, \u00b6 10, 380 Mont. 198, 356 P.3d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b68 <em>Did Hislop\u2019s aggravated DUI conviction violate the prohibition on ex post facto laws </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\u00b69 Hislop argues that her conviction for aggravated DUI violates the prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws because her conviction relied upon the suspension of her driver\u2019s license following her 2007 refusal to submit to a test, which predated the enactment of the aggravated DUI statute. The State argues Hislop\u2019s conviction is not an <em>ex post facto </em>application of the aggravated DUI statute because Hislop was punished for conduct that occurred in 2013 after the enactment of the aggravated DUI statute. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\u00b610 Both the federal and Montana constitutions prohibit the <em>ex post facto </em>application of laws. U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 10; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 31. A criminal law is <em>ex post facto </em>if it (1) punishes as a crime an act that was not unlawful when committed; (2) makes punishment for a crime more burdensome; or (3) deprives a person charged with a crime of any defense available under the law at the time the act was committed. <em>State v. Mount, </em>2003 MT 275, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, 317 Mont. 481, 78 P.3d 829. Banning <em>ex post facto </em>legislation serves two purposes: entitling people to a fair warning of what conduct is punishable and preventing federal and state governments from passing arbitrary and potentially vindictive laws. <em>State v. Brander, </em>280 Mont. 148, 153, 930 P.2d 31, 35 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">\u00b611  Hislop argues that \u00a7 61-8-465(l)(d), MCA, falls into the first of the above-referenced three categories of <em>ex post facto </em>laws because it punished her criminally for an act that was previously punished civilly. However, license revocation due to refusal to submit to a breath or blood test remains a civil sanction, not a crime. <em>See In re Burnham, </em>217 Mont. 513, 518, 705 P.2d 603, 607 (1985). Hislop is not being punished for her refusal to submit to a breath or blood test in 2007. Instead, Hislop is being punished for driving under the influence of alcohol and refusing a breath or blood test when she had her license suspended for refusing a breath or blood test within the last ten years. The Legislature gave Hislop \u201cfair warning\u201d that this conduct was punishable two years prior to her actions. <em>Brander, </em>280 Mont. at 153, 930 P.2d at 35. Hislop\u2019s act was therefore unlawful when it was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u00b612  Hislop argues in the alternative that \u00a7 61-8-465(1)(d), MCA, falls into the second category of <em>ex post facto </em>laws because it increased the punishment for her 2007 refusal to submit to a breath or blood test.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, a law\u2019s reliance on prior behavior that occurred before the law was passed does not violate the prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws where the law punishes conduct that occurs after the law was passed. <em>See Brander, </em>280 Mont. at 154, 930 P.2d at 35 (\u201c[SJimply because a statute operates on events antecedent to its effective date does not make the statute <em>ex post facto, </em>nor does such operation make a law prohibitively retroactive.\u201d). Because \u00a7 61-8-465(1)(d), MCA, merely takes into account Hislop\u2019s 2007 behavior while punishing her 2013 conduct, it does not constitute <em>ex post facto </em>legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b509-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON, SHEA and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-6\"> Hislop\u2019s arguments are somewhat inconsistent in that she argues a license revocation is a civil sanction as applied to the first category of <em>ex post facto </em>laws, but is a criminal punishment as applied to the second category <em>of ex post facto </em>laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
