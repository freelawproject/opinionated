We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b62 We address the following two restated issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err by concluding that the alleged acts and subsequent consequences did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d covered by the policy?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment in favor of EMC?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">\u00b63 The asserted facts in the underlying tort action that gave rise to the insurance coverage dispute herein are as follows: Since 1969, the Slacks have owned land on Flathead Lake, in Lake County, on which sat a vacation home of some age. In 2007, the Slacks hired contractor Jeffrey Fisher and his company, Fisher Builders (Fisher), to build \u201ca remodeled home located on the site of the small home\u201d to serve as a year-round residence. Because the Slacks\u2019 vacation home predated the adoption of Lake County\u2019s zoning regulations, the proposed construction modifications were deemed by the County to be \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in as a pre-regulation structure and, thus, an acceptable non-conforming property use. However, in order to maintain that status, the remodeled home had to incorporate the existing structure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Approval of the Slacks\u2019 permit was also conditioned on the requirement that \u201c[t]he existing deck shall remain unchanged as a result of the proposed project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">\u00b64 Fisher elevated the existing home structure on steel I-beams to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>pour a new foundation. With the existing structure resting on the beams, Fisher began to dismantle the walls of the vacation home and, in so doing, discovered an infestation of carpenter ants. He cut out the ant-infested planks, apparently intending to salvage what usable materials he could from the remaining structure. He subsequently burned the ant-infested boards.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At some point during this work, the deck collapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\">\u00b65 A member of the Lake County Planning Department conducted a site visit and issued a cease and desist order, halting all work on the project. The Planning Department revoked the Slacks\u2019 construction permit, citing multiple violations of the Lakeshore Protection Regulations and noting that the \u201cexisting structure on the site had been destroyed.\u201d The Slacks appealed the revocation of their construction permit to the District Court, eventually reaching a settlement with Lake County that allowed them to construct a home, albeit a smaller one than had previously been approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b66 The Slacks then initiated a negligence action against Fisher and his construction company, Fisher Builders (the underlying action). EMC had issued a commercial general liability insurance policy to Fisher. The policy provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">1. Insuring Agreement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">a. We [EMC] will pay those sums that the insured [Fisher] becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance applies. ... However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any \u201csuit\u201d seeking damages for \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance does not apply. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">b.

EMC and the Slacks both moved for summary judgment, with Fisher joining the Slacks\u2019 motion. Fisher and Fisher Builders ultimately settled with the Slacks, consenting to entry of judgment in favor of the Slacks and assigning their rights under the EMC insurance policy to the Slacks. The District Court granted EMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Fisher\u2019s conduct was clearly intentional and did not fit within the meaning of \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy, \u201cregardless of whether Fisher intended the consequences or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u00b68 Slacks appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">STANDARD; OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">\u00b69 \u201cThe interpretation of an insurance policy presents a question of law, and we will review the District Court\u2019s legal conclusion for correctness.\u201d <em>Landa v.

Did the District Court err by concluding that the alleged acts and subsequent consequences did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d covered by the policy ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b612 The Slacks contend that the District Court erred by holding that, in the context of general liability insurance, the term \u201coccurrence,\u201d defined by the policy as \u201can accident,\u201d categorically precludes coverage for any intentional conduct on the part of the insured. They argue the District Court erred by concluding that unintended consequences resulting from Fisher\u2019s acts did not satisfy the definition of \u201coccurrence.\u201d EMC responds that this Court \u201chas clearly, unambiguously, and consistently stated that in the context of [commercial general liability] insurance coverage where an insurer\u2019s policy defines \u2018occurrence\u2019 as an accident, damages stemming from the insured\u2019s intentional acts do not constitute accidental \u2018occurrences\u2019 \u2014 even if the resulting consequences and related damages are unintended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b613 Slacks cite extensively to <em>Northwestern Nat\u2019l Cas. Co. v. Phalen, </em>182 Mont. 448, 597 P.2d 720 (1979). There, Phalen, the insured, punched another man outside of a bar. Phalen\u2019s victim ran away after Phalen\u2019s punch, and Phalen gave chase. Before Phalen caught him, a third party tripped the victim. <em>Phalen, </em>182 Mont. at 451, 597 P.2d at 722. The victim fell off the curb and hit the pavement, sustaining serious injuries. <em>Phalen, </em>182 Mont. at 452, 597 P.2d at 722. After the victim brought suit against Phalen and the intervening third party who tripped him, Phalen\u2019s insurer claimed the incident did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy and was not covered. <em>Phalen, </em>182 Mont. at 454, 597 P.2d at 723. The policy excluded from coverage \u201cbodily injury or property damage, which is either <em>expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured,\u201d </em>as does the policy here. <em>Phalen, </em>182 Mont. at 455, 597 P.2d at 724 (emphasis in original). The district court entered summary judgment in favor of the insurer, concluding there was no coverage. <em>Phalen, </em>182 Mont. at 454, 597 P.2d at 724. This Court reversed, stating, \u201c[W]e would interpret the clause to mean that it precludes coverage for bodily injuries or damages, though not specifically intended by the insured, <em>if the resulting harm was within the expectation or intention of the insured </em>from his standpoint.\u201d <em>Phalen, </em>182 Mont. at 459, 597 P.2d at 726 (emphasis added). We also determined that summary judgment was improper because a question of material fact remained regarding Phalen\u2019s intention and expectation as to his victim\u2019s injuries. <em>Phalen, </em>182 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>at 460, 597 P.2d at 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b614 We considered a similar coverage question in <em>Miller Mut. Ins. Co. v. Strainer, </em>204 Mont. 162, 663 P.2d 338 (1983). Strainer worked at the ASARCO smelter in East Helena, and played a practical joke on a coworker by removing a filter from the coworker\u2019s respirator and \u201csquirt[ing] a puff of smoke into the respirator\u2019s air chamber.\u201d <em>Strainer, </em>204 Mont. at 164, 663 P.2d at 339. While Strainer claimed he \"did not know the smoke would cause any injury other than momentary discomfort[,]\u201d the coworker \u201cinhaled the smoke and allegedly was seriously injured.\u201d <em>Strainer, </em>204 Mont. at 164, 663 P.2d at 339. The coworker brought suit against Strainer, whose insurer brought an action to declare there was no coverage under the policy, which excluded coverage for \u201cbodily injury or property damage which is either expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured,\u201d because Strainer had acted intentionally. <em>Strainer, </em>204 Mont. at 166, 663 P.2d at 340. We disagreed with the insurer, citing to <em>Phalen </em>for the principle that \u201cintentional acts are <em>not </em>excluded under an insurance policy <em>unless the intentional act results in injuries which would be expected or intended. </em>A person may act intentionally without intending or expecting the consequences of that act.\u201d <em>Strainer, </em>204 Mont. at 167, 663 P.2d at 341 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b615 <em>Phalen </em>and <em>Strainer </em>both involved clearly intentional acts, yet in both cases we determined that the acts may nonetheless have constituted an \u201coccurrence\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under the policies at issue because the subsequent consequences may not have been intended or expected by the actor. Our analysis, simply framed, was to consider 1) whether the act itself was intentional, and 2) if so, whether the consequence or resulting harm stemming from the act was intended or expected from the actor\u2019s standpoint. <em>See Phalen, </em>182 Mont. at 457, 597 P.2d at 725.</p>\n<p id=\"A3q\">\u00b616 EMC relies heavily on <em>Blair, </em>calling it \u201cthe seminal case on this very issue.\u201d Blair owned eight acres of land in a residential subdivision. He excavated a gravel pit on his property and the subdivision\u2019s landowners association brought suit against him, seeking an injunction and restoration of the property. <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Blair tendered defense of the action to his insurance company, asserting that, despite his intentional act to excavate gravel, \u201che did not intend to cause harm to neighboring property owners,\u201d and thus his actions qualified as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>\u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy. <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 17. In the declaratory judgment action, the district court granted summary judgment to Blair\u2019s insurer, concluding that \u201cBlair\u2019s admitted intentional gravel operation did not constitute an occurrence ....\u201d <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 12. This Court affirmed, reasoning that because \u201cBlair deliberately moved gravel on his property, which caused the alleged damages[,]\u201d his actions were \u201cno accident.\u201d <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 19. In retrospect, while we reached the correct result in <em>Blair, </em>the analysis we employed in that case was incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\">\u00b617 In <em>Blair, </em>we distinguished the <em>Phalen </em>line of authority on the ground that the policy at issue did not contain language requiring consideration of whether the damage was \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 20.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, we cited a similar definition of \u201caccident\u201d as a happening \u201cthat occurs without intention or design on the part of the insured.\u201d <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Liss, </em>2000 MT 380, \u00b6 36, 303 Mont. 519, 16 P.3d 399). Yet, we failed to fully analyze under this definition whether the damages allegedly caused by Blair were intended or designed, and simply acceded to Blair\u2019s subjective assertion that \u201che did not intend to cause harm\u201d to his neighbors by locating a gravel pit next to them. <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 17. We thus decided the case on the sheer force of a declaration that \u201c[ujnequivocally, this was no accident.\u201d <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b618 Instead of distinguishing the <em>Phalen </em>line of authority, we should have applied it by holding that Blair\u2019s subjective assertion that \u201che did not intend\u201d to cause the resulting harm to his neighbors was not dispositive, and that, pursuant to the second prong of our construct, Blair\u2019s act of siting a gravel pit in a residential neighborhood had the objective intention or design of impacting the adjacent residential properties. <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 17. By so doing, we would have reached the same denial of coverage but decided the case consistently with the principles of our previous cases: an \u201caccident\u201d may include intentional acts, but coverage is excluded when the consequences of those acts are objectively intended or expected from the standpoint of the insured, as the consequences in <em>Blair </em>surely were. <em>Phalen, </em>182 Mont. at 459, 597 P.2d at 726; <em>Strainer, </em>204 Mont. at 167, 663 P.2d at 341. Likewise, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>could have employed this analysis in <em>Landa, </em>where we held there was no coverage under the same policy definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d for tort claims that were \u201cwholly comprised of [the insured\u2019s] intentional acts\u201d of deceptive statements and misrepresentation. <em>Landa, </em>\u00b6 24. Instead of relying on <em>Blair\u2019s </em>focus on whether the act was truly intentional, we would have reached the same denial of coverage under the second prong of our construct by holding that the insured\u2019s deceitful statements about his business had the objective intention or design of misleading or defrauding the prospective buyer of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b619 As noted above, the second prong of the analysis (whether the insured intended or expected the injury stemming from an intentional act) is an objective inquiry. In <em>Blair, Strainer, </em>and many other cases, the insured made the subjective claim that he did not intend the harm that ensued from his intentional act. It would be a rare case indeed, as reflected in the absence of such cases in our precedent, where an insured would acknowledge that he intended to injure or cause harm to others. However, courts are well equipped to determine objectively what injuries could reasonably be expected to result from an intentional act. <em>See N. H. Ins. Group v. Strecker, </em>244 Mont. 478, 798 P.2d 130 (1990) (father who molested his minor daughter for over 10 years could expect the personal injuries that followed, including medical treatment and emotional distress, regardless of his protestations to the contrary); <em>Am. States Ins. Co. v. Willoughby, </em>254 Mont. 218, 836 P.2d 37 (1992) (spectator who punched, kicked, and bit security guards could expect physical injuries that resulted from assault; \u201c[t]hese types of action are per se intentional and the intent to seriously injure is evident from the commission and type or nature of the act itself.\u201d); <em>Smith v. State Farm Ins. Cos., </em>264 Mont. 129, 870 P.2d 74 (1992) (homeowner who punched teenager in the face could expect physical injuries that followed, including knocking out a tooth); <em>Landa </em>(business owner who made intentional misrepresentations to a prospective buyer could expect injuries from reliance on those misrepresentations).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b620  The District Court erred by reasoning that \u201cthe Montana Supreme Court has rejected\u201d the Slacks\u2019 argument that the term accident may \u201cinclude intentional conduct with unintended results.\u201d In fairness to the District Court, this Court has not been consistent in the analysis to be applied when considering this coverage issue. Nonetheless, holding otherwise could broadly eliminate coverage for many damage events that began with an initial act of intention but led to unexpected results. As we said many years ago, pointed out by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Slacks: \u201cStrange and wonderful indeed are the circumstances in which persons are killed or injured by the intentional pulling of the trigger of an \u2018unloaded\u2019 gun, and it is clear that in such situations the discharge itself and the resulting injuries are accidental.\u201d <em>Terry v. Nat\u2019l Farmers Union Life Ins. Co., </em>138 Mont. 333, 339, 356 P.2d 975, 978 (1960) (citation omitted). With the clarification provided herein that the policy language defining \u201caccidents\u201d may include intentional acts if the damages were not objectively intended or expected by the insured, our inconsistent statements have been harmonized and the proper standard can be applied on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\">\u00b621 <em>2. Did the District Court err when it granted summary judgment in favor of EMC?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b622 Slacks argue that the District Court erred by resolving issues of material fact when granting EMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and by resolving disputed facts in favor of EMC. Specifically, the Slacks claim that the District Court determined that Fisher left parts of the home and/or deck unsupported, causing the deck to collapse, that Fisher \u201cdestroyed\u201d the original structure by dismantling the walls, and that Fisher failed to retain a sufficient portion of the original structure in order to maintain the non-conforming use status.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b623 EMC argues that the Slacks\u2019 claim of error is without merit because \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s findings are based upon the substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous.\u201d However, we review a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the exact same standards that the district court applied. <em>Landa, </em>\u00b6 13. At the summary judgment stage, \u201c \u2018the court <em>does not make findings of fact, </em>weigh the evidence, choose one disputed fact over another, or assess the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnston v. Centennial Log Homes &amp; Furnishings, Inc., </em>2013 MT 179, \u00b6 24, 370 Mont. 529, 305 P.3d 781 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b624 The Slacks offer that \u201c[t]he record establishes that Fisher did not intentionally tear down the entire home. He took apart some of the walls ....\u201d Fisher testified that he and his crew \u201cpulled the tarpaper loose from the house,\u201d and \u201cstarted taking those boards loose\u201d in order to move a wall \u201ca foot closer to the lake than the original house,\u201d as contemplated by the building plan. Fisher testified that, after removing the boards, he and his crew discovered an infestation of carpenter ants and they sawed away the ant-infested boards. \u201cSo we cut all the ones that were heavily laden[ ] with carpenter ants into two-foot sections.\u201d Fisher further testified that \u201cthe deck fell down because it wouldn\u2019t support itself.\u201d EMC asserts that \u201cFisher unilaterally and purposely tore down the Slacks\u2019 entire home ...,\u201d and that he admitted as much. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>However, in support of this statement, EMC cites to pages of Fisher\u2019s deposition that are not included with the record before this Court (only excerpts were provided). We cannot determine with certainty from the record provided whether the District Court\u2019s statement that Fisher \u201cdestroyed] the original structure ...\u201d is supported by uncontested facts, but it appears doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b625 The Slacks also contend the District Court erred by determining that Fisher\u2019s actions violated the construction permit. They point to Fisher\u2019s testimony about his meeting with the Lake County Planning Department Planner, where Fisher stated: \u201cWe had the meeting with Sue Shannon when she gave us the permit. After the meeting I said ... \u2018How much of this old house would you like me to use in here\u2019.... She said, 1 would like you to use 50 percent.\u2019 \u201d They cite Fisher\u2019s testimony expressing his understanding that the non-conforming use permit allowed him to dismantle the original structure and then reuse/reassemble the materials in the remodeled home. \u201cAnd did we have a non-conforming structure? [The Lake County Planner] always said we needed to have a non-conforming structure in place. He didn\u2019t say it had to be the old non-conforming structure, he said we had to have a non-conforming structure.\u201d \u201c[T]here is no possible way you can move a wall in two feet without taking it apart and reassembling it.\u201d In response, EMC again cites to portions of Fisher\u2019s testimony not provided to the Court by stating that \u201c[Fisher] admitted at his deposition purposely tearing down the entire house even after being informed by Lake County that the original structure was required to be in place at all times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b626  Given this testimony from the record as provided, we conclude that issues of material fact precluded summary judgment, and that further proceedings will be necessary to resolve factual issues related to application of the coverage provisions of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b627 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-14\"> The record before us is unclear about what exactly this requirement entailed.

The <em>Strainer </em>policy\u2019s definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d was not provided by the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b217-5\"> EMC offers material outside of that portion of the record that was before us in <em>Blair </em>to demonstrate that the policy in <em>Blair </em>indeed contained the same \u201cexpected or intended\u201d exclusion that we stated did not exist, and upon which we distinguished the <em>Phalen </em>line of authority. Of course, we cannot consider that material now, but even if that assertion were true, such exclusion would have likewise provided the proper basis for determining that no coverage existed in <em>Blair, </em>based on the reasoning set forth herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
