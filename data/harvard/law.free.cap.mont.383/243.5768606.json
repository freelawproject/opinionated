Peters cross-appeal the District Court\u2019s dismissal of their cross-claim seeking a declaration that New York Marine is liable to pay the stipulated settlement. While the parties raise multiple issues on appeal, we restate the dispositive issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">\n<em>Whether New York Marine timely raised its disqualification claim, and if so, whether the claim should be considered on the merits because the judge did not disclose circumstances that could potentially cause the judge\u2019s impartiality to be reasonably questioned.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">\u00b62 We remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">\u00b63 This matter has been before this Court on a previous occasion. <em>Draggin\u2019Y Cattle Co. v. Addink, </em>2013 MT 319, 372 Mont. 334, 312 P.3d 451 (hereafter <em>Draggin\u2019 Y I). </em>Because the underlying suit\u2019s background facts are delineated in <em>Draggin\u2019 Y I, </em>we restate the facts only briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"AaDa\">\u00b64 In January 2011, Peters filed a complaint against Junkermier alleging multiple counts stemming from tax services Junkermier performed for Peters. Junkermier tendered the defense to New York Marine, which insured Junkermier under a professional liability policy. Thereafter, New York Marine defended Junkermier subject to a reservation of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">\u00b65 Junkermier eventually moved for summary judgment in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>underlying action on the ground that Peters\u2019s claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The District Court granted Junkermier\u2019s motion for summary judgment in December 2012 and Peters appealed. In <em>Draggin\u2019 Y I, </em>we concluded that Peters\u2019s claims were timely filed. <em>Draggin\u2019 Y I, </em>\u00b6 51. Accordingly, we reversed the District Court\u2019s order granting Junkermier summary judgment and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Draggin\u2019 Y I, </em>\u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b66 On remand, Peters filed a motion for substitution of district court judge pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-804(12), MCA. Judge Huss assumed jurisdiction in December 2013. Litigation continued for nearly a year and then on November 13, 2014, Peters and Junkermier entered into a settlement agreement and stipulation for entry of judgment without New YorkMarine\u2019s participation. Shortly thereafter, the District Court issued an order scheduling a hearing on the stipulated settlement\u2019s reasonableness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b67 Prior to the hearing, New York Marine filed a motion to intervene and request for stay, discovery, and status conference. On December 15, 2014, the District Court granted New York Marine\u2019s motion to intervene but denied its motions for additional discovery and to stay the reasonableness hearing. The court held the reasonableness hearing that same day. At the hearing, Peters filed a cross-claim seeking a declaration that New York Marine was liable to pay the stipulated settlement under the insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b68 On March 5, 2015, the District Court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order finding that the stipulated settlement amount was reasonable. On May 6, 2015, the court entered judgment in the amount of $ 10,000,000 in Peters\u2019s favor and further ordered that Junkermier was not liable for the stipulated settlement. The court dismissed Peters\u2019s cross-claims on June 5,2015, on the ground that the federal district court retained jurisdiction over all claims filed by New York Marine in the federal court. New York Marine appeals the District Court\u2019s order denying its motion for discovery on the reasonableness of the settlement. Peters cross-appeal the June 5 order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b69 On appeal, New York Marine asserts for the first time that Judge Huss erred by not disclosing an apparent conflict of interest. New York Marine claims that the alleged conflict stems from a complaint that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>former court reporter filed against Judge Huss in February 2014. In October 2014 \u2014 during the pendency of this case \u2014 Judge Huss individually entered into a stipulation and confession of judgment. The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) had been paying for Judge Huss\u2019s defense and Judge Huss allegedly entered into the stipulated settlement without the OCA\u2019s participation or knowledge. On November 17, 2014 \u2014 four days after Peters and Junkermier entered into their stipulated settlement \u2014 the OCA filed a complaint against Judge Huss in a Helena district court seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify him. In its complaint, the OCA specifically contested the stipulated settlement amount\u2019s reasonableness. Judge Huss did not disclose the stipulated settlement or his dispute with the OCA to the parties in the case at issue. Judge Huss resigned effective January 1, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b610 We recently adopted a standard of review for analyzing judicial disqualification under the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct. <em>State v. Dunsmore, </em>2015 MT 108, \u00b6 10, 378 Mont. 514, 347 P.2d 1220. Our \u201cinquiry into disqualification requires an objective examination of the circumstances surrounding\u201d potential judicial disqualification and \u201can accurate interpretation\u201d of the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct. <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 10. Accordingly, we review judicial disqualification questions de novo, \u201cdetermining whether the lower court\u2019s decision not to recuse was correct under the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct.\u201d <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b6 11 <em>Whether New York Marine timely raised its disqualification claim, and if so, whether the claim should be considered on the merits because the judge did not disclose circumstances that could potentially cause the judge\u2019s impartiality to be reasonably questioned.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u00b612 On appeal, New York Marine asserts that Judge Huss\u2019s potential conflict of interest raises reasonable questions regarding his impartiality. New York Marine contends that the \u201cundeniable parallels between Judge Huss\u2019 interests in the litigation he was (and still is) defending in his personal capacity and [Peters\u2019s] interests in not permitting [New York Marine] to meaningfully challenge the stipulated settlement\u201d create \u201can apparent and significant conflict of interest.\u201d As such, New York Marine claims that Judge Huss was required, at a minimum, to disclose his apparent conflict of interest to the parties under the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct. New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Marine accordingly asserts that Judge Huss erred by failing to disclose the potential grounds for disqualification. Finally, New York Marine claims that the issue is properly before this Court on appeal because it \u201conly became aware of the facts giving rise to Judge Huss\u2019 potential bias in May 2015, when it discovered that Judge Huss had submitted a letter of resignation (dated April 21, 2015 and effective January 1, 2016) and investigated the circumstances behind that resignation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APY\">\u00b613 Peters counter that the issue is not properly before this Court because New York Marine raises it for the first time on appeal. Peters contend that the information regarding the potential conflict of interest is not in the record and that New York Marine may not address additional matters on appeal because it is bound by the record before the District Court. Accordingly, Peters urge this Court to \u201cstrike all such material\u201d concerning the potential conflict of interest. They assert further that New York Marine had the opportunity to raise the issue in the District Court because the judgment did not become final until Judge Huss entered the order dismissing Peters\u2019s cross-claims on June 5,2015 \u2014 a month after New York Marine claims that it discovered the information on which it bases its disqualification argument. Finally, Peters claim that Judge Huss\u2019s \u201cpersonal experience\u201d does not require disqualification under the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct. Peters assert that under New York Marine\u2019s \u201cformulation, a judge who is in a car accident should not preside over a car accident case, because there may be an \u2018appearance of impropriety\u2019 based on the judge\u2019s personal experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b614 New York Marine requests that we take judicial notice of a number of exhibits \u2014 which are attached to its opening brief on appeal \u2014 regarding Judge Huss\u2019s stipulated settlement and the ensuing dispute with the OCA. The OCA\u2019s complaint for declaratory judgment against Judge Huss is a record of a court of this state of which we take judicial notice. M. R. Evid. 202(b)(6), (d). <em>See Farmers Plant Aid, Inc. v. Fedder </em>, 2000 MT 87, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, 299 Mont. 206, 999 P.2d 315 (concluding that M. R. Evid. 202(b)(6) allows a court to take judicial notice of proceedings in other cases). The complaint alleges sufficient facts to inform our inquiry for purposes of this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b615 It is well established that we generally do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Pilgeram v. GreenPoint Mortg. Funding, Inc., </em>2013 MT 354, \u00b6 20, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.2d 839 (citations omitted). This Court, however, reserves the power to consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal if the issue \u201caffects the substantial rights of a litigant.\u201d <em>Cottrill v. Cottrill Sodding </em>Serv., 229 Mont. 40, 42, 744 P.2d 895, 896 (1987) (quoting <em>In the Matter of N.B., </em>190 Mont. 319, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>323, 620 P.2d 1228, 1231 (1980)) (internal quotations omitted). <em>Accord State v. Carter, </em>2005 MT 87, \u00b6 13, 326 Mont. 427, 114 P.3d 1001; <em>Eastman v. Atl. Richfield Co., </em>237 Mont. 332, 337, 777 P.2d 862, 865 (1989). \u201cIt is axiomatic that a fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.\u201d <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 11. This basic requirement \u201cincludes the requirement that any judge who is biased or partial with regard to a particular matter or party be disqualified from hearing the case.\u201d <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 11. Furthermore, this Court reserves the right to address issues raised for the first time on appeal \u201cif extenuating circumstances justify the party\u2019s failure to assert [its] legal theory at trial.\u201d <em>Pilgeram, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Marcus Daly Memorial Hosp. Corp. v. Borkoski, </em>191 Mont. 366, 369, 624 P.2d 997, 999 (1981); <em>Carter, </em>\u00b6 13).</p>\n<p id=\"A8W\">\u00b616  We conclude that New York Marine raises a claim sufficient to invoke its substantial right to due process because of Judge Huss\u2019s potential conflict of interest. We conclude further that the combination of several factors presents extenuating circumstances justifying New York Marine\u2019s failure to raise the issue at trial. These factors include: Judge Huss\u2019s failure to disclose the potential conflict of interest; the nature of that conflict; Judge Huss\u2019s announcement of his resignation; the fact that New York Marine did not discover the potential grounds for disqualification until at least a month after the court\u2019s approval of the settlement; and the additional fact that final judgment was entered shortly after the potential conflict\u2019s initial discovery. Furthermore, New York Marine\u2019s claims present a number of significant issues impacting the judiciary\u2019s integrity that this Court has not yet addressed. We deem it appropriate, under these circumstances, to consider whether the merits of New York Marine\u2019s claim should be reached even though it did not raise the claim until it filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A5e\">\u00b617 We turn first to Peters\u2019s contention that New York Marine had sufficient opportunity to raise its disqualification claim before the District Court. Although not stated directly, Peters essentially argue that New York Marine waived its disqualification claim by not raising it prior to Judge Huss\u2019s June 5, 2015 final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b618 \u201cThe 2008 Montana Code of Judicial Conduct \u2018establishes standards for the ethical conduct of judges and judicial candidates.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6 41, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455 (quoting M. C. Jud. Cond., Preamble [3]). Rule 2.12 of the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct and \u00a7\u00a7 3-1-803, and -805, MCA, governs judicial disqualification. <em>See Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41-51. Rule 2.12(C) provides that disqualification claims may be waived by the parties unless disqualification is \u201cfor bias or prejudice under paragraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>(A)(1).\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(C). New York Marine does not assert that Judge Huss had <em>\u201ca </em>personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or a party\u2019s lawyer, or personal knowledge of facts that are in dispute in the proceeding.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A)(1). Rather, New York Marine relies on Rule 2.12(A) to assert that Judge Huss\u2019s \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d based on the nature and timing of his potential conflict of interest. M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A). As such, New York Marine\u2019s disqualification claim is subject to waiver. Dunsmore, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19 (concluding that disqualification claims may be waived under Rule 2.12(C) unless the claim is for bias or prejudice under Rule 2.12(A)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b619  We recently adopted a \u201ctimeliness requirement\u201d to determine whether a party has waived a disqualification claim under Rule 2.12. <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 18. Under this requirement, \u201cA claim for disqualification of a judge must be brought within a reasonable time after the moving party learns the facts forming the basis for a claim that the judge should be disqualified.\u201d <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 20. If a party does not raise its disqualification claim \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d of learning the facts underlying its claim, the claim is waived. <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b620 In <em>Dunsmore, </em>the judge in question conducted a sentencing proceeding \u201ca little over a year after charges were filed\u201d against the party asserting a disqualification claim. <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 5. We observed that the party knew of the factual basis for the claim prior to the sentencing proceeding, \u201cbut did not raise disqualification.\u201d <em>Dunsmore,</em></p>\n<p id=\"AS-X\">\u00b6 20. We determined that the party asserting disqualification \u201cmade an apparent tactical decision not to seek [the judge\u2019s] disqualification\u201d by waiting until after the sentencing proceeding to assert the disqualification claim. <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 19. Accordingly, we concluded that the party did not bring its disqualification claim within a reasonable time and therefore waived the claim. <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u00b621 The instant case is distinguishable from <em>Dunsmore. </em>Here, New York Marine asserts that it did not learn of the factual basis for its disqualification claim until May 2015. The District Court dismissed Peters\u2019s cross-claims in a June 5, 2015 order. New York Marine, therefore, had about a month to investigate and raise its disqualification claim before Judge Huss\u2019s final order. Furthermore, New York Marine allegedly learned of the potential conflict of interest around the same time that the court entered judgment in Peters\u2019s favor on May 6,2015, and about two months after the court declared that the stipulated settlement was reasonable. The court, therefore, already had decided the primary issues against New York Marine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Consequently, it appears that New York Marine did not make \u201can apparent tactical decision not to seek [Judge Huss\u2019s] disqualification\u201d prior to raising the issue on appeal. <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 19. Under these circumstances, we conclude that New York Marine raised its claim for disqualification \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d after learning of the circumstances underlying the claim. <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 20. Accordingly, New York Marine did not waive its disqualification claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b622 We emphasize that the timeliness requirement we adopted in <em>Dunsmore </em>ordinarily will mean that a party must raise a disqualification issue before a district court. Rule 2.12 contemplates that a judge against whom a disqualification claim is asserted should have appropriate opportunity to address the claim in the first instance. M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(C) (\u201cA judge subject to disqualification under this Rule ... may disclose in writing or on the record the basis of the judge\u2019s disqualification and may ask the parties and their lawyers to consider, outside the presence of the judge and court personnel, whether to waive disqualification.\u201d). Disqualification issues, therefore, may be resolved by the court itself. <em>See </em>M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.7 (\u201cA judge shall hear and decide matters assigned to the judge, except when disqualification <em>is required </em>by Rule 2.12 or other law.\u201d (Emphasis added)). A party also may seek disqualification by invoking the procedures of \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA. In either case, a party may and ordinarily should raise disqualification issues discovered after an order or final judgment as a motion for relief from judgment in accordance with M. R. Civ. P. 60(b). <em>See Forsmark v. State, </em>349 N.W.2d 763, 768 (Iowa 1984) (addressing a disqualification claim brought in a petition to vacate judgment under the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure); <em>Blaisdell v. City of Rochester, </em>609 A.2d 388, 390 (N.H. 1992) (addressing a disqualification claim brought in a post-final judgment motion to recuse and vacate). Given that we are announcing this principle for the first time here, however, we do not conclude in this case that New York Marine waived its disqualification argument by failing to file a Rule 60(b) motion. Future parties in a similar situation should raise disqualification in accordance with Rule 60(b) in order to preserve the claim for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b623 New York Marine claims that Judge Huss, at a minimum, was obligated to disclose information to the parties that he believed might reasonably be relevant to a potential disqualification claim. New York Marine contends further that \u201cit is hard to argue that there was not, at the very least, the appearance of impropriety in Judge Huss\u2019 ruling on [New York Marine\u2019s] motion to intervene and on the reasonableness of the stipulated judgment.\u201d We decline to address whether Rule 2.12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>required Judge Huss to disqualify himself. This would have been the issue if Judge Huss had disclosed the potential conflict of interest and refused to recuse himself. Under the current situation, however, New York Marine did not have adequate opportunity to raise its disqualification claim earlier because it did not learn of the potential problem until Judge Huss\u2019s April 2015 letter of resignation became public. We therefore address whether Judge Huss initially should have disclosed the circumstances to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b624 The circumstances under which a judge should disclose information that reasonably may cause a party to question the judge\u2019s impartiality present an issue of first impression in Montana. The Preamble to the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct provides, in part, \u201cJudges should maintain the dignity of judicial office at all times, and avoid both impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in their professional and personal lives. They should aspire at all times to conduct that ensures the greatest public confidence in their independence, impartiality, integrity, and competence.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Preamble [2], In order to maintain the dignity of judicial office, the Code mandates, \u201cA judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A). <em>See also Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"AYm\">\u00b625 Rule 2.12(C) provides, \u201cA judge subject to disqualification under this Rule ... <em>may </em>disclose in writing or on the record the basis of the judge\u2019s disqualification.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(C) (emphasis added). Comment 5 to Rule 2.12 provides further, \u201cA judge <em>should </em>disclose on the record information that the judge believes the parties or their lawyers might reasonably consider relevant to a possible motion for disqualification, even if the judge believes there is no basis for disqualification.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12 cmt. [5] (emphasis added). Rule 2.12(C) and Comment 5 counsel that a judge has a duty to disclose information that may be grounds for disqualification under Rule 2.12 unless the judge voluntarily recuses himself or herself on the basis of that information. This conclusion comports with a judge\u2019s affirmative duty to \u201cdisqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A). <em>See also </em>M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12 cmt. [2] (\u201cA judge\u2019s obligation not to hear or decide matters in which disqualification is required applies regardless of whether a motion to disqualify is filed.\u201d). The Code undoubtedly requires judges to disqualify themselves if a party might reasonably question their impartiality. In order for the party to be informed of the circumstances, a judge should disclose information that is relevant to a possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>motion for disqualification. Furthermore, disclosure under Rule 2.12 advances one of the Code\u2019s fundamental purposes \u2014 promoting confidence in the judiciary. <em>See </em>M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 1.2 (\u201cA judge shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.\u201d); M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.2 (\u201cA judge shall uphold and apply the law, and shall perform all duties of judicial office fairly and impartially.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b626 Montana\u2019s Code of Judicial Conduct is based on the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct. <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 12. \u201cWe adopted the ABAModel Code of Judicial Conduct ... in part because it would allow us to consider a well-developed body of case law from other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>In the Matter of the 2008 Montana Code of Judicial Conduct, </em>No. AF 08-0203 (Mont. Dec. 12, 2008)). A number of jurisdictions that have adopted the Model Code interpret their equivalent to Rule 2.12 as requiring judges to disclose information that may be grounds for disqualification. <em>E.g., Forsmark, </em>349 N.W.2d at 768 (concluding that a judge has \u201ca duty to disclose\u201d potential disqualifying information and that the \u201cjudge\u2019s failure to disclose the information deprived plaintiffs of the opportunity to make a timely request that he disqualify himself on the ground ... that \u2018his impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u2019 \u201d); <em>Blaisdell, </em>609 A.2d at 390 (concluding that it is a \u201cjudge\u2019s responsibility to disclose, <em>sua sponte, </em>all information of any potential conflict between [the judge] and the parties or their attorneys when [the judge\u2019s] impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d); <em>Adams v. State, 601 </em>S.W.2d 881, 884 (Ark. 1980) (concluding that if Arkansas\u2019s equivalent to Rule 2.12(A) \u201cis applicable, then the judge must disqualify on [the judge\u2019s] own initiative or must comply with [the equivalent to Rule 2.12(C)] on [the judge\u2019s] own initiative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b627 Peters contend that Judge Huss was not required to disclose his personal settlement because requiring disqualification under the circumstances at issue here is equivalent to requiring disqualification from a car accident case of a judge who has been involved personally in a car accident. We are unpersuaded by this contention because the situations are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u00b628 The Code defines \u201cimpartiality\u201d as an \u201cabsence of bias or prejudice in favor of, or against, particular parties or classes of parties, as well as maintenance of an open mind in considering issues that may come before a judge.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Terminology, \u201cImpartiality.\u201d Comment 1 to Rule 2.12 makes clear that \u201ca judge is disqualified whenever the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12 cmt. [1].</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b629 A judge\u2019s average personal experiences \u2014 including being involved in a car accident \u2014 undoubtedly shape the judge\u2019s perspective. This does not mean, however, that such experiences necessarily preclude a judge from maintaining an \u201copen mind in considering issues that may come before a judge.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Terminology, \u201cImpartiality.\u201d As such, a judge\u2019s average personal experiences do not generally lead to reasonable questions about the judge\u2019s impartiality and subsequent disqualification under Rule 2.12. Rule 2.7 reinforces this conclusion. It provides, \u201cA judge shall hear and decide matters assigned to the judge, except when disqualification is required by Rule 2.12 or other law.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.7. Comment 1 to Rule 2.7 explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">Although there are times when disqualification is necessary to protect the rights of litigants and preserve public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, judges must be available to decide matters that come before the courts. Unwarranted disqualification may bring public disfavor to the court and to the judge personally. The dignity of the court, the judge\u2019s respect for fulfillment of judicial duties, and a proper concern for the burdens that may be imposed upon the judge\u2019s colleagues require that a judge not use disqualification to avoid cases that present difficult, controversial, or unpopular issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANf\">M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.7 cmt. [1]. If a judge\u2019s average personal experiences required disqualification under Rule 2.12, judges would not be \u201cavailable to decide matters that come before the courts.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.7 cmt. [1], Such \u201c[ujnwarranted disqualification\u201d is prohibited by the Code. M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.7 cmt [1].</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b630 The alleged ground for disqualification here, however, is not an average personal experience. Only a few weeks before Peters and Junkermier entered into their stipulated settlement, Judge Huss entered into a stipulated settlement stemming from a lawsuit against him individually. A month before Judge Huss held a hearing to determine the reasonableness of the stipulated settlement at issue here, the OCA \u2014 which acted as an insurer by paying for Judge Huss\u2019s defense \u2014 filed a complaint in which it claimed that Judge Huss\u2019s personal stipulated settlement was unreasonable. In other words, Judge Huss presided over a hearing in which an insurer questioned the reasonableness of a stipulated settlement while the reasonableness of his own personal stipulated settlement was being questioned by his insurer. The timing and nature of the circumstances reasonably raise concerns regarding Judge Huss\u2019s ability to maintain \u201can open mind in considering\u201d the reasonableness of the stipulated settlement at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>here. M. C. Jud. Cond., Terminology, \u201cImpartiality.\u201d Accordingly, Judge Huss\u2019s \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d under Rule 2.12(A). We conclude that, under these circumstances, Judge Huss was required to disclose his participation in his personal stipulated settlement to the parties under Rule 2.12(C) because the circumstances might lead to reasonable questions regarding Judge Huss\u2019s impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b631  Based on the foregoing analysis, we hold that New York Marine did not waive its disqualification claim. We conclude that the presiding judge should have disclosed circumstances that could potentially cause the judge\u2019s impartiality reasonably to be questioned. We decline to determine on appeal, however, whether Judge Huss should have been disqualified for cause. That is a determination that requires findings of fact and conclusions of law following the presentation of evidence \u2014 a matter that may not be addressed in the first instance by an appellate court. Accordingly, we determine that the appropriate course of action is to refer the disqualification issue to a district judge to hear the matter pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA. An order of assignment will follow. The ruling on the disqualification motion may be appealed by either party. Until that process is concluded, it would be premature to consider whether the District Court\u2019s orders and final judgment should be reversed because of the presiding judge\u2019s failure to recuse himself. We decline to address the other issues raised on appeal at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b632 IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the appeal is DISMISSED without prejudice, pending referral to a district judge for hearing New York Marine\u2019s request for disqualification for cause. An appropriate order of assignment will follow in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">DATED this 3rd day of May, 2016.</p>\n<judges id=\"b278-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b278-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH and JUSTICE WHEAT recused themselves from participation in this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\"> On the same day, New York Marine filed a complaint against Junkermier for declaratory relief and breach of contract in the United States District Court for the District of Montana, Great Falls Division.

This case takes us into new territory and I understand the Court\u2019s desire to carefully lay out the procedures to be followed to address the serious charge of judicial impartiality and the manner in which to raise it and test it, including the entry of findings and conclusions after a hearing, and to remand for such a process to be undertaken. However, on the basis of what is the uncontested material evidence that the presiding judge, at the time he was approving a stipulated judgment over the objections of the insurer in this case, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>likewise entering a stipulated judgment in personal litigation at the potential detriment of his insurer, and for which he would similarly seek judicial approval, I would go further. If there were four votes to do so, I would reverse the May 2015 judgment and June 2015 dismissal order entered by the presiding judge and remand this matter for further proceedings before a new judge, who would review and decide New York Marine\u2019s motion for discovery, the stipulated judgment\u2019s reasonableness, and New York Marine\u2019s motion to dismiss Peter\u2019s cross-claims. I see no point in prolonging this litigation to conduct an evidentiary hearing on disqualification, at which the presiding judge, who has now resigned under circumstances related to his stipulated judgment, will be called to opine on these circumstances in testimony, and whose credibility on these matters must inevitably be contested; then for entry of an order, and then for a subsequent appeal from that order <em>(see </em>Opinion, \u00b6 30). In my view, a clear basis for disqualification has already been established and should be ordered to ensure the appearance of, and the public\u2019s confidence in, a fair and impartial judiciary.</p>\n<judges id=\"b279-5\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the concurring Opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b279-6\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"A8V\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"APA\">\u00b634 I agree that this matter should be dismissed without prejudice for a district judge to consider the issue of Judge Huss\u2019s impartiality. In my opinion, however, the Court unnecessarily concludes that Judge Huss was required to disclose his personal settlement. We have not addressed such an issue previously and I would refrain from doing so given the absence of any record or decision of the trial court regarding the specific issue of disclosure or a decision from the Judicial Standards Commission. As a result, I fear the Court has announced a new rule of judicial disclosure concerning the personal and subjective circumstances of a trial judge which ultimately will prove problematic and unmanageable for trial courts given the absence of any factual record supporting, explaining, or substantiating the Court\u2019s reasoning and the multitude of personal situations that potentially could be relevant for disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b635 Indeed, it is not clear what relevance Judge Huss\u2019s failure to disclose has to the issue of disqualification or even whether the matter is more appropriately committed to a disciplinary proceeding. Significantly, a trial judge has many personal experiences which are common to those of the litigants appearing before him. Some experiences, for example a trial judge presiding over a contested parenting proceeding when he is also involved in a contested parenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>proceeding involving his own children, would not appear to require disclosure \u2014 except upon the existence of particularly relevant facts. The Court has deemed disclosure was required because a legal process utilized by Judge Huss was similarly utilized by Peters \u2014 contesting the reasonableness of a stipulated settlement. It would seem at first glance that there would be a sundry of legal proceedings that a trial judge may be involved in personally that would parallel those upon which he was presiding over as trial judge. This is why a decision that Judge Huss was required to disclose must first take place through a fact-finding process in order to clarify the nexus and relevance of the disqualifying circumstances to the issue of the judge\u2019s impartiality. It is axiomatic that such an evidentiary process cannot occur in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b636 With this one exception regarding the rendering of an advisory opinion on judicial disclosure, I agree that this matter should be dismissed for a hearing on the issue of Judge Huss\u2019s impartiality.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
