In early 2013, employees complained to the County Chief Executive Matt Vincent regarding Moe\u2019s job performance and behavior. Vincent and the County Attorney, Eileen Joyce, met with Moe in February 2013 to informally counsel Moe regarding her performance issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b65 In April 2013, Vincent learned that Moe had failed to disclose to him her knowledge of potential wage claims against the County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During that same month, one of Moe\u2019s subordinates filed a productive work environment/workplace harassment complaint against Moe. As a result, Vincent placed Moe on administrative leave in May 2013, pending the outcome of an investigation by an independent consultant. During the investigation Moe was represented by counsel, participated in meetings with Vincent, and provided written responses to the issues being investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b66 The investigation established that the productive work environment/workplace harassment complaint was unsubstantiated. The investigation revealed, however, that other issues were substantiated relating to Moe\u2019s inappropriate conduct and job performance deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b67 Pursuant to the County Charter, the Chief Executive has the power to remove a non-elected department head for just cause with advice and consent of the Council of Commissioners (Council). Following the investigation, Vincent determined that Moe should be terminated and requested a special meeting of the Council to obtain its advice and consent for the termination. Moe was provided with the written documents and reasons for her termination. Vincent met with Moe and her attorney in order to give Moe an opportunity to provide any additional information or documents in response to the investigation results. The Council was given the investigative report, along with the documents Moe submitted in response, for review in advance of the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u00b68 Prior to the meeting, Vincent announced his intention to close the portion of the meeting concerning the reasons for his decision to terminate Moe. Joyce informed Moe that the meeting would be closed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>and that Moe would not be allowed to speak at the meeting. In response, Moe waived her right of privacy and requested that the meeting remain open.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b69 At the beginning of the meeting on October 16, 2013, Vincent, as the presiding officer, declared that he was closing the meeting based on his determination that the privacy rights of County employees, including the employee who had made the workplace harassment complaint and the employees who provided information during the investigation, outweighed the merits of public disclosure. Vincent did not identify the employees with the alleged privacy interests or give those employees an opportunity to waive their privacy interests. Moe and her attorney were allowed to remain at the meeting, but were not allowed to speak.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b610 During the closed portion of the meeting, Vincent and Joyce provided the Council with reasons for Moe\u2019s termination. When the meeting was re-opened the Council granted consent to terminate Moe\u2019s employment. On October 18, 2013, Vincent sent a termination notice to Moe advising her that she was discharged, and included a copy of the County\u2019s grievance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b611 Moe submitted a grievance with the County on November 4,2013. On November 15, 2013, Moe filed a complaint alleging three counts against the County: 1) violation of Montana\u2019s open meeting laws, Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution and \u00a7 2-3-203, MCA; 2) violation of Article II, Section 8 of the Montana Constitution and \u00a7\u00a7 2-3-101 through -114, MCA, relating to the right of citizen participation in government operations; and 3) violation of due process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, claiming a right to recover damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In January 2014, the County denied Moe\u2019s grievance on the ground that she failed to provide a detailed statement of the disputed issues and relevant facts that explain what specific policies and procedures she alleged were violated and the specific remedy she sought through the grievance process. Moe amended her complaint in March 2014, adding a fourth count: 4) violation of the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act, \u00a7\u00a7 39-2-901 through -915, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b612 After the County filed its answer to her amended complaint, Moe moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability on all four counts. The County opposed Moe\u2019s motion and filed its own motion for summary judgment on all counts. During the January 16, 2015 summary judgment hearing, the County introduced a copy of the independent investigator\u2019s fact-finding report relating to Moe\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>termination. The District Court admitted the report provisionally. After the hearing, the court ordered that the report be filed under seal. On May 27,2015, the District Court issued an order granting summary judgment to the County on the first three counts. On the fourth count, the court granted the County\u2019s motion with respect to Moe\u2019s claim that the County violated \u00a7 39-2-904(l)(a) and (c), MCA. The court denied the County\u2019s motion with respect to Moe\u2019s claim that the County violated \u00a7 39-2-904(l)(b), MCA, holding that factual questions remained as to whether the County had good cause for Moe\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b613 Moe moved for certification of the summary judgment order as final pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b). The District Court granted Rule 54(b) certification on June 30, 2015. Noting that the County did not oppose Moe\u2019s motion for certification, we determined that the District Court\u2019s certification order satisfied the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 54(b) and M. R. App. (6)(6). Moe <em>v. Butte-Silver Bow Cnty., </em>DA 15-0400, Or. (Mont. July 14, 2015). Both parties appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b614 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment. <em>Pilgeram v. GreenPoint Mortg. Funding, Inc., </em>2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Anderson v. BNSF Ry., </em>2015 MT 240, \u00b6 15, 380 Mont. 319, 354 P.3d 1248. Conclusory statements, speculative assertions, and mere denials are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. <em>Davis v. State, </em>2015 MT 264, \u00b6 7, 381 Mont. 59, 357 P.3d 320. All reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the offered evidence should be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment; however, summary judgment cannot be defeated by unsupported speculation. <em>Baumgart v. State, </em>2014 MT 194, \u00b6 14, 376 Mont. 1, 332 P.3d 225. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct and its findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Pilgeram, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">\u00b615 <em>1. Whether the County is entitled to summary judgment on Moe\u2019s claim that it violated Montana\u2019s open meeting laws.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">\u00b616 Moe claims that the decision to close a portion of the special meeting violated Montana\u2019s open meeting laws because the County failed to follow proper procedures in determining whether the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>privacy interests of the other employees outweighed the merits of public disclosure. Moe argues that the employees who had alleged privacy interests were \u201cnot even identified\u201d and that there was \u201cno analysis of what [the] alleged privacy rights were.\u201d Moe emphasizes that she had waived her privacy rights and that the other employees were not given the same opportunity. Moe argues that Vincent made a \u201cblanket determination\u201d that simply because other employees were involved \u201cthey automatically had privacy interests that prevented any public discussion of any aspect of the investigation.\u201d According to Moe, \u201c[s]uch an unprecedented rule would gut the Open Meeting Laws.\u201d As a result, Moe contends that the County should have identified the other employees, stated why their privacy rights outweighed the merits of public disclosure, and then given them a chance to waive those privacy rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b617 In any event, Moe argues, the other employees\u2019 protected privacy interests were not implicated because none of their personnel records were discussed at the meeting. According to Moe, \u201c[a]t most, employee(s) accusations against Moe could have been discussed, and these are not protected by a privacy right except that of [Moe].\u201d In addition, Moe argues that the District Court improperly based its decision on the idea that public disclosure of workplace harassment and retaliation complaints may discourage employees from pursuing such complaints. This idea, according to Moe, is at odds with the law because \u201cthe only consideration that can defeat the public\u2019s right to know is the other constitutional right of individual privacy.\u201d Moe claims that the District Court\u2019s holding erroneously makes it so the right to anonymously complain is superior to the constitutional right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b618 Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution establishes the public right to know:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">This provision is implemented by \u00a7\u00a7 2-3-201 through -221, MCA. Section 2-3-203, MCA, provides, \u201cThe presiding officer of any meeting may close the meeting during the time the discussion relates to a matter of individual privacy and then if and only if the presiding officer determines that the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.\u201d Section 2-3-203(3), MCA. The Montana Constitution establishes the right to privacy in Article II, Section 10: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\u201cThe right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.\u201d The competing interests of the right to privacy and the right to know \u201cmust be balanced in the context of the facts of each case, to determine whether the demands of individual privacy exceed the merits of public disclosure.\u201d <em>Billings Gazette v. City of Billings, </em>2013 MT 334, \u00b6 14, 372 Mont. 409, 313 P.3d 129 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b619 In conducting this balancing test, courts must first consider whether the individual(s) whose privacy rights are at issue has \u201ca subjective or actual expectation of privacy, and if so whether society should recognize that the expectation is reasonable.\u201d <em>Missoula Cnty. Pub. Schs. v. Bitterroot Star, </em>2015 MT 95, \u00b6 11, 378 Mont. 451, 345 P.3d 1035. \u201cActual expectation of privacy is necessarily a question of fact that requires a determination of whether the individual whose privacy is at issue had notice of possible disclosure.\u201d <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 18. Whether society is willing to recognize a privacy expectation as reasonable is a question of law that requires consideration of \u201call relevant circumstances, including the nature of the information sought.\u201d <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21,26. It is reasonable for an employee to expect that matters communicated in private by the employee to his or her employer normally would be kept confidential. <em>Mont. Human Rights Div. v. Billings, </em>199 Mont. 434, 442, 649 P.2d 1283, 1287-88 (1982). Public disclosure of certain employee information \u201ccould impede candid communication between employer and employee.\u201d <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b620  The District Court concluded that the employees who initiated the workplace harassment complaints against Moe had individual privacy interests that society is willing to recognize as reasonable. We agree. First, the employees who initiated the complaints against Moe had an actual expectation of privacy. The County\u2019s Productive Work Environment/Harassment Prevention Policy (Policy 134) states, \u201cA report filed under this Policy, its investigation, the outcome of the investigation, and any action(s) taken relating to a specific employee or employees is confidential.\u201d Thus, the employees who initiated the complaints against Moe and cooperated in the investigation did not have \u201cnotice of possible disclosure\u201d and therefore had an actual expectation of privacy based on Policy 134. <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b621 In addition, the County employees\u2019 actual expectations of privacy are ones that society is willing to recognize as reasonable. The District Court determined that public disclosure of workplace harassment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>retaliation complaints may discourage employees from pursuing such complaints. This determination is consistent with our recognition of such privacy interests and our conclusions that society is willing to recognize those privacy interests as reasonable. In <em>Montana Human Rights Division, </em>we held that employees had a reasonable expectation that information contained in their employment records would not be divulged \u201cin an investigation or during a public hearing in which the employee is only remotely involved.\u201d <em>Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>199 Mont. at 443, 649 P.2d at 1288. In <em>Billings Gazette, </em>we undertook a lengthy review of our prior decisions relating to the reasonableness of public employees\u2019 expectations of privacy when balanced against the public\u2019s right know. <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-40. We observed that employees reasonably would expect that their communications to the employer regarding workplace misconduct \u201cnormally would be kept confidential.\u201d <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 47 (quoting <em>Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>199 Mont. at 442, 649 P.2d at 1288) (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also Bozeman Daily Chronicle v. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>260 Mont. 218, 228, 859 P.2d 435, 441 (1993) (holding that an accuser and witnesses to an alleged incident have a subjective privacy interest which society is willing to recognize as reasonable in an investigation focused on the accused). Here, because the evidence supporting Vincent\u2019s decision to terminate Moe was based in significant part on information that had come from other County employees who were only \u201cremotely involved\u201d in the reason for convening the October 16, 2013 Council meeting, those employees had a reasonable expectation that their communications would not be made public. <em>Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>199 Mont. at 443, 649 P.2d at 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b622 Having found that the employees had reasonable expectations of privacy, we must balance the employees\u2019 right to privacy against the merits of public disclosure. Moe argues that the public is entitled to know why Vincent and Joyce believed that Moe was inadequate in her working relationship with Vincent, and that the public has an interest in \u201cdiscussion about the Fox Lawson [P]ay [P]lan study and a possible lawsuit that could have arisen from it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u00b623 Moe\u2019s arguments are unpersuasive. In <em>Billings Gazette, </em>the newspaper sought disclosure of documents detailing the investigation and discipline of Billings City employees due to inappropriate computer usage. <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 1. We concluded that the employees\u2019 \u201creasonable expectation of privacy in their identities with regards to internal disciplinary proceedings clearly outweighs the merits of public disclosure,\u201d and that although the information \u201cmay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>make interesting or sensational news copy,\u201d \u201cpublic disclosure is not in the public interest.\u201d <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 59. We noted that \u201c[p]ublic knowledge of the names of the individuals disciplined will not provide the public with any greater opportunity to participate in the internal employment decisions of the City.\u201d <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b624  For similar reasons, we conclude that the privacy interests of County employees with regard to the internal complaint reporting and investigation in this case outweigh the merits of public disclosure. The public, via news reporting outlets, already had received information regarding Moe\u2019s administrative leave and pending investigation. Contrary to Moe\u2019s contention, the Council meeting did not involve discussion of the substance of the Fox Lawson Pay Plan or potential litigation. Rather, the closed portion of the meeting concerned Vincent\u2019s reasons for terminating Moe, based in part on information that employees provided during an investigation that they had been led to believe was confidential. We have observed that \u201cgeneral assertions that public disclosure will foster public confidence in public institutions and maintain accountability for public officers are not sufficient to establish a strong public interest.\u201d <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 56 (citing <em>Missoulian v. Bd. of Regents of Higher Educ., </em>207 Mont. 513, 532, 675 P.2d 962, 972 (1984)). The portion of the meeting during which the Council voted to give consent to Vincent\u2019s termination decision was open to the public. Public knowledge of the information gathered from other County employees during a personnel investigation would undermine the County\u2019s interest as an employer in encouraging candor and willingness of its employees to bring legitimate complaints to the County\u2019s Chief Executive. As we recognized in <em>Missoulian </em>and <em>Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>the promotion of candid communication between an employer and its employees is good public policy. <em>Missoulian, </em>207 Mont. at 533, 675 P.2d at 973; <em>Mont. Human Rights Div., </em>199 Mont. at 442-43, 649 P.2d at 1287-88. Protecting the confidentiality of such communications helps to encourage employees not to remain silent during internal investigations of workplace problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u00b625  Further, the termination decision was premised in large part upon a multi-faceted investigation comprising interviews with numerous County employees other than Moe. The Council was provided with the investigation report, documenting workplace issues involving employees of Moe\u2019s department and other County employees; that report and Moe\u2019s responses to its findings were to be discussed at the meeting. The report disclosed the identity of the employees interviewed, which would be evident in any discussion about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>issues. Therefore, it was not inappropriate for Vincent to close that discussion to the public rather than to require him to repeatedly open and close the meeting as particular elements of the investigation may have come up during the discussion. We conclude that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment in the County\u2019s favor with respect to Moe\u2019s claim that the County violated Montana\u2019s open meeting laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b626 <em>2. Whether the County is entitled to summary judgment on Moe\u2019s claim that it violated Montana\u2019s public participation laws.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u00b627 Section 2-3-103, MCA, provides that \u201c[e]ach agency shall develop procedures for permitting and encouraging the public to participate in agency decisions that are of significant interest to the public.\u201d Section 2-3-103(1)(a), MCA. Before an agency takes final action on an issue that is of significant interest to the public, the agency must follow procedures to ensure adequate notice and assist public participation. Section 2-3-103(1)(a), MCA. \u201cProcedures for assisting public participation must include a method of affording interested persons reasonable opportunity to submit data, views, or arguments, orally or in written form, prior to making a final decision that is of significant interest to the public.\u201d Section 2-3-111(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u00b628 In <em>Jones v. County of Missoula, </em>2006 MT 2, 330 Mont. 205, 127 P.3d 406, we adopted the Attorney General\u2019s definition of the term \u201csignificant public interest\u201d as \u201cany non-ministerial decision or action of a county commission which has meaning to or affects a portion of the community.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 16 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A ministerial act is one \u201cperformed pursuant to legal authority, and requiring no exercise of judgment.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 16. Public participation procedures are required when a final decision is made. Sections 2-3-103, -111, MCA. <em>See Jones, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9,22 (holding that a county commission meeting where the county made the decision to allow dependent coverage to domestic partners of county employees was of significant public interest). Non-ministerial decisions that directly affect more than one person may be considered of significant public interest. <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 22 (holding that a county\u2019s decision to make dependent health care coverage available to domestic partners was of significant public interest even though it affected only county employees).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\u00b629 In <em>Jones, </em>we also acknowledged that the topic at issue was of interest to the public at large because of state and nation-wide media coverage relating to gay and lesbian rights. <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 19. We noted that the hearing on proposed legislation that included a provision for extending group insurance to domestic partners of state employees in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>civil unions \u201cbrought hundreds of opponents to the Capitol.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 21 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u00b630 Moe argues that her termination was of significant interest to the Butte public. Moe points to newspaper articles concerning her termination to \u201cshow the degree of public interest in [the] matter.\u201d As such, Moe contends that the County was required under \u00a7\u00a7 2-3-103 and -111, MCA, to open the special meeting so that any member of the public could have the opportunity to give input to the Council. Moe points out that \u201c[t]he right of public participation is available to all citizens, and not only to those who may be the subject of the decision in question.\u201d Moe acknowledges that if the discussion veered into an area where the right of privacy outweighed the merits of public disclosure, then that portion could have been closed to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b631 The County argues that it did not violate Montana\u2019s public participation laws in relation to Moe\u2019s termination because the Council\u2019s decision to give advice and consent to Vincent only affected Vincent\u2019s ability to fulfill the County Charter\u2019s requirement to obtain advice and consent for his decision. The County argues that the advice and consent of the Council is not part of an employee\u2019s pre-termination due process, which concludes with the Chief Executive\u2019s termination decision. According to the County, employees are not afforded hearings to plead their case before the Council because an advice and consent meeting is \u201cmerely a mechanism for the Council to confirm that the Chief Executive followed the proper process in making his/her decision to appoint or terminate a non-elected department head.\u201d Therefore, according to the County, the Council\u2019s decision is not a matter of significant interest to the public requiring public participation because \u201cit does not have meaning to or affect a portion of the community.\u201d \u00b632 The District Court concluded that while the special meeting was non-ministerial, the Council\u2019s actions did not significantly affect the community as whole because its decision to give advice and consent affected Vincent\u2019s ability to terminate Moe \u201cand nothing more.\u201d The District Court determined that the only direct impact of the Council\u2019s decision was on Vincent and Moe. The court noted that although the public was not afforded the right to participate in this matter, Moe was given \u201cample opportunity\u201d prior to the meeting to participate in the investigation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b633  We agree with the District Court. The special meeting was not \u201cof significant interest to the public,\u201d \u00a7 2-3-103(1)(a), MCA, because it did not have \u201cmeaning to or affect[ ] a portion of the community,\u201d <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 16. As the County\u2019s Chief Executive, Vincent had the authority, pursuant to the County Charter, to terminate a non-elected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>department head after the conclusion of the pre-termination process. During the pre-termination process, Moe had the opportunity to present evidence to Vincent and meet with him. The Council\u2019s special meeting confirmed that Vincent followed the proper steps, and it consented to his termination decision. Unlike <em>Jones, </em>the Council\u2019s decision did not directly affect anyone except Moe and Vincent. While news media reported Moe\u2019s termination, such coverage does not establish by itself that the closed portion of the special meeting was of significant interest to the public. The meeting involved a personnel decision affecting one County employee, and it was not the Council\u2019s function at that meeting to determine whether Moe would be discharged. Moreover, Moe\u2019s assertion that that she lacked the opportunity to participate in her pre-termination processes is without merit. The record makes clear that Moe actively participated in responding to the fact-finding investigation and provided her own arguments and evidence in rebuttal. Accordingly, the District Court correctly concluded that the County did not violate Montana\u2019s public participation laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b634 <em>3.

Moe further contends that the Council was given an \u201cerroneous impression\u201d as to what its role should be because, according to Moe, it was told that it \u201chad no independent obligation to determine if it should give its advice and consent that [she] should be removed for just cause, contrary to the plain language of [Art. IV, Section 4.02(d) of the County Charter].\u201d \u00b636 The County argues that Moe confuses the advice and consent process under the County Charter with the due process requirements for the Chief Executive\u2019s termination decision. According to the County, Vincent afforded Moe extensive pre-termination processes. The County argues that Moe was not entitled to address the Council because it was not making the decision whether she should be terminated but rather \u201cwas simply asked to confirm\u201d Vincent\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u00b637 The District Court concluded that Moe had a protected property interest in her continued employment based on Art. IV, Section 4.02 of the County Charter, which provides that the Chief Executive cannot terminate a non-elected department head until the Chief Executive has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>demonstrated good cause for doing so. The court concluded, however, that the County did not deprive Moe of her pre-termination due process rights. The District Court found that Moe fully participated in the pretermination investigation, based on the following undisputed facts: Moe provided written and verbal responses to Vincent concerning her alleged policy violations and performance deficiencies; Moe received the independent investigator\u2019s report and submitted a multiple-page written response; Moe received a detailed explanation of the policy violations and substantiated performance deficiencies; and Moe met with Vincent to provide him with any additional verbal and written information he should take into consideration before making a final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b638 Title 42, United States Code Section 1983 provides a cause of action for persons deprived of constitutional rights by another person acting under color of state law. <em>Mysse v. Martens, </em>279 Mont. 253, 260, 926 P.2d 765, 769 (1996). Persons who have been deprived of due process by government agents in the termination of employment may be entitled to relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 if they have a property interest in their employment. <em>Hunter v. City of Great Falls, </em>2002 MT 331, \u00b6 23, 313 Mont. 231, 61 P.3d 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b639 We have held that when a government employer has, by administrative regulation, limited its ability to terminate an employee without just cause, employees subject to that scheme have a property interest in their continued employment, which is protected by due process. <em>Boreen v. Christensen, </em>267 Mont. 405, 416, 884 P.2d 761, 767 (1994). In this context, due process requires \u201coral or written notice to the employee with an explanation of the employer\u2019s evidence and the opportunity for the employee to respond in \u2018something less\u2019 than a full evidentiary hearing <em>before </em>termination coupled with a full post-termination hearing \u2018at a meaningful time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boreen, </em>267 Mont. at 410, 884 P.2d at 764 (citing <em>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 545, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 1496 (1985)) (emphasis in original). \u201c[T]he pretermination hearing need not definitively resolve the propriety of the discharge. It should be an initial check against mistaken decisions \u2014 essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.\u201d <em>Boreen, </em>267 Mont. at 410-11, 884 P.2d at 764 (citing <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. at 545-46, 105 S. Ct. at 1496).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u00b640 Our review of the record convinces us that the District Court correctly applied the law in ruling that Moe\u2019s due process rights were protected. We agree that, pursuant to Art. IV, Section 4.02 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>County Charter, Moe had a protected property interest in her continued employment. That right, however, was not absolute and Moe could be terminated for good cause with due process and with the Council\u2019s advice and consent. Moe does not contend that her post-termination due process rights were violated. As the decision to terminate is vested in the Chief Executive, due process did not require that Moe\u2019s pre-termination opportunity to respond occur in the Council meeting. Moe\u2019s assertion that the Council was \u201cmisinformed\u201d as to what \u201cadvice and consent\u201d actually meant is without merit. Art. IV, Section 4.02(d) does not impose an \u201cindependent obligation\u201d on the Council to determine whether termination was proper. Moe provides no other relevant evidence or authority to support her contention.</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">\u00b641  As the District Court noted, the undisputed facts establish that Moe fully participated in the pre-termination process. The opportunities afforded Moe to participate in the pre-termination process, of which she fully availed herself, meet the required due process standard. Moe received a copy of the independent investigator\u2019s report, she responded to the report, and she and her attorney met with Vincent on September 18, 2013, to present her arguments as to whether there were \u201creasonable grounds to believe that charges against her [were] true and supported] the proposed action.\u201d <em>Boreen, </em>267 Mont. 405 at 410-11, 884 P.2d at 764. The undisputed facts establish that Moe received \u201coral or written notice with an explanation of the employer\u2019s evidence\u201d and had the opportunity to respond in \u201csomething less\u201d than a full evidentiary hearing before her termination. <em>Boreen, </em>267 Mont. at 410, 884 P.2d at 764. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment in the County\u2019s favor with respect to Moe\u2019s claim that the County violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u00b642 <em>4.

Moe contends that her discharge was wrongful under all three grounds set forth in \u00a7 39-2-904(1), MCA. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>District Court granted summary judgment against Moe with respect to her claims under \u00a7 39-2-904(l)(a) and (c), MCA. Moe agrees that there are no genuine issues of fact but argues that the court should have granted her \u2014 rather than the County \u2014 judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b644 Moe argues that her discharge was wrongful under \u00a7 39-2-904(l)(a), MCA, because her termination was \u201cin violation of the Montana Wrongful Discharge and Public Participation laws\u201d and thus in violation of public policy. Moe contends that her discharge was wrongful under \u00a7 39-2-904(l)(c), MCA, because the County violated three of its written policies \u2014 Article IV, Section 4.02(d)(1) of the County Charter, and two sections of the County\u2019s Code of Ethics, entitled \u201cPublic participation\u201d and \u201cOpen Meetings.\u201d As discussed, Art. IV, Section 4.02(d)(1) enables the Chief Executive to remove non-elected department heads for just cause with the advice and consent of the Council. Moe claims that, \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d the Council did not \u201ctruly\u201d give effective \u201cadvice and consent\u201d because its action \u201cwas taken in violation of Montana\u2019s Open Meeting and Public Participation laws,\u201d and because the Council was misinformed as to what \u201cadvice and consent\u201d actually meant. Moe contends that the County violated the Code of Ethics provisions based on the same arguments she raises under Issues 1 and 2 above relating to open meetings and public participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b645 In regard to \u00a7 39-2-904(l)(a), MCA, the County argues that Moe\u2019s contentions are insufficient to form the basis of a claim because Montana\u2019s open meeting and public participation laws do not constitute \u201cpublic policies\u201d as defined under the Wrongful Discharge Act. Concerning \u00a7 39-2-904(l)(c), MCA, the County argues that neither the County Charter nor its Code of Ethics ordinances constitute personnel policies under the Wrongful Discharge Act. In any event, according to the County, Moe cannot show that any alleged violations of the County\u2019s personnel policies caused her termination. The County claims that in the absence of a causal link between the alleged violations and her termination, Moe\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b646 Based on its rejection of Moe\u2019s open meeting, public participation, and due process claims, the District Court determined that the County did not wrongfully discharge Moe by virtue of violating either its own personnel policies or public policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">\u00b647 With respect to Moe\u2019s claims under \u00a7 39-2-904(l)(c), MCA, we have determined already that the County did not violate Montana\u2019s open meeting or public participation laws and that the County\u2019s termination procedures did not violate Moe\u2019s rights to due process. Accordingly, her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>claims that the County violated its Charter or Code of Ethics provisions do not substantiate a claim for wrongful discharge under \u00a7 39-2-904(1)(c), MCA. Because Moe\u2019s wrongful discharge claim under \u00a7 39-2-904(1)(c), MCA, fails, it cannot serve as the basis for her claim that the County violated public policy under \u00a7 39-2-904(1)(a), MCA. Moreover, Moe\u2019s arguments with respect to \u00a7 39-2-904(1)(a), MCA, do not correspond with the language of the statute. Moe argues that her termination was in violation of public policy, but she provides no argument or evidence that her discharge was in \u201cretaliation\u201d for her \u201crefusal to violate public policy\u201d or \u201cfor reporting a violation of public policy.\u201d Section 39-2-904(l)(a), MCA.

The County claims that it terminated Moe\u2019s employment based on her failure to perform her job duties, disruption of County operations, and \u201cother legitimate business reasons.\u201d The County points to employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>complaints regarding Moe\u2019s job performance and behavior, Moe\u2019s unresponsiveness to Vincent\u2019s requests for further communication, Moe\u2019s failure to inform Vincent of potential wage claims \u2014 including one in which Moe stood to gain the most significant financial benefit \u2014 and Moe\u2019s participation in a conference call in her County office during working hours with an attorney who was representing the employees pursuing potential wage claims against the County. Moe\u2019s conduct, according to the County, constituted a violation of the duty of public trust and \u201cundermined [Vincent\u2019s] confidence in her ability to faithfully serve as a member of [the County\u2019s] management team.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b652 Moe counters that whether she had satisfactorily performed her job duties \u201cis a factual question that cannot be decided by summary judgment.\u201d Moe asserts that her two summary judgment affidavits \u201caver many discrete facts that are in contradiction to the summary judgment affidavits submitted by [the County].\u201d Moe argues further that her discharge was pretextual because \u201cVincent wanted to discharge [Moe] in order to discourage any litigation concerning the Fox Lawson compensation plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b653 The District Court concluded that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to \u201cwhether Vincent\u2019s decision to terminate [Moe\u2019s] employment was pretextual and not for good cause.\u201d The court explained that Moe and the County had different characterizations of the evidence in regard to a number of Vincent\u2019s accusations. The court concluded that \u201ca properly instructed jury could conclude that [Moe] did in fact satisfactorily performl ] her job duties and did not disrupt [County] operations. A jury could also conclude to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\u00b654 Based on our review of the record, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion. We recognize that because Moe occupied a managerial position, Vincent had broad discretion to decide whether to keep Moe in employment. <em>Baumgart, </em>\u00b6 39, <em>Sullivan v.

Employers have the broadest discretion when dealing with managerial employees. <em>Baumgart, </em>\u00b6 39. \u201cWe afford employers the greatest discretion where an employee occupies a \u2018sensitive\u2019 managerial position and exercises \u201cbroad discretion\u2019 in [her] job duties.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"A0-\">\u00b655 In <em>Baumgart, </em>the Department of Commerce presented direct evidence that Baumgart, the former administrator of the Department\u2019s Tourism and Promotion Division failed to appropriately manage her budget for five consecutive years, placing the Division \u201cin the precarious position of having more than $4 million in extremely valuable funds swept out of her budget and into the general fund.\u201d <em>Baumgart, </em>\u00b6 36. We upheld summary judgment in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>employer because Baumgart could not \u201crefute the existence of the budget problem or her admissions that she did not understand the Division\u2019s budget.\u201d <em>Baumgart, </em>\u00b6 36. Moreover, we concluded that \u201cBaumgart failed to present <em>any </em>evidence of other underlying reasons for her termination, aside from her unsupported allegations of political motivation for both the political discrimination and wrongful discharge claims.\u201d <em>Baumgart, </em>\u00b6 37 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b656 In <em>Sullivan, </em>Continental Construction terminated Sullivan because it believed that \u201cSullivan had failed to fulfill the requirements of his managerial position and had failed to act in a trustworthy manner\u201d by \u201ctreating employees and subcontractors in a demeaning manner\u201d; \u201chaving frequent unexplained absences from work\u201d; \u201cspeaking to others in a derogatory manner about customers and employees\u201d; and \u201cbehaving in a manner that did not meet the standards of Continental Construction.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12, 25. Sullivan argued that he raised genuine issues of material fact to suggest that his employer lacked good cause to terminate his employment. <em>Sullivan, </em>\u00b6 26. To support this assertion, Sullivan pointed to statements made by other employees who indicated that Sullivan \u201chad not acted inappropriately in their presence.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>\u00b6 26. He also argued that he \u201cregularly had invited his employees over to his house for dinner and recently organized a group golf trip for his employees.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>\u00b6 26. We concluded that Sullivan failed to present material and substantial evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Continental Construction had good cause to terminate him. We noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">The fact that not every Continental Construction employee complained about Sullivan failed to undermine the validity of Continental Construction\u2019s conclusion that Sullivan\u2019s continued employment could threaten its future viability in Montana. Similarly, the fact that Sullivan apparently treated some employees well does not challenge the validity of the complaints made by other Continental Construction employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\"><em>Sullivan, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b657 An employer\u2019s broad discretion in handling managerial employees is not absolute. In <em>Guertin v. Moody\u2019s Market, </em>265 Mont. 61, 874 P.2d 710 (1994), we held that where a managerial employee testified that she was a hardworking and loyal employee and had not received previous complaints from her employer about her management capability, and where she explained why she believed that the reasons given by her employer for her termination were factually incorrect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>there was an issue of fact regarding whether she was terminated for good cause. <em>Guertin, </em>265 Mont. at 69, 874 P.2d at 715. In <em>Howard v. Conlin Furniture No. 2, </em>272 Mont. 433, 901 P.2d 116 (1995), Howard\u2019s direct supervisor testified regarding several events that demonstrated Howard\u2019s unsatisfactory performance of his job duties as a furniture store manager. <em>Howard, </em>272 Mont. at 439-40, 901 P.2d at 120. Howard responded by deposition to the allegations against him, denying each allegation with specific claims and counterclaims. <em>Howard, </em>272 Mont. at 440, 901 P.2d at 120. We concluded that Howard\u2019s \u201cclaims, denials, and counterclaims raise a factual issue as to whether Howard was terminated for good cause within the meaning of \u00a7 39-2-903(5), MCA, of the Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>272 Mont. at 440, 901 P.2d at 120. Because of the factual issues raised by Howard\u2019s detailed responses, we concluded that \u201creasonable persons could differ regarding inferences to be drawn from the deposition testimony and exhibits.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>272 Mont. at 440, 901 P.2d at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"ApO\">\u00b658 This case is more akin to <em>Guertin </em>and <em>Howard </em>than it is to <em>Baumgart </em>and <em>Sullivan. </em>Moe has raised sufficient factual disputes that would support a conclusion that the reason for her discharge was not \u201cgood cause\u201d in and of itself or that the given reason was \u201ca pretext and not the honest reason for the discharge.\u201d <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b659 Similar to <em>Guertin, </em>in her response to her termination letter, Moe stated that she \u201cworked hard for [the County] and [had] never before been disciplined.\u201d In her response to the fact-finding investigative report, Moe explained why she believed that the reasons given by the County for her termination were incorrect. The majority of the County\u2019s allegations against Moe stem from the fact-finding investigative report. Similar to <em>Howard, </em>Moe submitted a detailed written response to the report in which she took issue with nearly all of the allegations against her. For example, with respect to the allegations that Moe failed to maintain a close cooperative working relationship with Vincent, Moe disputed that Vincent advised her at the February 8, 2013 meeting that he expected better communication from her. Moe contends that the \u201conly reference to poor communication\u201d during that meeting was in regard to an allegation from a Mr. McCarthy faulting her for a delay in direct deposits. Moe alleges that she \u201cwas able to show that the direct deposit problem was not due to [her delay], but because there was a new HR/Payroll system and a payroll clerk had not appropriately filled in an effective entry date field.\u201d In addition, while Moe does not dispute that she did not advise Vincent of the potential pay plan litigation between April 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>and April 22,2013, she maintains that Vincent had knowledge already of the potential liability and that she had kept him informed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">Vincent was notified immediately upon taking office that the pay plan was and continues to be a liability for [the County]. The concern and awareness of liability was acknowledged by Ms. J oyce who stated in one of our January meetings to Mr. Vincent that \u201cyes the pay plan is another big liability we have but we can talk about that another day, ha ha.\u201d All parties were aware that failure to follow the pay plan adopted by the council created the potential for liability. Mr. Amerman and I had several meetings with Mr. Vincent since January up until the time I was placed on leave advising and educating him on the pay plan and discussing our concerns if we do not get this pay plan back on track and moving forward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b660 With respect to the allegation that Moe\u2019s phone conversation with an attorney during working hours was inappropriate, Moe claims that her staff asked her to speak with the attorney and that she did so for \u201cabout two minutes\u201d only \u201cto confirm\u201d that retaliation against staff because of the lawsuit would be illegal. In her response to the investigative report, however, Moe also claims that \u201c[flor personal business I have a First Amendment right to talk with anyone I want.\u201d In light of these somewhat conflicting statements in the record, it is unclear whether Moe\u2019s conversation with the attorney was for personal reasons or in her capacity as the County\u2019s Human Resources Director. It is clear, however, that Moe disputes the allegation that the conversation was inappropriate. Moe disputes also the allegations that she lacked comprehensive knowledge of public sector practices and procedures regarding the Fox Lawson Pay Plan and that she jeopardized County employment practices and liability insurance by failing to implement required policy changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b661 Unlike <em>Baumgart, </em>Moe refutes the existence of persistent problems in her department and never acknowledged a lack of understanding of any job duty or responsibility. Furthermore, where Baumgart failed to correct her mistakes for five consecutive years, Moe alleges that she was terminated before she had time to rectify the mistakes perceived by Vincent. In particular, Moe denies that Vincent gave her a directive at the February 8, 2013 meeting to improve communication. She claims that the specific issues he and Joyce brought up at the February 8, 2013 meeting were not substantiated and that she \u201cwas able to rebut all of those allegations.\u201d Moe explains that from January up until the time she was placed on leave, she had several meetings with Vincent and Mr. Amerman regarding concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>about the Fox Lawson Pay Plan. Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Moe, <em>Baumgart, </em>\u00b6 14, the first time that she became aware of Vincent\u2019s concerns with her communication methods was on April 22, 2013, when Vincent asked Moe about the potential pay plan litigation. Moe was placed on administrative leave on May 3,2013 \u2014 less than two weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b662 Different from <em>Sullivan, </em>where Sullivan relied on vague statements from other employees and immaterial information about his conduct with other employees outside the workplace, Moe has presented exhaustive responses to the allegations against her, including a four-page letter responding to her termination letter and a nine-page written response to the investigative report. The Court\u2019s only inquiry in reviewing a summary judgment order is to determine whether the evidence establishes a genuine issue of material fact. M. R. Civ. P. <em>56(c)(3); Anderson, </em>\u00b6 15. Moe\u2019s responses potentially could be viewed by a jury to \u201cchallenge the validity\u201d of the County\u2019s conclusion that she undermined Vincent\u2019s confidence in her ability to serve as a member of the County\u2019s management team. <em>Sullivan, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b663 In contrast to <em>Davis, </em>we are unable to conclude that the facts that are undisputed are sufficient to establish good cause. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 14. We conclude that \u201creasonable persons could differ regarding inferences to be drawn\u201d from the fact-finding investigative report and Moe\u2019s responses to the allegations against her. <em>Howard, </em>272 Mont. at 440, 901 P.2d at 121. The evidence Moe presents to support her disputes of the material facts are more than \u201cconclusory statements, speculative assertions, or mere denials,\u201d <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 7, and are thus sufficient to defeat the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In light of these genuine issues of fact, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of summary judgment to the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u00b664 For the foregoing reasons we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in the County\u2019s favor with respect to Issues 1, 2, 3, and 4. We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of summary judgment to the County on Issue 5 and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b341-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\"> The potential wage claims arose from provisions in the County\u2019s employee compensation plans derived from a classification and compensation study by Fox Lawson and Associates, a Minnesota-based compensation consulting firm. The parties refer to the plan as the \u201cFox Lawson Pay Plan\u201d and we will do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
