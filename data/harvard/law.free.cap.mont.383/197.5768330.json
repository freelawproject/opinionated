J., and allows Stevi to relocate to Vermont with C.J. Matthew alleges several errors in the District Court\u2019s parenting determination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\u00b62 Matthew and Stevi first met in or about 2004 and, although they had an \"on and off\u2019 relationship for several years, the parties never lived together. C.J. was born in August 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">\u00b63 At the time of the District Court proceedings, Stevi resided in Belgrade, Montana, with C.J., her husband Tom, and the couple\u2019s minor child. She has a degree in early childhood education and had been employed by Head Start in Bozeman since 2007. Stevi began her Head Start employment as an assistant teacher and eventually progressed to serve as both the site supervisor and the technology manager. In July 2015, she was offered a job as the Children\u2019s Service Manager for a Head Start program in Newport, Vermont.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">\u00b64 Matthew resides in Livingston with his domestic partner, who was pregnant with his child at the time of the final parenting plan hearing. Matthew has a daughter, P.J., from a previous relationship. He has part-time custody of P. J. Matthew served in the armed forces, worked as a police officer, and at the time of the hearing was working on a ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">\u00b65 Although the parties dispute whether Matthew was given an opportunity to spend time with C.J. during the first fifteen months of his life, it is undisputed that Matthew saw C.J. only once during that time period. Stevi testified that Matthew did not provide her with any financial assistance during that time; Matthew did not offer any evidence to the contrary. In July 2014, the District Court ordered Matthew to pay $156 per month in child support. A Child Support Enforcement Division debt computation worksheet admitted at the hearing showed that Matthew was current on child support payments as of June 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">\u00b66 Prior to C.J.\u2019s birth, Matthew sent Stevi an email stating that \u201ca paternity test will be required\u201d because he questioned whether or not he was C.J.\u2019s father. After C.J.\u2019s birth, Matthew continued to contest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>paternity before eventually filing a paternity action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Approximately six months after the court ordered paternity testing, Matthew took a paternity test. It confirmed that he was C.J.\u2019s father. On June 14, 2013, after receiving the paternity test results, Matthew filed a petition for establishment of an interim parenting plan. While Matthew\u2019s petition was pending, he and Stevi arranged for supervised visits between himself and C.J at Hearts &amp; Homes in Bozeman. Stevi stopped the arrangement after three visits because she felt C.J. was demonstrating \u201cvery distressed behavior\u201d during the visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b67 The District Court held a hearing on Matthew\u2019s petition for an interim parenting plan on February 3,2014. Following the hearing, the parties attempted to reconcile their relationship and arranged parenting time on their own. The parties\u2019 attempt at reconciliation eventually failed and, in May 2014, Matthew filed a petition for an \u201cemergency de facto\u201d parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u00b68 In July 2014, the District Court issued an order that allowed Matthew two visits per week with C.J. and required both parties to attend counseling sessions. The court also appointed counselor Chantelle Plauche to assist in reunifying Matthew and C.J. The order required the parties to follow Plauche\u2019s \u201crecommendations for improving the relationship and parental contact between Matthew and [C.J.].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u00b69 Plauche worked with the parties for a year and testified that Matthew\u2019s relationship with C.J. improved. Due to the improving relationship, Plauche recommended a number of times that Matthew incrementally increase his parenting time with C.J., and Matthew\u2019s parenting time did increase. Plauche eventually recommended that Matthew be allowed to have C.J. for three days and two nights in a row per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\u00b610 On July 14, 2015, Stevi filed a proposed final parenting plan and a notice of intent to relocate. Her proposed plan called for C.J. to reside with her in Vermont during the school year and with Matthew in Livingston during the summer. Matthew also filed a proposed parenting plan in which C.J. would live with him during the school year and with Stevi in Vermont during the summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">\u00b611 On August 18, 2015, the District Court held a hearing on Stevi\u2019s notice of intent to relocate and the parties\u2019 respective parenting plans. Stevi, Matthew, and Plauche testified at the hearing. Matthew also called Katherine McLaughlin as an expert witness to testify generally regarding childhood development. On August 27, 2015, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Court issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order regarding the final parenting plan. The court\u2019s order largely adopted Stevi\u2019s proposed parenting plan. Matthew appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact supporting a parenting plan to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re the Parenting of M.C., </em>2015 MT 57, \u00b6 10, 378 Mont. 305, 343 P.3d 569. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>M.C., </em>\u00b6 10. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>M.C., </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u00b613 A district court has \u201cbroad discretion when considering the parenting of a child, and we must presume that the court carefully considered the evidence and made the correct decision.\u201d <em>In re the Marriage of Woerner, </em>2014 MT 134, \u00b6 12, 375 Mont. 153, 325 P.3d 1244 (quoting <em>In re Marriage of Crowley, </em>2014 MT 42, \u00b6 44, 374 Mont. 48, 318 P.3d 1031). Accordingly, absent clearly erroneous findings, we will not disturb a district court\u2019s decision regarding parenting plans unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Woerner, </em>\u00b6 12. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Woerner, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u00b614 While district courts \u201chave broad discretion when considering the parenting of a child,\u201d <em>Woerner, </em>\u00b6 12, a district court must \u201cdetermine the parenting plan in accordance with the best interest of the child,\u201d \u00a7 40-4-212(1), MCA; <em>Woerner, </em>\u00b6 13. District courts are directed to consider \u201call relevant parenting factors\u201d in making these determinations. Section 40-4-212(1), MCA. The statute\u2019s non-exhaustive list of factors includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">(a) the wishes of the child\u2019s parent or parents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">(b) the wishes of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">(c) the interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child\u2019s parent or parents and siblings and with any other person who significantly affects the child\u2019s best interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">(d) the child\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-14\">(e) the mental and physical health of all individuals involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-15\">(f) physical abuse or threat of physical abuse by one parent against the other parent or the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>(g) chemical dependency... or chemical abuse on the part of either parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">(h) continuity and stability of care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">(i) developmental needs of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">(j) whether a parent has knowingly failed to pay birth-related costs that the parent is able to pay, which is considered to be not in the child\u2019s best interests;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">(k) whether a parent has knowingly failed to financially support a child that the parent is able to support, which is considered to be not in the child\u2019s best interests;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">(l) whether the child has frequent and continuing contact with both parents, which is considered to be in the child\u2019s best interests unless the court determines, after a hearing, that contact with a parent would be detrimental to the child\u2019s best interests. ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">(m) adverse effects on the child resulting from continuous and vexatious parenting plan amendment actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Section 40-4-212(1), MCA. Although \u201c[w]e have encouraged district courts to make specific findings on each relevant statutory factor,\u201d we require only \u201cthat the district court make findings sufficient for this court to determine whether the court considered the statutory facts and made its ruling on the basis of the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Woerner, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">\u00b615 The District Court found that C.J. is attached primarily to Stevi because she \u201chas parented him much more of the time, has arranged for his medical and dental care, has arranged for his play dates and other social interaction, and has provided for his day to day needs.\u201d The court found further that Stevi did not prevent Matthew from spending time with C.J. during the first fifteen months of C.J.\u2019s life. The court noted that Matthew \u201cdid not present any evidence that he was actually requesting and pursuing parenting time with [C. J.] in any significant fashion\u201d during that time period. Although the court determined that C.J. \u201chas a secure bond with [Matthew],\u201d it decided that \u201cStevi should be entitled to relocate to Newport, Vermont!,] where she has the opportunity to pursue her career in a setting that has more room for advancement [and] more financial opportunity.\u201d The court found that the final parenting plan \u201cwill deepen\u201d C.J.\u2019s bond with Matthew by virtue of its longer periods of uninterrupted parenting time, \u201cinvolve far fewer parenting exchanges and less exposure to conflict for [C.J.] than what he is experiencing under the current schedule,\u201d and \u201cinvolve opportunities for frequent telephone and Skyping or similar communications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">\u00b616 The court next addressed the competing constitutional rights implicated by the proposed parenting plans \u2014 Stevi\u2019s right to travel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Matthew\u2019s right to parent \u2014 before analyzing whether it would be in the best interest of C.J. to move to Vermont \"with Stevi or to remain in Livingston with Matthew. The court thoroughly considered and made specific findings on each of the best interest factors set forth in \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA. Based upon its consideration of the factors, the court concluded that it would be in C.J.\u2019s best interest to adopt a final parenting plan that allowed Stevi to maintain primary custody of C.J. and relocate to Vermont.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b617 Matthew first asserts that the District Court\u2019s finding that Stevi did not interfere with his relationship with C.J. is clearly erroneous. Matthew alleges that the evidence demonstrates that Stevi \u201cwillfully and consistently interfered with [Matthew\u2019s] parenting time.\u201d Matthew contends that the \u201creason that C.J. is primarily attached to [Stevi] is because she has consistently thwarted and interfered with [Matthew\u2019s] ability to exercise parenting time of any kind[,] not just meaningful parenting time.\u201d Consequently, Matthew asserts, the District Court\u2019s finding adversely impacted its consideration of several of the best interest factors under \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b618 The District Court\u2019s finding provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">33. Stevi is the parent to whom [C.J.] is primarily attached. She parented him without contact from [Matthew] during the first fifteen months of [C.J.\u2019s] life. The lack of contact between [C.J.] and [Matthew] during that time frame was not due to interference or blocking the contact on Stevi\u2019s part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The District Court relied on evidence showing that for the first eight months of C.J.\u2019s life, Matthew contested whether he was C.J.\u2019s father. Although Matthew was ordered to take a paternity test on October 31, 2012, he did not take the test until April 29, 2013. Moreover, Matthew admitted that Stevi offered to allow him to visit C.J. so long as she was present, but testified that he refused the opportunity because he did not want Stevi present during his visits with C.J. The parties\u2019 testimony substantiates the District Court\u2019s view that although Stevi has been C.J.\u2019s primary parent, she has made efforts to have Matthew involved in C.J.\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\u00b619 It is the District Court\u2019s function to determine \u201cthe credibility of the witnesses and the weight assigned to their respective testimony.\u201d <em>In re the Parenting </em>of N.S., 2011 MT 98, \u00b6 25, 360 Mont. 288, 253 P.3d 863. \u201cWhether we would have reached the same decision as the trial court is not the standard under which we review a court\u2019s order for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Woerner, </em>\u00b6 29 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Lockhead, </em>2013 MT 368, \u00b6 12, 373 Mont. 120, 314 P.3d 915). Rather, \u201c[w]e review whether substantial evidence in the record supports the court\u2019s findings regardless of whether the evidence could support a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>outcome as well.\u201d <em>Woerner, </em>\u00b6 29 (citing <em>Brimstone Mining, Inc. v. Glaus, </em>2003 MT 236, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 236, 77 P.3d 175). Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the District Court did not misapprehend the effect of the evidence or clearly make a mistake in finding that Stevi did not interfere with Matthew\u2019s relationship with C.J. The District Court\u2019s finding of fact is supported by substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we disagree with Matthew\u2019s contention that the District Court\u2019s finding led to an incorrect application of the best interest factors under \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b620 Next, Matthew alleges that the District Court misstated the law when it concluded that Matthew \u201cbears a \u2018heavy burden\u2019 of establishing that the proposed travel restriction is consistent with the best interests\u201d of C.J. Matthew contends that the burden of proof for establishing a travel restriction is simply the best interest of the child standard. Therefore, Matthew claims, the District Court incorrectly required Matthew \u201cto show that not moving was in C. J.\u2019s best interest.\u201d Matthew claims again that the District Court\u2019s finding that Stevi did not interfere with his relationship with C.J. is not supported by substantial evidence. Matthew cites our holding in <em>M.C. </em>that \u201ca parent\u2019s decision to move may be considered against the best interests of a child if the parent\u2019s decision exemplifies a willful and consistent attempt to frustrate or deny contact between the child and his or her other parent.\u201d <em>M.C., </em>\u00b6 20 (citation and internal quotations omitted). Finally, Matthew asserts that the court incorrectly elevated Stevi\u2019s right to travel over C.J.\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b621 The right to travel \u201chas long been recognized as a fundamental constitutional right.\u201d <em>M.C., </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 629-31, 89 S. Ct. 1322, 1328-29 (1969), <em>overruled on other grounds by Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 671, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 1360 (1974)). Accordingly, the right to travel \u201cmay be restricted only by a compelling state interest.\u201d M. C., \u00b6 12 (citing Dunn <em>v. Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330, 339, 92 S. Ct. 995, 1001 (1972); <em>In re Marriage of Cole, </em>224 Mont. 207, 213, 729 P.2d 1276, 1280 (1986)). Advancing the best interest of a child is a compelling state interest. <em>M.C., </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>Cole, </em>224 Mont. at 213, 729 P.2d at 1280). Therefore, \u201cin cases implicating a parent\u2019s exercise of his or her fundamental right to travel, \u2018it is the court\u2019s task to attempt to reconcile the interests of both parents with the best interests of the child.\u2019 <em>\u201d M.C., </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting <em>Cole, </em>224 Mont. at 213, 729 P.2d at 1280). In such cases, we have cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">A restriction on a parent\u2019s fundamental right to travel must be imposed cautiously and only when there is sufficient proof that the restriction is in the best interest of the child. The parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>seeking the restriction must provide case-specific proof that the restriction is in the child\u2019s best interest: that is, legitimate, case-specific reasons and evidence pertaining to the particular child, rather than general discussion about the effects of relocation on children of separation or divorce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><em>M.C., </em>\u00b6 14 (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b622  Our precedent makes clear that Matthew \u2014 as the parent seeking to restrict Stevi\u2019s fundamental right to travel \u2014 bears the burden of proving that the restriction is in C.J.\u2019s best interest. Here, the District Court recognized correctly that Matthew bore such a burden. The court recognized further its responsibility to consider C.J.\u2019s best interests and concluded, \u201cUltimately, in balancing the respective and competing constitutional rights of the parties and in determining the terms and parameters of any parenting plan, the Court is bound to consider the best interest standards of the child as contemplated in \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA.\u201d The court then proceeded to consider, and make specific findings regarding, each of the best interest factors set forth in \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA. We conclude that the District Court correctly held Matthew to the burden of showing that the travel restriction was not in C.J.\u2019s best interest, and that it correctly applied the best interest of the child standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b623  As discussed above, there is substantial evidence supporting the District Court\u2019s finding that Stevi did not interfere with Matthew\u2019s relationship with C.J. Aside from his interference argument, Matthew has offered no other \u201clegitimate, case-specific reasons and evidence\u201d supporting his contention that restricting Stevi\u2019s right to travel is in the best interest of C.J. M.C., \u00b6 14. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court acted within its broad discretion in allowing C.J. to relocate to Vermont with Stevi.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b624 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law were correct. We therefore will not disturb the District Court\u2019s decision regarding C.J.\u2019s parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">\u00b625 The District Court\u2019s order adopting the final parenting plan is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b228-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-10\"> The District Court took judicial notice of the paternity action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
