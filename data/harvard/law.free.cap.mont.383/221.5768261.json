We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">\u00b62 Ray presents the following dispositive issues for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err in granting Connell summary judgment on Ray\u2019s defamation claim based on a conversation between Connell and Jim Ronquillo (Ronquillo)?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court err in granting Connell summary judgment on Ray\u2019s defamation claim based on comments Connell made at two Billings City Council meetings?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-12\">\n<em>3. Did the District Court err in granting Connell summary judgment on Ray\u2019s claims of tortious interference with business interests and general damages for mental anguish and suffering based on Connell\u2019s alleged defamation of Ray\u2019s character?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">\u00b63 Ray and Connell are both real estate agents. Ray and Connell each own land in the East Billings Urban Revitalization District (EBURD). EBURD is a zoning district in the industrial area of Billings, which has adopted a master plan and code (EBURD Code) to regulate development and renewal in the area. Property owners within EBURD also make up a non-profit organization called the Billings Industrial Revitalization District (BIRD). BIRD advocates for development within EBURD. Connell is president of BIRD. In May 2013, Ray requested two variances from the EBURD Code in order to develop property he owns located within the district. The Board of Adjustments denied one variance request and granted the other. BIRD and several landowners appealed the granted variance. Ray appealed the denied variance. The EBURD Code and the outcome of Ray\u2019s two variance requests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>generated contention between Ray and Connell. Connell is a proponent of the EBURD Code and Ray is a vocal opponent.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b64 Ray wrote a letter to the Billings City Council asking the Council to rescind or modify the EBURD Code. The Billings City Council held a meeting on October 7, 2013, and discussed the EBURD Code. According to that meeting\u2019s transcript, Connell addressed the Council and commented on Ray\u2019s petition to rescind or modify the EBURD Code. Connell said, \u201cI sent [the City Council] a letter last week kind of outlining the Jerry T. Ray situation.\u201d Connell continued, \u201c[T]he simplest way to summarize Jerry T. Ray is he\u2019s like a broken watch. He\u2019s right twice a day, and he in-fills a lot of stuff. So there\u2019s a lot of things that you\u2019ve been told that are not factual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b65 At another Billings City Council meeting, held on January 6,2014, the minutes reflect that Ray addressed the Council and said he wanted to talk about the first two phases of EBURD in which he owned property. He advocated for rezoning the EBURD back to \u201cControlled Industrial\u201d because the EBURD Code is too stringent, complying with it is too expensive, and.its provisions discourage development. The minutes show that Connell later spoke and called himself \u201cpublic enemy #1 [to Ray\u2019s] petition.\u201d Connell accused Ray of making misrepresentations and invited Ray to follow city procedures and buy the required permits. Connell said Ray\u2019s criticisms of the EBURD Code were \u201cjust simply not true.\u201d The minutes show Connell said \u201cif they held a hearing with sworn testimony, it would be found that what Mr. Ray had told Council was not true.\u201d Finally, the minutes indicate Connell accused Ray of having ex-parte communication with all of the Board of Adjustments members prior to their ruling on his variance requests and giving them factually incorrect information to influence their decision. Connell admitted he was not at the Board of Adjustments meeting when Ray\u2019s requests were considered because Ray \u201chad turned his name into the Board of Realty for malpractice.\u201d As a result, Connell \u201chad to go before the Board of Realty, who dismissed the complaint with prejudice.\u201d Connell concluded, \u201cThe bottom line was there were seven criteria to grant a variance, and Mr. Ray only qualified for one \u2014 a parking lot; but the board granted it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b66 Ray filed suit against Connell alleging Connell\u2019s comments during these two meetings constituted defamation of his character. Additionally, Ray accused Connell of telling Ronquillo, a Billings City Councilman, that Ray had stolen gates from Connell\u2019s business, Pierce Packing, and was keeping them at his residence. This accusation, Ray argued, also constituted defamation and Ray accused Ronquillo of spreading the rumor. On April 24, 2014, Ronquillo signed an affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>in which he attested Connell told him that Ray stole gates from Connell\u2019s business and had them at his home. In the affidavit, Ronquillo attested Connell\u2019s statement about Ray stealing gates was \u201cdefamation of Jerry T. Ray\u2019s character\u201d and \u201cthis untrue statement could cause Jerry T. Ray financial harm as Jerry is a Realtor and the truth is paramount in the real estate profession.\u201d Later, during a deposition taken on March 12,2015, Ronquillo testified that he did not read the affidavit fully before signing it, saying, \u201cI probably didn\u2019t read the whole doggone thing, which is my fault,\u201d and did not recognize the document until his signature was pointed out. During his deposition, Ronquillo contradicted many of the statements in his affidavit. He testified he believed that Connell\u2019s statement about Ray stealing gates was a joke, not defamation. Ronquillo testified that he conveyed Connell\u2019s story only to Ray and that he did not believe the accusation could cause Ray financial harm because he had not told anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"Arv\">\u00b67 Ray claimed punitive damages, general damages based on a lost real estate commission, costs, attorney fees and expenses for defamation. Ray claimed that he lost a real estate commission because Donald Janich, a ranch-owner, heard Connell\u2019s comments while watching a Billings City Council meeting on television and, afterwards, decided not to allow Ray to list his ranch. Donald Janich\u2019s ranch later sold, which, according to Ray\u2019s third amended complaint, resulted in damages totaling \u201c$82,500.00 in lost commission from a real estate transaction less any costs of split commission with Donald R. Janich.\u201d Ray included an additional claim in his second amended complaint: Ray claimed that Connell\u2019s same allegedly-defamatory conduct entitled him to an unidentified amount of damages for tortious interference with business interests. Ray included an additional claim in his third amended complaint for $400,000 in general damages for mental anguish and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b68 On August 10, 2015, after considering the briefs, pleadings, and papers on file and arguments of counsel, the District Court granted Connell\u2019s two motions for partial summary judgment and renewed motion for summary judgment. The District Court held that: 1) the absolute privilege of \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA, applied to the statements Connell made at the Billings City Council meetings and protected them from constituting defamation; 2) Connell\u2019s statement to Ronquillo was not defamation because, according to Ronquillo\u2019s deposition, which is controlling, it was a joke; and 3) Connell was entitled to summary judgment on Ray\u2019s claims of tortious interference and mental anguish damages because the underlying conduct for those claims was the same conduct that the Court determined was not defamatory and entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Connell to summary judgment. Ray appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b69 We review summary judgment orders de novo, performing the same analysis as the district court. <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. </em>Co., 2008 MT 252, \u00b6 36, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186 (citation omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b610 <em>1. Did the District Court err in granting Connell summary judgment on Ray\u2019s defamation claim based on a conversation between Connell and Ronquillo?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\u00b611 Ray claims Connell defamed him by communicating an accusation of theft to Ronquillo. Defamation is effected by libel or slander. Section 27-1-801, MCA. \u201cLibel is a false and unprivileged publication by writing, printing, picture, effigy, or other fixed representation that exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy or causes a person to be shunned or avoided or that has a tendency to injure a person in the person\u2019s occupation.\u201d Section 27-1-802, MCA. \u201cSlander is a false and unprivileged publication other than libel that: 1) charges any person with crime ...\u201d or \u201c3) tends directly to injure a person in respect to the person\u2019s ... business, either by imputing to the person general disqualification in those respects that the office or other occupation peculiarly requires or by imputing something with reference to the person\u2019s office, profession, trade, or business that has a natural tendency to lessen its profit ....\u201d Section 27-1-803, MCA. For defamatory words to be actionable, they \u201cmust be of such nature that the court can presume as a matter of law that they will tend to disgrace and degrade [the plaintiff] or cause him to be shunned and avoided. It is not sufficient, standing alone, that the language is unpleasant and annoys or irks him, and subjects him to jests or banter, so as to affect his feelings.\u201d <em>McConkey v. Flathead Elec. </em>Coop., 2005 MT 334, \u00b6 45, 330 Mont. 48, 125 P.3d 1121 (citing <em>Wainman v. Bowler, </em>176 Mont. 91, 96, 576 P.2d 268, 271 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\u00b612 Here, Connell\u2019s statement to Ronquillo accused Ray of a crime of stealing gates. Ronquillo\u2019s affidavit attested Connell\u2019s statement was defamatory. However, Ronquillo contradicted his affidavit statements during his deposition and said he thought Connell\u2019s accusation that Ray stole gates was a joke. Ajoke is not defamatory and, therefore, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>actionable. Although it may have been unpleasant, annoying, or irksome, the joke about Ray stealing gates did not disgrace or degrade Ray or cause him to be shunned or avoided and is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b613 Ray argues that the discrepancy between Ronquillo\u2019s affidavit and deposition testimony raised a genuine issue of material fact \u2014 whether Connell\u2019s accusation was a joke or sincere \u2014 which precluded the District Court from granting summary judgment. However, \u201c[w]hen statements in an affidavit submitted pursuant to Rule 56(e), M.R.Civ.P., are repudiated in a later deposition, the affidavit statements do not raise a genuine issue of material fact.\u2019\u2019 <em>Meadow Lake Estates Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Shoemaker, </em>2008 MT 41, \u00b6 46, 341 Mont. 345, 178 P.3d 81 (quoting <em>Herron v. Columbus Hosp., </em>284 Mont. 190, 195, 943 P.2d 1272, 1275 (1997) (In <em>Herron, </em>Herron sued Columbus Hospital after being injured by an automatic door entering a building Columbus Hospital owned. To oppose Columbus Hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Herron submitted an affidavit of Lyle Skinner, a Columbus Hospital maintenance employee. Lyle Skinner was later deposed and contradicted several of the statements he attested to in his affidavit. In <em>Meadow Lake Estates, </em>we applied the same principle outlined in <em>Herron </em>\u2014 a witness\u2019s later deposition controls where it, at least in part, repudiates statements made in the witness\u2019s earlier affidavit \u2014 to a party to the litigation where the party\u2019s later deposition contradicted an earlier attested affidavit.).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b614  Ronquillo signed his affidavit on April 24, 2014, and repudiated those statements in a deposition taken on March 12, 2015. Ronquillo\u2019s later deposition testimony \u2014 that he believed Connell was joking when he told Ronquillo that Ray stole gates \u2014 controls. Ronquillo\u2019s deposition testimony clearly contradicts his earlier affidavit, which he admitted he signed without thoroughly reviewing and did not initially recognize; thus the contradictory statements do not raise a genuine issue of material fact. Connell was entitled to. judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b615 <em>2. Did the District Court err in granting Connell summary judgment on Ray\u2019s defamation claim based on comments Connell made at two Billings City Council meetings?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b616  A privileged publication is one made in any \u201cofficial proceeding authorized by law.\u201d Section 27-1-804(2), MCA. The City of Billings Charter creates \u201ca City council of the City of Billings composed of ten (10) Councilmembers.\u201d Section 3.02. The Billings Municipal Code provides that \u201c[t]he city council shall hold a regular meeting for the transaction of city business on the second and fourth Mondays in each month\u201d and that \u201c[t]he mayor or any three (3) councilmembers may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>request\u201d a special meeting. Section 2-211. A \u201cregular meeting of the Great Falls city commission\u201d constitutes an official proceeding authorized by law. <em>Skinner v. Pistoria, </em>194 Mont. 257, 264, 633 P.2d 672, 676 (1981). Here, applying the City of Billings Charter, its Municipal Code, and <em>Skinner </em>the District Court held \u201ca meeting or special meeting of the Billings City Council is also such an official proceeding.\u201d The District Court was correct in concluding that Billings City Council meetings, both regularly scheduled and specially called, constitute official proceedings authorized by law as contemplated in \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA, and communications during those meetings are privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b617 \u201cOne requisite of a defamation action is that the communication must be unprivileged. A privileged communication is one which, except for the circumstances under which it is made, may be defamatory and actionable.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>194 Mont. at 261, 633 P.2d at 675 (citation omitted). The privilege created by \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA, is an absolute privilege against liability for defamation and is therefore unaffected by the presence of malice. <em>Skinner, </em>194 Mont. at 263, 633 P.2d at 675-76 (citations omitted). The privilege covers critical expressions made at official meetings authorized by law that are responsible for the interest being expressed. <em>Skinner, </em>194 Mont. at 263, 633 P.2d at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b618 Ray claims Connell defamed him during two Billings City Council meetings by maliciously accusing Ray of not telling the truth. This, he argues, slandered him and negatively impacted Ray\u2019s business as a real estate agent. The meeting on October 7, 2013, was a Billings City Council Work Session and the meeting on January 6, 2014, was a Billings City Council Special Meeting. We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that both meetings constituted official proceedings authorized by law. The Billings City Council is responsible for transacting city business and the City of Billings adopted the EBURD Code, which was a topic at both meetings. We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Billings City Council is responsible for interests related to the EBURD Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b619  At both meetings, Connell accused Ray of criticizing the EBURD Code provisions he disliked by conveying information to the Council that was \u201cnot factual,\u201d \u201cnot true,\u201d or \u201csimply not true.\u201d He accused Ray of having inappropriate, ex-parte communications with the Board of Adjustments members and having \u201cturned him in\u201d to the Board of Realty for malpractice. Connell also referred to himself as public enemy number one to Ray\u2019s petition. These comments constitute critical expressions about Ray and his petition to rescind or modify the EBURD code and may have been arguably defamatory and actionable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>However, because they were communicated to the body responsible for the interest being expressed at an official proceeding authorized by law, they were absolutely privileged under \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA. Whether the comments were malicious is irrelevant because the privilege covers both malicious critical expressions and non-malicious critical expressions. Additionally, Ray seems to contend that Connell\u2019s status, as either a public figure or private figure, has bearing on his claim. However, we conclude that the absolute privilege of \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA, draws no distinction based upon the speaker\u2019s status, and, therefore, Connell\u2019s status is irrelevant. The District Court properly granted Connell summary judgment on Ray\u2019s defamation claim based on Connell\u2019s comments made at two Billings City Council meetings because the comments were absolutely privileged under \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA. Connell was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqp\">\u00b620 3. <em>Did the District Court err in granting Connell summary judgment on Ray\u2019s claims of tortious interference with business interests and general damages for mental anguish and suffering based on Connell\u2019s alleged defamation of Ray\u2019s character?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b621 Ray argues Connell\u2019s statements to Ronquillo and comments at the Billings City Council meetings hurt his business as a real estate agent and will continue to do so. Ray argues Connell\u2019s statements also impacted his reputation, life, and livelihood, causing him mental anguish and suffering. Ray inserted these additional claims in his second and third amended complaints. As support for these additional claims, Ray incorporated by reference all earlier paragraphs of the complaints. The District Court concluded Connell was entitled to summary judgment on these additional claims because it had already granted summary judgment on Ray\u2019s defamation claims and the additional claims failed to allege \u201cany additional conduct of Connell upon which to impose liability under Montana law.\u201d We conclude, likewise, that Ray\u2019s additional claims rely on the same underlying conduct that we have already concluded is not actionable. Therefore, no genuine issue of material fact existed and the District Court properly concluded Connell was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u00b622 The District Court\u2019s order granting Connell\u2019s two motions for partial summary judgment and renewed motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
