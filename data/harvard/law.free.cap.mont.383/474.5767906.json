We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in dismissing the charge against Colvin based upon his claim that the State failed to preserve exculpatory evidence?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">\u00b63 On October 9,2014, the State charged Colvin by information with attempted deliberate homicide in the September 4, 2014 shooting of Michael Aja. At the time of the incident Aja was sitting in his Jeep vehicle. Colvin claimed that he was holding the pistol inside the driver\u2019s side window when it accidently fired and hit Aja. On the same day as the shooting, law enforcement officers seized and impounded the Jeep as evidence. As the case developed, the position of the pistol and its distance from the victim when fired became important issues to the prosecution and the defense. The State\u2019s theory was that the pistol shot came from several feet outside the vehicle, while Colvin\u2019s theory was that it came from very near or inside the window. Colvin also contends that each eyewitness to the incident, including the victim, supports his theory that the shot was fired from near or inside the vehicle window.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">\u00b64 On October 9, the same day that the State filed the charge, Colvin\u2019s attorney filed a motion for discovery pursuant to \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA. The motion listed numerous objects and categories of requested information, specifically including the vehicle in which Michael Aja was shot and \u201call material exculpatory or inculpatory of the defendant.\u201d The defense believed that the vehicle contained essential evidence such as blood spatter and gunshot residue. On October 14 the District Court entered an order granting the defense discovery motion, requiring disclosure of \u201call materials known or discovered... pertinent to this case.\u201d That same day the State filed a motion for leave to return a wallet and keys to Michael Aja.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">\u00b65 On October 30, 2014, the State\u2019s expert witness examined the vehicle and collected evidence, including photographs. The expert subsequently concluded, based upon his examination of the vehicle and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>other evidence, that Colvin was seven feet from the vehicle when he fired the shot. On November 9, 2014, the State returned the vehicle to the victim Michael Aja. The State did not notify the defense or the District Court that it intended to release the vehicle and did not seek leave of the District Court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b66 On November 21, 2014, Colvin\u2019s attorney, still not knowing that the State released the vehicle, filed a motion to compel, contending that the State had not complied with the Court\u2019s October 14 order requiring discovery. The District Court granted the motion to compel, requiring the State to produce \u201call completed discovery information currently in the State\u2019s possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b67 On December 10 the State provided additional items of discovery to Colvin\u2019s attorney, including a receipt disclosing that the Jeep vehicle was returned to Michael Aja on November 9,2014. This was the State\u2019s first notice to the defense that the vehicle was no longer in State custody. The State never informed Colvin or his attorney of its intent to return the vehicle, and the State never sought or obtained leave from the District Court to do so. After the State returned the vehicle, Michael Aja used it for his daily travel needs. The State provided its expert\u2019s report to the defense on February 10, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b68 On February 26, 2015, Colvin moved to dismiss the charge based upon the State\u2019s failure to preserve the vehicle. On June 2, 2015, after briefing by the parties, the District Court entered its Decision and Order Regarding Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. The District Court granted Colvin\u2019s motion and dismissed the charge against him based upon the State\u2019s failure to preserve the vehicle. The District Court relied upon the constitutional due process right of criminal defendants to obtain exculpatory evidence held by the prosecution. <em>Brady v. </em>Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). The District Court determined that the \u201crelease of the vehicle amounted to the loss of the crime scene itself, or at least the most significant component of the crime scene.\u201d The District Court noted that there was \u201ca significant dispute in the position of the State and the defense as to where the defendant was standing when the gun discharged.\u201d The District Court determined that after release of the vehicle and Aja\u2019s daily use, the defense had no means to obtain evidence as it existed at the time the State\u2019s expert gathered his evidence. The State\u2019s expert examined the vehicle while it was impounded and collected evidence to determine where Colvin was standing when the shot was fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b69 The District Court concluded that the State\u2019s \u201cnegligent\u201d release of the impounded vehicle in the face of an order requiring disclosure \u201cdeprived the defense of the opportunity to investigate and prove their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>theory of the case. This is a fundamental violation of due process.\u201d Further, because the vehicle was released back to Michael Aja for daily use, the District Court concluded that its evidentiary value to the defense \u201cis now lost.\u201d The District Court concluded that this deprivation of evidence was a violation of Colvin\u2019s right to due process and required dismissal of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b610 A district court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss charges in a criminal case presents a question of law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>State v. Schauf, </em>2009 MT 281, \u00b6 13, 352 Mont. 186, 216 P.3d 740. Review is plenary, to determine whether the district court is correct. <em>State v. Hardaway, </em>2001 MT 252, \u00b6 64, 307 Mont. 139, 36 P.3d 900. Findings of fact are reviewed to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Fregien, </em>2006 MT 18, \u00b6 8, 331 Mont. 18, 127 P.3d 1048. A district court\u2019s discretionary decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Breeding, </em>2008 MT 162, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 323, 184 P.3d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err in dismissing the charge against Colvin based upon his claim that the State failed to preserve exculpatory evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\u00b612 A criminal defendant has a right to obtain exculpatory evidence held by the government. The United States Supreme Court has established that \u201csuppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S. Ct. at 1196-97. The purpose of the <em>Brady </em>rule \u201cis not punishment of society for misdeeds of a prosecutor but avoidance of an unfair trial to the accused.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S. Ct. at 1197. Material evidence is evidence which is more than conclusory or speculative; a material fact is one that is relevant to the cause of action or the defense, and requires resolution by the trier of fact. <em>Hopkins v. Superior Metal Workings, </em>2009 MT 48, \u00b6 5, 349 Mont. 292, 203 P.3d 803. A <em>Brady </em>due process violation depends upon \u201csuppression of material evidence favorable to a defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Seifert, </em>2010 MT 169, \u00b6 14, 357 Mont. 188, 237 P.3d 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\u00b613 A <em>Brady </em>violation of due process occurs when the defendant establishes that the State possessed evidence that had exculpatory or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>impeachment value to the defense; the evidence was willfully or inadvertently suppressed; and that suppression prejudiced the defense. <em>State v. Root, </em>2015 MT 310, \u00b6 19, 381 Mont. 314, 359 P.3d 1088. The last element \u2014 prejudice to the defense \u2014 is sometimes stated in terms of a burden to show that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different had the evidence been provided.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>State v. Gollehon, </em>1999 MT 210, \u00b6 15, 296 Mont. 6, 986 P.2d 395. The defendant is not required to show that the evidence would have led to acquittal, <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 1565-66 (1995), and a defendant meets his burden by showing that suppression of the evidence was prejudicial to the defense. <em>State v. Ellison, </em>2012 MT 50, \u00b6 16, 364 Mont. 276, 272 P.3d 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b614 On appeal the State argues that the District Court should have held an evidentiary hearing before deciding the motion to dismiss; that dismissal is a severe sanction limited to egregious cases of governmental misconduct; that there was no showing of intentional destruction of the evidence; and that Colvin failed to establish the exculpatory nature of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b615 The State charged Colvin with attempted deliberate homicide. An essential element of that offense is intent \u2014 the State must prove that the defendant acted \u201cpurposely or knowingly\u201d to attempt to cause the death of another. Section 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA. Whether Colvin acted purposely or knowingly was an issue for both sides. Colvin, for example, points to a purported statement by the victim that the gun was close to his face when it discharged. As the District Court found, Colvin made a sufficient showing that the distance from which the shot was fired would be a critical issue regarding intent in this case. A shot from a distance outside the vehicle would tend to support the State\u2019s charge that Colvin fired purposely or knowingly, while a shot fired adj acent to or inside the vehicle window would support Colvin\u2019s defense that the gun discharged accidently.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b616 The State\u2019s expert concluded that the shot came from a distance of seven feet from the vehicle. This conclusion was based at least in part on the evidence that the expert obtained during his inspection of the vehicle. As the District Court found, the vehicle <em>was </em>the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>scene and after it was released could not be returned to the condition it was in when examined by the State\u2019s expert. This, at a minimum, severely hampered any defense effort to examine and use the blood spatter, powder residue and other evidence from the vehicle. Until the time the vehicle was released to Aja, the State clearly believed that evidence on and in the Jeep was important to determining what happened in the shooting. The State retained an expert to examine the vehicle and the expert used evidence gathered from that examination in reaching an opinion as to how the shooting happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b617 The State argues that the evidence inside the Jeep \u201cstill exists\u201d and that the defense is at fault for not pursuing it. However, this is just speculation as to the condition of the vehicle \u201ccrime scene\u201d and the extent to which intervening time, use, cleaning and weather compromised important evidence. The State also argues that Colvin could obtain the same evidence that its expert obtained from the vehicle. The State asserts that Colvin could \u201crecreate the shooting\u201d by using the actual or a substitute vehicle. This is a novel suggestion, given that the blood spatter from the victim\u2019s wound is concededly one of the important factors that an expert would analyze.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b618 The decision in <em>State v. Buckles, </em>1999 MT 79, 294 Mont. 95, 979 P.2d 177, does not assist the State\u2019s position. The State charged Buckles with negligent homicide following a single-vehicle accident in which a passenger died. Law enforcement officers seized and impounded the vehicle, but subsequently released it. Buckles contended that this was a <em>Brady </em>violation; that examination of the interior of the vehicle could have revealed important evidence about whether he was the driver; and that the charge should be dismissed. However, since Buckles admitted to responding officers that he was the driver, he was unable to establish any reasonable probability that retention of the vehicle would yield a different result. <em>Buckles, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"A1O\">\u00b619  The State attempts to shift blame for this situation to the defense, arguing that if only the defense had examined the vehicle earlier, it would have been in its impounded condition. However, the defense motion for discovery specifically requested that the State provide the vehicle for inspection, and at the time the State released the vehicle, the State was -under an order to provide discovery. The State released the vehicle only 10 days after the State\u2019s expert examined it. Further, as to other seized material not at issue (keys and wallet), the State had taken the reasonable step of providing notice and obtaining leave of the Court to return those items. There is no reasonable way that the defense could have guessed that if it did not act to examine the untampered vehicle at some unknown time, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>opportunity to do so would be lost. We agree that the loss of the original condition of the victim\u2019s vehicle was prejudicial to Colvin.</p>\n<p id=\"AuA\">\u00b620 We find no basis to disturb the District Court\u2019s determination that the vehicle was the crime scene and that the blood spatter and gunshot residue on and in it were important evidence for the prosecution and the defense. We find no basis to disturb the District Court\u2019s conclusion that after the vehicle was released and used by Aja for a period of time, it was \u201cno longer intact\u201d as it existed at the time of the shooting or at the time the State\u2019s expert examined it.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b621 The State contends that it was an abuse of discretion to dismiss the charge against Colvin as a result of the <em>Brady </em>violation rather than selecting some alternative outcome. However, the District Court had few real alternatives to dismissal. Precluding the State from using the evidence it gleaned from the vehicle, for example, would not assist Colvin in developing evidence to support his defense that he fired the gun close to the victim by accident. We are not persuaded by the State\u2019s speculation that the intervening use of the vehicle has not altered the essential blood spatter and gunshot residue evidence, and that Colvin could recreate the shooting and replicate the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AaY\">\u00b622 The State further contends that dismissal of charges should be reserved for cases of egregious governmental conduct to hide or destroy evidence favorable to the defense. The State does not explain how the release happened in this case except to assert that it was done inadvertently. While there is no evidence of bad faith conduct by the State, it was at least reckless to release the vehicle while an order requiring its production to the defense was in place. The District Court had discretion to fashion a remedy under the facts and circumstances of the case, including dismissal. <em>State v. Halter, </em>238 Mont. 408, 413, 777 P.2d 1313, 1316-17 (1989); <em>State v. Swanson, </em>222 Mont. 357, 362, 722 P.2d 1155, 1158 (1986). In any event, based upon the clear holding in <em>Brady, </em>the inquiry should be upon whether the evidence was material to the case and how it impacted the defense, regardless of whether the evidence was lost through intentional or inadvertent conduct. The fundamental purpose of the <em>Brady </em>rule is not to punish the government for misconduct; it is to protect the due process rights of the accused. <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S. Ct. at 1197. There can be no real issue that the vehicle evidence here was material to the case for both the prosecution and the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b623 The State argues that it was error for the District Court to decide Colvin\u2019s motion to dismiss without holding an evidentiary hearing. However, there is no express requirement that a court considering a <em>Brady </em>issue must hold an evidentiary hearing. It may do so as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>of discretion. <em>Halter, </em>238 Mont. at 413, 777 P.2d at 1316-17. While the State speculates on appeal about the evidence it could have presented, it did not request a hearing in the District Court where these issues could have been addressed. The State also did not file any affidavits but simply responded by brief to Colvin\u2019s motion to dismiss. The parties briefed the issues and the District Court was able to determine whether an evidentiary hearing would assist the decision. The District Court was within its discretion in determining whether to hold a hearing and we find no error. <em>City of Helena v. Wittinghill, </em>2009 MT 343, \u00b6 23, 353 Mont. 131, 219 P.3d 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b624  We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the State\u2019s release of the vehicle was a violation of Colvin\u2019s right to due process and we affirm the order dismissing the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b505-7\">JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\"> In a case like the present one where there was no trial or plea, it will clearly be difficult to show or to determine whether the outcome of the proceeding would have been different had the evidence not been suppressed. That factor, therefore, is not pertinent to resolution of the present case but may be relevant in other cases, depending upon the facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
