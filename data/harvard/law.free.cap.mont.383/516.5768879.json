Petaja cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion for attorney fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">\u00b62 We restate and address the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">1. <em>Did substantial evidence support the jury verdict finding MPEA breached its duty of fair representation?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-11\">2. Was <em>the jury verdict contrary to the instructions and law ?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-12\">3. Was <em>Petaja\u2019s claim barred by res judicata?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-13\">4. <em>Did the District Court have legal authority to award attorney fees?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">\u00b63 Most of the facts of this case are not in dispute as a matter of law. MPEA\u2019s trial counsel failed to timely answer multiple discovery requests propounded by Petaja and failed to respond to the District Court\u2019s order granting Petaja\u2019s motion to compel MPEA to answer the discovery requests. As a result, the District Court ordered Petaja\u2019s requests for admission to be deemed admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">\u00b64 This case began when Petaja was terminated from her position with Lewis and Clark County as the Clinic Coordinator of the Women, Infants and Children Supplemental Nutrition Program. The County claimed Petaja\u2019s position was terminated as the result of a reorganization. Petaja, 59, claimed she was terminated because of her age.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-17\">\u00b65 Petaja was a member of a collective bargaining unit represented by MPEA. The collective bargaining agreement provided a procedure to address grievances between employees and the County. The grievance procedure consisted of four advancing steps: (1) an informal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>discussion with the employee\u2019s supervisor; (2) a formal grievance written to the department head; (3) a formal grievance written to the Human Resources Director; and (4) final and binding arbitration. Petaja requested MPEA to file a Step 1 grievance challenging her termination. In response, the County offered to employ Petaja as a temporary administrative receptionist at a significant pay decrease. Petaja accepted the position but refused to waive any rights or claims she had under the CBA against the County. Petaja then requested MPEA to file a Step 2 grievance. MPEA scheduled a meeting with its representative, Raymond Berg, and Petaja\u2019s husband, to discuss Petaja\u2019s Step 2 grievance. Berg then refused to meet with Petaja\u2019s husband to discuss Petaja\u2019s Step 2 grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b66 Petaj a\u2019s husband then hand delivered a letter to Berg, with a copy to MPEA\u2019s counsel, which requested that MPEA file Petaja\u2019s Step 2 grievance, or alternatively, provide Petaja with written confirmation that MPEA had decided not to pursue the grievance and that Petaja had exhausted her remedies under the CBA. MPEA refused to file Petaja\u2019s Step 2 grievance, and failed to provide her with written notice of its decision not to pursue the grievance and that she had exhausted her remedies under the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b67 Instead, MPEA signed a settlement agreement on behalf of Petaja that purported to resolve all disputes concerning wages owed to Petaja by the County under the CBA, without reservation of any other claim. MPEA did not advise Petaja it was entering into a settlement agreement with the County, nor did MPEA present the settlement agreement to Petaja for her signature or review.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\u00b68 Petaja filed a discrimination claim against the County with the Human Rights Bureau (HRB). HRB issued a final agency decision dismissing the claim. Petaja also filed an unfair labor practice complaint against MPEA with the Montana Board of Personnel Appeals (BOPA). BOPA issued a final agency decision dismissing the complaint. After HRB and BOPA dismissed Petaja\u2019s complaints, Petaja filed suit in district court against the County, alleging discrimination, and against MPEA, alleging breach of the duty of fair representation. The County pled as an affirmative defense that Petaja\u2019s discrimination claim was time barred. MPEA did not contend that Petaja\u2019s fair representation claim was barred by BOPA\u2019s final decision under the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\u00b69 At trial, the District Court instructed the jury on the claim of breach of the duty of fair representation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">[T]he Plaintiff has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>1) She was a member of MPEA\u2019s collective bargaining unit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\">2) The employer violated the terms of the collective bargaining agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">3) Defendant MPEA breached its duty to act honestly and in good faith and to avoid arbitrary conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">A union breaches its duty of fair representation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">1) When it ignores a meritorious grievance or processes agreements in a perfunctory manner</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">2) When it fails to act honestly and [in] good faith with its union members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">3) When its conduct is arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">4) When it egregiously disregards the rights of the union member.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM-\">\u00b610 Whether Petaja\u2019s discrimination claim against the County was time barred was submitted as a factual question to the jury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the County on the discrimination claim, but the verdict form did not require the jury to indicate whether it found in favor of the County on the merits or because it found Petaja\u2019s claim was time-barred. The jury returned a verdict against MPEA on the breach of the duty of fair representation claim, finding it liable for $100,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">\u00b611 After trial, Petaja asked the District Court to order MPEA to pay Petaja\u2019s attorney fees, totaling $100,975. MPEA did not respond to this request. The District Court denied Petaja\u2019s request on the ground it had no legal authority to award attorney fees, stating, \u201c[d]espite the incomprehensible admission by MPEA to the award of $100,975 in attorney fees against it, the Court will not grant the award.\u201d MPEA appeals from the jury verdict. Petaja cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">\u00b612 The Court reviews a jury verdict to determine whether it is supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Magart v. Shank, </em>2000 MT 279, \u00b6 4, 302 Mont. 151, 13 P.3d 390. The standard of review for whether the verdict is consistent with the law and instructions is also substantial evidence. <em>Drilcon, Inc. v. Roil Energy Corp., </em>230 Mont. 166, 178, 749 P.2d 1058, 1065 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">\u00b613 A district court\u2019s application of <em>res judicata </em>is an issue of law that is reviewed for correctness. <em>Touris v. Flathead County, </em>2011 MT 165, \u00b6 10, 361 Mont. 172, 258 P.3d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">\u00b614 A district court\u2019s conclusion regarding the existence of legal authority to award attorney fees is reviewed for correctness. <em>City of Helena v. Svee, </em>2014 MT 311, \u00b6 7, 377 Mont. 158, 339 P.3d 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b615 <em>1. Did substantial evidence support the jury verdict finding MPEA breached its duty of fair representation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b616 Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if weak and conflicting. <em>Siebken v. Voderberg, </em>2015 MT 296, \u00b6 12, 381 Mont. 256, 359 P.3d 1073. It consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be less than a preponderance. <em>Marriage of Schmitz, </em>255 Mont. 159, 165, 841 P.2d 496, 500 (1992). It is the role of the jury to determine the weight and credibility of the evidence, and this Court will defer to the jury\u2019s role. <em>Upky v. Marshall Mountain, LLC, </em>2008 MT 90, \u00b6 23, 342 Mont. 273, 180 P.3d 651 (citation omitted). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Upky, </em>\u00b6 23. Where conflicting evidence exists, we will not overturn a jury\u2019s decision to believe one party over another. <em>Upky, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>Samson v. State, </em>2003 MT 133, \u00b6 11, 316 Mont. 90, 69 P.3d 1154).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b617  Under the substantial evidence standard, MPEA\u2019s admissions of fact as deemed by the court present an insurmountable obstacle on appeal. The jury was instructed to accept as true that MPEA had refused to meet with Petaja and her husband to discuss the Step 2 grievance, failed to file Petaja\u2019s Step 2 grievance, failed to notify Petaja that it would not file Petaja\u2019s Step 2 grievance, failed to verify that Petaja had exhausted her administrative remedies, and, without Petaja\u2019s knowledge, signed a settlement agreement on Petaja\u2019s behalf with the County that purported to resolve all claims between Petaja and the County. These admissions of fact presented the jury with significantly more than a \u201cmere scintilla\u201d of evidence that MPEA\u2019s conduct was \u201carbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith.\u201d Any evidence MPEA presented at trial that showed MPEA\u2019s conduct was reasonable was therefore conflicting at best, which precludes the jury\u2019s verdict from being overturned. <em>Upky, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\u00b618 <em>2. Was the jury verdict contrary to the instructions and law ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u00b619 MPEA argues the jury\u2019s verdict was inconsistent and contrary to the law because \u201cthe employer [was] found not at fault,\u201d which means \u201cthe union is liable for nothing - it did not increase the damages caused by the employer\u2019s wrongful conduct because the employer committed no wrong.\u201d This is incorrect for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">\u00b620  First, MPEA misapprehends the jury\u2019s verdict regarding the County\u2019s fault. Whether Petaja\u2019s discrimination claim against the County was time barred was submitted as a factual question to the jury. It was therefore possible for the jury to believe the County discriminated against Petaja, only to also find that the meritorious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>claim was time barred. Although we do not speculate on how the jury-reached its decision, <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating Serv. v. </em>HKM Assocs., 265 Mont. 494, 513, 878 P.2d 248, 259 (1994), it is entirely possible the jury found the County discriminated against Petaja, but that the claim was time barred, given the jury was instructed that in order to recover against MPEA, Petaja had to prove (1) she was a member of MPEA\u2019s collective bargaining unit, (2) <em>the County violated the terms of the CBA, </em>and (3) MPEA breached its duty to act in good faith. Under the verdict form used, MPEA cannot prove otherwise. The jury\u2019s verdict is therefore not demonstrably inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b621 Second, although MPEA cites ample authority for the proposition that a union is liable only for increases in the employee\u2019s damages caused by the union\u2019s refusal to process a meritorious grievance, the jury received no such damages instruction. Instead, the jury was instructed to compensate Petaja for \u201cthe damages, harm, or detriment caused by [MPEA\u2019s] violation.\u201d We have long adhered to the rule that \u201can instruction given without obj ection becomes the law of the case\u201d for this purpose. <em>Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 144, 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561. The jury\u2019s verdict was therefore not contrary to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"AUr\">\u00b622 <em>3. Was Petaja\u2019s claim barred by res judicata?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u00b623 In responding to a complaint, the defense of res judicata must be pled as an affirmative defense. Mont. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1). The failure to affirmatively plead a defense set forth in Rule 8(c) results in a waiver of that defense. <em>Nitzel v. Wickman, </em>283 Mont. 304, 312, 940 P.2d 451, 456 (1997). Because trial counsel for MPEA did not properly raise this issue before the District Court, we decline to address it on appeal. <em>In re Transfer Terr. From Poplar Elem. Sch. Dist. No. 9 to Froid Elem. Sch. Dist. No. 65, </em>2015 MT 278, \u00b6 18, 381 Mont. 145, 364 P.3d 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"Aso\">\u00b624 <em>4. Did the District Court have legal authority to award attorney fees?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\u00b625 Petaja argues on cross-appeal that the District Court had legal authority to award her attorney fees incurred in litigating this action. Montana follows the American Rule that, absent a specific statutory or contractual provision, a prevailing party generally is not entitled to recovery of its attorneys\u2019 fees in prosecuting or defending the action. <em>Trustees of Ind. Univ. v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, \u00b6 19, 315 Mont. 210, 69 P.3d 663. We have recognized equitable exceptions to the American Rule, <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 19, but construe these exceptions narrowly \u201clest they swallow the rule.\u201d <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 248, \u00b6 23, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">\u00b626  There are no contractual or statutory provisions applicable here, nor do any of the equitable exceptions apply. Despite MPEA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\u201cincomprehensible admission\u201d to an award of $100,975 in attorney fees, the District Court correctly found it had no legal authority to award attorney fees in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-5\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b546-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE MCGRATH,</author>\n<p id=\"AYp\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b628 I concur in the result reached by the majority but not all that is said in the majority Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u00b629 In \u00b6 23, the majority disposes of MPEA\u2019s contention that Petaja\u2019s claims were barred by claim preclusion or res judicata by concluding that her attorney Carter Picotte did not properly raise the issue in District Court. The majority also implies the claim preclusion was never raised below and was therefore waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">\u00b630 The record shows that MPEA specifically raised claim preclusion in its answer to the Second Amended Complaint and again in the Pretrial Order. Therefore, there was no waiver of the defense based upon a failure to plead as required by M. R. Civ. P. 8(c). However, it is clear that after raising the defense, trial counsel never brought it to the District Court for a decision. The defense was therefore waived not by a failure to plead, but by a failure to subsequently pursue it in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">\u00b631 In any event, the res judicata defense rested upon the proposition that Petaja\u2019s claims were adjudicated against her in the Board of Personnel Appeals. The only action taken by the BOPA on Petaja\u2019s grievance was to assign an investigator who wrote a report concluding that Petaja\u2019s claims lacked merit. There was no adjudication, quasi-judicial or otherwise, sufficient to support res judicata. <em>Nasi v. Dep\u2019t of Highways, </em>231 Mont. 395, 397-98, 753 P.2d 327, 329 (1988).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
