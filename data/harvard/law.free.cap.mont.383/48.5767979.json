Did the District Court err by holding the treatment plan was appropriate?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by terminating Father\u2019s parental rights?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">\u00b63 J.B., Jr. (J.B.) was only a few weeks old when his parents, J.B., Sr. (Father), and K.S. (Mother), took him shoplifting at Missoula\u2019s JC Penney store. When confronted by security, Mother fled in her car with J.B. Father pulled a knife, declaring he was \u201cnot returning to prison,\u201d and fled on foot. At the time, Father was on probation, and two outstanding felony warrants for his arrest had been issued from Ravalli County.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">\u00b64 Long before this incident, the Department of Public Health and Human Services, Child and Family Services Division (Department), were familiar with Mother and Father. The Department had previously been involved with proceedings regarding J.B.\u2019s siblings, including the termination of Father\u2019s parental rights to J.B.\u2019s brother, E.B., on grounds of abandonment. After receiving the report of the shoplift-turned-robbery, the Department investigated the incident and filed a petition for Emergency Protective Services, Adjudication of J.B. as a Youth in Need of Care, and Temporary Legal Custody. The District Court granted the Department\u2019s petition upon Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s stipulation to the adjudication of J.B. as a Youth in Need of Care. J.B. was then placed in a foster home with his sibling, E.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">\u00b65 In the Ravalli County action related to the two outstanding felony warrants, Father was sentenced to ten years suspended on each felony, to run concurrently with an unspecified sentence Father was serving in another Ravalli County action. The record does not indicate the length of the other sentence. In the Missoula County robbery action that arose from the incident here, the District Court, citing Father\u2019s seven prior felony convictions, sentenced him to the Department of Corrections for 20 years with 18 years suspended, to run concurrently with his sentences in Ravalli County.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">\u00b66 The Department provided a treatment plan for Father while he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>was incarcerated, which was intended to preserve Father\u2019s parent-child relationship with J.B. The treatment plan had several goals designed to provide the Department with \u201cthe necessary information to determine whether it will be safe for [J.B.] to return to [Father\u2019s] care,\u201d and to instill \u201clong-term change and... lasting stability so that further intervention by [the Department] is no longer needed.\u201d The treatment plan required Father to perform numerous tasks, including refraining from committing further criminal offenses, completing a chemical dependency evaluation, and attending available parenting classes. The treatment plan stated the completion date for these tasks was \u201congoing.\u201d Father, represented by counsel, stipulated to the treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b67 Although Father completed a chemical dependency evaluation and attended group therapy sessions, he was involved in numerous behavioral incidents while incarcerated, including flooding his cell, breaking a sprinkler head, and not complying with orders. At the termination hearing, Father testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">Q: When you went into Missoula County Detention Facility in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">June of 2014, you were involved in several behavioral incidents in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">there, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">A: Yes, a few.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">Q: Including flooding your cell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">Q: Breaking a sprinkler head?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-13\">Q: Disruptive behavior and not complying with orders?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-14\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-15\">Q: And then just recently in boot camp you were disciplined for</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-16\">violating and refusing to comply with a direct order, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-17\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-18\">\u00b68 The Department, alleging Father\u2019s treatment plan had not been successful, petitioned the District Court to terminate Father\u2019s parental rights to J.B. The District Court agreed, holding the treatment plan \u201cwas not successful\u201d and that Father had an \u201cinability to conform his conduct to the law\u201d that was \u201cunlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d J.B. had been living in foster care with his brother, E.B., for over 15 months at that time.

Findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>In re D.B., </em>2007 MT 246, \u00b6 18, 339 Mont. 240, 168 P.3d 691. A factual finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if review of the record convinces the Court a mistake was made. <em>In re </em>2012 MT 137, \u00b6 10, 365 Mont. 298, 280 P.3d 899. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party when determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the district court\u2019s findings. <em>In re B.D., </em>2015 MT 339, \u00b6 5, 381 Mont. 505, 362 P.3d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b611 A district court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is a mistake of law or a finding of fact clearly erroneous that amounts to an abuse of discretion. <em>In re M.N., </em>2011 MT 245, \u00b6 14, 362 Mont. 186, 261 P.3d 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\u00b612 Under \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, a court may terminate parental rights upon a finding, established by clear and convincing evidence, that the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">(i) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-10\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">\u00b613 Father makes two challenges on appeal. First, he argues the District Court erred by concluding the treatment plan was appropriate. Second, he argues the District Court erred by concluding the treatment plan was not successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">\u00b614 <em>1. Did the District Court err by holding the treatment plan was appropriate?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u00b615 Father argues the treatment plan was not appropriate because it provided no deadlines, instead stating the completion date for each task was \u201congoing.\u201d The Department counters that Father did not properly preserve this issue for review by timely objecting to the treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b616  \u201cWhere a parent fails to object to a treatment plan in a timely manner, the parent waives any argument regarding the propriety of the treatment plan.\u201d <em>In re T.S., </em>2013 MT 274, \u00b6 25, 372 Mont. 79, 310 P.3d 538 (citing <em>In re C.J.M., </em>2012 MT 137, \u00b6 16, 365 Mont. 298, 280 P.3d 899); <em>see also In re A.A., </em>2005 MT 119, \u00b6\u00b6 21-28, 327 Mont. 127, 112 P.3d 993 (parent who, with representation of counsel, stipulated to several treatment plans, and failed to object in a timely manner, waived her argument that the treatment plans were not appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"ATe\">\u00b617 The treatment plan, upon Father\u2019s stipulation, was approved by the District Court in March 2014. Father was represented by counsel. It was not until just before the termination hearing, in March 2015, that Father raised an objection to the lack of deadlines in his treatment plan. If Father was legitimately concerned about the lack of deadlines in the treatment plan, he could have raised the issue when the plan was before the District Court for approval. Neither did Father raise a concern about the lack of deadlines during the course of the plan\u2019s implementation, waiting until right before the termination hearing to raise the issue. We agree with the Department. Under T.S., Father waived his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b618 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by terminating Father\u2019s parental rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u00b619 Father argues the District Court abused its discretion because its legal conclusion that Father\u2019s treatment plan was not successful was based on the finding that Father\u2019s incarceration rendered the plan unsuccessful \u2014 a rationale we expressly forbade in <em>In re A.T., </em>2003 MT 154, 316 Mont. 255, 70 P.3d 1247. While we acknowledge Father\u2019s point regarding sole reliance on incarceration contemplated by a treatment plan, we affirm the District Court because of additional findings sufficient to support the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the plan was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\u00b620  Section 41-3-609(1)(f)(i), MCA, is written in the disjunctive: the Department can meet its burden by showing either the treatment plan has not been complied with, \u201cor has not been successful.\u201d We have recognized that the disjunctive language indicates a district court may find a treatment plan unsuccessful \u201ceven if the parent has completed all the required tasks.\u201d <em>In re D.F., </em>2007 MT 147, \u00b6 36, 337 Mont. 461, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>161 P.3d 825 (citing <em>In re A.F., </em>2003 MT 254, \u00b6 25, 317 Mont. 367, 77 P.3d 266); <em>see also In re D.A., </em>2008 MT 247, \u00b6 22, 344 Mont. 513, 189 P.3d 631 (\u201cWell-intentioned efforts toward successful completion of a treatment plan do not demonstrate either the completion or the success of the plan.\u201d) (citation omitted). However, a district court may not conclude the treatment plan has been unsuccessful simply because of a parent\u2019s incarceration status when the parent\u2019s incarceration status was known and considered by the Department when formulating the plan. <em>A. T., </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b621 The District Court\u2019s conclusion that the treatment plan was unsuccessful was based in part on Finding of Fact 13, which stated Father \u201chas been incarcerated since the inception of this case and was not released from his incarceration so that he could parent [J.B.].\u201d The Department\u2019s treatment plan expressly considered Father\u2019s incarceration and nothing in the record indicates Father\u2019s sentence was altered from that which the Department contemplated when it formulated the treatment plan. Had the District Court relied on nothing more, the District Court\u2019s decision to terminate may well have conflicted with our decision in <em>A.T. </em>However, a review of additional findings establishes adequate grounds for termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b622 To terminate parental rights under \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, a district court must make two basic findings. First, the district court must find the treatment plan \u201chas not been complied with ... or has been unsuccessful.\u201d Section 41-3-609(l)(f)(i), MCA. Second, the district court must find \u201cthe conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d Section 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii), MCA. The phrase, <em>\u201cthe </em>conduct or condition\u201d (emphasis added), indicates that \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii), MCA, is referring to a prior finding of a conduct or condition that has rendered the parent unfit. Given the statute does not expressly require the district court to make such a finding, the meaning of the statute is that the condition rendering the parent unfit is the condition(s) or reason(s) in \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(i), MCA, that caused the treatment plan to be unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"A_K\">\u00b623 Finding of Fact 14 states \u201cFather\u2019s conduct or condition of inability to conform his conduct to the law resulting in incarceration, and inability to remain free of illicit drugs when out of incarceration, is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d The District Court\u2019s finding that Father had an \u201cinability to conform his conduct to the law,\u201d if supported by the evidence, establishes the condition that rendered Father unfit, i.e., the condition that rendered the treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>plan unsuccessful.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b624 Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if weak and conflicting. <em>Siebken v. Voderberg, </em>2015 MT 296, \u00b6 12, 381 Mont. 256, 359 P.3d 1073. It consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be less than a preponderance. <em>Marriage of Schmitz, </em>255 Mont. 159, 165, 841 P.2d 496, 500 (1992). Further, it is presumed that terminating a parent\u2019s rights is in the child\u2019s best interests when the child has been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months. <em>D.B., </em>\u00b6 40 (citing \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA). The presumption is not a sufficient basis, by itself, to terminate parental rights. D.B., \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u00b625 Although it appears Father had completed several tasks of his plan, the uncontroverted evidence establishes that Father had acted out while incarcerated, including flooding his cell, breaking a sprinkler head, disruptive behavior, and refusing to follow orders. While the District Court did not enter findings regarding Father\u2019s conduct while incarcerated, the evidence was uncontested, admitted by Father, and was necessarily implied by the District Court\u2019s finding that Father was unable to conform his conduct to the law. <em>See In re </em>S.M., 2014 MT 309, \u00b6 28, 377 Mont. 133, 339 P.3d 23 (\u201c[UJnder the doctrine of implied findings, we may consult hearing transcripts in addition to the written findings. This doctrine holds that where \u2018findings are general in terms, any findings not specifically made, but necessary to the determination, are deemed to have been implied, if supported by the evidence.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). Father argues that his treatment plan required only that he refrain from committing further criminal offenses, and that the State has never charged him or proven the elements of a crime arising out of these incidents. However, while he was not criminally charged, Father\u2019s admitted property destruction could well have supported a charge. The larger point is that Father was clearly not conforming his conduct to the legal requirements of his incarceration, and therefore not achieving the \u201clong-term change and ... lasting stability\u201d required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>by the treatment plan for him to parent a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b626  This evidence represents more than a \u201cmere scintilla\u201d in support of the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Father had an inability to conform his conduct to the law, rendering the treatment plan unsuccessful. Given the presumption that termination was in J.B.\u2019s best interests, <em>D.B., </em>\u00b6 40, and that a treatment plan may be found unsuccessful \u201ceven if the parent has completed all the required tasks,\u201d D.F., \u00b6 36, we cannot conclude the District Court\u2019s finding that the treatment plan was unsuccessful was clear error. The termination of Father\u2019s parental rights was therefore not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b79-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-19\"> Mother\u2019s parental rights to J.B., Jr., were also terminated by the District Court.

The District Court could have satisfied both subsections by finding \u201cthe treatment plan was unsuccessful because of Father\u2019s inability to conform his conduct to the law\u201d and then finding \u201cthat condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d As long as the condition found to render the parent unfit, i.e., the condition rendering the treatment plan unsuccessful, is clearly articulated in a district court\u2019s findings, as here, the particular formulation of the finding will generally not matter.

The evidence establishes that, although not required given the provisions of \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(c), MCA, an appropriate treatment plan was approved by the court, but was not successful because Father remained unfit and unable to provide J.B. with parental care. I would affirm the District Court, however, on the alternative basis that Father had his rights to J.B.\u2019s sibling, E.B., involuntarily terminated and that the circumstances relating to the prior termination were relevant to his ability to adequately care for J.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\u00b629 The applicable criteria for termination of Father\u2019s rights are set forth in \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(a-f), MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State relied upon two of the criteria in its petition seeking termination: subsection (l)(f) \u2014 that J.B. was adjudicated a Youth in Need of Care, an appropriate treatment plan was approved, but unsuccessful, and Father\u2019s condition was not likely to change within a reasonable time; and subsection (l)(d) \u2014 that Father had subjected a child to the circumstances listed in \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(e), MCA, in that Father had his \u201cparental rights to [E.B.] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>involuntarily terminated and the circumstances related to the termination of parental rights are relevant to Father\u2019s ability to adequately care for [J.B.].\u201d We have explained that \u201c[a] prior termination, followed by a parent\u2019s demonstration of continuing unfitness, indicates that decisive termination of parental rights is the best way to protect a child\u2019s welfare.\u201d <em>In re </em>J.W., 2013 MT 201, \u00b6 39, 371 Mont. 98, 307 P.3d 274 (internal quotation and citation omitted); <em>In re T.S.B., </em>2008 MT 23, \u00b6 48, 341 Mont. 204, 177 P.3d 429 (citation omitted) (\u201ccircumstances of a prior termination continue to be relevant in a later termination of a sibling under \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-609(1)(d) and 41-3-423(2)(e), MCA, unless the circumstances have changed\u201d); <em>In re A.H.D., </em>2008 MT 57, \u00b6 21, 341 Mont. 494, 178 P.3d 131; <em>In re A.P., </em>2007 MT 297, \u00b6 30, 340 Mont. 39, 172 P.3d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b630 In Father\u2019s prior termination for abandoning E.B., Father chose not to participate in the legal proceedings and, as here, was unwilling to put the needs of E.B. ahead of his own interests. As here, Father was unavailable to parent E.B. because of criminal activity, including periods of incarceration, and demonstrated a lack of initiative or interest in parenting E.B. Father ignored efforts by the Department to establish visits and contact with E.B. and ignored court orders to appear at the prior termination proceeding, just as he has ignored court orders relevant to these proceedings. In the instant proceedings, Father testified he has five children, ages ten and younger \u2014 one of whom is deceased and one of whom his rights have been terminated. Father\u2019s parenting with respect to two of his other children has been limited to occasionally \u201cwriting letters,\u201d a few visits in between periods of incarceration, and phone calls. However, those communications are not recent because Father is uncertain about where those children, C. and X., live because he has \u201clost contact\u201d with their respective moms. Father has failed to adequately provide for his children by remaining unemployed or incarcerated and demonstrates inadequate initiative to provide parental care for his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b631 The District Court listened to this testimony and took judicial notice of two sentences for which Father would remain incarcerated for several years. Father, with respect to all of his children, has never parented and demonstrates a clear propensity to engage in criminal behavior knowing the consequences of incarceration will remove him from his children\u2019s lives. The District Court\u2019s finding that the circumstances leading to the prior termination of Father\u2019s rights to E.B. remained relevant is supported by substantial evidence in the record which establishes Father has refused to take the initiative to parent any of his children. Father\u2019s termination of E.B. was a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>his demonstrated lack of interest and inability to make himself available to E.B. and is probative of Father\u2019s conduct in the instant proceedings \u2014 Father has similarly chosen to be absent from J.B.\u2019s life and remains unavailable to parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b632 The guiding principle in determining whether to terminate parental rights is always the best interests of the child and the district court is bound to give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the child \u2014 which take precedence over parental rights. Section 41-3-609(3), MCA; <em>In re K.J.B., </em>2007 MT 216, \u00b6 29, 339 Mont. 28, 168 P.3d 629. Here, there was substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s findings that the circumstances surrounding Father\u2019s prior termination remained relevant to his inability to parent J.B. Indeed, I believe Father\u2019s lack of initiative to make the necessary changes in his life to adequately parent was exhibited in both termination proceedings. The termination criteria set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-609(l)(d) and -423(2)(e), MCA, and relied upon by the District Court, is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\"> I believe this Court incorrectly stated in <em>A.T., </em>that \u201c[the Department] could have requested termination of father\u2019s parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(e), MCA.\u201d <em>AT., </em>\u00b6 23. The criteria for termination are set forth in subsection (1) of \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, and not subsection (4)(c). Section 41-3-609(4)(c), MCA, addresses whether a treatment plan is required in evaluating criteria pursuant to (l)(f), and does, not by itself, establish a basis for termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b81-5\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"ADz\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b633 I would reverse the termination of Father\u2019s parental rights on the record before the Court. The Department\u2019s termination request focused on Father\u2019s failure to comply with his treatment plan pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, and the Department failed to meet its burden of proof under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\u00b634 I do not take issue with the Court\u2019s analysis of the law. In particular, I agree that whether the treatment plan was appropriate is not properly before us in this appeal and that, under our precedent, the District Court could not conclude that Father\u2019s treatment plan was unsuccessful by virtue of his incarceration status alone, when that status \u201cwas known and considered by the Department when formulating the plan.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">\u00b635 \u201cThe Department has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory criteria for termination have been satisfied.\u201d <em>In re K.L., </em>2014 MT 28, \u00b6 14, 373 Mont. 421, 318 P.3d 691. As the Court observes, the Department sought termination primarily under \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA. The District Court\u2019s single finding addressing \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f)(i), MCA, stated that \u201cFather did not successfully complete his treatment plan because he has been incarcerated since the inception of this case and was not released from his incarceration so that he could parent [J.B.], Jr.\u201d But Father\u2019s treatment plan did not require that he be released from incarceration. The Phase I plan contemplated that Father would remain incarcerated throughout that Plan\u2019s duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u00b636 The Department offered no evidence at the termination hearing that Father had not complied with the tasks set forth in the treatment plan. Child Protection Specialist Amanda Graziano was the State\u2019s only witness who testified regarding Father\u2019s compliance with his treatment plan. Graziano testified extensively about Mother\u2019s failure to complete her treatment plan, including Mother\u2019s chemical dependency issues, substance abuse, use of illicit drugs, and inability to obtain adequate housing for herself. In contrast, when asked whether Father had met the goals and addressed the Department\u2019s concerns through his treatment plan, Graziano\u2019s only explanation was that Father \u201cwas not able to follow through\u201d because he had been incarcerated \u201cfor the duration of the case.\u201d On cross-examination, Graziano admitted that Father had been present at all hearings throughout the case and that the Department had been made aware of Father\u2019s status with the Department of Corrections (DOC) throughout the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b637 Father testified that during his incarceration he had completed one group therapy program and was in the process of completing two other group therapy programs. He also testified that he had not had any disciplinary issues while incarcerated with the DOC. Father explained that he was signed up to go to Connections Corrections and believed that after completing that program he would be able to be a better parent for his son. Father stated that when he gets to prerelease he intends to take parenting classes and participate in outpatient counseling programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b638 Although Father acknowledged in his testimony that he had acted out during his detention at the Missoula Assessment and Sanctions Center (MASC) while awaiting DOC placement, he had since been admitted to the Sanction Treatment Assessment Revocation and Transition (START) program and was in full compliance with all conditions of his confinement. His case manager, Patrick McGee, testified that Father had been \u201cvery compliant\u201d and \u201cpositive\u201d during his time at START and that Father had completed \u201cwhatever is necessary,\u201d including participating in mental health and chemical dependency counseling. McGee also testified that Father was administratively transferred out of the boot camp program because it \u201cwas not a good fit for him,\u201d and that Father had not had any disciplinary problems during his incarceration with the DOC. The Department offered no evidence that Father had any disciplinary infractions throughout his incarceration \u2014 including the incidents that Father acknowledged \u2014 and the District Court did not premise its decision on Father\u2019s \u201cdisruptive behavior\u201d while at MASC.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\u00b639 The Department also presented no evidence that Father\u2019s incarceration was expected to be long-term. There are many parents who serve time in prison without losing all rights to their children. Further, although the Department presented evidence regarding the prior termination of Father\u2019s rights to another child, it did not seek to forego the requirements of a treatment plan by filing its petition under \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(a) or (c), MCA. <em>See A.T., </em>\u00b6 24. The Court does not rely on the prior termination or long-term incarceration in affirming the District Court. Rather, the Court essentially concludes that Father\u2019s rights as a parent may be terminated because \u2014 despite the lack of any affirmative evidence from the Department \u2014 he acknowledged acting out while at the detention center and failing to follow an order. Opinion, \u00b6 25. That is an awfully thin reed, and one the District Court did not even mention in its findings of fact. Rather, as noted, the court relied exclusively on Father\u2019s incarceration to determine that he had not complied with his treatment plan. The Department well may have adequate grounds for termination in this case, particularly given Father\u2019s history and the prior termination of his parental rights to another child. It is perhaps the unlikelihood of Father\u2019s ultimate success that influences the Court\u2019s decision today. But the requirements of the law must be met, and the ruling has implications beyond this case. Having invoked \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, and given Father a treatment plan, the Department is bound to prove the elements of that statute before asking the court to terminate his rights. I would conclude that the Department failed to meet its burden.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
