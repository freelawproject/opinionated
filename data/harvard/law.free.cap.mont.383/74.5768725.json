He relies on a wheelchair for mobility. Prior to his initial commitment in 2014, S.G.R. had established a pattern of receiving his Social Security check on the first of each month, staying at a hotel, and drinking until his money ran out. He would then check in to the Community Crisis Center in Billings for the remainder of the month. While at the Community Crisis Center in early 2014, S.G.R. suffered a seizure as a result of alcohol withdrawal and was hospitalized. During his hospitalization, S.G.R. was diagnosed with dementia secondary to chronic alcoholism, which prompted the State to file a petition for involuntary commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">\u00b65 On February 7, 2014, S.G.R. consented to his initial commitment to the Montana State Hospital for a period not to exceed three months. Before the initial commitment expired, the State filed a petition for extension of commitment. On May 9, 2014, S.G.R.\u2019s commitment was extended without objection for a period not to exceed six months. He was transferred to the Nursing Care Center in June 2014. Upon admission to the Nursing Care Center, S.G.R. was diagnosed with depression and alcohol-induced dementia.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">\u00b66 On October 23,2014, Susan Stevens, a psychology specialist at the Nursing Care Center, petitioned the District Court to extend S.G.R.\u2019s commitment based on her opinion that S.G.R. was in need of further evaluation and treatment and that S.G.R. required detention \u201cto prevent injury to [himself] or to others.\u201d The next day, the District Court appointed a \u201cfriend\u201d and legal counsel for S.G.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">\u00b67 On December 16,2014, the District Court held a contested hearing at which S.G.R. was present and represented by counsel. Witnesses presented testimony that S.G.R. had received inpatient alcohol treatment numerous times over the years in several different states; had been to the Galen Chemical Dependency Unit at least seven times; had been admitted four times to the Montana State Hospital; and was presenting a \u201cconsistent pattern\u201d of staying sober for a few months, then starting to drink, isolating himself and quitting his medications, leading to paranoid delusions and significant seizures that recently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>had nearly killed him. While at the Nursing Care Center, S.G.R. had attempted three times to elope from the facility (leave without permission). On one elopement attempt, S.G.R. tried to take his wheelchair down a significant decline, over an embankment, toward several frog ponds. During the last elopement attempt, S.G.R. rolled his wheelchair into traffic attempting to flag down a ride. Stevens testified that in all three cases, especially the last incident, S.G.R. \u201cpresented himself in a very dangerous situation.\u201d Steve Cummings, another member of the Nursing Care Center staff, testified that S.G.R. was \u201cpretty aggressive, very verbally abusive,\u201d when staff attempted to bring him back to the facility on the most recent occasion, and that they had to summon assistance from law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b68 Stevens testified that S.G.R. has \u201cextremely poor\u201d insight into his alcoholism, denying it until the day of the hearing, and has no insight into his dementia \u201cand will deny it.\u201d With his dementia, Stevens advised the court, S.G.R. lacked ability to understand his circumstances or needs, and had a disregard for his safety. Stevens concluded that S.G.R.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">presents as a danger to himself because of his dementia which is [ex]acerbated by his alcoholism, which he shows a consistent pattern of relapsing and drinking the alcohol which then aggravates his mental health symptoms to the point that either a) he nearly dies or [b)] he becomes paranoid and suicidal. I also believe he does not have the means to care for himself outside of a structured environment at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\u00b69 Stevens\u2019s written mental health assessment further substantiated her concerns. It concluded that S.G.R. presented a danger to himself because of his lack of insight and judgment into his illness and his continued belief that he can live independently, without assistance with his illness, \u201cdespite nearly dying and being homeless.\u201d She opined that S.G.R. was not amenable to placement in a group home or release to the community \u201cdue to his age and history of leaving placements to drink, which exacerbates his mental illness. ... [and] his pervasive pattern of non-compliance to medical treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">\u00b610 S.G.R. testified, describing himself as an \u201cold cowboy\u201d who does not like being kept in \u201ccaptivity.\u201d He stated that if he was released, he would maintain his sobriety by attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and by continuing to take his prescribed medications. S.G.R. claimed that he had money in a bank account and that he owned a home in Wyoming, which he could live in if released.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">\u00b611 Cummings testified that S.G.R.\u2019s placement options were limited because of the combination of his mental illness and his alcoholism. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Cummings expressed concern that S.G.R. was unable to maintain sobriety, observing that during his stay at the State Hospital he \u201cmanaged to get away from them and caught a ride to a bar and had drinks there.\u201d Based on his conversations with S.G.R.\u2019s family, Cummings testified that it was \u201cnot an option\u201d for S.G.R. to return to the family home in Wyoming. Although Cummings committed to exploring admission into a veterans\u2019 home or assisted living facility, he believed it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d as the veterans\u2019 home tended to \u201crefuse most people\u201d with a mental health history, and an assisted living facility would not be suitable unless S.G.R. maintained sobriety.</p>\n<p id=\"ALU5\">\u00b612 At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court granted the petition because S.G.R. \u201cdoes suffer from a mental disease or defect, that being alcohol induced dementia, which leads to him being a danger to himself.\u201d The court cited S.G.R.\u2019s elopement risk and his inability to understand his own conditions as risks to his safety, particularly in light of his history of seizures and the risk of his \u201cget[ting] back on alcohol.\u201d On January 12, 2015, the District Court issued its Order for Recommitment requiring that S.G.R. be committed to the Nursing Care Center for a period not to exceed one year from December 16, 2014, and directing that the staff begin looking for alternative placement for him. S.G.R. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u00b613 We review commitment orders to determine whether a district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re S.M., </em>2014 MT 309, \u00b6 13, 377 Mont. 133, 339 P.3d 23. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if, after a review of the entire record, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>In re L.K.S., </em>2011 MT 21, \u00b6 14, 359 Mont. 191, 247 P.3d 1100. Whether a district court\u2019s findings of fact meet statutory requirements is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>In re L.L.A., </em>2011 MT 285, \u00b6 6, 362 Mont. 464, 267 P.3d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\u00b614 <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s order met the statutory requirements for extending commitment under \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127 and -128, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">\u00b615 Before a period of civil commitment expires, the \u201cprofessional person in charge of the patient at the place of commitment may petition the district court in the county where the patient is committed for extension of the commitment period.\u201d Section 53-21-128(l)(a), MCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u201cIf the court finds that the patient continues to suffer from a mental disorder and to require commitment, the court shall order commitment as set forth in \u00a7 53-21-127.\u201d Section 53-21-128(l)(d), MCA. Section 53-21-127(7), MCA, provides that commitment is justified so long as any one of the criteria listed under \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, is satisfied. The criteria are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">(a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">(b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">(c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent or to others because of the respondent\u2019s acts or omissions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">(d) whether the respondent\u2019s mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent\u2019s recent acts or omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent\u2019s mental condition to the point at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Section 53-21-126(1), MCA. Section 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA, requires the court to make certain findings of fact, including \u201ca detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">\u00b616 In its Order for Recommitment, the District Court did not specify which of the \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, criteria on which it relied to conclude that S.G.R. continued to require commitment. The court did, however, review procedural history and recount specific portions of testimony presented at the December hearing. Noting that they were \u201c[biased on testimony given at the hearing and the Mental Health Assessment filed by Sue Stevens,\u201d the court then set forth the following five findings of fact: 1) \u201c[S.G.R.] continues to suffer from the mental disorder of Dementia with behavioral disturbances, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Drug Induced Persisting Dementia, Alcohol Dependence and Insomnia\u201d; 2) \u201cCurrently, the most appropriate alternative and least restrictive placement for [S.G.R.] is the [Nursing Care Center], The Care Plan Team will start looking for other alternative placements\u201d; 3) \u201cThe treatment care plan as filed with this court appears to be appropriate for [S.G.R.] and should be continued with regular review\u201d; 4) It is necessary for the [Nursing Care Center] to be given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>authority to administer all medications deemed necessary and appropriate for [S.G.R.] and to administer those medications involuntarily, if necessary, as he is unable to appreciate the necessity for a proper medication regimen to control his mental illness\u201d; and 5) \u201cFergus County shall not be held responsible for any costs incurred in this matter. [S.G.R.] is a resident of Yellowstone County, which is the county responsible for any costs incurred in this matter as provided by MCA \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-128(l)(c), 53-21-132, and/or 53-21-113.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b617 S.G.R. argues that the District Court\u2019s findings in its Order for Recommitment were insufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements set forth above. The State counters that \u201c[a]lthough that section of the order does not contain detailed factual findings about S.G.R., the section of the order where the court summarized [hearing] testimony should also be viewed as findings.\u201d Additionally, the State suggests that this Court rely on the District Court\u2019s oral findings to evaluate whether the requirements under \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA, were met. Specifically, the State proposes that we rely on the District Court\u2019s statement at the conclusion of the hearing, \u201cWell the Court will find that [S.G.R.] does suffer from a mental disease or defect, that being alcohol induced dementia, which leads to him being a danger to himself.\u201d Further, the State proposes that we rely on the District Court\u2019s express comment that S.G.R.\u2019s delusions, elopement risk, and inability to understand his own conditions \u201cput him at risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b618 In L.L.A., L.L.A. challenged the sufficiency of a district court\u2019s factual findings supporting her involuntary commitment. L.L.A., \u00b6 6. In that case, the district court issued seven findings of fact supporting its order of commitment that were \u201cderived almost exclusively from the language of \u00a7 53-21-126, MCA.\u201d <em>L.L.A., </em>\u00b6 13. We reversed the order of commitment, concluding that the court\u2019s findings were insufficient because they lacked any references to L.L.A\u2019s actual behavior to demonstrate why she required commitment. <em>L.L.A., </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u00b619 Conversely, in <em>In re M.P.-L,, </em>2015 MT 338, 381 Mont. 496, 362 P.3d 627, we upheld the involuntary commitment order in the face of M.P.-L.\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the court\u2019s factual findings. In that case, the district court issued four findings of fact supporting its order of commitment. <em>M.P.-L., </em>\u00b6 18. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">The District Court included information in the findings reflecting M.P.-L.\u2019s circumstances leading to the court\u2019s conclusions under \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA. The evidence included conclusions from testimony by [the professional who conducted an evaluation of M.P.-L.] that M.P.-L.: suffered from mental illness; made three suicide threats; and continued to be a threat to herself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>M.P.-L., </em>\u00b6 19. We noted that although the district court\u2019s written findings are \u201cbare-boned,\u201d the court provided sufficient reasoning in its findings to justify commitment and satisfy the requirements under \u00a7 53-21-127(8), MCA. <em>M.P.-L., </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b620 We have applied the doctrine of implied findings in involuntary commitment cases, \u201cconsulting] hearing transcripts in addition to the written findings\u201d where the latter are claimed to be insufficient to support commitment. <em>S.M., </em>\u00b6 28. The doctrine of implied findings \u201cholds that where \u2018findings are general in terms, any findings not specifically made, but necessary to the determination, are deemed to have been implied, if supported by the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>S.M., </em>\u00b6 28 (quoting <em>In re Mental Health of S. C., </em>2000 MT 370, \u00b6 15, 303 Mont. 444, 15 P.3d 861). In <em>S.M., </em>we invoked the doctrine and held that a district court\u2019s written order of commitment must be \u201cminimally sufficient\u201d and at least adequate to apprise the staff at the receiving facility, treatment professionals, and law enforcement of the particular condition and behaviors that gave rise to the need for commitment. <em>S.M., </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b621 There is not a substantive distinction between the order entered in this case and the commitment orders we affirmed in <em>M.P.-L. </em>and <em>S.M. </em>Although we noted in <em>S.M. </em>that the District Court \u201ccould have been more specific and listed more of the facts,\u201d we relied on the record, the court\u2019s oral and written findings, and the doctrine of implied findings to conclude that the order was \u201cminimally sufficient\u201d and properly based on the respondent\u2019s \u201cindividual circumstances.\u201d <em>S.M., </em>\u00b6 22. Similarly, here, although the District Court\u2019s written findings are spartan, they were stated in terms, like in <em>M.P.-L., </em>that recounted specific witness testimony from the hearing. <em>M.P.-L., </em>\u00b6 18. Here, in fact, the court expressly noted that its findings were \u201cbased on\u201d that evidence. The record establishes that the court\u2019s written, oral, and implied findings properly were based on S.G.R.\u2019s \u201cindividual circumstances.\u201d <em>S.M., </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b622 The order that we reversed in <em>L.L.A. </em>was insufficient because it \u201ccontain[ed] no indication of the facts upon which [the court] found that\u201d L.L. A. was substantially unable to protect her life and safety, and no information specifically reflecting L.L.A\u2019s circumstances or particular behaviors that supported the district court\u2019s conclusions. <em>L.L.A., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11,13. Here, in contrast, the order identifies the <em>testimony </em>and evidence on which the court premised its findings. The evidence and testimony support the court\u2019s conclusion that S.G.R.\u2019s mental illness required extension of his commitment because he was a \u201cdanger to himself\u2019 and was \u201cunable to appreciate the necessity for a proper medication regimen to control his mental illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u00b623  Although the District Court\u2019s recommitment order is not a model, it does not suffer the same statutory defect as in <em>L.L.A. </em>because the order reflects the particular circumstances and behaviors that supported the court\u2019s conclusions, and because the court provided sufficient reasoning to justify its decision. The District Court\u2019s oral findings \u2014 which are appropriate for consideration under our precedent, <em>S.M., </em>\u00b6 27 \u2014 substantiate its determination that the standards for recommitment had been satisfied. We conclude that the District Court\u2019s written order, when considered as a whole and together with the court\u2019s oral findings, was \u201cminimally sufficient\u201d to meet the involuntary commitment statute\u2019s requirement for a \u201cdetailed statement\u201d on which its conclusions were based, and that it was supported by substantial evidence. <em>S.M., </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b624 S.G.R. also faults the District Court for failing to identify which subsection of the applicable statute authorized the commitment. Based on the court\u2019s oral statements, S.G.R. \u201cassum[es]\u201d that he was committed pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-126(1)(d), MCA, and argues that his commitment to the Nursing Care Center is not legally or factually supportable under that subsection. S.G.R. argues that because the court failed to tie its findings to any other subsection of the statute, it appears to have premised commitment on \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(d), MCA, which required the court to commit him to a community placement instead of to the Nursing Care Center. Section 53-21-127(7), MCA. The District Court\u2019s oral finding that S.G.R.\u2019s dementia and inability to understand his own condition \u201cput him at risk\u201d of danger does reflect the language of subsection (1)(d). But, although its findings about the reason for commitment were \u201cgeneral in terms,\u201d they clearly imply that S.G.R. was recommitted because he was \u201csubstantially unable to provide for his own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety.\u201d Section 53-21-126(l)(a), MCA. The District Court recognized that S.G.R. could not live independently, lacked appreciation for his condition, and was unable to keep himself safe. As discussed above, the record contains substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s conclusions in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b625 For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the District Court\u2019s written order was minimally sufficient and supported by substantial evidence. Its January 12, 2015 Order for Recommitment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, WHEAT and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b105-8\">JUSTICE McKINNON, dissenting.</judges>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u00b626 The order extending S.G.R.\u2019s commitment was not \u201cminimally sufficient,\u201d as this Court holds today, and his involuntary commitment must be reversed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court\u2019s findings failed to detail the factual basis of its determination that Respondent continued to suffer from a mental disorder and required continued commitment. The District Court\u2019s findings, therefore, failed to satisfy the statutory criteria outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127 and -128, MCA. The court\u2019s summarization of the testimony presented and restatement of Respondent\u2019s diagnosis do not meet the minimum \u201cbare-boned\u201d findings found sufficient in <em>M.P.-L. </em>and <em>S.M. </em>and do not constitute strict compliance with the statutory mandate. Finally, this Court utilizes the doctrine of implied <em>findings </em>inappropriately to determine a conclusion of law: \u201cthat the standards for recommitment had been satisfied.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 23. In fact, the District Court failed to indicate pursuant to which statutory subsection it found S.G.R. required recommitment\u2014\u00a7 53-21-126(1)(a), (b), (c), or (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b627 The situation in <em>M.P.-L., </em>is distinguishable from S.G.R.\u2019s. There, the district court issued two orders. This Court determined that the first order was \u201cdeficient and failed to comply with \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA,\u201d because it did not include a detailed statement of facts. <em>M.P.-L., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11. However, the district court issued an additional order, which, when viewed together with the first order, \u201cprovided proper facts and information the court used to determine that M.P.-L. was suffering a mental disorder requiring commitment.\u201d <em>M.P.-L., </em>\u00b6 22. More importantly, the statutory subsection upon which the court relied to find M.P.-L. required commitment was set forth in the court\u2019s order. Particularly, the court\u2019s factual findings that M.P.-L. attempted suicide on three occasions established that M.P.-L. presented an \u201cimminent threat of injury to [herself],\u201d under \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(c), MCA. <em>M.P.-L., </em>\u00b6 22. We concluded this was minimally sufficient and went on to \u201creiterate that the statutory requirements of an involuntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>commitment must be strictly adhered to by the district courts, including the requirement of detailed findings under \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA, in order to justify appropriate decisions and to follow proper procedure.\u201d <em>M.P.-L., </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b628 S.M., is even less applicable to the case at bar than <em>M.P. -L. </em>In that case, S.M. did not primarily challenge the sufficiency of the district court\u2019s factual findings, as the Court misstates. Opinion, \u00b6 20. Instead, \u201cS.M. argue[d] there was insufficient evidence to support the District Court\u2019s determination that she was substantially unable to care for her own health and safety\u201d or, alternatively, that the \u201cDistrict Court failed to make a \u2018detailed statement of facts\u2019 supporting this determination.\u201d <em>S.M., </em>\u00b6 19. This distinction is important and led to us utilizing the doctrine of implied findings, which was appropriate for our analysis of her insufficient evidence challenge, but inappropriate for our analysis of S.G.R.\u2019s insufficient order challenge. In <em>S.M., </em>we also discussed whether the findings of fact were sufficient; however, the challenge was focused on whether evidence in the record supported the district court\u2019s conclusion that she required commitment under \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(d), MCA. <em>S.M., </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b629 The findings here do not specify what the court relied on to find S.G.R. suffered from a mental disorder or what facts, statute, or subsection the court considered and utilized to determine his continued commitment was necessary. This failure confused the parties\u2019 arguments on appeal. S.G.R., for the sake of his arguments on appeal, assumes the District Court extended his commitment under subsection (d) of \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, while the State assumes the District Court relied on subsection (c). This Court inexplicably determines that \u201calthough its findings about the reason for commitment were \u2018general in terms,\u2019 they clearly imply that S.G.R. was recommitted because he was \u2018substantially unable to provide for his own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety\u2019 \u201d under subsection (a). Opinion, \u00b6 24. This confusion demonstrates perfectly what the District Court failed to accomplish in its order. Contrary to being \u201cclear,\u201d it is completely unclear which statutory subsection of \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, the District Court relied upon in recommitting S.G.R. against his will. The District Court cannot rely on evidence in the record as a shortcut method to fill in gaps in its order that are required by statute. In light of the order\u2019s deficiencies, the statutory requirements authorizing S.G.R.\u2019s second extension of commitment were not satisfied and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b630 S.G.R.\u2019s second issue raised on appeal asks whether the District Court erred in extending his commitment to the Nursing Care Center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>instead of a community facility. He contends that the District Court was prohibited by statute from extending his commitment to the Nursing Care Center. Under \u00a7 53-21-127(7), MCA, \u201cif the court relies solely upon the criterion provided in 53-21-126(l)(d)\u201d (that if untreated, respondent \u201cwill become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety\u201d), \u201cthe court may require commitment only to a community facility or program or an appropriate course of treatment ... and may not require commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health nursing care center.\u201d Section 53-21-127(7), MCA. Because we do not know which statutory subsection of \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, the District Court relied upon to extend S.G.R.\u2019s commitment \u2014 it could be either subsection (a), (c), or (d) according to the parties and this Court \u2014 we cannot know whether \u00a7 53-21-127(7), MCA, applies or whether S.G.R.\u2019s second argument on appeal has merit. Despite the Court\u2019s efforts to assemble an order upon the basis of implied findings, a statement by the District Court during trial that S. G.R.\u2019s mental condition \u201cput him at risk\u201d does not equate to a statutory determination being made by the <em>trial </em>court regarding the necessity of commitment. That S.G.R.\u2019s mental condition \u201cput him at risk\u201d could have been logically construed as support for him being \u201csubstantially unable to provide for his own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety\u201d under \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(a), MCA; an \u201cimminent threat of injury to [himself]\u201d under \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(c), MCA; or even \u201cpredictably result in deterioration of [his] mental condition to the point at which [he] will become a danger to self,\u201d under \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(d), MCA. It does not, however, \u201cclearly imply\u201d any of these options.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b631 I believe the District Court\u2019s order extending S.G.R.\u2019s commitment is insufficient and must be reversed. However, the most concerning error the Court makes is in failing to appreciate the role an appellate court has to review determinations of the trial court. When those determinations have not been made in the first instance, we cannot string a web of implied findings and baldly state that it is \u201cclear\u201d upon which statutory subsection the trial court relied in fashioning its order of commitment. We do more harm to litigants and our precedent through such faulty analysis and manipulation of the record than had we simply reversed an individual\u2019s order of commitment for its insufficiency, despite that individual\u2019s need for assistance.</p>\n<judges id=\"b108-5\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE McKinnon.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-6\"> S.G.R. does not raise, and therefore I do not address, whether the time of Respondent\u2019s second extension of commitment, of up to one year, violates the time limitations imposed by \u00a7 53-21-128, MCA. I note, however, that \u00a7 53-21-128(1) and (2), MCA, appear to place a time limitation of six months on any order extending commitment, while \u00a7 53-21-128(3), MCA, appears to prohibit further extensions from affecting a patient\u2019s custody for more than one year. It does not appear that, under any construction of \u00a7 53-21-128, MCA, a second order for recommitment could be for as long as one year. However, the relationships between the various time limitations found in the subsections of \u00a7 53-21-128, MCA, have not been raised by the parties or addressed by the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
