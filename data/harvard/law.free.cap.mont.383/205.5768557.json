Did the Water Court correctly conclude that the cumulative volume of water Eldorado may divert from the Teton River for the Eldorado, Truchot, Dennis, and Beattie Rights is limited to no more than 15,000 acre-feet per year?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\n<em>2.

Did the Water Court err when it limited the flow rate of the Truchot Right to 300 miner\u2019s inches instead of225 miner\u2019s inches?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\u00b63 The present case is the second segment of Water Court Case 41O-129. The previously litigated portion stemmed from Eldorado\u2019s claimed use of the Bateman Ditch, which also involved a question certified by the District Court to the Water Court pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following our decision in <em>Giese </em>the Water Court bifurcated the case into 41O-129A and 41O-129B. Case 41O-129A was limited to the issues involving the use of the Bateman Ditch. We reviewed those issues in <em>Eldorado Co-Op Canal Co. v. Lower Teton Joint </em>Objectors, 2014 MT 272, 376 Mont. 420, 337 P.3d 74. Presently, we review the parties\u2019 appeals of the Water Court\u2019s determination of the remaining aspects of the case, styled as Case 41O-129B.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">\u00b64 The Teton River\u2019s headwaters are northwest of the town of Choteau, located in west-central Montana along the Rocky Mountain Front. After leaving the mountains, the river travels east, making southeast and northeast turns, before joining the Marias River around one hundred and fifty miles later. The Teton River does not have an onstream reservoir capable of stabilizing late season flows. The sources of early season high flows and late season low flows are spring runoff and the continued melting snowpack. It is common for stretches of the river to be completely dry by late summer. The Teton River is located in the Teton River Basin, 410, which has not yet received final adjudication and is currently controlled by a Temporary Preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b65 Eldorado is one of four companies that divert water from the Teton River. It is historically considered to be the most senior of the four companies. Eldorado claims water rights based upon the rights decreed in <em>Perry v. Beattie, </em>Cause No. 371, Montana Eleventh Judicial District Court, Teton County, March 28, 1908.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the <em>Perry </em>decree the District Court established the priority dates and flow rates for approximately 40 water rights. Of these decreed water rights Eldorado owns four. They are referred to as the Eldorado, Truchot, Dennis, and Beattie Rights, which are based on their ownership at the time of the decree. Initially, Eldorado owned the Eldorado Right, and over time it acquired these other three named rights. Under the purview of the District Court, a Water Commissioner has historically delivered water to the applicable water users in line with their rights as established in the <em>Perry </em>decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b66 As required by the Montana Water Use Act (WUA), codified at Title 85, MCA, Eldorado filed a Statement of Claim for its four decreed rights \u2014 for its irrigation rights and for its stockwater rights \u2014 on an Irrigation District Claim Form. During the examination of Basin 410 the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) assigned individual claims to each of Eldorado\u2019s four Perry rights. Eldorado was assigned a total of eight claims: four irrigation claims and four stockwater claims. Thus, each of the four named rights (Eldorado, Truchot, Dennis, and Beattie) contains an irrigation and a stockwater component.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b67 Objectors LTJO and TCRC, along with others, filed objections to Eldorado\u2019s claims. Some of the objectors were able to come to an agreement with Eldorado during the settlement process. LTJO and TCRC were not. In June 2012, the parties participated in a four-day trial in front of a Water Master. In August 2013, the Water Master issued a Master\u2019s report related to Eldorado\u2019s water claims based on the four named rights. All parties filed objections to the Master\u2019s report. In November 2014, the Water Court responded to the parties\u2019 objections and issued an order amending and adopting the Master\u2019s report. Issues One and Two of this appeal pertain to volume, the facts of which are discussed in this section. Issue Three pertains to flow rate, the facts of which are discussed exclusively in the discussion of Issue Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">A. Master\u2019s report</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u00b68 The Water Master issued a report with his findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding each of Eldorado\u2019s claimed water rights. Pertinent to the issues on appeal, the Master determined the four named rights should be limited to the following total volume quantifications: 1) Eldorado Right limited to 9,000 acre-feet per year; 2) Truchot Right limited to 450 acre-feet per year; 3) Dennis Right limited to 300 acre-feet per year; and 4) Beattie Right limited to 600 acre-feet per year \u2014 totaling 10,350 acre-feet per year. The Master based these findings in part on witness testimony in an effort to determine the historic volume used for each right.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b69 The Master stated in the report that Eldorado\u2019s volume has continued to increase, most notably after 1980, due to Eldorado\u2019s expansion of its irrigated acres and period of use. The Master stated the historic volume should be determined as of the date of a right\u2019s perfection, which he determined to be 1908 for the Eldorado Right based on the completion of Eldorado\u2019s original intent to develop a ditch system. The Master outlined three possible methods to determine the volume: 1) based on actual diversion at the time of perfection; 2) based on the acres historically irrigated at the time of perfection plus a volume-per-acre standard; and 3) based on the decreed flow rate, the number of acres the flow rate could reasonably irrigate, and a volume-per-acre standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b610 The Master found problems with the evidence related to the first two methods. Specifically, the Master stated there was insufficient evidence to determine volume based on actual diversion, and the evidence related to the acreage historically irrigated at the time of perfection was not credible. Instead, he found the third method, based on the decreed flow rate, was the better method of determining volume for the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b611 For the third method of making a volume determination the decreed flow rate is the only precisely known fact. To determine the remaining two elements, number of acres the flow rate could reasonably irrigate, or duty of water, and the volume-per-acre standard, the Master analyzed the testimonial and documentary evidence to reach those determinations. The Master found the duty of water to be 0.5 miner\u2019s inch per acre based on the proposed findings of fact Eldorado submitted during the <em>Perry </em>litigation. With a 0.5 inch-per-acre standard and Eldorado\u2019s decreed flow rate of 3,000 miner\u2019s inches, the Master concluded 6,000 acres should be used to determine the volume for the Eldorado Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b612 The final aspect, the volume-per-acre standard, the Master evaluated: the volume as claimed by Eldorado on its Statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Claim; testimony from District Court Judge R.D. McPhillips, who marshaled the decreed right; the Water Commissioner\u2019s records; testimony from Eldorado\u2019s expert witness John Westenberg; and testimony from LTJO\u2019s expert witness Jay Johnson.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge McPhillips testified to using a one acre-foot-per-acre-per-year standard when marshaling Eldorado\u2019s rights, but admitted he did not know if it was or was not the appropriate standard to use. He stated that figure was given to him by an employee of either the county\u2019s Agricultural Stabilization Conservation Service<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or the county\u2019s DNRC Soil and Water Conservation District office.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b613 Ultimately, the Master found the most credible evidence was a standard offered by LTJO\u2019s expert witness. Johnson testified that for three of Eldorado\u2019s rights (Truchot, Dennis, and Beattie) a 1.5 acre-feet-per-acre-per-year standard should apply.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He was unable to identify the source of the standard except to state it was a figure from the DNRC. The Master found \u201cwhile [Johnson] did not reference the source for the standard in DNRC documents, his expertise places him in the position to know the standards the DNRC is using. His expertise also gives him the ability to determine if that standard is reasonable. ... Johnson\u2019s testimony and the exhibits used ... [are] the most compelling evidence of an appropriate [standard].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b614 The Master applied Johnson\u2019s standard to the Eldorado Right at 6,000 irrigable acres. The Master used the same standard given by Johnson for the three remaining rights, and applied it to the acreage of each right\u2019s historic place of use, which he determined based on Johnson\u2019s analysis of the original property owners\u2019 legal descriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">B. Water Court\u2019s order</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b615 The Water Court determined the Master erred with his volume quantifications of the four named rights. The court determined the Master committed legal error by not first determining whether the objectors met their burden of proof to refute Eldorado\u2019s claims. The court then found the Master\u2019s volume determinations were not based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>on substantial evidence because the Master utilized an incorrect water volume standard that was used by a witness. The court held it was also legal error to use the incorrect water volume standard to determine Eldorado\u2019s rights\u2019 volume quantifications. The court \u201cdeclinefd] to adopt the Master\u2019s findings regarding volume for [Eldorado\u2019s claims]\u201d and stated the volume for the claims \u201cshould be decreed as claimed in [Eldorado\u2019s] statement of claim, with a remark that states \u2018the combined annual volume for [the] claims... may not exceed 15,000 acre feet\u2019 \u201d per year. The 15,000 acre-feet-per-year figure was the combined amount claimed on Eldorado\u2019s initial Statement of Claim for all four named rights. Appellant argues the Water Court correctly reversed the Master\u2019s volume determination, but erred by setting the volume quantification at 15,000 acre-feet per year. LTJO cross-appeals the issue but argues the Master\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous, are supported by substantial evidence, and thus the Water Court should be reversed and the Master\u2019s volume findings reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b616 A water case that involves both a Water Master and the Water Court implicates a double layer of review. <em>Heavirland v. State, </em>2013 MT 313, \u00b6 13, 372 Mont. 300, 311 P.3d 813. Initially, the Water Court is required to review the factual findings made by a Water Master under the clearly erroneous standard. Conclusions of law made by a Water Master are reviewed by the Water Court for legal correctness. <em>Heavirland, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14. This Court reviews the Water Court\u2019s order to determine whether it correctly applied those standards. Whether the appropriate standards were applied is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>Heavirland, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b617 If we determine the Water Court properly rejected a factual finding made by a Water Master, we review the substitute and any additional findings for clear error. <em>Skelton Ranch, Inc. v. Pondera Cnty. Canal &amp; Reservoir Co., </em>2014 MT 167, \u00b6 26, 375 Mont. 327, 328 P.3d 644 (citations omitted). Clear error can be found by one of three ways. A factual finding may be clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence. Even if supported by substantial evidence, the finding may be clearly erroneous if the trier of fact misapprehended the effect of the evidence. Even if supported by substantial evidence and the effect of the evidence is not misapprehended, a finding may be clearly erroneous if, in light of the evidence as a whole, the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Marks v. 71 Ranch, LP, </em>2014 MT 250, \u00b6 12, 376 Mont. 340, 334 P.3d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\u00b618 Substantial evidence is evidence that a \u201creasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if the evidence is weak or conflicting.\u201d <em>Skelton Ranch, </em>Inc., \u00b6 27 (citations omitted). To find substantial evidence there must be more than a scintilla of evidence but a preponderance of the evidence is not required. This standard is deferential, and not synonymous with the clear error standard. A reviewing court may still find a factual finding is clearly erroneous even though there is evidence to support it. <em>Skelton Ranch, Inc., </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b619 <em>1. Did the Water Court correctly conclude that the cumulative volume of water Eldorado may divert from the Teton River for the Eldorado, Truchot, Dennis, and Beattie Rights is limited to no more than 15,000 acre-feet per year?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b620 Under the WUA, enacted in 1973 for the purpose of adjudicating and determining the extent of water rights in the state, the Water Court is bound to enter a description of a water right with the attributes listed in \u00a7 85-2-234, MCA, into the final decree for a given basin. Sections 85-2-101, -234, MCA. Of the attributes listed in \u00a7 85-2-234, MCA, the amount of water included in the right is required, and volume is permitted, but not required, for certain rights. Section 85-2-234(6)(b), MCA. Under the WUA, a water right may receive a volume determination in the adjudication process if \u201ca water judge determines [the right] require[s] both volume and flow rate to adequately administer the right.\u201d Section 85-2-234(6)(b)(iii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AeU\">\u00b621 In <em>Worden v. Alexander, </em>108 Mont. 208, 90 P.2d 160 (1939) we recognized \u201cwhat quantum of water is reasonably required for irrigation is necessarily... complicated ... depending, as it does, upon many different conditions.\u201d <em>Worden, </em>108 Mont. at 213, 90 P.2d at 162 (quoting <em>Joerger v. Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>276 P. 1017, 1030 (Cal. 1929)). Such conditions include: the soil composition; the climactic conditions; the irrigated acreage; the location, quality, and altitude of the land; the types of crops irrigated; the length of the irrigation season; and any other condition specific to the unique case. <em>Worden, </em>108 Mont. at 213, 90 P.2d at 162. These conditions must be considered and weighed by the trier of fact to reach an ultimate conclusion. <em>Worden, </em>108 Mont. at 213, 90 P.2d at 162. Ultimately, \u201c[t]he question of the amount of water necessary per acre for irrigation is one of fact for the court or jury, and can never be considered a question of law for the courts.\u201d <em>Worden, </em>108 Mont. at 213, 90 P.2d at 162 (quoting <em>Tucker v. Missoula Light &amp; Water Co., </em>77 Mont. 91, 108, 250 P. 11, 18 (1926)).</p>\n<p id=\"AgC\">\u00b622 The intent of the WUA is to determine water rights in the state as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>they existed on July 1, 1973, the date the WUA went into effect. The process of determining the extent of all water rights is multistep. Initially, any party claiming an existing water right was required to file a Statement of Claim to assert the right. Section 85-2-224, MCA. After that, other affected parties may file objections to challenge the extent of the claimed right. Section 85-2-233, MCA. The final decree settles disputes with finality. Section 85-2-234, MCA. However, prior to the entry of the final decree we have acknowledged the Water Court\u2019s ability to test the provisions of a temporary decree to determine whether they properly and fairly reflect an appropriator\u2019s rights. <em>McDonald v. State, </em>220 Mont. 519, 531-32, 722 P.3d 598, 606 (1986). Modifications may be necessary and can be made before the entry of the final decree. <em>McDonald, </em>220 Mont. at 532, 722 P.3d at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b623 Eldorado argues the Water Court impermissibly constrained its water rights by quantifying the volume of the four rights as it did. In essence, Eldorado contends 15,000 acre-feet per year adopted by the Water Court is too low a limit. Eldorado argues <em>McDonald </em>established the principle that volume is a reflection of beneficial use of pre-WUA water rights. <em>McDonald, </em>220 Mont. at 530, 722 P.2d at 605. Eldorado further argues the volume determination subjects the rights to \u201ca limit [that] has never been a part of the use of water by Eldorado[.]\u201d LTJO argues the Water Court should have accepted the Master\u2019s determination of 10,350 acre-feet per year, in total for all four rights because the Master\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"A0B\">\u00b624 <em>McDonald </em>addressed the issue of whether volume determinations are constitutionally permissible. Similar to the instant case, the petitioner\u2019s water right in <em>McDonald </em>had never previously been subjected to a volume limitation. <em>McDonald, </em>220 Mont. at 523, 722 P.2d at 600-01. However, we held they are permissible as long as they do not improperly constrain the historical beneficial use of pre-July 1, 1973 water rights. <em>McDonald, </em>220 Mont. at 521, 532, 722 P.2d at 599, 606. \u201c[T]he amount actually needed for beneficial use within the appropriation will be the basis, the measure and the limit of all water rights in Montana as between appropriators, and as between appropriators and others.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>220 Mont. at 532, 722 P.2d at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b625 In this case the Master determined a volume determination is necessary to administer these water rights. The Water Court affirmed the Master\u2019s decision. This decision is governed by statute. When we interpret a statute we first look to the plain meaning of its words. <em>Clarke v. Massey, </em>271 Mont. 412, 416, 897 P.2d 1085, 1088 (1995). When a statute is clear and unambiguous, it is the role of the judiciary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>to \u201cascertain and declare what is in [the] terms [of the statute] or in [the] substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>see also Clark, </em>271 Mont. at 416, 897 P.2d at 1088. A plain reading of the governing statute, \u00a7 85-2-234(6)(b)(iii), MCA, states a water judge has the discretion to determine whether volume is necessary. Therefore, we will not disturb the Water Court\u2019s determination that a volume quantification is necessary to administer the rights at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b626 Now, because we hold volume is a factual finding, of which the determination of its necessity is left to the discretion of the Water Court, we review the Water Court\u2019s application of the appropriate standard of review to the volume determination made by the Master de novo. The Water Court stated it was \u201clegal error [for the Master] to change the elements of Eldorado\u2019s water rights without first determining that the objector\u2019s burden of proof had been met,\u201d but then further analyzed the Master\u2019s findings and determined they were not supported by substantial evidence. Despite the fact that the Master did not outright state the objectors met the burden of proof under \u00a7 85-2-227(1), MCA, we may draw an inference that the Master decided the burden was met based on his deviation in volume from Eldorado\u2019s Statement of Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b627 A reviewing court \u2014 in this case both this Court and the Water Court \u2014 cannot simply substitute its own judgment for the Master who is the trier of fact. Further, reviewing courts must give due regard to the Master\u2019s ability to judge the credibility of witnesses. <em>Skelton Ranch, Inc., </em>\u00b6 63. However, this does not mean the clearly erroneous standard does not apply to the Master\u2019s findings. Here, the Master specifically outlined the ways in which he found Johnson\u2019s testimony to be the most credible, which neither we nor the Water Court may dispute. Instead, the Water Court reviewed the evidence presented and found the 1.5 acre-feet-per-acre-per-year standard adopted by the Master was not supported by substantial evidence. The Water Court\u2019s rationale was that the standard Johnson used was not in line with the DNRC\u2019s standards for the climactic area, and it did not represent the amount of water taken at the point of diversion, which is required by law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not agree with the Water Court\u2019s determination that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>1.5 acre-feet-per-year standard is not supported by substantial evidence. A reasonable mind might accept Johnson\u2019s testimony as adequate to support the conclusion that a 1.5 acre-feet-per-year standard should be applied to the Truchot, Dennis, and Beattie Rights, even though the testimonial evidence may be weak and evidence that conflicts with Johnson\u2019s testimony exists. However, upon our review of the evidence in the record we do agree with the Water Court\u2019s finding of clear error regarding the Master\u2019s volume determination that a 1.5 acre-feet-per-year standard should apply. We apply the right-result, wrong-reason appellate rule, and hold the Water Court reached the right result, but for the wrong reason. <em>Tipp v. Skjelset, </em>1998 MT 263, \u00b6 16, 291 Mont. 288, 967 P.2d 787 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b628 We note in <em>Heavirland </em>we clarified the standards of review for both the Water Court\u2019s review of a Water Master\u2019s report and this Court\u2019s review of a Water Court order. We now take this opportunity to reinforce these standards. When the Water Court assigns a case to a Water Master pursuant to W. R. Adj. R. 11 the Water Master becomes the trier of fact. M. R. Civ. P. 53(e)(2). The Water Court then becomes the reviewing court and is \u201ctethered to the clear and unequivocal articulation of the applicable standard of review in Rule 53.\u201d <em>In re Parenting of G.J.A., </em>2014 MT 215, \u00b6 19, 376 Mont. 212, 331 P.3d 835. The Water Court is not free to simply substitute its judgment for the Master when reviewing his factual findings. <em>Weinheimer Ranch, Inc. v. Pospisil, </em>2013 MT 87, \u00b6 19, 369 Mont. 419, 299 P.3d 327. We emphasize that a difference of opinion regarding evidence presented to the trier of fact does not equal clear error. <em>Interstate Prod. Credit Ass\u2019n v. Desaye, </em>250 Mont. 320, 324, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287-88 (1991). The Water Court is obligated to review and analyze the Master\u2019s legal and factual findings under the applicable standards of review, and it is paramount that the Water Court follows its obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b629 Applying the appropriate standard of review to these facts, we find although there is substantial evidence to support the Master\u2019s conclusion, he nonetheless clearly erred in applying Johnson\u2019s proffered volume standard to all four rights. The evidence presented as to the appropriate volume standard included: Eldorado\u2019s Statement of Claim;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Judge McPhillips\u2019 testimony; the DNRC standards for volume; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the Water Commissioner\u2019s records; and testimony by two expert witnesses, Johnson and Westenberg. All of the evidence somewhat conflicted, and none of the evidence presented provided a clear path to determine a volume quantification that should be used to reflect historic usage pursuant to <em>McDonald.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b630  Eldorado\u2019s Statement of Claim lists 15,000 acre-feet per year for the irrigation of 15,240 acres, which amounts to just less than one acre-foot per year. Through the DNRC\u2019s claims review process Eldorado\u2019s claim abstract was amended to reflect that the actual irrigated acreage may be different than claimed, and the remark that \u201cthe total volume of [the] water right shall not exceed the amount put to historical and beneficial use\u201d was added, which in essence describes that a volume was not previously decreed for a right. Eldorado argues W. R. Adj. R. 19 requires that all of the elements of a Statement of Claim must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Eldorado misstates the rule. The rule states prima facie proof of the contents of a claim \u201cmay be contradicted and overcome by other evidence that proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the elements of the claim do not accurately reflect the beneficial use of the water right as it existed prior to July 1,1973.\u201d W. R. Adj. R. 19. By statute, the Water Court is obligated to accept the claim form as proof of the contents of a claim, to be overcome only by a preponderance of the evidence. Section 85-2-227(1), MCA. In essence, a water right as it is reflected on a claim form is entitled to be taken as true on its face, unless proven otherwise. To require the Water Court to find proof of the elements of claims made by a preponderance of the evidence is contrary to the rule, and we reject Eldorado\u2019s argument in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b631 Judge McPhillips testified he historically marshaled one acre-foot per year for the decreed rights, but he could not state whether it was the proper amount.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The DNRC standards were used for the limited purpose of analyzing Johnson\u2019s proffered standard because he claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the standard was an applicable standard used by the DNRC. The Water Commissioner\u2019s records were determined not to be a credible source of historic volume diversion because the records were incomplete, and prior to 1964 there was a lack of a dependable measuring device on the ditch that would have produced reliable metrics. Westenberg testified to the generalities of whether the Water Commissioner\u2019s records reflect a volume usage for Eldorado\u2019s rights that are within the DNRC standards for the climactic area and type of irrigation for these rights. He did not opine as to what volume should apply to Eldorado\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b632 Johnson\u2019s testimony of applying a 1.5 acre-feet-per-year standard to the rights was based on his own expert knowledge, but he admitted it was less than the current DNRC standards. Johnson further tied his proffered standard to his testimony about the appropriate irrigable acreage that Eldorado should be allowed. While the Master thoughtfully outlined his rationale as to why he accepted Johnson\u2019s credibility over the others\u2019 we conclude that he misapprehended the effect of the evidence because the purpose of a volume determination is to reflect historic beneficial use, and Johnson\u2019s standard admittedly, and later verified, was not grounded in anything other than his own guess. <em>McDonald, </em>220 Mont. at 521, 532, 722 P.2d at 599, 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b633  In this case it seems it is not the standard itself that is fundamentally problematic to the parties, but it is the combination of Johnson\u2019s proffered standard and its application to the number of irrigable acres that the Master utilized to determine the volume of the four rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It was these two independent elements that were used to generate the maximum volumes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Regardless, we have not been asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>to determine whether the irrigable acreage within the place of use is correct, but to determine whether the volume quantification made by the Water Court is in error. We hold it is not. We ultimately agree with the Water Court\u2019s conclusion that none of the parties were able to successfully meet the burden of proof to establish a historic volume quantification for the four rights that is either greater than or less than the amount claimed on Eldorado\u2019s Statement of Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b634  Eldorado advances the argument that the volume determination is not in line with our precedent in <em>McDonald. </em>As previously stated, <em>McDonald </em>sets forth that expressions of quantifications of a water right, including volume and flow rate, are permissible to identify the limit of a water right so long as they are in line with the historical, unabandoned beneficial use of the water. <em>McDonald, </em>220 Mont. at 529-30, 722 P.2d at 605-06. However, Eldorado fails to identify a way in which the volume determination it contests is counter to its historic, unabandoned beneficial use. Instead, Eldorado credibly established a historic volume in its Statement of Claim that no party, including Eldorado, was able to successfully rebut. In overruling the Master, the Water Court declined to enter a specific per-acre volume factual finding, which is not required by law, and we will not second guess its judgment in that regard. We do note the Statement of Claim set forth a volume quantification that is likely in line with the volume historically delivered to Eldorado under the <em>Perry </em>decree. We conclude that the Water Court\u2019s improper application of the standard of review to the Master\u2019s factual findings nonetheless produced the proper result, and we therefore uphold the Water Court\u2019s findings regarding volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b635 <em>2. Did the Water Court err when it chose not to assign separate volume limits for each of Eldorado\u2019s four sets of combined irrigation and stockwater rights for the Eldorado, Truchot, Dennis, and Beattie Rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b636 LTJO argues the Water Court erred when it assigned one volume maximum for all four of Eldorado\u2019s named rights. It reiterated the concerns contained in the Master\u2019s report regarding an expansion of Eldorado\u2019s place of use and argues a combined volume determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>allows Eldorado\u2019s junior rights to be used out of priority. TCRC argues \u201c[wlithout a separate volume for each of the... acquired water rights, total diversions of these rights will be greatly enlarged beyond the original owner\u2019s use to the detriment of other water users.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">\u00b637  A water right cannot be enlarged beyond the original beneficial use by the original appropriator to the injury of others. <em>Quigley v. McIntosh, </em>110 Mont. 495, 505, 103 P.2d 1067, 1072 (1940). However, place or purpose of use may be changed, subject to the complaints of another user. <em>Quigley, </em>110 Mont. at 505, 103 P.2d at 1072. The requirement therefore is for a pre-WUA water user to have protested and sought redress for an alleged injury caused by a change of purpose or place of use of another\u2019s water right. Here, the Master found Eldorado acquired all four rights by 1937.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> From that point on Eldorado used all four rights to provide water to its stockholders. As discussed above, the purpose of the WUA and adjudication process is to determine with finality the extent of all water rights in the state as of July 1, 1973. Any changes made to a right prior to the WUA followed the no-injury rule, and after would require following the statutory procedures under the WUA. The record does not indicate, nor do the parties argue, that another user was injured by a change to any of the named water rights\u2019 purposes or places of use prior to the WUA.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b638  The rights at issue have long been comingled in many ways. However, they each remain subject to the elements of a water right as determined by the Water Court (i.e., the decreed flow rates, periods of use, points of diversion, etc.), which are not at issue in this appeal. Volume is an aspect of a water right that must still reflect historic beneficial use, but may be applied to a water right by the Water Court with discretion, as given to the court by statute. <em>McDonald, </em>220 Mont. at 532, 722 P.2d at 606; \u00a7 85-2-234(6)(b)(iii), MCA. So long as the water right is constrained by its historic beneficial use, we hold the Water Court did not err by utilizing a combined volume limitation for Eldorado\u2019s four named water rights. A water user who alleges injury caused by Eldorado\u2019s use retains the ability to pursue every remedy available to him under statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b639 <em>3. Did the Water Court err when it limited the flow rate of the Truchot Right to 300 miner\u2019s inches instead of225 miner\u2019s inches?</em></p>\n<p id=\"A2_\">\u00b640 Eldorado acquired 225 miner\u2019s inches of the Truchot Right in 1921. TCRC argues there is no evidence that the remaining 75 miner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>inches were transferred to Eldorado. Therefore, TCRC argues the Water Court erred by failing to limit the Truchot Right\u2019s flow rate at 225 miner\u2019s inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b641 While Eldorado was unable to produce a deed of transfer for the remaining 75 inches, the Master found substantial evidence supported the transfer by way of the Water Commissioner\u2019s records and State Water Resource Survey. It is known that the 75 inches were originally retained by Truchot, and then transferred to another water user named Coffee until 1946. Any competing water user\u2019s claim to the 75 inches of the right was addressed and resolved by the Master, and he determined no other party made claim to the portion of the right on a Statement of Claim. The Water Commissioner\u2019s records and State Water Resource Survey reflect full use of the Truchot Right by Eldorado by the 1960s at the latest. The Master\u2019s finding was affirmed by the Water Court. Furthermore, Eldorado claimed the full 300 inches on its Statement of Claim, which the Water Court correctly stated is entitled to prima facie proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b642  The Water Court is obligated to review the Master\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Heavirland, </em>\u00b6 14. The Water Court stated, \u201c[i]n this case [the Water Commissioner\u2019s] records constitute substantial evidence of use of the entire Truchot [R]ight by Eldorado.\u201d We review de novo whether the Water Court applied the appropriate standard of review. <em>Skelton Ranch, </em>Inc., \u00b6 26. In this case the Water Court plainly analyzed the Master\u2019s factual findings to determine whether substantial evidence supported his findings, and found no clear error. We conclude the Water Court applied the appropriate standard of review and we therefore affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u00b643 The Water Court\u2019s order regarding Water Court Case 410-129B is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b244-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-10\"> It is unnecessary to recount the somewhat complex procedural aspects of <em>Giese v. Blixrud, </em>2012 MT 170, 365 Mont. 548, 285 P.3d 458 and the underlying Water Court Case 410-129. It suffices to state that Case 410-129A related solely to the Bateman Ditch, and LTJO utilized avenues available to it through both the District Court and the Water Court to determine the extent of the rights involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-9\"> Teton County is now part of the Ninth Judicial District.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\"> Interestingly, Johnson is a former DNRC water resource specialist who reviewed and analyzed Eldorado\u2019s four rights during his tenure with the DNRC. Johnson later left the DNRC to consult privately, and through his consultant work re-analyzed Eldorado\u2019s claims and opined on behalf of LTJO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\"> In his testimony Judge McPhillips used the former name for a state office of the United States Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b234-11\"> Johnson\u2019s testimony was limited to three of the four named rights. He did not testify regarding the Eldorado Right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b238-7\"> Upon review of Johnson\u2019s testimony, he did not state it was a point of diversion standard; instead he stated he did not recall if the standard applies at the field or at the point of diversion. He did state he was aware that the DNRC\u2019s diverted volume standards for the applicable climactic area are higher than 1.5 acre-feet per year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\"> Under statute all aspects of Eldorado\u2019s Statement of Claim, which included a claimed volume, should be afforded prima facie proof of the contents of the claim. Section 85-2-227(1), MCA. Therefore, none of the parties needed to prove the 15,000 acre-feet per year claimed by Eldorado for all four rights was correct, but that it was incorrect, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>shown by a preponderance of the evidence. Further, Eldorado itself was not bound to the volume amount it claimed on its Statement of Claim. Along with those who objected to the extent of Eldorado\u2019s claim, Eldorado had the opportunity to present evidence to refute its own volume claim and show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a greater volume was historically used. <em>Nelson v. Brooks, </em>2014 MT 120, \u00b6 34, 375 Mont. 86, 329 P.3d 558.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b240-12\"> Judge McPhillips testified the one acre-foot amount was a general rule of thumb, not a hard-and-fast rule. If water users under the <em>Perry </em>decree used more than one acre-foot then they ran the risk of being shut off. Logically, it was during dry years when marshaling was more difficult and water users logged complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b241-6\"> The Master declined to adopt the acreage figure Johnson testified appropriately reflects the number of acres Eldorado has historically irrigated. The Master found the most credible evidence showed Eldorado should be limited to irrigating 12,550 acres annually for all four rights. The Water Court found the Master\u2019s determination was based on substantial evidence and affirmed his determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\"> In regard to the volume determination, the Master determined 6,000 acres were irrigated under the Eldorado Right based on Eldorado\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law it submitted during the <em>Perry </em>litigation. Additionally, the Master determined 900 acres, separated amongst the remaining three named rights, were irrigated based on Johnson\u2019s testimony regarding the analyses of the rights. The Master then applied Johnson\u2019s 1.5 acre-feet volume standard to the total acreage and ultimately concluded Eldorado\u2019s four rights are limited to 10,350 acre-feet per year, and gave each right a separate volume maximum. If the Master were to have applied Johnson\u2019s standard to the number of acres he determined could be annually irrigated the volume limit would equal 18,825 acre-feet per year. However, we need not address this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>mathematical curiosity. The Water Court noted: \u201cIrrigated acreage and volume are two separate elements of a water right. The Master\u2019s finding that Eldorado was limited by historic use to annual irrigation of 12,550 acres is not invalidated by, or conditioned upon, his selection of a specific volume. The Master\u2019s decision regarding maximum annual acreage is dependent on historic use, and does not become clearly erroneous because the volume identified for that acreage is objectionable to another party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b243-6\"> As addressed in Issue Three, the exact date is not definitively known for when Eldorado acquired all of the Truchot Right. It is known Eldorado purchased the maj ority of the Truchot Right in 1921 and Eldorado claimed full use of the right by the 1950s.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
