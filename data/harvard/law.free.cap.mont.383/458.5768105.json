We address Brunette\u2019s claims on appeal under a single issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Brunette\u2019s petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">\u00b63 On April 11, 2015, Officer Brandon Brotnov was on patrol in Cut Bank, Montana. At 12:54 a.m., the police department dispatch received a call from an unknown officer to run a license plate check on Brunette\u2019s vehicle, which was parked on Central Avenue. Officer Robert Snyder also was on patrol that night and told Officer Brotnov about Brunette\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">\u00b64 Sometime later, Officer Brotnov observed Brunette\u2019s vehicle parked on Central Avenue. When Officer Brotnov drove past Brunette\u2019s parked vehicle, Brunette turned around and headed in the opposite direction. Officer Snyder and Officer Brotnov continued to patrol the area and discussed Brunette\u2019s whereabouts; a portion of a transcript of radio communication between Officer Brotnov and Officer Snyder makes clear that the Officers discussed Brunette\u2019s whereabouts for approximately five minutes. During this time, Officer Brotnov observed Brunette pull over and change directions twice. Officer Brotnov began to follow Brunette, observed him make a right-hand turn without using his turn signal, and initiated a traffic stop at approximately 1:40 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"AlX\">\u00b65 At the time Brunette made the turn, Officer Snyder was approaching in the oncoming lane. Officer Brotnov testified that his report indicated that after witnessing Brunette fail to use his turn signal, but prior to initiating the traffic stop, he observed Brunette almost strike a parked vehicle. At the hearing, however, Officer Brotnov testified, after viewing footage from his dash cam, that he was mistaken about Brunette almost striking the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">\u00b66 After stopping Brunette, and before leaving his vehicle, Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Brotnov had dispatch begin the suggested deprivation period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Brotnov approached Brunette\u2019s vehicle and detected a slight odor of an alcoholic beverage and cigarette smoke. Officer Brotnov observed Brunette have difficulty retrieving his driver\u2019s license and the vehicle\u2019s registration and insurance. Brunette explained to Officer Brotnov that he was unsure of where the registration and insurance were because it was a company vehicle. Officer Brotnov observed further that Brunette\u2019s eyes were red and watery and that his speech was slurred. Upon questioning, Brunette admitted that he had consumed alcoholic beverages that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b67 Officer Brotnov then administered standardized field sobriety tests, including a portable breath test (PBT). The PBT indicated a blood alcohol concentration of 0.143. Officer Brotnov placed Brunette under arrest for driving under the influence in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. At the detention center, Brunette refused to submit to an Intoxilyzer breath test and his driver\u2019s license was suspended pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b68 On April 20, 2015, Brunette filed a petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA. In the petition, he argued that Officer Brotnov did not have reasonable grounds to conduct the stop. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing on May 20, 2015. During Officer Brotnov\u2019s testimony, Brunette\u2019s counsel questioned him about his case report and played the dash cam video and the body cam recording, but did not offer or enter any of these items into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"A9C\">\u00b69 At the hearing\u2019s conclusion, the District Court made a number of oral findings. The court expressed \u201cconcerns about officer conduct on that night.\u201d Those concerns included: that an officer \u201cran\u201d Brunette\u2019s license plate nearly an hour before he was pulled over; that the Officers discussed Brunette\u2019s whereabouts and may have been \u201ctargeting this individual\u201d; and that Officer Brunette began the suggested deprivation period before his initial contact with Brunette. The court found, however, that \u201cclearly there was a lack of a turn signal that was a traffic stop.\u201d The court found further that the turn signal violation, the watery eyes, and the PBT \u201cmay be sufficient\u201d to create reasonable suspicion, \u201calong with the other factors.\u201d The District Court ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>directed counsel to brief the officer conduct issues because it was unsure whether those issues \u201ccreate[ ] a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b610 Both parties submitted briefs following the evidentiary hearing addressing the issues about which the District Court expressed concerns. In his briefing, Brunette alleged for the first time that Officer Snyder failed to dim his high-beam lights as he was approaching Brunette in the oncoming lane, which Brunette claimed contributed to his failure to use his turn signal. Brunette\u2019s brief also contained a portion of the transcript of the radio exchange between Officer Snyder and Officer Brotnov, which he obtained after the hearing. The District Court issued its order denying Brunette\u2019s petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license on August 17, 2015. The court\u2019s order focused on whether the stop was pretextual. Brunette appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a petition for reinstatement of a driver\u2019s license to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous. <em>Kummerfeldt v. State, </em>2015 MT 109, \u00b6 8, 378 Mont. 522, 347 P.3d 1233. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>Kummerfeldt, </em>\u00b6 8. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Kummerfeldt, </em>\u00b6 8. The suspension of a driver\u2019s license is presumed to be correct; therefore, the petitioner bears the burden of proving that the State\u2019s action was improper. <em>Brown v. State, </em>2009 MT 64, \u00b6 8, 349 Mont. 408, 203 P.3d 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">\u00b612 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Brunette\u2019s petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">\u00b613 In a driver\u2019s license reinstatement proceeding, a district court is limited to considering the issues set forth in \u00a7 61-8-403(4)(a), MCA. Section 61-8-403(4)(b), MCA; <em>Kummerfeldt, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Ditton v. DOJ Motor Vehicle Div., </em>2014 MT 54, \u00b6 30, 374 Mont. 122, 319 P.3d 1268). Relevant here, the issues include whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">(i) a peace officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the person had been driving or was in actual physical control of a vehicle upon ways of this state open to the public while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of the two and the person was placed under arrest for violation of 61-8-401 or 61-8-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>465;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">(iv) the person refused to submit to one or more tests designated by the officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Section 61-8~403(4)(a)(i), (iv), MCA. It is undisputed that Brunette refused to submit to a breath test; therefore, the court\u2019s focus was limited to the factors set forth in \u00a7 61-8-403(4)(a)(i), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">A. The Record on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">\u00b614 We first address the record on appeal. In his briefing to this Court, Brunette claims that the dash cam video shows that Officer Snyder had his high-beam lights on as he approached Brunette and \u201cthat Officer Brotnov clearly failed to stop at a stop sign and yield at a yield sign as he pursued Mr. Brunette.\u201d Because the Officers broke the traffic code, Brunette claims that any evidence obtained through the Officers\u2019 wrongdoing should be excluded. Brunette also references evidence obtained from the body cam recording. Brunette contends that the dash cam video \u201cof the stop was viewed, discussed at length, and consistently referred to during the hearing,\u201d and that it was \u201cmerely an oversight not to have admitted it into evidence.\u201d Brunette argues \u201cthat the video is incorporated through reference and should be admitted.\u201d Brunette relies extensively on a portion of the transcript of Officer Brotnov\u2019s and Officer Snyder\u2019s radio communications in asserting that the stop was pretextual. Brunette argues that the State failed to provide the radio transcript before the hearing. Moreover, Brunette contends that the radio transcript is part of the record because a portion of the radio transcript was included in his initial brief to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">\u00b615 The State counters by arguing that Brunette\u2019s reference to and reliance on the Officers\u2019 radio exchange transcript, the dash cam video, and the body cam recording violate the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure because they are outside of the record on appeal. Accordingly, the State requests that this Court disregard any reference to the facts allegedly obtained from those sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">\u00b616 This Court considers only the district court record, including \u201cthe original papers and exhibits filed in the district court, the transcript of proceedings, if any, and a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the clerk of the district court.\u201d M. R. App. P. 8(1). \u201c[P]arties on appeal are bound by the record.\u201d <em>State v. MacKinnon, </em>1998 MT 78, \u00b6 15, 288 Mont. 329, 957 P.2d 23 (quoting <em>State v. Hatfield, </em>256 Mont. 340, 344, 846 P.2d 1025, 1028 (1993)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the dash cam video and the body cam recording were both played at the hearing, neither was offered or entered into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>evidence and they are not included in the District Court record. Accordingly, we will not consider references to this evidence on appeal. <em>State v. J.C., </em>2004 MT 75, \u00b6 26, 320 Mont. 411, 87 P.3d 501 (concluding that the documents the defendant \u201cattached to his appellate brief are not part of the District Court record and will not be considered on appeal\u201d). Brunette\u2019s brief to the District Court in support of his driver\u2019s license reinstatement did include a portion of the radio transcript between Officer Snyder and Officer Brotnov. That portion of the transcript is therefore part of the District Court record properly before this Court on appeal. M. R. App. P. 8(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">B. Grounds for the Stop</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b617 Particularized suspicion for Officer Brotnov\u2019s initial stop of Brunette\u2019s vehicle is determined by \u201cexamining the totality of the circumstances confronting the officer at the time.\u201d <em>Ditton, </em>\u00b6 30. In order for an officer to have particularized suspicion, the officer must demonstrate: \u201c(1) objective data and articulable facts from which he or she can make certain reasonable inferences; and (2) a resulting suspicion that the person to be stopped has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d <em>Broum, </em>\u00b6 20. It is well established that \u201c[a] statutory violation alone is sufficient to establish particularized suspicion for an officer to make a traffic stop.\u201d <em>Kummerfeldt, </em>\u00b6 11 (quoting <em>State v. Schulke, </em>2005 MT 77, \u00b6 16, 326 Mont. 390, 109 P.3d 744) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b618  The District Court found \u2014 and it is undisputed \u2014 that \u201cBrunette failed to utilize his turn signal.\u201d Such a \u201cstatutory violation alone is sufficient to establish particularized suspicion\u201d for the initial investigative stop. <em>Kummerfeldt, </em>\u00b6 11. Brunette contends, however, that the District Court incorrectly concluded that Officer Brotnov\u2019s basis for the stop was legal because Officer Brotnov lacked objectivity. He claims the court erred by relying on <em>State v. Farabee, </em>2000 MT 265, 302 Mont. 29, 22 P.3d 175, and asserts that this case is more analogous to <em>State v. Lahr, </em>172 Mont. 32, 560 P.2d 527 (1977). He asserts that unlike in <em>Farabee, </em>here, Officer Brotnov observed no wrongdoing before following Brunette. Brunette contends that, similar to <em>Lahr, </em>\u201cthe Officers manufactured a traffic stop\u201d because \u201c[t]hey coordinated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>their movements over the radio so they could intercept Mr. Brunette.\u201d Brunette relies on the radio transcript and the purported footage from the dash cam video to support his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b619 Brunette\u2019s reliance <em>onLahr is </em>misplaced. <em>InLahr, </em>a deputy sheriff in Denton, Montana, observed a package exchanged between the defendant, Lahr, and a man with previous drug related arrests. <em>Lahr, </em>172 Mont. at 33, 560 P.2d at 528. After Lahr left Denton and headed toward Lewistown, Montana, the deputy radioed a second deputy in Lewistown and told him to \u201cpick [Lahr] up ... and see what [he was] up to.\u201d <em>Lahr, </em>172 Mont. at 33, 560 P.2d at 528. The deputy in Lewistown waited for Lahr\u2019s vehicle and followed him in an unmarked police car \u201cfor approximately three miles at a distance of one to four car lengths.\u201d <em>Lahr, </em>172 Mont. at 33, 560 P.2d at 528. The deputy testified that he observed Lahr swerve over the centerline of the highway and go onto the shoulder. <em>Lahr, </em>172 Mont. at 34, 560 P.2d at 528. Lahr testified that he thought the vehicle was following him too closely and that he was attempting to have the vehicle pass him. <em>Lahr, </em>172 Mont. at 34, 560 P.2d at 528. The deputy pulled Lahr over for reckless driving, observed what he believed to be marijuana in the car, and arrested Lahr. <em>Lahr, </em>172 Mont. at 34, 560 P.2d at 528-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b620 On appeal, Lahr contended that the arrest was invalid because the deputies lacked probable cause. We concluded that it was \u201cclear that neither [deputy] had probable cause to arrest Lahr\u201d because they had nothing more than a suspicion that an illegal transaction had taken place. <em>Lahr, </em>172 Mont. at 35, 560 P.2d at 529. We reiterated that \u201cgood faith or mere suspicion on the part of arresting officers is not enough\u201d for probable cause. <em>Lahr, </em>172 Mont. at 35, 560 P.2d at 529. Accordingly, we concluded, \u201cClearly, the traffic stop was merely a pretext used by [the arresting deputy] to follow up on the call received from [the other deputy]. Hence, [the arresting deputy] was also acting on a mere suspicion.\u201d <em>Lahr, </em>172 Mont. at 35, 560 P.2d at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b621 In <em>Farabee, </em>the defendant relied <em>onLahr </em>to argue that the officers used a statutory violation \u201cas a pretext to stop him and investigate their hunch\u201d that he was involved in narcotics activity. <em>Farabee, </em>\u00b6 22. We analyzed <em>Lahr </em>and concluded that the basis of our holding there was not that the deputy \u201cused an otherwise justifiable traffic stop as an unlawful means to investigate a mere suspicion. Rather, we held that the traffic stop was not justified because either [the deputy] did not actually witness Lahr driving recklessly, or [the deputy] caused Lahr\u2019s erratic driving by following too closely.\u201d <em>Farabee, </em>\u00b6 28. Accordingly, we noted, <em>\u201cLahr </em>does not stand for the proposition that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>traffic stop supported by probable cause or reasonable suspicion is nonetheless unlawful because it was used as a \u2018pretext\u2019 to investigate other criminal activity for which the officer did not have a reasonable suspicion.\u201d <em>Farabee, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b622 In fact, in <em>Farabee </em>we noted approvingly that the \u201cUnited States Supreme Court has stated that the constitutional reasonableness of a traffic stop under the Fourth Amendment does not depend on the subjective motivations of the individual officers involved.\u201d <em>Farabee, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S. Ct. 1769, 1774 (1996)). We declined to conclude that the right to privacy under Article II, Section 10, of the Montana Constitution affords citizens greater protection than that provided by the Fourth Amendment when judging the lawfulness of a traffic stop; we reasoned that \u201cthe lawfulness of a traffic stop under the Montana Constitution depends on whether the officer had a particularized suspicion that an occupant of the vehicle has committed or is committing an offense.\u201d <em>Farabee, </em>\u00b6 30 (citations omitted). <em>Accord State v. Crawford, </em>2016 MT 96, \u00b6 21, 383 Mont. 229, 371 P.3d 381 (and concluding that \u201cour precedent has long established that inquiry into the subjective motivations of law enforcement... is inappropriate in assessing the validity of an arrest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A_i\">\u00b623  The instant case is distinguishable from <em>Lahr. \u201cLahr </em>might be applicable if [Brunette] could prove that the officers involved in his stop never actually had a reasonable suspicion that [there was a statutory violation].\u201d <em>Farabee, </em>\u00b6 29. It is undisputed, however, that Brunette failed to use his turn signal in violation of \u00a7 61-8-336, MCA. Brunette has failed to show that Officer Brotnov did not have reasonable suspicion for the investigatory stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b624 <em>\u201cLahr </em>might also be applicable if [Brunette] could prove that the [officers] somehow manufactured reasonable suspicion ... in order to create a justifiable traffic stop and investigate their hunch.\u201d <em>Farabee, </em>\u00b6 29. Although the District Court found that Officer Snyder\u2019s high-beam lights were on as he was approaching Brunette in the oncoming lane, the court ultimately concluded that \u201cit appears that the arresting officers did not contribute to or cause Brunette\u2019s signaling violation.\u201d Unlike in <em>Lahr, </em>Brunette did not testify that the Officers\u2019 actions contributed to his failure to use his turn signal. In fact, he testified that he \u201cremember[ed] seeing a car coming towards\u201d him and, when he was asked why he didn\u2019t use his turn signal, he responded, \u201cI just guess I forgot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b625 This case is further distinguishable from <em>Lahr </em>because in that case the arresting deputy was instructed to pick Lahr up based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>mere suspicion, proceeded to wait for Lahr while he traveled from Denton to Lewistown, and then followed him closely for three miles before observing the erratic driving. Here, the portion of the radio transcript between Officer Snyder and Officer Brotnov demonstrates that the Officers communicated about Brunette\u2019s whereabouts for approximately five minutes prior to the traffic stop and that Officer Brotnov was not following him for more than a few blocks. While the evidence reveals that Officer Snyder told Officer Brotnov about Brunette\u2019s vehicle, it does not demonstrate that Officer Snyder instructed Officer Brotnov to pick up Brunette. Moreover, after Officer Snyder told Officer Brotnov about Brunette\u2019s vehicle, Officer Brotnov witnessed Brunette pull over and change directions twice prior to observing the turn signal violation. Contrary to Brunette\u2019s assertions, the transcript does not demonstrate that \u201cthe Officers decided to pick up Mr. Brunette long before they witnessed a traffic violation.\u201d The transcript demonstrates only that the Officers were aware of Brunette\u2019s vehicle and that they discussed Brunette\u2019s whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"A6O\">\u00b626 Brunette claims that pretext is apparent from Officer Brotnov\u2019s beginning the suggested deprivation period prior to his initial contact with Brunette. While previous versions of the Administrative Rules of Montana required an officer to comply with a checklist that included observing a deprivation period before administering a breath test, <em>State v. McGowan, </em>2006 MT 163, \u00b6 16, 322 Mont. 490, 139 P.3d 841, the current version of the rules has no such requirement, Admin. R. M. 23.4.212 <em>(2012);Levanger, </em>\u00b6 12. Whatever Officer Brotnov\u2019s intentions may have been for starting the deprivation period when he did, they have no bearing on the analysis in this case because the reasonableness of a traffic stop \u201cdoes not depend on the subjective motivations of the individual officers involved.\u201d <em>Farabee, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>Whren, </em>517 U.S. at 813, 116 S. Ct. at 1774).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b627 Brunette also contends that the evidence demonstrates that there were several inconsistencies with Officer Brotnov\u2019s testimony. He therefore asserts that the District Court erred by finding that the traffic stop was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b628 We are unpersuaded by Brunette\u2019s contention. The record demonstrates that Brunette questioned Officer Brotnov about the alleged inconsistencies during the hearing. Moreover, Brunette included a portion of the radio transcript \u2014 which he claims demonstrates further the inconsistencies in Officer Brotnov\u2019s testimony \u2014 in his briefing to the District Court. The District Court therefore had the opportunity to consider this evidence. It is well-established that \u201cbecause an assessment of testimony is best made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>upon observation of the witness\u2019s demeanor and consideration of other intangibles that are only evident during live testimony, the fact-finder is uniquely in the best position to judge the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Ditton, </em>\u00b6 33 (citations omitted). As such, we \u201cdefer to the trial court regarding the credibility of [Officer Brotnov] and the weight to be accorded [his] testimony.\u201d <em>Ditton, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b629 After reviewing the available record on appeal, we conclude that Brunette has not met his \u201cburden of proving that the State\u2019s action was improper.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>\u00b6 8. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court correctly relied on <em>Farabee </em>in determining that the stop was \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d and that there was \u201cno evidence that this failure [to use a turn signal] was caused by law enforcement.\u201d The District Court correctly concluded that \u201cthe necessary particularized suspicion existed\u201d for the initial stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">C. The Statutory Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u00b630 Brunette next claims that the District Court failed to consider adequately the necessary issues in a driver\u2019s license reinstatement proceeding. Brunette does not dispute that he refused to submit to a breath test. He contends, however, that the District Court erred by failing to make the other findings necessary under \u00a7 61-8-403(4)(a), MCA, to support its order \u2014 whether Officer Brotnov had reasonable grounds to believe Brunette was under the influence of alcohol and whether Brunette was lawfully placed under arrest. Although Brunette concedes that he failed to use his turn signal, he nevertheless asserts that Officer Brotnov failed to establish objective data from which he could infer that Brunette was under the influence of alcohol both prior to and during the investigative stop. Brunette accordingly asserts that Officer Brotnov lacked the necessary particularized suspicion to administer the field sobriety tests.

The State contends that Officer Brotnov had particularized suspicion to support the investigative stop because Brunette failed to use his turn signal. Furthermore, the State asserts, Officer Brotnov\u2019s observations after the stop \u201cestablished sufficient grounds to form a reasonable belief that Brunette was driving under the influence.\u201d Finally, the State contends that Officer Brotnov\u2019s particularized suspicion ripened into probable cause to arrest Brunette <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>because Officer Brotnov observed indicators of impairment and, based on those indicators, administered field sobriety tests, which established probable cause for arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">1.

We are unpersuaded by Brunette\u2019s contention that Officer Brotnov lacked particularized suspicion to conduct the field sobriety tests. Officer Brotnov testified that, once he approached Brunette, he made the following observations: he smelled the odor of an alcoholic beverage; Brunette had red, watery eyes; Brunette\u2019s speech was slurred; Brunette had difficulty getting his license out of his wallet; and Brunette admitted to consuming alcohol. Such objective data and articulable facts are sufficient for particularized suspicion that a person is under the influence of alcohol. <em>E.g., Brown, </em>\u00b6 23 (concluding that an officer had particularized suspicion that a driver was under the influence of alcohol based, in part, on the officer\u2019s observations of an odor of alcohol, slurred and slow speech, and slow, staggered movements); <em>Hulse v. DOJ, Motor Vehicle Div., </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 42, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75 (concluding that an officer\u2019s observations of an odor of alcohol, bloodshot eyes, and the driver\u2019s difficulty producing her driver\u2019s license constituted \u201cobjective data [that] further established that [the officer] had a separate particularized suspicion that [the driver] was driving while under the influence of alcohol, and, therefore, [the officer\u2019s] administration of field sobriety tests was a constitutionally permissible search\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b633 We similarly are unpersuaded that the District Court made inadequate findings regarding whether Officer Brotnov had reasonable grounds to believe that Brunette was driving under the influence of alcohol. We will not overturn a district court\u2019s decision if its findings of fact and conclusions of law \u201care sufficiently comprehensive and pertinent to the issues to provide a basis for decision and are supported by evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Whiteman, </em>2005 MT 15, \u00b6 12, 325 Mont. 358, 106 P.3d 543. The District Court made the following relevant oral findings at the evidentiary hearing\u2019s conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">I think we got [sic] a failure to use a turn signal, that\u2019s considered, and I think we got [sic] watery eyes and we have a P.B.T.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">[B]ut clearly the stop was made, there was no blinker used.

Furthermore, the District Court expressly found in its written order that \u201cthe stop was objectively reasonable and the necessary particularized suspicion existed.\u201d We conclude that the District Court\u2019s oral and written findings are supported by the evidence and are \u201csufficiently comprehensive and pertinent to the issues to provide a basis for decision,\u201d <em>Whiteman, </em>\u00b6 12, regarding whether Officer Brotnov \u201chad reasonable grounds to believe that [Brunette] had been driving ... while under the influence of alcohol,\u201d Section 61-8-403(4)(a)(i), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">2.

Probable cause \u201cexists when the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer\u2019s personal knowledge are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to believe that the suspect has committed an offense.\u201d <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b635 Here, in addition to Officer Brotnov\u2019s observations regarding the smell of alcohol, red and watery eyes, slurred speech, difficulty retrieving driver\u2019s license, and admission of alcohol consumption, Officer Brotnov administered field sobriety tests, including a PBT. The PBT indicated that Brunette\u2019s blood alcohol concentration was 0.143, well in excess of the legal limit. These facts and circumstances are sufficient for probable cause to believe that Brunette was driving under the influence. Brunette therefore was validly arrested. <em>Brown, </em>\u00b6 23 (concluding that the officer\u2019s objective observations \u2014 e.g., an odor of alcohol, slurred and slow speech, and slow, staggered movements \u2014 allowed the officer\u2019s \u201cparticularized suspicion to escalate into probable cause for a DUI arrest\u201d); <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 73 (concluding that even without the evidence of one of the field sobriety test results, \u201csufficient evidence remains to support a finding that [the officer] had probable cause to arrest [the defendant] for driving under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>influence, and, therefore, that [the defendant\u2019s] arrest was valid\u201d based in part on the officer\u2019s observations of the other field sobriety tests, an odor of alcohol, bloodshot eyes, and the driver\u2019s difficulty producing her driver\u2019s license).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b636 Brunette correctly points out that the District Court\u2019s order does not address whether Officer Brotnov had probable cause to arrest him for driving under the influence. We have, however, long adhered \u201cto the doctrine of implied findings[,] which states that where a court\u2019s findings are general in terms, any findings not specifically made, but necessary to the judgment, are deemed to have been implied, if supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Interstate Brands Corp. v. Cannon, </em>218 Mont. 380, 384, 708 P.2d 573, 576 (1985). Under this doctrine, \u201cwe may consult hearing transcripts in addition to the written findings.\u201d <em>In re S.M., </em>2014 MT 309, \u00b6 28, 377 Mont. 133, 339 P.3d 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b637  As stated above, a district court is limited to considering certain issues in a driver\u2019s license reinstatement proceeding \u2014 one of which is whether \u201cthe person was placed under arrest.\u201d Section 61-8-403(4)(a)(i), MCA. That consideration requires a court to determine \u201cwhether an officer had the right to make the arrest,\u201d which necessarily requires a conclusion that the officer had probable cause. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 13. Here, the District Court found generally that \u201cBrunette was ultimately arrested and charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d The court found specifically that \u201cthe stop was objectively reasonable,\u201d and orally found that there were indicators of intoxication \u2014 the watery eyes and the PBT that, \u201calong with the other factors ... may be sufficient\u201d to uphold the suspension. The court\u2019s general and specific findings necessarily include implied findings sufficient to conclude that Officer Brotnov had probable cause to arrest Brunette. As demonstrated above, the evidence supports such a determination. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s failure to specifically address whether Officer Brotnov had probable cause to place Brunette under arrest does not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00b638 The District Court\u2019s order denying Brunette\u2019s motion to reinstate his driver\u2019s license is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b494-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\"> The \u201cdeprivation period,\u201d formerly contained in the Administrative Rules of Montana, required an officer to observe the person for fifteen minutes before administering a breath test. <em>State v.

The findings made by the District Court do not support a determination of particularized suspicion to administer field sobriety tests, which was the basis for Brunette\u2019s arrest for DUI and subsequent seizure of his license. Indeed, careful scrutiny of the record does not demonstrate particularized suspicion for DUI at any time until <em>after </em>the administration of the tests. The District Court labored under a misconception that Brunette\u2019s failure to use a turn signal was objective evidence that <em>by itself </em>established particularized suspicion sufficient under \u00a7 61-8-403(4)(a)(i), MCA. In doing so, it failed to proceed further in judging and weighing the credibility of evidence to determine if it properly escalated into a particularized suspicion for administration of sobriety tests, particularized suspicion that Brunette was driving under the influence, and probable cause for Brunette\u2019s arrest for driving under the influence. This Court errs by supplanting the District Court\u2019s decision with its own and adding facts which were contested and at the heart of these proceedings \u2014 and, ultimately, the job of the District Court to resolve and evaluate within the proper legal framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b640 We held in <em>Hulse </em>that field sobriety tests were searches that must be supported by particularized suspicion to believe the driver was intoxicated when operating a vehicle. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 38. We observed that an investigative stop for offenses which were not related to driving under the influence could nonetheless escalate into particularized suspicion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAT\">Once a lawful stop is made, a police officer\u2019s suspicions may become further aroused and the stop may become further prolonged and the scope enlarged as required by the circumstances, <em>provided the scope of the investigation remains within the limits created by the facts upon which the stop is predicated and the suspicion which they arouse.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 40 (emphasis supplied). We provided, by way of example, that if \u201can officer only observed an individual driving with a broken taillight and after making his initial stop he did not observe any signs of intoxication, he would not have particularized suspicion that the driver was driving under the influence, and, therefore, would be prohibited from administering field sobriety tests.\u201d <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b641 Here, it was the task of the District Court, and not this Court, to assess the credibility of those facts which would support escalation into particularized suspicion for a belief that Brunette was driving under the influence. While the basis for the initial stop was undisputedly Brunette\u2019s failure to use a turn signal, the District Court did not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>either verbally or in the court\u2019s written order, assess, evaluate, or weigh the credibility of facts which would warrant the development of particularized suspicion that Brunette was driving while intoxicated. Indeed, it was highly contested whether the officer had any grounds to suspect Brunette was driving under the influence and whether the stop was pretextual. There was uncontested evidence that law enforcement made no observations of erratic driving, straddling the center line, wide turns, unnecessary acceleration or deceleration, stopping problems, etc. Indeed, the officer agreed that Brunette did not appear to have any driving problems at all. The pretextual nature of the initial stop, when the deprivation period was begun, and running the out-of-state license plates over forty minutes before making the stop were clearly troubling to the court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the context of these types of credibility issues, and the absence of any oral or written findings beyond Brunette\u2019s failure to use a turn signal and test refusal, this Court errs in stepping into the shoes of the trial court and making those \u201cimplied\u201d findings or misconstruing statements of the court into \u201coral findings.\u201d The District Court\u2019s remarks regarding watery eyes and a PBT were offered to guide counsel in the submission of its supplemental briefing, and cannot be construed as \u201coral findings\u201d of the court to supplement its written order. Opinion, \u00b6 33. Furthermore, the record does not establish at what point the officer made the observation of \u201cwatery eyes\u201d and whether it was, in fact, part of the escalation into particularized suspicion for the sobriety tests and a belief that Brunette was driving under the influence. Significantly, the District Court made no finding that Brunette had any odor of alcoholic beverage, as this Court does, and stated on the record that he had \u201csome concerns about [the] officer\u2019s conduct.\u201d The District Court\u2019s singular focus on the objective nature of Brunette\u2019s failure to use his turn signal strongly suggests that it deemed much of the officer\u2019s other testimony as untrustworthy and questionable. Such a belief was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>warranted given the circumstances of the investigation and, indeed, one of the bases for the stop \u2014 swerving and nearly crashing into another vehicle \u2014 evaporated following the officer\u2019s observation during the hearing of his in-car video. The Court errs by attributing credibility to facts necessary to substantiate reasonable suspicion when the District Court refrained from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b642 In a proceeding to reinstate a driver\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-403(4)(a)(i), MCA, the court is limited to considering whether law enforcement had particularized suspicion to believe that the person had been driving while under the influence. The District Court\u2019s singular conclusion that Brunette made a turn without using a turn single is insufficient to establish particularized suspicion to believe Brunette was driving under the influence. The District Court does not articulate those facts giving rise to an escalation of the stop and which would establish particularized suspicion for the administration of field sobriety tests and reasonable grounds to believe that Brunette was driving while under the influence. To the extent we misconstrue the District Court\u2019s order and add to its findings, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-5\">JUSTICE WHEAT joins the dissenting opinion of JUSTICE McKinnon.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-4\"> Also, Brunette presented evidence that some, if not all, of the field sobriety tests were unreliable because he suffered from two brain tumors which affected his hearing and likely his balance. There was also testimony that during the deprivation period and contrary to law enforcement procedure the officer stood outside his patrol car while Brunette was seated inside, making it unlikely the officer could observe or hear whether Brunette \u201cbelched\u201d thus rendering the preliminary breath test unreliable. Finally, Brunette who was a Wisconsin native employed by Global Energy Services on a wind farm in Glacier County, was driving a company vehicle with Texas license plates. Brunette was unfamiliar with where the registration was located within the vehicle. The District Court did not address any of this evidence in its order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
