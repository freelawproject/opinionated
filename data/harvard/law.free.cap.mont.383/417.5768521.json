Both actions were brought in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County. BNSF moved to dismiss both plaintiffs\u2019 claims for lack of personal jurisdiction. Judge Michael G. Moses, presiding over Tyrrell\u2019s action, denied BNSF\u2019s motion to dismiss. Judge G. Todd Baugh, presiding over Nelson\u2019s action, granted BNSF\u2019s motion to dismiss. BNSF appeals Judge Moses\u2019 order, and Nelson appeals Judge Baugh\u2019s order. The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">\n<em>1. Whether Montana courts have personal jurisdiction over BNSF under the FELA.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">\n<em>2. Whether Montana courts have personal jurisdiction over BNSF under Montana law.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">\u00b62 We hold that Montana courts have general personal jurisdiction over BNSF under the FELA and Montana law. We affirm Judge Moses\u2019 order denying BNSF\u2019s motion to dismiss Tyrrell\u2019s complaint. We reverse Judge Baugh\u2019s order granting BNSF\u2019s motion to dismiss Nelson\u2019s complaint. We remand both cases for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">\u00b63 In March 2011, Nelson, a North Dakota resident, sued BNSF to recover damages for knee injuries he allegedly sustained while employed by BNSF as a fuel truck driver. BNSF is a Delaware corporation, and its principal place of business is Texas. Nelson\u2019s complaint did not allege that Nelson ever worked in Montana or was injured in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">\u00b64 BNSF filed a M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss Nelson\u2019s complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. Judge Baugh granted BNSF\u2019s motion, stating: \u201cI believe 3 Judges in this District have faced similar Motions which they have denied based on applicable precedent. Their rulings seem sound but do not look at whether based on common sense it may be time to reassess FELA cases in Montana which have no forum related connection.\u201d Judge Baugh then relied upon a recent United States Supreme Court decision, <em>Daimler AG v. </em>Bauman,_ U.S. _, 134 S. Ct. 746 (2014) (discussed in our resolution of Issue 1), to hold that BNSF\u2019s \u201cdue process rights prevent this Court from exercising general all-purpose jurisdiction over [BNSF] and this Court does not have specific jurisdiction.\u201d Nelson appeals Judge Baugh\u2019s order granting BNSF\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">\u00b65 In May 2014, Tyrrell sued BNSF for injuries Brent allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>sustained during the course of his employment with BNSF. The complaint alleged that, while working for BNSF, Brent was exposed to various carcinogenic chemicals that caused him to develop kidney cancer and ultimately led to his death. The complaint did not allege that Brent ever worked for BNSF in Montana or that any of the alleged chemical exposures occurred in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b66 BNSF filed a M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss Tyrrell\u2019s complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. Judge Moses denied BNSF\u2019s motion. He adopted and incorporated Montana Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County Judge Gregory R. Todd\u2019s ruling on BNSF\u2019s M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss in <em>Jesse R. Monroy v. BNSF Ry. Co., </em>Cause No. DV 13-799 (Aug. 1, 2014). In <em>Monroy, </em>Judge Todd found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">BNSF has established 40 new facilities in Montana since 2010 and invested $470 million dollars in Montana in the last four years .... In 2010, Montana shipped by BNSF 35.2 million tons of coal, 8.5 million tons of grain and 2.9 million tons of petroleum .... In the last year approximately 57,000 BNSF rail cars of grain per year rode the rails in Montana and 230,000 BNSF rail cars of coal per year go out of Montana. In October 2013, BNSF opened an economic development office in Billings, Montana, because of the heightened amount of business not only for coal and grain in Montana, but in particular the Bakken oil development.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjK\">Judge Todd analyzed Montana and United States Supreme Court precedent interpreting the FELA. He concluded that, under Montana\u2019s long-arm statute, M. R. Civ. P. 4(b)(1), BNSF \u201cdoes meet the criteria of being found within Montana and having substantial, continuous and systematic activities within Montana for general jurisdiction purposes.\u201d BNSF appeals Judge Moses\u2019 order denying BNSF\u2019s motion to dismiss, which adopted and incorporated Judge Todd\u2019s analysis in <em>Monroy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\u00b67 \u201cThe existence of personal jurisdiction is a question of law, which we review de novo.\u201d <em>Tackett v. Duncan, </em>2014 MT 253, \u00b6 16, 376 Mont. 348, 334 P.3d 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">\u00b68 <em>1. Whether Montana courts have personal jurisdiction over BNSF </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>under the FELA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b69 Congress enacted the FELA in 1908. The Act was \u201can avowed departure from the rules of common law,\u201d in response to \u201cthe special needs of railroad workers who are daily exposed to the risks inherent in railroad work and are helpless to provide adequately for their own safety.\u201d <em>Sinkler v. Mo. Pac. R.R. Co., </em>356 U.S. 326, 329, 78 S. Ct. 758, 762 (1958). In keeping with Congressional intent, \u201c[t]he United States Supreme Court has repeatedly noted that the FELA is to be given a liberal construction in favor of injured railroad employees so that it may accomplish humanitarian and remedial purposes.\u201d <em>Labella v. Burlington N., </em>182 Mont. 202, 205, 595 P.2d 1184, 1186 (1979) (citing <em>Urie v. Thompson, </em>337 U.S. 163, 69 S. Ct. 1018 (1949); <em>Coray v. S. Pac. Co., </em>335 U.S. 520, 69 S. Ct. 275 (1949); <em>McGovern v. Phila. &amp; Reading R.R., </em>235 U.S. 389, 35 S. Ct. 127 (1914)).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b610 When the FELA was initially enacted, \u201cvenue of actions under it was left to the general venue statute, 35 Stat. 65, which fixed the venue of suits in the United States courts, based in whole or in part upon the [FELA], in districts of which the defendant was an <em>inhabitant.\u201d Balt. &amp; Ohio. R.R. Co. v. Kepner, </em>314 U.S. 44, 49, 62 S. Ct. 6, 8 (1941) (citation omitted). However, \u201c[Litigation promptly disclosed what Congress considered deficiencies in such a limitation of the right of railroad employees to bring personal injury actions.\u201d <em>Kepner, </em>314 U.S. at 49, 62 S. Ct. at 8 (citations omitted). Thus, in 1910, Congress added the following language to Section 6 of the FELA, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acx\">Under this chapter an action may be brought in a district court of the United States, in the district of the residence of the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action. The jurisdiction of the courts of the United States under this chapter shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\"><em>See Kepner, </em>314 U.S. at 49, 62 S. Ct. at 8 (citing Act of Apr. 5, 1910, Pub. L. No. 61-117, ch. 143, 36 Stat. 291).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u00b611 This language was added to rectify \u201cthe injustice to an injured employee of compelling him to go to the possibly far distant place of habitation of the defendant carrier, with consequent increased expense for the transportation and maintenance of witnesses, lawyers and parties, away from their homes.\u201d <em>Kepner, </em>314 U.S. at 50, 62 S. Ct. at 8. The amendment was \u201cdeliberately chosen to enable the plaintiff, in the words of Senator Borah, who submitted the report on the bill [to amend the FELA], \u2018to find the corporation at any point or place or State where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>it is actually carrying on business, and there lodge his action, if he chooses to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kepner, </em>314 U.S. at 50, 62 S. Ct. at 8 (quoting 45 Cong. Rec. 4034 (1910) (statement of Sen. William Borah)). In <em>Miles v. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., </em>315 U.S. 698, 702, 62 S. Ct. 827, 829 (1942), the U.S. Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">The specific declaration in [45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56] that the United States courts should have concurrent jurisdiction with those of the several states, and the prohibition against removal, point clearly to the conclusion that Congress has exercised its authority over interstate commerce to the extent of permitting suits in state courts, despite the incidental burden, where process may be obtained on a defendant ... actually carrying on railroading by operating trains and maintaining traffic offices within the territory of the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Justice Jackson, concurring, further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">Unless there is some hidden meaning in the language Congress has employed, the injured workman or his surviving dependents may choose from the entire territory served by the railroad any place in which to sue, and in which to choose either a federal or a state court of which to ask his remedy. There is nothing which requires a plaintiff to whom such a choice is given to exercise it in a self-denying or large-hearted manner. There is nothing to restrain use of that privilege ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\"><em>Miles, </em>315 U.S. at 706-07, 62 S. Ct. at 832 (Jackson, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"A5r\">\u00b612 The U.S. Supreme Court consistently has interpreted 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56 to allow state courts to hear cases brought under the FELA even where the only basis for jurisdiction is the railroad doing business in the forum state. <em>E.g., Pope v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., </em>345 U.S. 379, 73 S. Ct. 749 (1953); <em>Miles, </em>315 U.S. 698, 62 S. Ct. 827. For example, in <em>Pope, </em>a plaintiff who resided and was injured in Georgia filed a FELA action against his railroad employer, a Virginia corporation, in Alabama state court. The plaintiff grounded jurisdiction and venue on 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56. The railroad requested an injunction from a Georgia state court pursuant to a Georgia statute providing Georgia courts with the power to enjoin Georgia residents from bringing suits in a foreign jurisdiction. The Georgia Supreme Court ruled in favor of the railroad. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed, holding that 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56 \u201cestablishes a petitioner\u2019s right to sue in Alabama. It provides that the employee may bring his suit wherever the carrier \u2018shall be doing business,\u2019 and admittedly respondent does business in Jefferson County, Alabama. Congress has deliberately chosen to give petitioner a transitory cause of action....\u201d <em>Pope, </em>345 U.S. at 383, 73 S. Ct. at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>\u00b613 Similarly, in <em>Miles, </em>315 U.S. 698, 62 S. Ct. 827, a Tennessee resident was killed while working for his railroad employer in Tennessee. The railroad was an Illinois corporation. The employee\u2019s estate brought suit against the railroad in Missouri. The Tennessee Court of Appeals, at the railroad\u2019s request, permanently enjoined the employee\u2019s estate from prosecuting his claim in Missouri. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\">Congress has exercised its authority over interstate commerce to the extent of permitting suits in state courts, despite the incidental burden, where process may be obtained on a defendant ... actually carrying on railroading by operating trains and maintaining traffic offices within the territory of the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><em>Miles, </em>315 U.S. at 702, 62 S. Ct. at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u00b614 BNSF contends that Daimler,_ U.S._, 134 S. Ct. 746, overruled prior U.S. Supreme Court precedent holding the FELA conferred jurisdiction to state courts where the railroad does business. In <em>Daimler, </em>Argentinian plaintiffs filed suit in California Federal District Court against DaimlerChrysler Aktiengesellschaft (Daimler), a German public stock company headquartered in Stuttgart that manufactured Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Germany. The complaint alleged that, during Argentina\u2019s \u201cDirty War\u201d from 1976-1983, Daimler\u2019s Argentinian subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz Argentina, collaborated with Argentinian security forces to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill Mercedes-Benz Argentina workers. The plaintiffs sought damages for the alleged human rights violations from Daimler under the laws of the United States, California, and Argentina. They predicated jurisdiction over the lawsuit on the California contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of Daimler incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\u00b615 The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari \u201cto decide whether, consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth amendment, Daimler is amenable to suit in California courts for claims involving only foreign plaintiffs and occurring entirely abroad.\u201d Daimler, _ U.S. at _, 134 S. Ct. at 753. The Court emphasized that \u201cgeneral jurisdiction requires affiliations so \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as to render [the foreign corporation] essentially at home in the forum State.\u201d Daimler, _ U.S. at _ n.11, 134 S. Ct. at 758 n.11 (quoting <em>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, </em>564 U.S. 915, 919, 131 S. Ct. 2846, 2851 (2011)) (internal quotation marks omitted and changes in original). The Court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cgeneral or all-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>purpose\u201d theory of jurisdiction, under which Daimler could be sued \u201con any and all claims against it, wherever in the world the claims may arise.\u201d <em>Daimler, </em>_ U.S. at _, 134 S. Ct. at 751. The Court determined that such \u201cexorbitant\u201d exercises of personal jurisdiction are \u201cbarred by due process constraints on the assertion of adjudicatory authority.\u201d Daimler, _ U.S. at _, 134 S. Ct. at 751. The Court emphasized that \u201cno part of [Mercedes-Benz] Argentina\u2019s alleged collaboration with Argentinian authorities took place in California or anywhere else in the United States\u201d and rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to found jurisdiction over Daimler on the California contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA. Daimler, _ U.S. at _, 134 S. Ct. at 752, 760. In doing so, the Court noted that Mercedes-Benz USA\u2019s relationship with Daimler was that of an independent contractor, and it had no authority to make binding obligations or act on behalf of Daimler. Daimler, _ U.S. at _, 134 S. Ct. at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">\u00b616 <em>Daimler </em>addressed \u201cthe authority of a court in the United States to entertain a claim brought by foreign plaintiffs against a foreign defendant based on events occurring entirely outside the United States.\u201d Daimler, _ U.S. at _, 134 S. Ct. at 750. Unlike the cases before us, <em>Daimler </em>did not involve a FELA claim or a railroad defendant. Likewise, none of the cases BNSF cites to support its position that <em>Daimler </em>precludes state court jurisdiction over FELA claims against railroads involved FELA claims or railroad defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Daimler, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court did not address personal jurisdiction under the FELA, nor did it need to: the Court has long held that the FELA does not apply to torts that occur in foreign countries, even when all parties involved are citizens of the United States. <em>See N.Y. Cent. R.R. Co. v. Chisholm, </em>268 U.S. 29, 31, 45 S. Ct. 402, 402 (1925); <em>accord Cox v. Chesapeake Ohio R.R. Co., </em>494 F.2d 349, 350 (6th Cir. 1974) (noting that <em>Chisholm </em>is \u201ca firm restriction on the extra territorial application\u201d of the FELA and that \u201cthe Supreme Court apparently added to this resolve in <em>Lauritzen v. Larsen, </em>[345 U.S. 571, 581, 73 S. Ct. 921, 927 (1953)], wherein it stated that, \u2018we have held [the FELA] not applicable to an American citizen\u2019s injury sustained in Canada while in service of an American employer\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u00b617 Moreover, <em>Daimler </em>did not present novel law. Rather, the U.S. Supreme Court emphasized prior holdings that general jurisdiction requires foreign corporations to have affiliations so \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d as to render them \u201cat home\u201d in the forum state. <em>Daimler, </em>_ U.S. at _, 134 S. Ct. at 749 (citing <em>Goodyear, </em>564 U.S. at 919, 131 S. Ct. at 2851). Congress drafted the FELA to make a railroad \u201cat home\u201d for jurisdictional purposes wherever it is \u201cdoing business.\u201d <em>See Kepner, </em>314 U.S. at 49-50, 62 S. Ct. at 8 (citing 45 Cong. Rec. at 4034). Therefore, <em>Daimler </em>did not overrule decades of consistent U.S. Supreme Court precedent dictating that railroad employees may bring suit under the FELA wherever the railroad is \u201cdoing business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b618 The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Denver &amp; Rio Grande </em>W.<em>R.R. Co. v. Terte, </em>284 U.S. 284, 52 S. Ct. 152 (1932), provides further guidance on whether BNSF is subject to suit under the FELA by way of \u201cdoing business\u201d in Montana. In <em>Terte, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court addressed whether a Missouri state court could entertain a FELA suit against two different railroad companies \u2014 the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad Company (Rio Grande) and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (Santa Fe). The railroad employee sought damages for injuries sustained in Colorado by the railroad companies\u2019 joint negligence. The U.S. Supreme Court addressed the personal jurisdiction of the Missouri court over the two railroads, respectively. The Court held that the Rio Grande could not be sued in Missouri, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">The Rio Grande, a Delaware corporation, operates lines which lie wholly within Colorado, Utah and New Mexico. It neither owns nor operates any line in Missouri; but it does own and use some property located there. It maintains one or more offices in the State and employs agents who solicit traffic. These agents engage in transactions incident to the procurement, delivery and record of such traffic. It is not licensed to do business in Missouri.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-8\"><em>Terte, </em>284 U.S. at 286, 52 S. Ct. at 153. By contrast, the U.S. Supreme Court held that \u201cthe Santa Fe was properly sued\u201d in Missouri, relying on the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">The Santa Fe, a Kansas corporation, owns and operates railroad lines in Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, and other States. It is licensed to do business in Missouri and has an office and agents in Jackson CountyL, Missouri]. These agents transact the business ordinarily connected with the operation of a carrier by railroad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANO\"><em>Terte, </em>284 U.S. at 286, 52 S. Ct. at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">\u00b619 It is undisputed that BNSF owns and operates railroad lines in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Montana. BNSF is licensed to do business and has offices and agents in Montana. BNSF\u2019s agents in Montana transact business ordinarily connected with the operation of a railroad carrier. Thus, under the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Terte, </em>BNSF is \u201cproperly sued\u201d in Montana. <em>See Terte, </em>284 U.S. at 287-88, 52 S. Ct. at 153. BNSF is \u201cdoing business\u201d in Montana, and Montana courts have general personal jurisdiction over BNSF under 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b620 This conclusion is in line with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cliberal construction\u201d of the FELA in favor of injured railroad workers. <em>See Urie, </em>337 U.S. at 180, 69 S. Ct. at 1030. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56 does not specify whether the \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction\u201d conferred upon the state and federal courts refers only to subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction, the U.S. Supreme Court has never given it such an interpretation, and it is not the province of this Court to insert such a limitation. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (\u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is ... not to insert what has been omitted ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b621 Moreover, as BNSF\u2019s counsel acknowledged at oral argument, BNSF\u2019s interpretation of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56 would mean that a Montana resident, hired and employed by BNSF in Montana, who was injured while working \u2014 even temporarily \u2014 for BNSF in another state, would not be able to bring his action in the state in which he regularly resides and where his employer regularly conducts business. Such a result is in direct contravention of the FELA\u2019s purpose of protecting injured railroad workers from what the U.S. Supreme Court characterized as the \u201cinjustice\u201d of having to travel far from home to bring suit against the railroad. <em>See Kepner, </em>314 U.S. at 49-50, 62 S. Ct. at 8. And if Montana residents may sue BNSF in a Montana state court for injuries that occur outside of Montana, so may residents of other states. <em>See Miles, </em>315 U.S. at 704, 62 S.

According to BNSF, it has over 2,000 miles of railroad track and more than 2,000 employees in Montana. BNSF maintains facilities in Montana, owns real estate in Montana, has a telephone listing in Montana, and does direct advertising in Montana with Montana media. Each of these factors is significant in determining whether general jurisdiction over BNSF exists. <em>See Bedrejo v. Triple E Can., </em>Ltd., 1999 MT 200, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12, 295 Mont. 430, 984 P.2d 739. Though BNSF alleges that its revenues from Montana represent less than ten percent of its nationwide business, that fact alone does not defeat personal jurisdiction. <em>See Reed v. Am.

Judge Baugh, though he granted BNSF\u2019s motion to dismiss, recognized that BNSF \u201chas way more than minimum contacts with the State of Montana. It is a significant, substantial, continuous and systematic business enterprise in Montana even though its operations in some of the 27 other states it operates in are far greater.\u201d With that aspect of Judge Baugh\u2019s opinion, we agree: BNSF maintains substantial, continuous, and systematic contacts with Montana. Thus, BNSF is \u201cfound within\u201d the state under M. R. Civ. P. 4(b)(1). <em>See Tackett, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b628 Given that personal jurisdiction exists pursuant to M. R.

BNSF\u2019s contention that it is not subject to personal jurisdiction in Montana courts is largely based on its incorrect interpretation of <em>Daimler, </em>discussed in our resolution of Issue 1. In contrast to BNSF\u2019s position, we have held that \u201c[t]he District Courts of Montana clearly have jurisdiction\u201d to hear FELA cases. <em>Labella, </em>182 Mont. at 204, 595 P.2d at 1186.

R.R., 282 </em>Mont. 233, 245, 937 P.2d 27, 34 (1997). This is especially true regarding a plaintiffs forum selection under the FELA, <em>Davis, </em>282 Mont. at 245-46, 937 P.2d at 34, \u201ceven if that choice of forum involves forum shopping,\u201d <em>State ex rel.

I would conclude that the District Courts lack general (all-purpose) personal jurisdiction over BNSF in the consolidated appeals under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The United States Supreme Court has made clear twice within the last five years that a state court may assert general jurisdiction over a foreign corporation under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201conly when the corporation\u2019s affiliations with the State in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>which suit is brought are so constant and pervasive \u2018as to render it essentially at home in the forum State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daimler AG v. Bauman, </em>_ U.S. _, 134 S. Ct. 746, 751 (2014) (quoting <em>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, </em>564 U.S. 915, 919, 131 S. Ct. 2846, 2851 (2011)) (brackets omitted). The United States Supreme Court has made it equally clear that merely \u201cengag[ing] in a substantial, continuous, and systematic course of business\u201d with the forum State is insufficient standing alone to subject a defendant to general jurisdiction. <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 761. Such a formulation, the Supreme Court has explained, would be \u201cunacceptably grasping.\u201d <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b633 Disregarding the United States Supreme Court\u2019s express holdings in <em>Goodyear </em>and in <em>Daimler, </em>this Court entirely rejects the \u201cat home\u201d standard in favor of substantially the same formulation that the Supreme Court rejected. Despite the United States Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that permitting general jurisdiction wherever a nonresident defendant is engaging in a substantial, continuous, and systematic course of business would deprive the defendant due process of law, this Court holds that BNSF can be haled into Montana state courts under the \u201cdoing business\u201d standard. The reasons that this Court gives for disregarding the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cat home\u201d formulation and adopting the \u201cdoing business\u201d standard are, in my view, unpersuasive. This case is quite clearly controlled by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Goodyear andDaimler </em>and the \u201cat home\u201d standard set forth therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">\u00b634 The Court does not contend, nor could it seriously contend, that the plaintiffs are able to satisfy the \u201cat home\u201d standard enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Goodyear </em>and in <em>Daimler. </em>In <em>Goodyear, </em>decided in 2011, the Supreme Court held that under the Due Process Clause a \u201ccourt may assert general jurisdiction over foreign (sister-state or foreign-country) corporations to hear any and all claims against them when their affiliations with the State are so \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as to render them essentially at home in the forum State.\u201d <em>Goodyear, </em>564 U.S. at 919, 131 S. Ct. at 2851. In the wake of <em>Goodyear, </em>many legal commentators \u2014 who had come to believe that general jurisdiction could be exercised wherever a corporation engaged in continuous and systematic business \u2014 openly questioned whether the Supreme Court actually intended to impose such a stringent standard for general jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause. <em>See, e.g., </em>Todd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>David Peterson, <em>The Timing of Minimum Contacts After Goodyear and McIntyre, </em>80 Geo.Wash. L. Rev. 202, 214-15, 217 (2011) (contending that the Court\u2019s restriction of general jurisdiction to corporations that are \u201cessentially at home\u201d should he dismissed as \u201cloose language\u201d). \u00b635 In <em>Daimler, </em>decided three years later, the Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Goodyear </em>and expanded upon its earlier analysis. In <em>Daimler, </em>the plaintiffs brought suit in California federal court against the German corporation Daimler, the manufacturer of Mercedes-Benz automobiles, seeking damages under federal statutory law on the theory that Daimler unlawfully aided the commission of horrific human rights violations against them in Argentina. The plaintiffs maintained that the federal court could exercise general jurisdiction over Daimler because of the \u201csubstantial, continuous, and systematic\u201d contacts in California of Daimler\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz USA, who operates \u201cmultiple California-based facilities\u201d and is \u201cthe largest supplier of luxury vehicles to the California market.\u201d <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b636 The Court assumed, for purposes of its personal jurisdiction analysis, that Mercedes-Benz USA\u2019s contacts were fully imputable to Daimler. Still, even with the contacts of Mercedes-Benz fully attributable to Daimler, the Court rejected the contention that Daimler was subject to general jurisdiction in California. The Court held that the standard of \u201csubstantial, continuous, and systematic course of business\u201d was \u201cunacceptably grasping\u201d and \u201cexorbitant,\u201d explaining that the Due Process Clause imposes a more stringent standard for state courts attempting to exercise general jurisdiction. <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 761. The Court explained that the proper inquiry for purposes of general jurisdiction \u201cis <em>not </em>whether a foreign corporation\u2019s in-forum contacts can be said to be in some sense \u2018continuous and systematic,\u2019 \u201d but rather \u201cwhether that corporation\u2019s affiliations with the State are <em>so </em>\u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as to <em>render it essentially at home </em>in the forum State.\u201d <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 752 (quoting <em>Goodyear, </em>564 U.S. at 919, 131 S. Ct. at 2851) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). A corporation is \u201cessentially at home,\u201d the Court instructed, where it is incorporated or where it has its principal place of business. <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 760. The Court explained that only in an \u201cexceptional case\u201d will a corporation be deemed essentially at home in another State. <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 761 n.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b637 Here, there is no dispute that BNSF\u2019s affiliations with Montana are not so substantial as to render it essentially \u201cat home\u201d in this State. BNSF is not incorporated under the laws of Montana, nor does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>it have its principal place of business in Montana. These two facts alone are strong evidence that BNSF is not at home in Montana. \u201cWith respect to a corporation, the place of incorporation and principal place of business are \u2018paradigm bases for general jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 760 (brackets, ellipsis, and citation omitted). \u201cThose affiliations have the virtue of being unique \u2014 that is, each ordinarily indicates only one place \u2014 as well as easily ascertainable.\u201d <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 760. It is only in an \u201cexceptional case\u201d that a State will have general jurisdiction over a corporation outside of its place of incorporation and principal place of business. <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 761 n.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b638 There is nothing exceptional about BNSF\u2019s contacts with Montana that would permit general jurisdiction. While BNSF certainly conducts substantial business in Montana, \u201cthe general jurisdiction inquiry does not \u2018focus solely on the magnitude of the defendant\u2019s in-state contacts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 762 n.20 (brackets and citation omitted). Indeed, in <em>Daimler, </em>the Court refused to find personal jurisdiction despite the fact that Mercedes-Benz USA distributes tens of thousands of cars to California, generates billions of dollars in revenue from California, and has multiple facilities in the State, including a regional headquarters. <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 752.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cGeneral jurisdiction instead calls for an appraisal of a corporation\u2019s activities in their entirety, nationwide and worldwide.\u201d <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 762 n.20. \u201cA corporation that operates in many places can scarcely be deemed at home in all of them.\u201d <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 762 n.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b639 Applying the United States Supreme Court\u2019s directive and comparing BNSF\u2019s activities in Montana with its nationwide activities, it is clear that BNSF is not at home in Montana. BNSF receives less than 10% of its revenue from Montana; barely 6% of BNSF\u2019s total track mileage is located in Montana; and less than 5% of BNSF\u2019s total workforce is located in Montana. These percentages, though slightly greater, differ little from those the Court found to be insufficient in <em>Daimler. See Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 752 (noting Mercedes Benz USA\u2019s sales make up 2.4% of Daimler\u2019s worldwide sales).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b640 In <em>Daimler, </em>the Court cited <em>Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., </em>342 U.S. 437, 72 S. Ct. 413, as the \u201ctextbook\u201d example of an \u201cexceptional case\u201d where general jurisdiction may exist outside the corporation\u2019s place of incorporation and principal place of business. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Perkins, </em>the defendant company\u2019s primary place of business was, because of wartime circumstances, temporarily located in Ohio, where the company was sued. <em>Perkins, </em>342 U.S. 437, 447-48, 72 S. Ct. at 419-20. The Court deemed the place of service in those unusual circumstances \u201ca surrogate for the place of incorporation or head office.\u201d <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 756 n.8 (citations omitted). On that basis alone, the Court concluded that Ohio courts could exercise general jurisdiction over the company without offending due process. <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 756. In contrast, BNSF\u2019s contacts with Montana are far from establishing a surrogate principal place of business in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"ATL\">\u00b641 In short, BNSF\u2019s contacts with Montana are insufficient to satisfy the due process standard set forth by <em>Goodyear </em>and <em>Daimler </em>to permit BNSF to be haled into courts of this State. That much is not in dispute. And, in my view, that is where the analysis of this case should come to end.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b642 Acknowledging that BNSF is not \u201cat home\u201d in Montana, the Court persists that BNSF can be brought before tribunals of this State under a less stringent standard, holding that BNSF need only be \u201cdoing business\u201d in Montana for state district courts to sustain general jurisdiction. Opinion, \u00b6 12. The Court reasons that the Due Process Clause demands less in this case than in <em>Goodyear </em>and in <em>Daimler </em>because, unlike in those cases, this case involves a \u201cFELA claim [and] a railroad defendant.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b643 I must disagree with the Court\u2019s refusal to apply the teachings of <em>Goodyear </em>and <em>Daimler. </em>Flowing from the Due Process Clause, the requirement that a state court have personal jurisdiction is \u201cfirst of all an individual right\u201d under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie Des Bauxites De Guinee, </em>456 U.S. 694, 702, 102 S. Ct. 2099, 2105 (1982). \u201cIt represents a restriction on judicial power not as a matter of sovereignty, but as a matter of individual liberty.\u201d <em>Insurance Corp. of Ireland, </em>456 U.S. at 702, 102 S. Ct. at 2104. That is to say, personal jurisdiction imposes a limitation on a state court\u2019s power to \u201cprotect the liberty of the nonresident defendant.\u201d <em>Walden v. </em>Fiore, _ U.S. _, 134 S. Ct. 1115, 1122 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\u00b644 I perceive no sound basis to afford BNSF less constitutional protection than the defendants were afforded in <em>Goodyear </em>and in <em>Daimler. </em>The United States Supreme Court has consistently explained that the inquiry under personal jurisdiction does not focus on the unilateral actions of the plaintiff, but instead focuses on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>defendant\u2019s relationship with the forum State. <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1122 (citing <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, </em>466 U.S. 408, 417, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 1873 (1984)). Indeed, there is no authority for the proposition that the quality or quantity of process afforded a defendant by the requirement of general jurisdiction depends on the type of cause of action pursued by the plaintiff or the occupation of the defendant. A defendant does not forfeit liberty or have a diminished liberty interest merely because the plaintiff brings a FELA action. Nor does a defendant forfeit constitutional protection by operating a railroad. It is thus altogether immaterial under the general jurisdiction inquiry that the plaintiffs here brought a FELA claim rather than a Torture Victim Protection claim <em>{Daimler) </em>or a negligence claim <em>{Goodyear). </em>It is likewise wholly immaterial that BNSF operates a railroad as opposed to a car dealership <em>{Daimler) </em>or a tire manufacturing operation <em>(Goodyear). </em>The Due Process Clause requires a defendant to be \u201cat home\u201d to be subject to general jurisdiction in the forum State, <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 754, and the Supreme Court has defined \u201cat home\u201d for a corporation as \u201cthe place of incorporation\u201d and the \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d of the corporation. <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 760. In so doing, the Court has established the minimum, base-line guarantee of due process that must be afforded defendants by the Constitution of the United States. BNSF should not be haled into a state court in Montana under any less stringent of a standard. Simply put, there is not a different, less protective Due Process Clause for BNSF; it is entitled to the same due process of law as every other defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b645 The Court persists that a \u201ccentury\u201d of United States Supreme Court precedent dictates otherwise, Opinion, \u00b6 22, reasoning that \u201cdecades of consistent\u201d Supreme Court decisions show that a nonresident railroad is subject to general jurisdiction wherever the railroad is \u201cdoing business.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 17. Remarkably, the Court arrives at this conclusion <em>without citing a single </em>general jurisdiction case. The Court instead cites three United States Supreme Court <em>decisions </em>\u2014 Pope, <em>Miles, </em>and <em>Terte </em>\u2014 having nothing to do with general jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause. In <em>Pope </em>and in <em>Miles, </em>the Supreme Court addressed whether FELA prevented state courts from using their equitable powers to enjoin their residents from bringing vexatious suits in other state courts. <em>Pope, </em>345 U.S. at 380, 73 S. Ct. at 750; <em>Miles, </em>315 U.S. at 699, 62 S. Ct. at 828. In <em>Terte, </em>the Court addressed whether interstate commerce is unduly burdened by bringing an action under FELA in respect to an injury sustained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>another State. <em>Terte, </em>284 U.S. at 287, 52 S. Ct. at 153. These cases do not so much as mention the Due Process Clause or general jurisdiction. Nor have the cases ever been cited by the United States Supreme Court or any other court \u2014 until now \u2014 for any proposition remotely related to general jurisdiction. This claimed \u201ccentury\u201d of United States Supreme Court precedent permitting general jurisdiction wherever a nonresident railroad is doing business simply does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b646 Further, even if the cases cited by the Court actually stood for the propositions cited for, it would not matter. Notwithstanding the Court\u2019s statement that these cases show \u201cdecades of consistent\u201d precedent, none of the cited cases were decided within the last six decades. In <em>Daimler, </em>the plaintiffs emphasized earlier Supreme Court decisions that seemingly upheld general jurisdiction under a formulation less stringent than the \u201cat home\u201d standard. The Supreme Court, however, refused to follow these decisions, explaining that they were decided in a different \u201cera\u201d before modern general jurisdiction developed. <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 761 n.18. After dismissing the decisions in a footnote, the Court made clear once again that the proper inquiry under the Due Process Clause is whether a nonresident corporation\u2019s contacts are so constant and pervasive as to render it \u201cessentially at home in the forum State.\u201d <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 761. Thus, whatever standard earlier decisions may or may not have used, the Supreme Court has now made clear that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires a defendant to be \u201cat home\u201d in the forum State to be subject to general jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b647 Lastly, the Court contends that Congress, <em>not </em>the Constitution, controls the sufficiency of process that is required to hale BNSF into state courts in Montana. Pushing aside the constitutional restrictions imposed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Court maintains that Congress has conferred general jurisdiction under 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56 of FELA, to state courts and has chosen to provide BNSF with less protection than the United States Supreme Court has held is required by the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u00b648 I again must disagree with the Court. Congress did not, nor could it, do so. First, Congress did not confer personal jurisdiction with the passage of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56. Section 56 is a venue statute for the federal courts, not a grant of personal jurisdiction to state courts. The United States Supreme Court has made this point clear: 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u201c[5]6 establishes <em>venue </em>for an action in the <em>federal </em>courts.\u201d <em>Balt. &amp; O. R. Co. v. Kepner, </em>314 U.S. 44, 52, 62 S. Ct. 6, 9 (1941) (emphasis added). Indeed, the \u201cphrasing of the section is not unique: it follows the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>familiar pattern generally employed by Congress in framing venue provisions.\u201d <em>Kepner, </em>314 U.S. at 56, 62 S. Ct. at 11 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (citing several federal venue statutes). Notably, even the cases the Court <em>cites </em>\u2014 for the erroneous proposition that a \u201ccentury\u201d of Supreme Court precedent dictates general jurisdiction exists wherever a railroad is doing business \u2014 expressly state that \u00a7 56 confers venue in the federal courts. <em>Miles, </em>315 U.S. at 710, 62 S. Ct. at 833 (\u201cthe provision of \u00a7 [5]6 \u2018filled the entire field of <em>venue </em>in <em>federal </em>courts\u2019 \u201d); <em>Pope, </em>345 U.S. at 383, 73 S. Ct. at 752 (\u00a7 56 provides an \u201cemployee a right to establish <em>venue </em>in the <em>federal </em>court\u201d) (emphasis added). Personal jurisdiction does not result from 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56, and in the century since its enactment, no court has ever concluded that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b649 Second, assuming for the sake of argument that \u00a7 56 does confer personal jurisdiction, it surely does not confer it to state courts. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56 provides that \u201can action may be brought in a circuit [district] court <em>of the United States, </em>in the district of the residence of the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action.\u201d (Emphasis added). By its plain language, \u00a7 56 applies only to \u201ccourt[s] of the United States.\u201d Seizing on the statute\u2019s subsequent language that allows for \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction\u201d with the several States, the Court persists that this language grants state courts personal jurisdiction. The phrase \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction\u201d is a well-known term of art long employed by Congress and courts to refer to subject-matter jurisdiction, not personal jurisdiction. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 467e; 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1704; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 678; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1829; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1); <em>Claflin v. Houseman, </em>93 U.S. 130, 134 (1876); <em>Mims v. Arrow Fin. Servs., </em>LLC, _ U.S. _, 132 S. Ct. 740, 745 (2012).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>'<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly interpreted the concurrent jurisdiction language within 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56 to denote the conveyance of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R. Co. v. Stapleton, </em>279 U.S. 587, 49 S. Ct. 442 (1929); <em>Norfolk S. Ry. v. Sorrell, </em>549 U.S. 158, 127 S. Ct. 799 (2007). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The congressional grant of concurrent jurisdiction with the several States clearly refers to a grant of subject-matter jurisdiction over FELA actions, not a grant of personal jurisdiction over individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b650 Lastly, Congress lacks authority to confer personal jurisdiction to state courts where the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment would prohibit it. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o State shall... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d The United States Supreme Court has made clear that the Constitution \u201cgrants Congress no power to restrict, abrogate, or dilute these guarantees.\u201d <em>Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, </em>458 U.S. 718, 732, 102 S. Ct. 3331, 3340 (1982). Indeed, it is well established that \u201cneither Congress nor a State can validate a law that denies the rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Hogan, </em>458 U.S. at 732, 102 S. Ct. at 3340 (citing <em>Califano v. Goldfarb, </em>430 U.S. 199, 210, 97 S. Ct. 1021, 1028 (1977); <em>Williams v. Rhodes, </em>393 U.S. 23, 29, 89 S. Ct. 5, 10 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b651 As explained above, the requirement that a state court have personal jurisdiction flows from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and protects the individual \u201cliberty of the nonresident defendant.\u201d <em>Walden, </em>134 S. Ct. at 1122. The United States Supreme Court has held that consistent with the guarantee of individual liberty that Clause prohibits a nonresident defendant from being haled into a state court for all purposes unless the defendant\u2019s \u201caffiliations with the State in which suit is brought are so constant and pervasive \u2018as to render it essentially at home in the forum State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 751 (quoting <em>Goodyear, </em>564 U.S. at 919, 131 S. Ct. at 2851) (brackets omitted). Congress cannot by way of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56, or any federal law, \u201crestrict, abrogate, or dilute\u201d that constitutional guarantee. <em>Hogan, </em>458 U.S. at 732, 102 S. Ct. at 3340.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b652 In sum, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o State shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d That Clause prohibits a state court from exercising general jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant unless the defendant\u2019s contacts with the State are so pervasive as to render the defendant essentially \u201cat home\u201d in the State. <em>Daimler, </em>134 S. Ct. at 751. Because there is no dispute that BNSF\u2019s contacts are not so pervasive as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>render it essentially at home in Montana, I would conclude that the two Montana State District Courts in the consolidated appeals lack general jurisdiction over BNSF under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b653 The Court does not address whether BNSF consented to jurisdiction in Montana, and I will reserve judgment on that issue as well. For unless the United States Supreme Court meant something other than what it said, I will get an opportunity to ultimately provide my thoughts on that argument in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b654 I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\"> <em>See also Daimler, </em>134 S.
