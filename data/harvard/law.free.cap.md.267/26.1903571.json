We shall dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In June 1970 the appellee (Unger) and about 60 other owners of lots in \u201cSwan Harbor,\u201d a development in the Meekins Neck section of the Hooper\u2019s Island District of Dorchester County, filed a bill of complaint against the appellants (Golden Hill), the developers, seeking the specific performance of certain provisions of a contract, an injunction, and other relief. After a rash of pleading and discovery Golden Hill, in November 1971, filed a counterclaim against Unger. Unger demurred. Judge Mace sustained his demurrer in respect of Counts I and II, with leave to amend, and in respect of Count III,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>without leave to amend. Golden Hill appealed \u201cfrom the ruling . . . sustaining . . . Unger [\u2019s] demurrer to Count III . . . [the] ruling having been entered on\u201d 16 February 1972. The only evidence in the record of the chancellor\u2019s ruling is his comment at the conclusion of the hearing on 14 February 1972 and the docket entry apparently made on the same day. Judge Mace said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u201c. . . Madam Clerk, as to the demurrer of Vernon Unger to the counterclaim of the defendant [appellants] it is sustained as to Counts I and II . . . with leave to amend. . . . [A]s to Count III [it] is sustained without leave to amend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The docket entry is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201c1972 February 14th. Demurrer of Vernon S. Unger to the counterclaim of the defendants is sustained as to Counts 1 and 2 with leave to amend within 20 days. Count 3 is sustained without leave to amend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>There is no docket entry for 16 February. We shall assume that what was meant in the notice of appeal was 14 February since the ruling is correctly described.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Since Rule 345 e cannot apply where the demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend, as to one count in a three count counterclaim (assuming a counterclaim is a \u201cdeclaration\u201d within the meaning of the rule), there must be a final judgment for costs before an appeal to this Court can lie, and there is no such judgment here. <em>Ernst v. Keough, </em>197 Md. 554, 80 A. 2d 23 (1951). Even if such a judgment had been entered compliance with Rule 605 a would have been necessary before an appeal could lie; and there is no evidence that Rule 605 a was ever mentioned. <em>Parish v. Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>250 Md. 24, 96, 242 A. 2d 512 (1968), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 940 (1971); cf. <em>Diener Enterprises, Inc. v. Miller, </em>266 Md. 551, 295 A. 2d 470. Although we are dealing with an equity case we have assumed, for the purpose of discussion, that the rules governing law cases would be applicable to Golden Hill\u2019s counterclaim. But if the rules governing equity cases are applicable then it is clear that the chancellor neither signed nor filed a written order. <em>Kennedy v. Foley, </em>240 Md. 615, 214 A. 2d 815 (1965). But whether it is one way or the other the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-15\">. 345 e \u2014 \u201cAn order sustaining a demurrer to an entire declaration without leave to amend, shall be deemed to include and constitute a final judgment for costs for the demurring party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-16\">373 d \u2014 \u201cSection e of Rule 345 (Demurrer) shall apply to this Rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-17\">605 a \u2014 \u201cWhere more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the court may direct the entry of a final judgment upon one or more but less than all of the claims only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.

Plaintiff, Unger, knew at the time that these threats were made that he was not entitled to the work to be done on his lot and without cause did extort from defendant, Belfiore, the promise to do such grading and filling work on the lot through threat to interrupt a meeting, the outcome of which was crucial to the defendant, Belfiore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">\u201c4.
