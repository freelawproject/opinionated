J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AM\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">This appeal involves an eighty-four acre tract of land in Allegany County, located approximately six miles west of Cumberland at the intersection of Vocke and Winchester Roads in LaVale, Maryland. The LaVale Zoning Board, on appellants\u2019 petition, changed the zoning classification of the property from Residential A and Rural Residential to Commercial A, thereby making possible the proposed construction of an enclosed shopping mall of approximately 500,000 square feet, accommodating over fifty stores.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s decision was premised on its finding, made after an evidentiary hearing, that there had been a substantial change in the character of the neighborhood since the original zoning in 1957. Appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u2014property owners residing in the area of the subject property \u2014 appealed to the Circuit Court for Allegany County. That court (Getty, J.) concluded that the rezoning was not justified because no legally sufficient evidence to establish a change in the character of the neighborhood had been adduced before the Board. The court reversed the Board\u2019s decision and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Appellants contend that Judge Getty erred in denying their Motion Ne Recipiatur to exclude appellees\u2019 appeal to the Circuit Court for Allegany County, filed on the ground that appellees had failed to serve a copy of their Petition of Appeal upon the LaVale Zoning Board as required by Maryland Rule B2 e, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">\u201cThe appellant shall join with his order for appeal, or shall file with the clerk of the court, within ten days after filing the order, a petition setting forth the action appealed from, the error committed by the agency in taking such action, and the relief sought, <em>and shall serve a copy thereof on the agency.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The record discloses that by letter dated March 3, 1972, addressed to the Board\u2019s office, appellees\u2019 counsel notified the Board that its decision of February 14, 1972 granting the requested reclassification would be appealed to the Circuit Court for Allegany County. Appellees thereafter filed both their order and petition of appeal in the Circuit Court on March 6, 1972; the certificate of service appended to the order and petition of appeal specified that copies thereof had been mailed to Leslie Clark, attorney for the Board, on March 3, 1972 at his designated office address (not the address of the Board). It was Clark\u2019s testimony that he did not receive either the order or petition of appeal. Other testimony in the record from the secretary to counsel for appellees was to the effect that she typed both the order and petition of appeal and personally mailed a copy of each on March 3, 1972 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>in th&amp; same envelope to the Board\u2019s counsel at his office address. The secretary testified that she particularly remembered these events because her employer advised her of the importance and necessity of complying with the various notices required by the law. There was other evidence in the case showing that on March 16, 1972 the Board\u2019s counsel notified all parties that the appeal had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In denying appellants\u2019 Motion Ne Recipiatur, Judge Getty held, in effect, that personal service upon the Board of the petition of appeal was not required; that the appellees had filed their petition of appeal with the Circuit Court and certified that a copy had been served on the agency by service upon its counsel; and that the mailing of a copy of the petition to the Board\u2019s counsel constituted \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the provisions of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Implicit in Judge Getty\u2019s opinion is his conclusion that the petition of appeal was in fact properly mailed to the Board\u2019s counsel. Under Maryland law, such a finding raises a presumption that the petition \u201creached its destination at the regular time and was received by the person to whom it was addressed.\u201d <em>Kolker v. Biggs, </em>203 Md. 137, 144, 99 A. 2d 743, 746 (\u00cd953). See also <em>Mohr v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., </em>216 Md. 197, 140 A. 2d 49 (1958); <em>McFerren v. Goldsmith-Stern Co., </em>137 Md. 573, 113 A. 107 (1921). Clark\u2019s testimony that he did not receive a copy of the petition did not, of course, conclusively rebut the presumption of its receipt; rather, it was merely evidence for the trier of fact to consider, together with the other evidence in the case, in determining whether a copy of the petition had been mailed to Clark, as specified in the certificate of service, and received by him. On the record before us, we cannot say that the balance struck by Judge Getty was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Appellants urge that even if a copy of the petition was served upon the Board\u2019s counsel, the appeal to the Circuit Court nevertheless should have been dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>under Maryland Rule B5 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because Maryland Rule B2 e requires that a copy of the petition be served \u201con the agency\u201d and service thereof upon counsel for the agency does not constitute compliance with the Rule. Rule B5 mandates dismissal of an appeal where the appellant \u201cshall fail to file\u201d either the order or petition of appeal \u201cwithin the time prescribed\u201d by the Rules, \u201cunless cause to the contrary be shown.\u201d In <em>Volk v. Pugatch, </em>262 Md. 80, 277 A. 2d 17 (1971), we approved the granting of a motion to dismiss where the appellant completely failed to file the petition of appeal required by Rule B2 e and also failed to transmit the record and testimony, as required by Rule B7 a. In <em>Salisbury Board of Zoning Appeals v. Bounds, </em>240 Md. 547, 214 A. 2d 810 (1965), we reversed the lower court\u2019s ruling refusing to dismiss an appeal where the appellants failed to file a petition of appeal setting forth the error committed by the agency until thirty days beyond the time prescribed for such filing by Rule B2 e. Both <em>Volk </em>and <em>Bounds </em>involved failure to file a petition of Appeal complying with the requirements of Rule B2 e; in each case, we noted that the Rule did not require a showing of prejudice to the adverse party as a prerequisite to dismissal of the appeal. In <em>Town of Somerset v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>245 Md. 52, 225 A. 2d 294 (1966), the petition was timely filed but failed to expressly allege that appellants were persons aggrieved by the Board\u2019s order. We there held, in refusing to approve a dismissal of the appeal, that \u201c[w]here there is compliance with the substance of the requirements of statutes or rules and the other parties have not been prejudiced, technical irregularities cannot be made the basis for depriving persons of the opportunity to assert their legal rights.\u201d 245 Md. at 61, 225 A. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>at 299-300. In <em>Board of County Commissioners v. Kines, </em>239 Md. 119, 210 A. 2d 367 (1965), it was claimed that the appeal was subject to dismissal because a copy of the <em>order </em>of appeal had not been served on the agency prior to its filing with the Clerk of the lower court, as required by Rule B2 c. After noting that the agency received a copy of the <em>petition </em>of appeal before the expiration of the time for appeal, and therefore had \u201cfull and timely notice\u201d that its action was sought to be overturned, we ruled that there was \u201csubstantial compliance with the appeal procedures.\u201d 239 Md. at 125, 210 A. 2d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Appellees in the present case did not \u201cfail to file\u201d their order and petition of appeal \u201cwithin the time prescribed\u201d by the Rules; on the contrary, the order and petition were both filed with the Clerk of the lower court well within the time prescribed by Rule B2. The content of the petition of appeal fully complied with the requirements of Rule B2 e; indeed, a review of the petition shows that it sets forth, in extended detail, as required by the Rule, \u201cthe action appealed from, the error committed by the agency in taking such action, and the relief sought.\u201d Three days prior to filing their order and petition of appeal, appellees notified the Board by letter sent to its office that an appeal would be taken from its decision granting the requested reclassification. The Board\u2019s counsel, who had appeared on its behalf at the zoning hearing, and upon whom a copy of the petition of appeal had been timely served, thereafter notified all other parties on March 16, 1972 \u2014 ten days after the petition was filed \u2014 that an appeal had been taken. It may be presumed that in affording such notification, as required by Rule B2 d, counsel was acting on the Board\u2019s behalf. Plainly, therefore, this is not a case where the agency\u2019s failure to receive a copy of the petition of appeal kept'it in darkness ; clearly, it had full and timely notice that its decision had been appealed and thus the real purpose of Rule B2 e was satisfied. In these particular circumstances, the lack of any prejudice being manifest, the failure of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>appellees to serve a copy of their timely filed petition of appeal \u201con the agency,\u201d as they did on the Board\u2019s counsel, does not mandate dismissal of the appeal under Rule B5. We think this case wholly unlike either <em>Volk </em>or <em>Bounds </em>where no proper petitions of appeal were ever timely filed; it is closer to <em>Kines </em>and <em>Town of Somerset </em>and while, because of the differing factual situation, it is not controlled by either of those cases, the substance of compliance with Rule B2 e, as in those cases, is wholly apparent. We, therefore, conclude that appellants\u2019 Motion Ne Recipiatur was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Appellants contend that the lower court erroneously substituted its judgment for that of the Board by finding the reclassification unreasonable and arbitrary and not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The Board found that while there had been no mistake in the original zoning, there had been a substantial change in the surrounding neighborhood since the adoption of the zoning map of sufficient weight to justify reclassification of the subject property. The Board\u2019s finding was expressly made dependent on \u201cvarious factors cumulative in nature,\u201d which included construction of the National Freeway between Cumberland and LaVale \u201cwith its two interchanges [off Vocke and Winchester Roads] all within approximately one mile . . . [of the subject property]\u201d; the widening of Vocke Road (which bordered one side of the subject tract) from a two-lane, sixteen-foot road to a six-lane, fifty-foot divided highway; the widening of Winchester Road (bordering another side of the subject property) from a two-lane road to a four-lane road; a consequent increase in vehicular traffic occasioned by the road construction; commercialization \u201cin the area\u201d which has been in process since the inception of the LaVale Zoning Ordinance; one reclassification for commercial purposes of a property directly across from the subject property (a roller rink); installation of water and sewerage facilities; and the compatibility of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>proposed use of the subject property with the \u201csurrounding area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The Board concluded in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">\u201cWhile any one of the various elements . . . may not be of itself sufficient, yet we find that the cumulative effect of all these factors has resulted in a substantial change in the neighborhood of sufficient weight to justify a map change.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Other evidence before the Board showed that the Searstown Shopping Center was located on property diagonally across from the intersection of Winchester and Vocke Roads; that the shopping center property extended northerly along Winchester Road almost to the Freeway interchange; that this land had been zoned commercial since the adoption of the zoning map in 1957; and that various commercial establishments existed along Route 40, an area, zoned commercial since 1957, which lay to the north of the Freeway.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">In his opinion reversing the Board\u2019s decision, Judge Getty noted that to justify a zoning reclassification, the Maryland cases require a showing of three elements, <em>viz.,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">\u201c1. What area reasonably constituted the \u2018neighborhood\u2019 of the subject property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">2. The changes which have occurred in that neighborhood since the original zoning;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">3. That these changes resulted in a change in the character of the neighborhood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">Judge Getty concluded that there was no evidence before the Board defining \u201cthe neighborhood of the subject property.\u201d He also concluded that the evidence before the Board failed \u201cto establish any change in the character of the neighborhood by the one element of change, the construction of the National Freeway and the widening of Vocke Road.\u201d Specifically, he stated that the testimony concerning commercial development in the upper LaVale area referred \u201calmost exclusively to intensification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>commercial establishments along Route 40 which has always been zoned commercial and cannot reasonably be considered as constituting the neighborhood of the subject property.\u201d He noted that the Searstown Shopping Center property, situated near the subject property, \u201cis in an area . . . that has always been zoned for commercial use.\u201d Judge Getty noted the existence of one commercially rezoned establishment across from the subject property (the roller rink); he stated that it had been rezoned several years previously without apparent objection. He held that the only probative evidence of a change in the general area was brought about by the construction of the Freeway with access entrances thereto from both Vocke and Winchester Roads, both of which roads had been widened. He noted that the widening of Winchester Road was done to accommodate traffic into the Searstown Shopping Center and into the Vocke Road entrance. Contrary to the Board\u2019s conclusion, Judge Getty said that the record contained no evidence that water and sewerage were not available until after enactment of the zoning ordinance; consequently, he held that the present existence of these lines did not constitute a change in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">On the record before us, we agree with the lower court that the \u201cneighborhood\u201d Of the subject property was not established in accordance with the requirements of the Maryland cases. We recognized in <em>Montgomery v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>263 Md. 1, 280 A. 2d 901 (1971) that the concept of a neighborhood is a flexible one and will vary according to the geographical location involved, it being axiomatic that in a rural or semi-rural area the \u201cneighborhood\u201d will be larger and more fluid than in a city or suburban area. We held in <em>Clayman v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>266 Md. 409, 292 A. 2d 689 (1972) that while that which reasonably constitutes the neighborhood of the subject property need not be precisely and rigidly defined, it must be shown to comprise an area reasonably within its \u201cimmediate environs . . . not some area miles away; and the changes must occur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>in that immediate neighborhood of such a nature as to have <em>affected its character.\u201d </em>266 Md. at 418, 292 A. 2d at 694. See also <em>Heller v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>264 Md. 410, 412-14, 286 A. 2d 772, 773-74 (1972); <em>Harley v. Aluisi, </em>259 Md. 275, 282, 269 A. 2d 575, 579 (1970) ; <em>Montgomery v. Board of County Commissioners for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>256 Md. 597, 602, 261 A. 2d 447, 450 (1970) ; <em>Woodlawn Area Citizens Association, Inc. v. Board of County Commissioners for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>241 Md. 187, 198-99, 216 A. 2d 149, 156-57 (1966). As the cited cases indicate, that which reasonably constitutes the neighborhood of the subject property is one of the basic facts to be established by an applicant for rezoning, and because of its fundamental involvement in any case resting on a contention of a change in the character of the neighborhood it must be satisfactorily shown upon the record. A record showing, as here, that the subject property was part of the LaVale or upper LaVale area, without some delineation of the general boundaries encompassed thereby, provides a woefully inadequate evidentiary foundation upon which to establish the requisite element of \u201cwhat reasonably constitutes the neighborhood\u201d within the contemplation of the Maryland cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Appellants concede that \u201cthere may not have been a specific demarcation of the boundaries of the neighborhood. . . .\u201d But they nevertheless urge that \u201csubstantial evidence of change was shown in instances across from the subject property, in the roads bordering it and in such close proximity to it as to necessarily be included in any definition of the applicable neighborhood.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is clear, however, that the Board expressly rested its de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>cisi\u00f3n granting the reclassification upon the cumulative effect of the factors hereinbefore enumerated which included commercialization of properties along Route 40, lying north of the Freeway \u2014 an area zoned commercial for over fifteen years and not in such close proximity to the subject property as necessarily to be accepted as a part of the neighborhood. But even without the inclusion of this area as a part of the surrounding neighborhood, the record made by the appellants before the Board does not contain the strong evidence required of a change in conditions resulting in a substantial change in the character of the neighborhood necessary to rebut the strong presumption of the correctness of the original zoning. See <em>Heller v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>264 Md. at 412, 286 A. 2d at 773. Compare <em>Beth Tfiloh v. Blum, </em>242 Md. 84, 218 A. 2d 29 (1966) ; <em>Finney v. Halle, </em>241 Md. 224, 216 A. 2d 530 (1966) ; <em>Jobar Corp. v. Rodgers Forge Community Association, Inc., </em>236 Md. 106, 202 A. 2d 612 (1964). We hold, therefore, that Judge Getty did not commit error by concluding that the evidence adduced before the Board was not legally sufficient to justify reclassification of the subject property from Residential A and Rural Residential to Commercial A.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-13\">.

Appellants claimed in their brief that, in addition to commercial rezoning of the roller rink property on Winchester Road immediately across from the subject tract, the property next to it, occupied by the Jolly Roger Liquor Store, was also previously rezoned commercial. Neither the Board nor the court made any such finding. The record indicates that the liquor store property is located next to the LaVale Firehall and not next to the subject property. We were told during oral argument that the liquor store lies 2% miles from the subject property.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
