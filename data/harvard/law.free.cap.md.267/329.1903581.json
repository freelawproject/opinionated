That in actions for malpractice against physicians and dentists, the issue of professional skill is generally a topic requiring expert testimony, in support of which he quoted from <em>Fink v. Steele, </em>166 Md. 354, 171 A. 49 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">2. Appellant\u2019s answers to interrogatories disclosed that he had \u201cno expert witnesses to establish his claim that appellant was negligent\u201d or failed to employ the skill required of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">3. That appellant\u2019s answers also presented no \u201cevidence\u201d concerning the applicable standard of care, without which he could not establish a <em>prima fade </em>case of malpractice under <em>Johns Hopkins Hospital v. Genda, </em>255 Md. 616, 258 A. 2d 595 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">The motion was initially argued and denied on September 11, 1970. The reasons for denial are discernible from the colloquy and ruling of May 9, 1972, when the motion was reargued and granted, resulting in the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ment from which this appeal is brought.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the 1972 hearing, appellee\u2019s counsel contended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">\u00ab4c * 4c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">\u201c[T]his is generally a topic calling for expert testimony only, and in the absence of such expert testimony, the Court in its general power can pass upon the question, such as is presented here, as a matter of law. There is also a well recognized rule in Maryland that in the performance of an operation a physician, or a surgeon and also a dentist is presumed to have' used skill and have done the operation properly, and it requires expert testimony to rebut that presumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201cIn the Plaintiff\u2019s answers to Interrogatories, he admits that he has no expert witness .... Since there is no expert testimony to be proffered in the case concerning the standard of skill in which the operation was done, or skill of the defendant himself in performing the procedure, in the absence of expert testimony to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s procedures did not conform with standards required, the plaintiff can\u2019t make out a case of malpractice, and consequently, the case needs to be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">\u201cBY THE COURT:. . . [B] ack in September of 1970, I agreed with your version of the law, but I denied your Motion to give Mr. Sullivan an opportunity to obtain expert testimony, and he, I believe, admitted at that time he had no expert witnesses to testify in the matter, so the Motion, at that time, was denied in order to give him an opportunity to do that. So, if the situation is still the same whereby Mr. Sullivan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>has no expert testimony to offer on behalf of his claim, then of course, as I say, I agree with your version of the law in that case ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">\u201cBY THE COURT: The Interrogatories, and, therefore, the record would indicate that the Plaintiff has no medical testimony to offer on behalf of his claim .... For these reasons, the Motion previously denied on September 11, 1970, is now granted effective this date, May 9, 1972, the Motion will be granted and summary judgment entered in favor of the defendant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">* * *&gt;&gt;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">In urging affirmance, appellee renews the arguments which were successfully advanced below and contends that summary judgment was appropriate to this case. We do not agree that the summary judgment procedure was properly applied here and we shall reverse the judgment entered in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">We suspect there are few better-settled rules in this state than that pertaining to the office of a motion for summary judgment. In a line of cases, the citation of which would unduly lengthen this opinion, we have repeatedly held that the summary judgment procedure is not designed as a substitute for trial or for the purpose of deciding an issue of fact, but that it merely provides for a hearing to determine whether there is an issue of fact to be tried. <em>Wolfe v. Lamar &amp; Wallace, Inc., </em>261 Md. 174, 274 A. 2d 121 (1971) ; <em>Kirsner v. Fleischmann, </em>261 Md. 164, 274 A. 2d 339 (1971) ; <em>Lipscomb v. Hess, </em>255 Md. 109, 257 A. 2d 178 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Nothing contained in Rule 610 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure, nor in any of our decisions, has ever permitted the granting of summary judgment as a remedy for failure to furnish the name of an expert witness one proposes to produce at his trial; nor, indeed, for any other failure to obey the discovery rules. The sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>for failure to comply with the discovery rules are comprehensive and have been deemed adequate to insure compliance. <em>See e.g., Lynch v. R. E. Tull &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>251 Md. 260, 247 A. 2d 286 (1968) ; <em>Miller v. Talbott, </em>239 Md. 382, 211 A. 2d 741 (1965); <em>Smith v. Potomac Electric Power Co., </em>236 Md. 51, 202 A. 2d 604 (1964); <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Mezzanotti, </em>227 Md. 8, 174 A. 2d 768 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">In this connection, it should be noted that Rule 417, which governs discovery by interrogatory, expressly allows for the filing of exceptions to answers, a procedure which might well have been utilized here by appellee if he judged appellant\u2019s answers to be unresponsive. Since answers to interrogatories are held to be continuing in nature even where they are not expressly so made, <em>Pare v. Rodrique, </em>256 Md. 204, 260 A. 2d 313 (1969), although they were here, appellee would not have been exposed to the danger of surprise if the case had been allowed to proceed to trial. In point of fact, there was nothing to prevent the trial court, at the summary judgment hearing, from dealing with the apparent inadequacy of appellant\u2019s answers by imposing sanctions <em>sua sponte </em>within the framework of the discovery rules. <em>Pfeiffer v. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co., </em>247 Md. 56, 230 A. 2d 87 (1967). Finally, since the application of sanctions under the discovery rules is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, <em>Evans v. Howard, </em>256 Md. 155, 259 A. 2d 528 (1969), nothing foreclosed him in the case at bar from placing appellant under a time limit for furnishing the name of his expert witness, thereby subjecting him to the array of sanctions available under Rule 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">To be sure, we have said that the issue of \u201csuitable professional skill is generally a topic calling for expert testimony,\u201d but we have also had occasion to add that, \u201cfor lack of it the Court may rule, in its general power <em>to pass upon the sufficiency of evidence </em>that there is not sufficient evidence <em>to go to the jury.\u201d Johns Hopkins Hospital v. Genda </em>and <em>Fink v. Steele, </em>both <em>supra </em>(emphasis added). The point we make here is that the rule appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>to have been applied invariably to the sufficiency of trial evidence. Whether appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment was sufficient to reveal that there was no genuine issue of material fact is not before us, as it is clear that the trial judge granted the motion merely because \"[appellant] had no medical testimony to offer on behalf of his claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">It may conceivably develop from evidence at the trial, if there is one, that this is one of those cases where no expert testimony is required to establish the standard of care or its breach. <em>Thomas v. Corso, </em>265 Md. 84, 97-99, 288 A. 2d 379 (1972) ; <em>Crockett v. Crothers, </em>264 Md. 222, 224-225, 285 A. 2d 612 (1972) ; <em>Central Cab Co. v. Clarke, </em>259 Md. 542, 551-52, 270 A. 2d 662, 667-68 (1970). We carefully refrain, however, from expressing any opinion in this regard, as our decision is limited to merely holding that the summary judgment procedure prescribed by Rule 610 may not be invoked for a mere failure to comply with the discovery rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; remanded for further proceedings; costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-9\">. We are not told why, in view of the 1970 denial, the motion was reargued in 1972 without a refiling of any kind; indeed, judging from the docket entries, there was no action of any kind during that interval except for a prayer for jury trial and three continuances of what we assume were trial dates, or continuances at the call of the docket upon the beginning of the term.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
