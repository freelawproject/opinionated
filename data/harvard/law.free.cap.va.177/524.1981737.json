Her maiden name was Curdts. In 1917 she married a Mr. Story and with him moved to the town of Franklin. He died in 1927, leaving two children, Dorothy, then ten years old, and Elliott, six, fruits of that marriage. After Mr. Story\u2019s death she continued to make that town her home. Mr. Pretlow was a widower who also lived in Franklin. He had three children, all of whom are now living- and one of whom lives with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">As might have been expected, Mr. Pretlow and Mrs. Story were casual friends, but his interest in her became more than casual in the autumn of 1936. About the first of February, 1937, he proposed marriage and was then accepted.. On March 6, 1937, an ante-nuptial settlement was entered into, and they were married four days thereafter. Mr. Pretlow was then 67 years old and she was 44. She moved into the Pretlow home and lived there about six months. In June, 1938, she filed her bill charging cruelty and desertion and asked that she be given divorce from bed and board. To that bill was filed an answer and cross-bill, which cross-bill was, in turn, answered. The marriage settlement, cross-bill and answer thereto will be found in a footnote.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> To the cross-bill a demurrer was also interposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The major objections set out in the demurrer to the cross-bill are that it is multifarious and that equity jurisdiction is not conferred by statute and therefore does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The court was of opinion that fraud which goes to the fundamentals of marriage relations gives jurisdiction and that in this case property rights growing out of that fraud could be adjusted also. We think this is right. Jurisdiction of equity at all will hereafter he considered more in detail. If equity has jurisdiction, the demurrer should have been overruled. Having reached the conclusion that inherent equity jurisdiction did exist, the cause came on to be heard upon its merits and was so heard and decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">A detailed discussion of the evidence would serve no good purpose. It is enough to say that we have examined it with care and are of opinion that the marriage was never consummated and that for this Mrs. Pretlow is to blame. She never at any time intended that it should be consummated. This conclusion is strengthened by the judgment of the trial court; before its chancellor both the plaintiff and defendant testified. In other respects she conducted herself normally and as was to have been expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>It is also said that even if equity had jurisdiction in this case that jurisdiction has been lost through laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">We have not yet had occasion to pass upon equity\u2019s jurisdiction in annulment proceedings which are based upon causes not named in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Code, section 5105, in general terms gives to equity jurisdiction in suits to annul marriages.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">\u25a0Code, section 5087, declares that all marriages between white and colored people, and all marriages prohibited on account of either of the parties having a former husband or wife then living, are void without any decree of divorce or other legal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">'Code, section 5088, provides that all marriages which are solemnized in this State and which are prohibited shall be void from the time they are so declared by decree of divorce or annulment.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">\u2022Code, section 5089, declares that those who leave the State for the purpose of evading her laws stand as if their marriage had been solemnized within the State, while Code, section 5090, deals with the age of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Code, section 5100, declares that any marriage supposed to be void for any of the canses mentioned in sections 5087, 5088, 5089 or 5090 may be declared void in a suit instituted for that purpose by either party, subject' to an unimportant exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Plaintiff contends that these statutes tell us when marriages m\u00e1y be annulled and name the cause for which that may be done; that this list is inclusive, from which it, of course, follows that other causes are excluded. Attention is also called to the fact that all of them deal with causes existing at the time the marriage is solemnized and that incapacity to perfrom marital duties is noAvhere mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\"> In <em>Heflinger </em>v. <em>Heflinger, </em>136 Va. 289, 118 S. E. 316, the court points out the difference between marriage contracts and other contracts. They can not be dissolved by mutual agreement and in them the State is \u201cinterested to preserve the integrity of the marriage tie, and to enforce its laws against prohibited marriages, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>general rules applicable to private contracts should not be permitted to thwart the public policy of the State established for the protection of society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">English law is cited and relied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">\u201cThe decisions under the English Divorce Act follow the principles of the ecclesiastical law and are not affected by any statutory provisions on the subject of fraud. Upon a review of all the ecclesiastical decisions it has recently been held that fraud as a ground for annulment of marriage does not include such fraud as induces a consent, but only such fraud as produces the appearance without the reality of consent.\u201d Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. of Law, 2d Ed., p. 1183. The text is supported by <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>P. D. 268 (1897), where it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">\u201c When in English law fraud is spoken of as a ground for avoiding a marriage, this does not include such fraud as induces a consent, but is limited to such fraud as procures the appearance without the reality of consent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Reliance is placed upon tlie rule in Pennsylvania. In <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Kimmell, </em>35 Pa. 13, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\u2018 \u2018 Tlie consent of the parties to the alleged marriage is t:o he determined by what took place at the time of its celebration; and it is not affected by a secret reservation of one of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">It was also held in <em>Eisenberg </em>v. Eisenberg, 105 Pa. Super. Ct. 30, 160 A. 228 (1932), that a court of equity has no jurisdiction to cancel fraudulent contracts of marriage, but the force of that rule is weakened by this fact there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">\u201cIt is admitted by the appellant that courts of equity in Pennsylvania do not possess general powers of a court of chancery; their jurisdiction is confined to the authority conferred upon them by statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">In <em>Bielby </em>v. <em>Bielby, </em>333 Ill. 478, 165 N. E. 231, it was held that evidence was insufficient to warrant a decree annulling marriage on account of fraudulent pretence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>of affection and because of refusal to consummate marriage. That is to say, this case was reversed for insufficiency of evidence among other causes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">\u201cAppellee does not testify that he ever requested that the marriage be consummated or that she ever refused so to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\"><em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>219 Iowa 338,.258 N. W. 719, is a case in which a woman represented to a man that he was the father of her unborn child. The court pointed out that the Iowa Code specified grounds upon which the marriage might be annulled and said that this was not one of them. It further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">\u201cIt is our conclusion that, under the situation in which the plaintiff found himself in this case, the statute has provided him a remedy as pointed out in section 10476, and, so long as the statute has provided the remedy for the condition in which he claims to have found himself, we think that he is bound to follow that remedy and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>be lias no right to maintain this independent action in equity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">It, however, added this saying clause: \u201cWe do not say that a condition might not arise in which equity will afford relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\"><em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>182 Ark. 206, 31 S. W. (2d) 134, is a case in which duress was relied upon. In reversing the decree of the court below, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">\u201cThe subject of marriage, divorce, and annulment are regulated by statute, and no divorce can be granted for any cause other than those specified in the statute, and no decree of annulment can be had except for the causes mentioned in the statute.\u201d .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">In <em>Lyannes </em>v. <em>Lyannes, </em>171 Wis. 381, 177 N. W. 683. there appears to have been false representations as to age when the license was secured. Relief was denied. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number><em>\u201c* </em>* * we deem it proper to say that we can see no valid reason for holding otherwise than that the jurisdiction and power to annul is exactly the same as that to divorce, and that both are exclusively of statutory creation, and neither rest upon nor can be extended by resort to the general equitable powers inherent in the circuit court as a court of equity.\u201d See also, <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission of Arizona, </em>54 Ariz. 1, 91 P. (2d) 700 (1939).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Many States by statute, among them Virginia, catalogue the causes or conditions which will support a decree. An opinion which without more rests its decision upon the statute is not very helpful. The fact that a given case does or does not measure up to its requirements is merely a matter of evidence, and such cases become of importance only when they undertake to deal with the inherent jurisdiction of equity courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Many cases in Virginia tell us of the alertness of equity to search out fraud. Others draw attention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the fact that the contract of marriage differs from ordinary contracts because it is affected with a public interest. The nearest approach to an expression of opinion by us on the issue here presented appears in <em>Heflinger v. </em>H<em>eflinger, supra, </em>where Judge Burks said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\">\u2018 \u2018 The rig\u2019ht to bring- a suit for annulment is expressly given by section 5100 of the Code, but this is probably merely declaratory of a preexisting- ground of equitable jurisdiction. <em>McClung </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>21 N. J. Eq. 225; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>33 Kan. 582, 7 Pac. 241; 2 Bish., Mar. &amp; Div. &amp; Sep., sec. 801-ff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">This was by way of <em>obiter, </em>but it shows the bent of his mind.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">\u201cThe fact that a statute enumerates certain grounds for annulment of a marriage does not imply that no other grounds exist. In this country, aside from legislative divorces, the only grounds for divorce in its restricted sense as distinguished from annulment are those specified by the statutes.\u201d 17 Am. Jur. 165.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\u201cSec. 80S. Fraud, Mistake, Duress, Lunacy. \u2014 - \u2022Since the status of marriage is conferred by a contract, without wbicb it cannot exist, and since for avoiding contracts equity has jurisdiction over all questions of fraud, mistake, and lunacy, if one of these impediments has entered into a marriage, a court of equity, in the absence of any other jurisdiction, will on due application pronounce it void * * * .\u201d 2 Bishop on Marriage, Divorce &amp; Separation (1891), section 801, <em>et seq., </em>cited by Judge Burks in the <em>Eeflinger Case.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">\u201cIn England the courts do not seem to have had jurisdiction to annul marriages for fraud, the only remedy being an application to Parliament to dissolve the marriage, and it has been held that the statute of 1857 (20 <em>&amp; </em>21 Vict., c. 85), creating the divorce court conferred no jurisdiction to annul a marriage for such cause. In this country at an early date courts of equity assumed independent jurisdiction of suits to annul marriages on the ground of fraud. This jurisdiction was expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>rested upon the general power to vacate contracts in all cases where they had been procured by fraud. From this general jurisdiction of equity a contract of marriage was not regarded as being excepted, when the assent to it was the result of artifice or gross fraud. At the present time the statutes very generally expressly confer this jurisdiction upon some court. * * * \u201d 9 E. C. L. 293.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">See also Black on Rescission &amp; Cancellation, Vol. II, sec. 345.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">\u201cThe trend of the authorities in that annulment of an unconsummated marriage may be secured more readily than in a case where the parties have cohabited. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>171 Mass. 404, 50 N. E. 933, 41 L. R. A. 800, 68 Am. St. Rep. 440; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>246 Mass. 353, 140 N. E. 73, 31 A. L. R. 146; <em>Arno </em>v. <em>Arno, </em>265 Mass. 282,163 N.

J. Eq. 588, 146 A. 649.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In Long on Domestic Relations (2d Ed.) 1913, sec. 45, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">\u201cThere is a tendency at present to set aside a marriage for fraud more readily where the marriage has not been physically consummated than -yhere there has been consummation. This distinction rests upon the soundest reasons. If the defrauded party discovers the fraud before the marriage is consummated, and thereafter refuses to cohabit, it is plain that the considerations of public policy against the dissolution of marriage are entitled to far less weig-ht than where the marriage has been followed by cohabitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">In <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>L. R., p. 198, 82 L. J. Prob. N. S. 121, 100 L. T. N. S. 408, 29 Times L. R. 765 (1913), it was held that \u201cthe willful and deliberate failure of a wife to consummate a marriage was adequate ground for its annulment.\u201d * # *</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>\u201cIt has always been held that the contract of marriage implies the ability to consnmmate it. In my opinion it also implies the willingness to consnmmate it.\u201d * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">\u201cIt is apparent enongh that without sexual intercourse the ends of marriage, the procreation of children and the pleasures and enjoyment of matrimony, cannot be attained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The situation in England is interesting and confused. <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Moss </em>was decided in 1897. The opinion there was delivered by Sir Francis Henry Jeune, one of the judges of the Court of Appeals and President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division. There relief was denied. The opinion in the <em>Dickinson Case, </em>decided in 1913, was delivered by Sir Samuel T. Evans, also one of the judges of the Court of Appeals and President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division. In each instance Sir Frederick Pollock was the editor. In the latter case the facts were quite like those in judgment here, and there the prayer of the petitioner was granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>and \u201ca decree <em>nisi </em>of nullity\u201d ordered. A headnote of the editor reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">\u2018 \u2018 Willful and persistent refusal to allow any marital intercourse is a sufficient ground for a. decree of nullity. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>140 Md. 258,117 A. 114, 22 A. L. R. 810, the court criticises the <em>Moss Case </em>and refused to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The State is interested in maintaining the sanctity of marriage relations, and it is interested in the ordered preservation of the race. It has a double interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">In <em>Crouch </em>v. <em>Wartenberg, </em>86 W. Va. 664, 104 S. E. 117, 11 A. L. R. 212, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">\u2018 \u2018 There is no doubt of the right and power of a court of equity, at the request of either party to the contract, to entertain a suit for the purpose of affirming or annulling a marriage supposed to be void, or as to the validity of which any doubt esists, and counsel do not question such right. <em>McClurg </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>21 N.

Va. 229, 122 S. E. 520, it appears that two young\u2019 people got married by way of a joke and never in fact lived tgether. This marriage was set aside. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201cThis suit is to annul the marriage between plaintiff and defendant, occurring on August 14, 1922, as distinguished from divorce, and upon grounds other than those specifically mentioned in section 1 of chapter 64 of the Code, the jurisdiction and power thereby invoked being not that conferred by the statute, but the inherent jurisdiction and power of a court of equity with respect to all civil contracts, voidable upon any ground cognizable by such courts. That such inherent power and jurisdiction esists is settled law in this state and elsewhere, and has been here declared and applied in at least two cases of this character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In <em>Anders </em>v. <em>Anders, </em>224 Mass. 438, 113 N. E. 203, L. R. A. 1916E, 1273 (1916), it appears that the woman\u2019s only object in getting married was that she might go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>back to Europe as a married woman for the sake of herself and her child. She did go and never saw her husband again. This marriage was annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The plaintiff here says that it stands alone in Massachusetts and is not in accord with <em>Chipman </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>237 Mass. 502, 130 N. E. 65, 14 A. L. R. 119, and <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>246 Mass. 353, 140 N. E. 73, 31 A. L. R. 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">These two last named cases do not mention the <em>Anders Case </em>and so could not have been intended to overrule it. Moreover, the <em>Anders Case </em>is in substance affirmed in <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>287 Mass. 154, 191 N. E. 673, where it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">\u201cThese facts do not bring the case at bar within the decision of <em>Anders </em>v. <em>Anders, </em>224 Mass. 438, 113 N. E. 203, L. R. A. 1916E, 1273, where the fraud of a woman in marrying the libellant in order to secure a married <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>name, with, the intent never to perform any one of her duties as a wife, was held cause for an annulment. There the fraudulent purpose was concealed. In the instant case the libellee made his purpose clear. He never misled the libellant into thinking- that the marriage would be consummated. An executory contract may be invalidated with less difficulty than a fully executed one. The trend of the authorities is that annulment of an unconsummated marriage may be secured more readily than in a case where the parties have cohabited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">\"When the <em>Anders Case </em>was decided, fraud was not a statutory ground for annulment; Rev.

Eq. 89, 60 A. 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Jurisdiction once acquired is not lost unless there is some statutory declaration which makes the purpose of the legislature plain. <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>Shakespeare, supra; Anders </em>v. <em>Anders, supra. </em>If by statute, without more, we were to declare that nullity might be decreed because of infancy, it could not be successfully contended that equity jurisdiction in all other cases was wiped away. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>And the fact that our statute has named more than one cause and not all does not change the situation. The power of equity to compel a husband to support a wife from whom he is separated is not lost because statutes afterwards enacted and for other causes have placed that burden upon him. Those dealing with divorce have not abridged inherent equity jurisdiction. <em>Heflin </em>v. <em>Heflin, ante, </em>p. 385, 14 S. E. (2d). 317, opinion this day handed down by Mr. Justice Gregory.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We apply the same principle where equity jurisdiction is given to law courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">\u201cCourts of equity, having once acquired jurisdiction, never lose it because jurisdiction of the same matters are given to law courts, unless the statute giving such jurisdiction uses prohibitory or restrictive words.\u201d <em>Filler </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>91 Va. 458, 22 S. E. 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\"> Divorce is the creature of statute; annulment rests within the inherent power of equity, inherited by it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>from the ecclesiastical courts of England. Fraud, particularly before consummation, is within the reach of its long arm, and that power is not lost because other grounds are specifically mentioned in the statute. It is a power not conferred by statute but is inherent with respect to all civil contracts voidable upon grounds recognized by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Plaintiff, as we have seen, further contends that even if this equitable right once attached it has been lost through laches. As a general rule, he who discovers fraud imbedded in his contract must, upon its discovery and without delay, seek rescission if he is to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\u201cA contract tainted with fraud is not void, but voidable. Therefore, great punctuality and promptness of action are required by the deceived party upon his discovery of the fraud. * * * If, after discovering the untruth of the representations, he conducts himself with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>reference to the transaction as though it were still subsisting and binding, he thereby waives all benefit of and relief from the misrepresentations. * # * And this duty promptly to disaffirm a fraudulent transaction is not dependent upon the proof of injury by the delay to the other party.\u201d <em>West End Real Estate Co. </em>v. <em>Claiborne, </em>97 Va. 734, 34 S. E. 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\u201cWhile the party entitled to relief may either avoid the transaction or confirm it, he cannot do both, if he adopts a part, he adopts all; he must reject it entirely if he desires to obtain relief. \u2019 \u2019 Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, p. 1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">This rule this court has repeatedly affirmed, but in its application we look to facts in each particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">In <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>159 Va. 210, 165 S. E. 490, a creditor waited seven years before undertaking to en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>force an equitable lien. Tbe court refused to apply tbe doctrine, and in the course of its opinion said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201cPrejudicial delay must be shown before the defense can be successfully maintained.

So long as the parties are in the same condition, it matters little whether a right is pressed promptly or slowly within the limits allowed by law.

All the material parties are living, there has been no chang*e in the circumstances and it is not shown that the delay has caused any injustice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">A condition in which situations are changing* or one in wddeh there could be no change calls for prompt repudiation, if repudiation is to be soug-ht at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Where a tenant covenants not to sublet and breaches that agreement, his landlord should move promptly, if at all. Plainly it would be inequitable for him to stand by while the subtenant was seeding* and later forbid him to harvest. <em>Deaton </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>90 Va. 219, 17 S.

Promptness is at times necessary, but this rule should not be strictly applied where delay has done no harm, where conditions have not changed and where it is possible to completely restore the parties to their antecedent rights. The parties here may be placed practically <em>in statu quo </em>\u2014 a thing which would be impossible if the marriage had been followed by cohabitation. Long on Domestic Delations, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">One who found that his wife was unresponsive or reluctant, and to whom he was deeply attached, might hope by manifestations of patience and tenderness to win her over; and that would be to his credit and not to his discredit.

No evidence has been lost, property rights are as they were, and delay has done no harm. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">\u2022 During the engagement Mrs. Story told Mr. Pretlow that she had some obligations in the Merchants &amp; Farmers Bank amounting to $600 or $700, which caused her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>some embarrassment. He then said to her: \u201cWell, I will relieve that; if that is all the trouble, I will pay that, if it is embarrassing- you.\u201d That was when they were first engaged. He went to the bank, was told that the amount due was $1,128.57, and because \u201cI felt it was a matter too small to break up the marriage on, and I was very much interested, and so I passed it up and gave Sol cheek for $1,128 and some cents.\u201d It can not be doubted that he made this payment because he thought that a refusal might break up the marriage. The inducing cause was her promise to marry him, just as that promise brought about the marriage settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">\u201cIf an intended husband make a present, after the treaty of marriage has been negotiated, to his intended wife, and the inducement for the gift is the fact of her promise to marry him, if she break off the marriage, he may recover from her the value of such present,\u201d quoted and relied upon in <em>Lumsden </em>v. <em>Arbaugh, </em>207 Mo.

That the- real purpose of complainant in agreeing to the marriage ceremony was to obtain support and maintenance from the respondent, to obtain a share of respondent\u2019s property for herself and for her two children (as set forth in said antenuptial agreement), and to derive the social benefit and standing which would enure to her through being the wife of respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">\u201cN.

Pretlow, Evelyn P. Rutledge (Mrs. R. E. Rutledge) and R. A. Pretlow, Jr., all of whom then were and now are adults.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">\u201c4. Answering paragraph D of the said cross-bill, this complainant admits that under date of March 6, 1937, this complainant and respondent entered into an antenuptial agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit B with the bill of complaint of this complainant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">\u201c5. Answering paragraphs E and F of the said cross-bill, this complainant avers that prior to the marriage of this complainant and the said respondent they entered into an antenuptial agreement, bearing date on the 6th day of March, 1987, a copy of which said agreement is filed as Exhibit B with the bill of complaint of this complainant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>and that under and by virtue of tbe said antenuptial agreement this complainant and tbe said respondent agreed to and with each other as in said agreement set out, reference being made to the said agreement for the exact terms and provisions thereof.

Answering paragraph G of the said cross-bill, this complainant avers that by deed dated March 6, 1937, and recorded in the office of the clerk of the Circuit Court pf Southampton county, Virginia, in deed book 77, at page 50S, 'the said respondent conveyed to this complainant two parcels of land, which this complainant understands to be two tracts referred to in paragraph First of the above mentioned agreement, the said respondent, however, reserving to himself a life estate for the duration of his life in and to the property so -conveyed.

The complainant believes it to be true that the said respondent paid an indebtedness of this complainant evidenced by a Four Thousand Dollar ($4,000.00)' bond and secured by a deed of trust on the property of this complainant and caused the said deed of trust to be released of record, as provided in paragraph Second of the above mentioned agreement.

This complainant is not informed as to whether or not the said respondent executed a will containing the provisions specified in the said agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\u201c7. Answering paragraph H of the said cross-bill, this complainant avers that the consideration for the execution by the complainant and by the said respondent of the antenuptial agreement hereinabove referred to was the contemplated and intended marriage of this complainant and the said respondent and the covenants and agreements on the part of each of the parties thereto therein contained, and that one of the purposes of the said agreement was to limit and restrict as therein provided the marital rights of each of the parties in and to the property of the other had no such antenuptial agreement been executed prior to the solemnization of such marriage. Except as herein stated, all other allegations of the said paragraph H are denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">\u201c8. This complainant denies the allegations of paragraphs I, J and K of the said cross-bill, and specifically denies that she has at any time since the solemnization of the marriage between this complainant and the said respondent refused to enter into or consummate her marital relationships with the said respondent, or been cold, indifferent or unaffectionate in her personal relationship with the said respondent, or repelled his advances, or refused to kiss him, or withheld herself from him in sexual intercourse.

This complainant avers that she did her utmost to look after their home and see that it was run in an orderly and proper manner and in accordance with the wishes and pleasure of the said respondent, and to see to it that his needs were taken care of and his comfort provided for. This complainant avers that not only did she and the said respondent occupy the same residence, but they also occupied the same room and habitually over a period of months occupied, for an extended time almost every night, the same bed in that room; that at no time did this complainant ever refuse or decline to permit the said respondent to get into bed with this complainant nor require him to leave her bed before he chose to do so; that not only did this complainant not withhold herself from sexual intercourse with the said respondent, but on the contrary she willingly and repeatedly submitted herself to his embraces and affections and endeavored in every reasonable way to cooperate with the said respondent in his desire and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>efforts to have sexual intercourse with her, ofttimes to the point of her well-nigh complete nervous and physical exhaustion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">\u201c9.

This complainant avers that her social standing prior to her marriage was not less high than that of the said respondent, and that she then had a position which she had held for years, the income from which afforded a comfortable living for herself and her children, which position she, at the request and insistence of the said respondent, resigned just prior to and in contemplation of her marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">\u201c11.

She avers that the said antenuptial agreement was not originated or conceived by this complainant, nor did she make any suggestion or demands as to the terms thereof; that the making, of an ante-nuptial agreement was suggested and insisted on by the said respondent, and that its terms were proposed by him and accepted by the complainant as proposed. This complainant was informed by the said respondent, and believed, that his desire to have an ante-nuptial agreement was to protect and safeguard the interests of this complainant and assure her \u2022 of a reasonable competence in the event of the death of the said respondent. This complainant is now advised that the real effect and purpose of the said antenuptial agreement was to limit and restrict the rights of this complainant in the ..property of the said respondent upon his death. This complainant avers that she was repeatedly told by the said respondent that he .was lonely and needed and greatly desired companionship, and that his desire to have her marry him was primarily to secure her as a congenial and helpful companion to contribute to his general, happiness, grace his home and provide for his comfort; that she is without sufficient knowledge or information to enable her to answer the other allegations of the said paragraph O, and so she neither admits nor denies the same, but calls for strict proof thereof, insofar as her interest may be affected thereby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">\u201c13. This complainant denies the allegations of paragraphs P and Q of the said cross-bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>\u201c14.

Answering paragraph U of the said cross-bill, this complainant admits that she is informed and believes that she is the record fee simple owner, subject to the life estate of the said respondent, of the two tracts of real estate conveyed to her by the said respondent as therein alleged, but denies that she has any idea or intention of either conveying, encumbering or disposing of the same, or any part thereof, during the pendency of this litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">\u201c17. This complainant denies the allegations of paragraph V of the said cross-bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">\u201c18.
