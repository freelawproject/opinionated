We hold that a defendant can do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">The State, Respondent, charged Kevin E. Jones (\u201cJones\u201d), Petitioner, with various criminal offenses, including second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type against Christine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Johnson (\u201cJohnson\u201d). In the Circuit Court for Somerset County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d), a jury tried and convicted Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Because Jones contends that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction, we summarize the evidence that the State offered at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Byron Johnson (\u201cByron\u201d) testified as follows. On the night of September 17, 2010, Byron and Jones were passengers in a car. Jones said that \u201che [had] got[ten] into an altercation with two boys\u201d at Wink Lane Apartments. Byron heard a gun being loaded. Out of the corner of his eye, Byron saw Jones holding a gun. Eventually, the car stopped near Wink Lane Apartments. While Byron remained in the car, Jones exited the car, walked to an apartment\u2019s front door, and knocked on it. A woman answered the door. Jones asked: \u201c[W]here the two [n* * * * *]s at[?]\u201d Byron heard \u201cyelling.\u201d The woman shut the door, and Byron heard three gunshots. Jones returned to the car and said that \u201che was going to kill ... the two boys [whom] he was trying to get.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Nikita Tindley (\u201cTindley\u201d), Johnson\u2019s daughter, testified as follows. On the morning of September 18, 2010,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Tindley, Johnson, and others were in an apartment at Wink Lane Apartments. Jones knocked on the apartment\u2019s front door. Tindley opened the door. Jones asked: \u201c[W]here the [n* * * * *]s at[?]\u201d Jones reached toward his pants. Tindley shut the door, saw Johnson approaching the door, and said: \u201c[D]on\u2019t go to the door[,] they got a gun.\u201d Tindley heard three gunshots.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Johnson testified as follows. Tindley shut the door; Johnson approached the door; and Tindley said: \u201c[D]on\u2019t go to the door[,] they got a gun.\u201d Johnson \u201chollered\u201d to her grandson, who was in the living room: \u201c[G]et down[.]\u201d Johnson heard three gunshots, which frightened her.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Officer Dave Adams of the Princess Anne Police Department testified that he went to the apartment in which Tindley and Johnson had been and found: a bullet hole in the front door; a bullet hole above the front door; a bullet in a wall in the living room; and a bullet in a wall in a rear bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The jury convicted Jones of crimes, including second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type against Johnson. Jones appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>213 Md.App. 208, 222, 73 A.3d 1136, 1145 (2013). Jones filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which this Court granted. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>436 Md. 327, 81 A.3d 457 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Jones contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction for second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type against Johnson because: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support a reasonable inference that Jones knew that Johnson\u2014or anyone other than Tindley, for that matter\u2014was in the apartment; and (2) a defendant cannot commit second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type against a victim of whose presence in particular the defendant does not know. The State responds that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type against Johnson because: (1) the evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable inference that Jones knew that multiple people were in the apartment; and (2) a defendant can commit second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type against a victim of whose presence in particular the defendant does not know, as the State may prove a defendant\u2019s intent through circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Evidence is sufficient to support a conviction where, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>[State], <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Hobby v. State, </em>436 Md. 526, 538, 83 A.3d 794, 800 (2014) (emphasis in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In determining whether evidence was sufficient to support a conviction, an appellate court \u201cdefer[s] to any possible reasonable inferences [that] the trier of fact could have drawn from the ... evidence!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538, 83 A.3d at 801 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 3-203 criminalizes second-degree assault, of which there are three types: \u201c(1) intent to frighten, (2) attempted battery, and (3) battery.\u201d <em>Snyder v. State, </em>210 Md.App. 370, 382, 63 A.3d 128, 135 (Raker, J.), <em>cert. denied, </em>432 Md. 470, 69 A.3d 476 (2013). A defendant commits second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type where: (1) \u201cthe defendant commitfs] an act with the intent to place [a victim] in fear of immediate physical harm\u201d; (2) \u201cthe defendant ha[s] the apparent ability, at [the] time, to bring about the physical harm\u201d; and (3) \u201c[t]he victim [is] aware of the impending\u201d physical harm. <em>Snyder, </em>210 Md.App. at 382, 63 A.3d at 135 (citation omitted). The State may prove a defendant\u2019s intent through \u201cdirect [evidence] or circumstantial evidence!.]\u201d <em>Bible v. State, </em>411 Md. 138, 158, 982 A.2d 348, 359 (2009) (plurality op.) (quoting <em>Thornton v. State, </em>397 Md. 704, 714, 919 A.2d 678, 683 (2007)) (second alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In <em>Ford v. State, </em>330 Md. 682, 708, 689, 625 A.2d 984, 996, 987 (1993), this Court held that evidence was sufficient to support convictions for assault with the intent to disable drivers and passengers where a defendant threw rocks at moving vehicles. First, this Court determined that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the defendant knew that passengers were in the vehicles. <em>See id. </em>at 705, 625 A.2d at 995. Next, this Court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to \u201csupport! ] a finding that [the defendant] intended] to disable any passengers in the vehicle[s,]\u201d as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>defendant \u201ccreated a zone of extreme peril inside the vehicles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707, 625 A.2d at 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Here, we conclude that a defendant can commit second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type against a victim of whose presence in particular the defendant does not know. A defendant commits second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type only if \u201cthe defendant commit[s] an act with the intent to place another in fear of immediate physical harm[.]\u201d <em>Snyder, </em>210 Md.App. at 382, 63 A.3d at 135. Where a defendant intentionally commits an act that creates a zone of danger, and where the defendant knows that multiple people are in the zone of danger, the defendant intends to place everyone in the zone of danger in fear of immediate physical harm\u2014even if the defendant does not know of a particular victim\u2019s presence in the zone of danger. <em>See Ford, </em>330 Md. at 689, 705, 707, 625 A.2d at 987, 995, 996 (Where a defendant threw rocks at moving vehicles, and where the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the defendant knew that passengers were in the vehicles, this Court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to \u201csupport[] a finding that [the defendant] inten[ded] to disable any passengers in the vehicle[s,]\u201d as the defendant \u201ccreated a zone of extreme peril inside the vehicles.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We reject Jones\u2019s implicit contention that this Court decided <em>Ford </em>wrongly by relying on the doctrine that \u201c[i]t is permissible to infer that <em>\u2018[a </em>defendant] intends the natural and probable consequences of [the defendant\u2019s] act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ford, </em>330 Md. at 704, 625 A.2d at 994 (quoting <em>Davis v. State, </em>204 Md. 44, 51, 102 A.2d 816, 819-20 (1954)). Although Jones does not expressly criticize this Court\u2019s logic in <em>Ford, </em>he contends that the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d doctrine should not apply to specific intent crimes in general. Jones relies on secondary sources whose authors criticize the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d doctrine, under which, supposedly, the State must prove merely that a defendant\u2019s actions were negligent, not intentional. <em>See, e.g., </em>Wayne R. LaFave, Criminal Law 270 (5th ed. 2010) (The \u201cnatural and probable conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>quences\u201d doctrine \u201cdestroy[s] the concept of intention and replace[s] it entirely with negligence.\u201d); Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.06 at 312 n.42 (1985) (\u201cTo say that the accomplice is liable if the offense committed is ... the \u2018probable consequence\u2019 of another crime is to make him [or her] liable for negligence[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">These concerns are unfounded. This Court has already \u201cdisagree[d]\u201d with LaFave\u2019s and the Model Penal Code\u2019s supposition that the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d doctrine \u201cpredicates liability on ... negligence[.]\u201d <em>Sheppard v. State, </em>312 Md. 118, 123 n. 3, 538 A.2d 773, 775 n. 3 (1988). As this Court has clarified, under the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d doctrine, a defendant is not presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences of the defendant\u2019s actions; instead, a finder of fact may, but need not, infer that the defendant intended the natural and probable consequences of the defendant\u2019s actions. <em>See Thornton, </em>397 Md. at 733, 919 A.2d at 695 (\u201c[0]nly an inference, rather than a presumption of intent, may be drawn from voluntary acts.... [T]he trier of fact is [not] allowed to presume that one intends the natural and probable consequences of his or her aets[.]\u201d (Citation omitted)); <em>see also </em>MPJI-Cr 3:31 (\u201c[Y]ou may, but are not required to, infer that a person ordinarily intends the natural and probable consequences of [his] [her] acts [and/or omissions].\u201d (Some brackets in original)). The lack of a presumption of intent negates the criticism of the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d doctrine. <em>See </em>Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.02 at 236 n.12 (1985) (The \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d doctrine \u201cshould not be taken as an invitation to dispense with the need for making the inference\u201d about intent. (Emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Here, first, we determine that the evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable inference that Jones knew that multiple people were in the apartment. It is undisputed that Jones knocked on the apartment\u2019s front door; Tindley answered the door; and Jones asked: \u201c[W]here the two [n* * * * *]s at[?]\u201d In other words, Jones indicated that he was seeking people other than Tindley and that he believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>that at least two people (in addition to Tindley) may have been in the apartment. Indeed, Byron testified that: (1) before the shootings, Jones said that \u201che [had] got[ten] into an altercation with two boys\u201d at Wink Lane Apartments; and (2) after the shootings, Jones said that \u201che was going to kill ... the two boys [whom] he was trying to get.\u201d Johnson testified that, after Tindley shut the door, but before she heard the gunshots: (1) Tindley told Johnson: \u201c[D]on\u2019t go to the door[,] they got a gun\u201d; and (2) Johnson \u201chollered\u201d to her grandson: \u201c[G]et down[.]\u201d Byron testified that, while he remained in the car <em>(i.e., </em>while he was farther away from the apartment than Jones was), he heard \u201cyelling.\u201d Based on Johnson\u2019s testimony and Byron\u2019s testimony, a finder of fact could reasonably infer that Jones knew that multiple people were in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Next, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable inference that Jones intended to place everyone in the apartment in fear of immediate physical harm. It is undisputed that, while Johnson was in the apartment, Jones intentionally fired a gun three times, and at least two bullets entered the apartment. In other words, Jones intentionally committed an act that turned the apartment into a zone of danger.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As discussed above, the evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable inference that Jones knew that multiple people were in the zone of danger. Thus, Jones intended to place everyone in the zone of danger in fear of immediate physical harm\u2014even if Jones did not know of Johnson\u2019s presence in the zone of danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We are unpersuaded by Jones\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Whalen, </em>49 S.W.3d 181, 185 (Mo.2001), in which the Supreme Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Missouri held that evidence there was insufficient to support convictions for first-degree assault. In <em>Whalen, see id., </em>while two law enforcement officers were in a hallway and outside of the defendant\u2019s sight, the defendant shot a third law enforcement officer who was in his bedroom\u2019s doorway. A jury convicted the defendant of first-degree assault against the two unharmed law enforcement officers. <em>See id. </em>On appeal, the defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he knew of the two unharmed law enforcement officers\u2019 presence. <em>See id. </em>The Supreme Court of Missouri agreed, stating that \u201conly speculation supported] the inference that\u201d the defendant knew of the two unharmed law enforcement officers\u2019 presence. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Supreme Court of Missouri implicitly acknowledged that a finder of fact may infer a defendant\u2019s knowledge of a victim\u2019s presence; in <em>Whalen, see id., </em>the evidence was simply insufficient to support such an inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Similarly, we are unpersuaded by Jones\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Wilson, </em>924 S.W.2d 648, 649, 650 (Tenn.1996), in which the Supreme Court of Tennessee held that evidence there was insufficient to support convictions for aggravated assault where a defendant shot at a house that contained multiple people. No people or vehicles were near the house, and \u201c[n]o testimony pointed to any facts\u2014lights, noises, or other signs\u2014 which would indicate to a passerby that the house was occupied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652. Thus, the Supreme Court of Tennessee determined that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the defendant knew that the house was occupied. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Likewise, Jones\u2019s reliance on <em>Hollingsworth v. State, </em>366 So.2d 326 (Ala.Crim.App.1978), is misplaced. In <em>Hollingsworth, id. </em>at 331-32, 327, the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama held that evidence there was insufficient to support a conviction for assault with the intent to murder where a defendant shot into a house. \u201c[Tjhere [was] no evidence what[so]ever\u201d that the defendant knew \u201cthat the house was ... occupied[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Because we determine that the evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable inference that Jones knew that multiple <em>people\u2014i.e., </em>people other than Tindley\u2014were in the apartment, this case is distinguishable from <em>Whalen, </em>49 S.W.3d 181, <em>Wilson, </em>924 S.W.2d 648, and <em>Hollingsworth, </em>366 So.2d 326, in which appellate courts held that certain evidence was insufficient to support convictions for assault where the evidence was insufficient to support findings that the defendants knew of the presence of more than one victim, or the presence of any victims at all.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">We hold that the evidence was sufficient to support Jones\u2019s conviction for second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type against Johnson, and a defendant can commit second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type against a victim of whose presence in particular the defendant does not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. PETITIONER TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-10\">. A review of the record reveals that Jones entered the car on the night of September 17, 2010, and that the gunshots occurred after midnight on the morning of September 18, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b490-9\">. In the petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>Jones raised one issue: \u201cWas the evidence sufficient to convicted [Jones] of second[-]degree assault of the intent[-]to[-]frighten [type] where the State failed to prove that [Jones] was aware of the existence of the victim?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\">. The extent of a zone of danger will depend on each case\u2019s particular circumstances. For example, in <em>Ford, </em>330 Md. at 707, 625 A.2d at 996, the zone of danger was the interior of the vehicles at which the defendant threw rocks. Here, the zone of danger is the apartment because Jones shot at the apartment\u2019s front door; one bullet entered the living room; and another bullet entered a rear bedroom. Because there is no issue as to second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type against anyone who was outside the apartment, we need not consider whether the zone of danger included other parts of, or any area outside, the apartment building.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\">. We also reject Jones\u2019s contention that the circuit court erred in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal as to second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type against Johnson, because, in granting the motion for judgment of acquittal as to attempted first-degree murder against Johnson and her grandson, the circuit court stated: \"I\u2019m not even sure [that] Jones knew that there was anybody [other than Tindley] in the apartment.\u201d Although the circuit court may have speculated as much in considering attempted first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder is comprised of elements that second-degree assault lacks, such as deliberation, premeditation, and a substantial step beyond mere preparation; thus, it does not follow from the circuit court\u2019s grant of the motion for judgment of acquittal as to attempted first-degree murder that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type against Johnson.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
