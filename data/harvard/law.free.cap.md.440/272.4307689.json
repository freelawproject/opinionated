Bar Counsel alleged that in the course of his representation of these clients, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Respondent violated a number of Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">As permitted by Maryland Rule 16-752(a), we referred the petition to the Honorable Michael R. Pearson of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Felder did not attend the hearing conducted on April 9, 2014 by Judge Pearson. After that hearing, the Judge issued the findings of fact and proposed conclusions of law set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">THE HEARING JUDGE\u2019S FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Judge Pearson made the following findings of fact by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Martrell and Timothy Matthews (\u201cMr. and Mrs. Matthews\u201d) first met with Felder in August 2011 to discuss their desire to file claims against Mid-Atlantic Home Builders (\u201cMid-Atlantic\u201d) for breach of contract, professional negligence, fraud, and misrepresentation. They paid Felder a $300 consultation fee for the first meeting. In November 2011, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews signed a retainer agreement, agreeing to pay Felder $5,000 for his services at an hourly rate of $250. They paid Felder $2,500 by check and agreed to pay the remaining $2,500 the following month.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">In December, Felder informed his clients that he was closing his practice but assured them that he would complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>their representation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The hearing judge found as to Mr. and Mrs. Matthews\u2019s payments that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\">Mr. Felder received the funds from Mr. and Mrs. Matthews and did not deposit them in trust and did not maintain them in trust until earned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">Mr. Felder did not obtain Mr. and Mrs. Matthews\u2019 informed consent to the deposit or maintenance of their fees other than in an attorney trust account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">[Felder] failed to maintain proper records relating to the deposit, maintenance, and disbursement of client funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Soon after informing his clients that he was closing his practice, Felder introduced Mr. and Mrs. Matthews to Monique Pressley\u2014a District of Columbia attorney not licensed in Maryland\u2014over whom Felder had supervisory authority. Judge Pearson found that \u201cMs. Pressley gave the clients the impression that she was licensed to practice in Maryland\u201d and performed work for Felder\u2019s clients by preparing a complaint against Mid-Atlantic.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Beginning in January 2013, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews had increasing difficulty reaching Felder and obtaining status updates regarding their case. As the hearing judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8k_\">On January 23, 2012, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews sent [Felder] an email requesting an update on their case. [Felder] replied on January 25, 2012, advising Mr. and Mrs. Matthews that the complaint was sent to Mid-Atlantic on January 7, 2012 and that Mid-Atlantic had until February 7th to respond or suit would follow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">On February 10, 2012, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews followed up with [Felder] through email and requested information on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>the status of their case. [Felder] did not reply to their email.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">Between February and April 2012, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews made several attempts to contact [Felder] through phone calls and emails but were unable to reach him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">On or about March 26, 2012, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews contacted Ms. Pressley through email and requested a copy of the complaint sent to Mid-Atlantic but did not receive a response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">On April 5, 2012, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews again sent a second email to Ms. Pressley requesting a copy of the documentation submitted to Mid-Atlantic on their behalf. Mr. and Mrs. Matthews did not receive any documents from [Felder\u2019s] office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">On April 11, 2012, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews drafted a termination letter to [Felder] and attempted to deliver it to [Felder\u2019s] Bowie office. [Mr. and Mrs. Matthews] were advised by the new office tenants that [Felder] no longer occupied the office space.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">[Felder] failed to notify Mr. and Mrs. Matthews that he had closed, and moved out of, his law firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">On April 11, 2012, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews forwarded a termination letter to [Felder] through email and forwarded a copy to Ms. Pressley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">[Felder] did not respond to Mr. and Mrs. Matthews\u2019s letter or email.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-11\">Mr. and Mrs. Matthews also mailed the termination letter via certified mail. The return receipt card reflects the letter was received and signed for on April 20, 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-12\">[Felder] did not respond to the certified letter sent by Mr. and Mrs. Matthews.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">Eventually, in April 2012, an employee at Felder\u2019s firm contacted Mr. and Mrs. Matthews to return to them a binder of documents the clients had provided in reference to their case as well as a $1,000 refund of legal fees \u201crepresenting a portion of the unearned fees\u201d Mr. and Mrs. Matthews had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>paid Felder. The hearing judge found that at no time did Felder reply to his clients\u2019 phone calls or emails.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Felder followed a similar pattern with Bernadine Ekeh (\u201cMs. Ekeh\u201d), who retained Felder to assist her with a loan modification in July 2011. She paid Felder a flat rate of $2,800 for representation not to exceed 10 hours of work at an hourly rate of $250.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Judge Pearson found that Ms. Ekeh experienced difficulty contacting Felder and receiving information regarding her loan modification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">Between August 2011 and May 2012, Ms. Ekeh left several messages on [Felder\u2019s] answering machine at the law firm\u2019s office number. [Felder] did not return [Ms. Ekeh\u2019s] calls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">On or about May 31, 2012, [Felder] returned Ms. Ekeh\u2019s call. [Felder] advised Ms. Ekeh that his office had relocated but did not give her a new address. During this conversation, Ms. Ekeh advised [Felder] that she had received correspondence rejecting her loan modification. [Felder] asked Ms. Ekeh to fax him the letter she received. Ms. Ekeh faxed the letter to [Felder] but did not hear back from him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">As with Felder\u2019s representation of Mr. and Mrs. Matthews, the hearing judge found that he failed to keep Ms. Ekeh\u2019s funds in trust or to maintain adequate records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">[Felder] admits in his response that he did not maintain Ms. Ekeh\u2019s legal fees in trust. He did not have Ms. Ekeh\u2019s consent to maintain the fees in any account other than a trust account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">[Felder] failed to maintain proper records relating to the deposit, maintenance, and disbursement of client funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Although Felder failed to communicate with Ms. Ekeh or perform work for her, he refunded her fees in their entirety, but only after Bar Counsel commenced its investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The hearing judge found that Felder never communicated to his clients that he had closed his practice and vacated his office:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\">[Felder] stated in his response that his office transitioned out of the legal profession from December 2011 until August 2012, and his last case was opened around April 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">[Felder] further stated that he vacated his office space and ceased his legal practice in June 2012. [Felder] did not address in his response his continuous failure to respond to requests for information from the client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The Attorney Grievance Commission received a complaint from Mr. and Mrs. Matthews in May 2012 and one from Ms. Ekeh in June 2012. In the course of investigating both complaints, Bar Counsel found Felder similarly unresponsive. Judge Pearson found as to the complaint of Mr. and Mrs. Matthews:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">[Felder] provided an initial response to the Attorney Grievance Commission on July 19, 2012. [Felder\u2019s] response did not address his failure to respond timely to two letters previously sent to him regarding the grievance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">During Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, [Felder] knowingly failed to respond to multiple requests for information from a disciplinary authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">[Felder] has not responded or communicated with the office of Bar Counsel concerning the complaint filed by Mr. and Mrs. Matthews after his initial response of July 19, 2012.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">As to Ms. Ekeh\u2019s complaint, Judge Pearson found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">During Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, [Felder] knowingly failed to respond to multiple requests for information from a disciplinary authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">On November 7, 2012, [Felder], through counsel, submitted a response to Bar Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>[Felder] has not responded or communicated with the office of Bar Counsel concerning the complaint filed by Ms. Ekeh after his response of November 7, 2012.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">From these facts, the hearing judge concluded that Felder violated MLRPC 1.1; 1.3; 1.4(a) and (b); 1.15(a) and (c); 1.16(d); 5.5(a); 8.1(b); 8.4(a), (c), and (d); and Maryland Rules 16-606.1 and 16-604.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">THE HEARING JUDGE\u2019S CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">MLRPC 1.1 requires attorneys to provide competent representation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and MLRPC 1.3 demands that they act with diligence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As to these rules, Judge Pearson concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">[Felder] ... failed to act with the requisite legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. In November 2011, [Felder] was retained by Mr. and Mrs. Matthews to represent them in claims against [Mid-Atlantic.] [Felder] did not perform any legal services for Mr. and Mrs. Matthews. Mr. and Mrs. Matthews attempted to contact [Felder] but were unable to reach him to inquire about their case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Additionally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">[Felder] failed to provide competent representation to Ms. Ekeh in that he failed to act with the requisite legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. In August 2011, [Felder] was retained by Ms. Ekeh to assist her in a loan modification. On August 3, 2011, [Felder] was paid $2,800 in legal fees. Ms. Ekeh had several questions regarding her case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>and attempted to reach [Felder] after that initial meeting. Respondent did not return the client\u2019s calls.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">MLRPC 1.4 requires attorneys to communicate with then-clients.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court identified many instances in which Felder failed to act in accordance with this rule. Specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adi\">[Felder] failed to return Mr. and Mrs. Matthews\u2019 calls and messages left on his answering machine and with his staff. Mr. and Mrs. Matthews also contacted Ms. Monique Pressley, a District of Columbia attorney, who worked with [Felder]. Mr. and Mrs. Matthews left messages with Ms. Pressley but did not hear back from [Felder]. Mr. and Mrs. Matthews attempted to reach [Felder] by phone, text message, and emails. Mr. and Mrs. Matthews mailed a certified termination letter to [Felder]. Mr. and Mrs. Matthews attempted to deliver the letter to his law office and found that [Felder] had vacated the office without giving his clients any notice. [Felder] failed to respond to Mr. and Mrs. Matthews\u2019 written termination letter requesting information as well as the return of their documents and the legal fees paid in full.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">[Felder] failed to comply promptly with Ms. Ekeh\u2019s reasonable requests for information about her matter[.] During the course of [Felder\u2019s] representation of Ms. Ekeh, he repeatedly failed to keep Ms. Ekeh reasonably informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>about the status of her case. Ms. Ekeh attempted to reach [Felder] by phone and text message. [Felder] failed to communicate with Ms. Ekeh regarding the status of her case. [Felder] failed to notify Ms. Ekeh that he closed his law practice and closed his office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">MLRPC 1.15 requires attorneys to maintain their clients\u2019 property in safekeeping. Concluding that Felder violated Rule 1.15(a) and (c),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Judge Pearson wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">[Felder] failed to hold property of Mr. and Mrs. Matthews in a trust account and failed to maintain complete records of the funds paid by Mr. and Mrs. Matthews for the representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">[Felder] fail[ed] to hold property of Ms. Ekeh in a trust account and to maintain complete records of the funds paid by Ms. Ekeh for the representation. On August 3, 2011, Ms. Ekeh paid [Felder] his entire fee of $2,800 by credit card. [Felder] did not deposit the fees in trust and did not maintain the fees in trust until earned. [Felder] did not obtain Ms. Ekeh\u2019s informed consent in wilting not to deposit the fees in trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>MLRPC 1.16 requires attorneys to protect their clients\u2019 interests when declining or terminating representation. The hearing judge concluded that Felder violated 1.16(d)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">[Felder] failed to notify Mr. and Mrs. Matthews that he would not handle the case for which he was retained. [Felder] abandoned Mr. and Mrs. Matthews\u2019 case and did not communicate with them after receiving payment in full for his services. Upon termination of representation, [Felder] failed to take steps necessary to protect Mr. and Mrs. Matthews\u2019 interests by failing to return their documents in response to their requests. [Felder] failed to return any of the legal fees paid to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">[Felder] abandoned Ms. Ekeh\u2019s case and did not communicate with her after receiving payment in full for his services. Upon termination of representation, [Felder] failed to timely return any of the legal fees paid to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">In part, MLRPC 5.5 prohibits attorneys from aiding the unauthorized practice of law. The hearing judge found that Felder violated Rule 5.5(a) <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">[Felder] assisted Ms. Pressley in the unauthorized practice of law knowing that Ms. Pressley is not licensed to practice in Maryland. [Felder] stated to Mr. and Mrs. Matthews that Ms. Pressley was his partner at the law firm and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>she would assist in handling their case. The evidence reveals that Ms. Pressley had direct contact with the clients. [Felder] had knowledge of Ms. Pressley\u2019s actions and he supported her involvement in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">MLRPC 8.1 prohibits attorneys from failing to respond to inquiries for information from a disciplinary authority. Judge Pearson concluded that Felder violated Rule 8.1(b)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">[Felder] knowingly failed to respond to lawful demands for information from a disciplinary authority when he did not respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">MLRPC 8.4 defines professional misconduct for attorneys. Specifically, the hearing judge found that Felder violated Rule 8.4(a), (c), and (d)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">[Felder] received a full retainer and failed to perform any substantive work for Mr. and Mrs. Matthews, after which he abandoned the clients without notice. [Felder] failed to deposit the legal fees in trust and failed to return the unearned fees to Mr. and Mrs. Matthews constituting deceit, dishonesty, or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>[Felder\u2019s] inadequate handling of Mr. and Mrs. Matthews\u2019 legal representation and failure to respond to Bar Counsel support the conclusion that he engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, in violation of Rule 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">[Felder\u2019s] failure to properly represent Ms. Ekeh and his failure to respond to Bar Counsel support the conclusion that he engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, in violation of Rule 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">By violating multiple Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, [Felder] violated Rule 8.4(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Finally, relating to Felder\u2019s failure to record, create, and maintain his clients\u2019 funds, the hearing judge found that Felder violated Maryland Rules 16-606.1 <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and 16-604<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>[Felder] did not deposit any of the fees paid by Mr. and Mrs. Matthews [or Ms. Ekeh] in trust and did not maintain the fees in trust until earned. [Felder] failed to maintain proper records relating to the deposit, maintenance, and disbursement of client funds, thereby violating Maryland Rules 16-606.1 and 16-604.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">As we recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">\u201cIn attorney discipline proceedings, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. 147, 167, 994 A.2d 928, 940 (2010) (citations omitted). \u201cWe accept a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless we determine that they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Edib, </em>415 Md. 696, 706, 4 A.3d 957, 964 (2010) (quoting <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 50, 891 A.2d 1085, 1095 (2006)). That deference is appropriate because the hearing judge is in a position to assess the demeanor-based credibility of the witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 707, 4 A.3d at 964. In that regard, \u201c[t]he hearing judge is permitted to \u2018pick and choose which evidence to rely upon\u2019 from a conflicting array when determining findings of fact.\u201d <em>Guida, </em>391 Md. at 50, 891 A.2d at 1095 (quoting <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 253, 760 A.2d 1108, 1118 (2000)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the hearing judge\u2019s proposed conclusion of law. <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ugwuonye, </em>405 Md. 351, 368, 952 A.2d 226, 236 (2008). In other words, \u201cthe ultimate determination ... as to an attorney\u2019s alleged mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>conduct is reserved for this Court.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

In that regard, we examine the record to ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to support the hearing judge\u2019s legal conclusions, by a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard of proof. <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Siskind, </em>401 Md. 41, 54, 930 A.2d 328, 335 (2007).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tanko, </em>427 Md. 15, 27-28, 45 A.3d 281, 288 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">EXCEPTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Neither Felder nor Bar Counsel notes any exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. Thus, although both parties are permitted to file \u201c(1) exceptions to the findings and conclusions of the hearing judge and (2) recommendations concerning the appropriate disposition[,]\u201d Md. Rule 16-758(b), we shall accept the hearing judge\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions,\u201d Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A). Additionally, based upon our <em>de novo </em>review, we agree that Felder violated the following MLRPC provisions: Rule 1.1; Rule 1.3; Rule 1.4(a) and (b); Rule 1.15(a) and (c); Rule 1.16(d); Rule 5.5(a); Rule 8.1(b); and Rule 8.4(a), (c), and (d). We also agree that Felder violated Maryland Rules 16-606.1 and 16-604.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">SANCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Bar Counsel recommends that Felder be disbarred. It directs the Court\u2019s attention to five aggravating factors found in Standard 9.22 of the American Bar Association\u2019s <em>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions </em>(1992).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Pursuant to Stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>dard 9.22(b), Bar Counsel characterizes Felder\u2019s misconduct as partly a result of a dishonest or selfish motive. Bar Counsel also points to Felder\u2019s pattern of misconduct (Standard 9.22(c)), his multiple offenses (Standard 9.22(d)), his failure to respond to requests during the disciplinary process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>(Standard 9.22(e)), and his refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct (Standard 9.22(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">When determining the appropriate sanction, we must also consider any mitigating factors. <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. </em>Roberts, 394 Md. 137, 165, 904 A.2d 557, 574 (2006) (\u201cThe appropriate sanction depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, including any mitigating factors.\u201d). Here, the hearing judge found no mitigating factors, and there is no reason to upset that finding. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. West, </em>378 Md. 395, 411, 836 A.2d 588, 597 (2003) (\u201cOn review, we keep in mind that the findings of the trial judge are <em>prima facie </em>correct and will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Bar Counsel directs the Court\u2019s attention to Standard 4.41, which advises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">Disbarment is generally appropriate when: (a) a lawyer abandons the practice and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client; or (b) a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for a client and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client; or (c) a lawyer engages in a pattern of neglect with respect to client matters and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">American Bar Association, <em>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, </em>\u00a7 4.41 (1992), <em>reprinted in Compendium of Professional Responsibility Rules and Standards </em>(2014). Bar Counsel then reiterates that Felder \u201cknowingly failed to perform the services for which he was retained and that [h]e engaged in a pattern of neglect with respect to his client matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">As we recently discussed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">In selecting a sanction, we are cognizant of the principle that attorney discipline proceedings are not instituted to punish an offending lawyer, but rather to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sucklal, </em>418 Md. 1, 10 n. 3, 12 A.3d 650, 655 n. 3 (2011). Imposition of a sanction protects the public in two ways: \u201cthrough deterrence of the type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>conduct which will not be tolerated, and by removing those unfit, to continue in the practice of law from the rolls of those authorized to practice in this State.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Our selection of an appropriate sanction is guided by the nature and gravity of the violation, the intent with which the violation was committed, and the particular circumstances surrounding each case, including aggravating and mitigating factors. <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

When assessing the appropriate sanction, we often refer to the American Bar Association\u2019s <em>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, </em>which advises the consideration of four questions: \u201c(1) What is the nature of the ethical duty violated?; (2) What was the lawyer\u2019s mental state?; (3) What was the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct?; and (4) Are there any aggravating or mitigating circumstances?\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

We are guided by our holding in <em>Park:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">[Djisbarment is the appropriate sanction when an attorney abandons a client by failing to pursue the client\u2019s interests, failing to communicate with the client, ignoring a client\u2019s repeated requests for status updates, terminating the representation without notice by failing wholly to provide effective services, and failing to return unearned fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">427 Md. at 196, 46 A.3d at 1162. Mr. Felder\u2019s conduct fits well within the dictates of <em>Park. </em>Felder failed to perform any legal services for his clients after accepting a retainer, ignored his clients\u2019 repeated requests for updates and attempts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>terminate his representation, failed to maintain his clients\u2019 funds in trust, abandoned representation of his clients without communication, failed to return unearned fees to one of his clients until after that client had already filed a complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission, and assisted the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that disbarment is the appropriate sanction.
