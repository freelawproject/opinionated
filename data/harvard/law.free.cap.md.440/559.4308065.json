Judge Helen Harrington of the Circuit Court for Charles County, after three hearings, ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> found that the Charles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>County Sheriffs Office no longer had possession of the T-shirt, cigarette package and \u201csex crimes kit\u201d; as to the \u201csex crimes kit\u201d, she also decided that even were the kit to have been produced, it only would have contained blood drawn from the victim. Johnson, thereafter, noted a direct appeal to this Court in which he asks us to resolve the following question:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiT\">Did the circuit court err in finding that the State had performed a reasonable search for requested evidence which might contain biological identification material?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We shall affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s findings and conclude that the Judge was not clearly erroneous when she concluded that the State performed a reasonable search for the requested scientific identification evidence and that the evidence no longer existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">At the end of three hearings, Judge Harrington stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">[THE COURT:] I think there has been a reasonable search....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">And there is no evidence whatsoever that there has been any intentional or willful destruction of evidence. It simply doesn\u2019t exist. We can\u2019t find it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">So I have to deny the Motion for a New Trial based on a request for post-DNA; post-conviction DNA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">Judge Harrington also made specific findings that the T-shirt, cigarette package and sex crimes kit were no longer in the possession of the Sheriffs Office and, therefore, were unavailable for testing. She had found, at the end of the second hearing, that the Sheriffs Office had twice inventoried all items in its evidence storage area, Building 104, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>having uncovered the T-shirt, cigarette package or sex crimes kit from which she concluded that the evidence sought by Johnson was no longer in the possession of the Sheriffs Office:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">[THE COURT:] I\u2019m reasonably satisfied that evidence that was in property held and transferred from the old units to the new units was inventoried and logged in not just once but twice. So I think the loose ends have more to do with where else might it be rather than whether things are actually in the Sheriffs possession right now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Charles Smith, the civilian property custodian of the Sheriffs Office, had testified at the second hearing and explained that all items of evidence held in Building 104 had been moved twice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to Mr. Smith, the property that had been held in Building 104 was moved in 2006, when the Sheriffs Office had been relocated, and again in approximately \u201c2008, 2009\u201d, when the building had been emptied in order to enable the County to \u201ctake care of\u2019 a mold problem. Mr. Smith also stated that he perused the handwritten inventories compiled during both relocations and had not found any reference to the T-shirt, cigarette package or sex crimes kit. Mr. Smith further testified that, prior to the second hearing before Judge Harrington, he and others had searched \u201caround the whole building\u201d in order to confirm that the T-shirt, cigarette package and sex crimes kit were not obtainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Judge Harrington\u2019s conclusion that the State had performed a reasonable search for the sex crimes kit at the Sheriffs Office was based not only on the affidavit and testimony regarding Building 104, but also upon another affidavit by Shelly Herold, a technician in the Charles County Sheriffs Office Forensic Science Unit. Ms. Herold affirmed that she had searched the Forensic Science Unit\u2019s storage areas for the sex crimes kit, to no avail.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Regarding the sex crimes kit, Judge Harrington also found that Physician\u2019s Memorial Hospital did not possess the sex crimes kit and even had the kit been found it would have only contained blood drawn from the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">[THE COURT:] There is evidence that there was [a sex crimes kit] but there\u2019s no evidence that it was ever logged in to The Sheriffs Department. It apparently does not appear to have been their procedure at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">There\u2019s no information indicating that it has been preserved or kept in any refrigerator there. We do have that affidavit from Shelly Herold that says that she did a search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">[COUNSEL FOR JOHNSON:] If you, if you collect evidence from a rape kit by definition you\u2019re gonna have skin cells on it and that\u2019s biological material that could be submitted to testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">And with respect to the shirt, you know, it\u2019s a kind of ridiculous\u2014.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">THE COURT: Yeah, as I said it could be there but I, we don\u2019t have any evidence that there were ... [s]kin cells collected at the hospital. There was a blood, blood work; blood draw.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Judge Harrington also relied upon the report compiled by Sergeant George Watts, the investigating officer in Johnson\u2019s case, as well as the report completed by the physician who had examined the victim at Physician\u2019s Memorial Hospital; both reports had been introduced into evidence during the second of the three hearings. The authors of both reports noted that the examining physician had handed the sex crimes kit over to Sergeant Watts after examining the victim, thereby establishing that the Hospital did not retain the sex crimes kit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Judge Harrington\u2019s finding that the sex crimes kit had only contained blood taken from the victim was based upon the hospital report upon which was written, under the heading \u201cEvidence Collected by Examining Physician\u201d, that only \u201cBLOOD\u201d had been collected from the victim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Johnson argued both before the trial court as well as before us that, because \u201cthe victim\u2019s t-shirt, a cigarette package, and a sex crimes kit\u2014did exist at one point\u201d, it is \u201creasonable that all or some of the items [Johnson] now seeks are somewhere in the State\u2019s possession.\u201d Johnson asserts that the State must produce \u201call relevant property logs\u201d from the Charles County Sheriff\u2019s Office as part of a reasonable search. Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ducing the property logs, he reasons, would provide his counsel an opportunity to review them with an \u201cadvocate\u2019s eye\u201d to determine if there were entries missed which could lead to the discovery of the missing T-shirt, cigarette package and sex crimes kit.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Johnson also argued before the trial court as well as before us that \u201cevidence, testimony, or affidavits as to the procedures in place at the hospital for conducting the sexual assault kit\u201d must be produced, because they would demonstrate that more than the victim\u2019s blood had been collected, as well as \u201cwhat was then done with the examination.\u201d For support that more than blood drawn from the victim had been collected, Johnson asserts that \u201cif a hospital subjected a victim to a sexual assault kit, it would be reasonable to assume that, even in 1980, more than just blood was taken\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In evaluating whether the State has conducted a reasonable search, we ask whether it has \u201cdemonstrated sufficiently a prima facie case, either directly or circumstantially, that the requested scientific identification evidence no longer exists\u201d. <em>Washington v. State, </em>424 Md. 632, 651, 37 A.3d 932, 942 (2012). The Circuit Court\u2019s finding that the State had met its burden and shown that the requested evidence no longer exists is reviewed under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Blake v. State, </em>418 Md. 445, 460, 15 A.3d 787, 796 (2011) (hereinafter <em>\u201cBlake II </em>\u201d). <em>See also Fuster v. State, </em>437 Md. 653, 89 A.3d 1114 (2014); <em>Arey v. State, </em>422 Md. 328, 29 A.3d 986 (2011) (hereinafter <em>\u201cArey II\u201d). </em>Under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard, \u201cif there is any competent evidence to support the factual findings below, those findings cannot be held to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>424 Md. at 651, 37 A.3d at 942, quoting <em>Solomon v. Solomon, </em>383 Md. 176, 202, 857 A.2d 1109, 1123 (2004). Based upon the application of these principles, we conclude that Judge Harrington did not err in her finding that the State conducted a reasonable search for the T-shirt, cigarette package and sex crimes kit. Her decision is supported by undisputed evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>that the T-shirt, cigarette package and sex crimes kit could not be located by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Our conclusion that Judge Harrington did not err is guided by our past jurisprudence that has refined the standard of what is a reasonable search under Section 8-201. In <em>Washington, </em>424 Md. at 635, 37 A.3d at 933, Washington had sought for testing, under Section 8-201, evidence compiled during the investigation that had led to his 1990 rape conviction. The circuit court ultimately concluded that \u201ca reasonable search was undertaken which included the Wicomico County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and Sheriffs Office, the Maryland State Police Crime Laboratory, [the hospital in which the victim had been examined] and the clerk\u2019s office of the Circuit Court\u201d based upon testimony and affidavit that each shelf and box in these locations had been searched for the evidence Washington had requested. <em>Id. </em>at 648, 37 A.3d at 941. The hearing judge in <em>Washington </em>also determined that \u201cthe evidence presented at the hearing showed that the searches for evidence related to this case, dating back to 2002, produced no results\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe evidence was either lost or destroyed prior to that time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648-49, 37 A.3d at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">We opined in <em>Washington </em>that the circuit court had not erred when it found that the State had conducted a reasonable search. We also held that it was irrelevant that the State had not introduced the storage protocols of the Sheriffs Office, because the protocols \u201cwould only indicate that the requested scientific identification evidence was in the possession of the Sheriffs Office\u201d, which had already been reasonably searched to no avail. <em>Id. </em>at 661-62, 37 A.3d at 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\"><em>Washington </em>informs us that the search conducted here was reasonable, as well as that production of the Hospital\u2019s protocols is not required in the present case. Judge Harrington determined that the T-shirt, cigarette package and sex crimes kit were no longer in the State\u2019s possession based upon Charles Smith\u2019s testimony, from which she found that Building 104 had been fully inventoried twice and searched once without having uncovered the evidence in question. As in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number><em>Washington, </em>in which we determined that the search of the Sheriffs Office was reasonable, it was not clearly erroneous for Judge Harrington to conclude that the search of the Charles County Sheriffs Office was reasonable and that the Sheriffs Office no longer possessed the T-shirt, cigarette package or sex crimes kit.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">With respect to the sex crimes kit specifically, Judge Harrington observed that the affidavit from Shelly Herold reflected that the kit was not stored within the Charles County Sheriffs Office\u2019s Forensic Science Unit. Judge Harrington also recognized that the sex crimes kit had been handed over to Sergeant Watts of the Charles County Sheriffs Office on the evening the victim had been examined based upon reports from Physician\u2019s Memorial Hospital and the Sheriffs Office that had been admitted into evidence. Judge Harrington, at the end of the second hearing, noted that neither the Hospital nor the Sheriffs Office possessed the sex crimes kit and instructed the State to explore other facilities that may have received the kit, namely the Maryland State Police Crime Laboratory and the FBI Crime Laboratory.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The documentation from the Hospital, the Sheriffs Office, the Maryland State Police and the FBI, together with Ms. Herold\u2019s affidavit, was prima facie proof that the sex crimes kit was no longer in the possession of the State, so that it was not clear error to conclude that the sex crimes kit no longer existed thirty-three years after it was removed from Physician\u2019s Memorial Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">As to Johnson\u2019s assertion that the Hospital\u2019s protocols for collecting and handling evidence from a sexual assault victim needed to be produced, because they may have shown additional places to search, we have noted that the protocol of a place to be searched is immaterial when the hearing judge already has concluded that the location to which the protocol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>was related has been futilely searched. <em>Washington, </em>424 Md. at 661-62, 37 A.3d at 949. In the present case, Judge Harrington relied upon documents admitted into evidence, created both by the Charles County Sheriffs Office and Physician\u2019s Memorial Hospital, which conclusively established that the hospital no longer had possession of the sex crimes kit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Our decision in <em>Horton v. State, </em>412 Md. 1, 985 A.2d 540 (2009), also does not offer succor to Johnson with regard to his request for the Hospital\u2019s protocols. In <em>Horton, </em>412 Md. at 17, 985 A.2d at 549, we ordered production of protocols only because a \u201cformer Hospital official had suggested that evidence concerning the victim\u201d could still have been stored in the hospital. No such testimony was adduced in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Here, Johnson merely asserts that \u201cmore than just blood was taken\u201d, so that the Hospital should be searched or at least queried regarding its protocols for collecting specimens in a sex crimes kit. The Hospital report admitted into evidence and relied upon by Judge Harrington, however, indicates that only \u201cBLOOD\u201d had been collected from the victim and included in the sex crimes kit, which was prima facie proof that only blood was taken. Johnson\u2019s mere assertion, without more, that other scientific identification evidence was collected does not render the search unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">With regard to Johnson\u2019s contention that he should have been provided the Charles County Sheriffs Office\u2019s property logbooks, because his counsel could have reviewed them to determine if there were errors in their compilation, we chalk this up again to mere speculation, rather than based upon proof of a mistake. We have determined, however, that speculation is not sufficient to overcome a prima, facie showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>that the State followed its procedures for storing and maintaining evidence. <em>Blake II, </em>418 Md. at 461-62, 15 A.3d at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">In <em>Blake II, </em>Blake sought for testing, under Section 8-201, evidence from his 1982 conviction of first degree rape and first degree sex offense. He asserted that evidence from his trial may have been held in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office following his trial and, therefore, a reasonable search must have included the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office. We rejected Blake\u2019s argument, first opining that it \u201cis reasonable to conclude that the evidence sought to be tested was handled in conformity with the routine practice of the Circuit Court and the Police Department\u201d; we then acknowledged that a tape recorded statement by the prosecutor in Blake\u2019s criminal trial \u201cconfirming that Assistant State\u2019s Attorneys did not take custody of exhibits at the conclusion of criminal trials\u201d established that the evidence was not held by the State\u2019s Attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 460, 462, 15 A.3d at 796, 797. We reasoned that, when \u201cit has been established that the prosecutor\u2019s office does not take custody of exhibits\u201d, the circuit court could properly deny a request for a search of the prosecutor\u2019s office. <em>Id. </em>at 462, 15 A.3d at 797. In the case before us, similarly, the logbooks were reviewed, the locations searched and the detail of their compilation and searches were produced; Johnson adduced no proof that there were mistakes in the compilation of the logbooks and in the locations searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Johnson, however, urges that the State had produced a logbook in <em>Arey II, </em>422 Md. 328, 29 A.3d 986 (2011), and so his request for the Charles County Sheriffs Office\u2019s logbooks should have been granted. Whether Arey received a logbook was not in issue in <em>Arey II </em>and did not form the basis for any decision by the trial court or this Court. The reversal of the trial court\u2019s decision in <em>Arey II </em>resulted from our determination that Arey should have had an opportunity in the circuit court to contest evidence adduced by the State, which had nothing at all to do with the production of logbooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">In conclusion, Judge Harrington\u2019s findings that the State had performed a reasonable search for the T-shirt, cigarette <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>pack and sex crimes kit and that they no longer were in the possession of the Charles County Sheriffs Office were not clearly erroneous, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CHARLES COUNTY IS AFFIRMED.

During the first hearing, the State only had produced a memorandum from a representative of the Property Management Unit of the Charles County Sheriff\u2019s Office stating that the T-shirt, cigarette package and sex crimes kit could not be found. The State, thereafter, was granted a postponement to secure affidavits in compliance with Rule 4-706(c)(2)(B) (2011), which states that \u201cif the State asserts that it has been unable to locate the evidence, an affidavit containing a detailed description of all steps it took to locate the evidence,\u201d must be included in the State\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">During the second hearing, the State produced affidavits executed by Charles Smith, the civilian property custodian of the Sheriff's Office, and Shelly Herold, a technician in the Sheriff's Office\u2019s Forensic Science Unit. Mr. Smith\u2019s testimony was also adduced. Records from the Sheriff's Office pertaining to property recovered during the investigation of the underlying offenses, as well as the Charles County Crime Laboratory's fingerprint analysis and the hospital report completed by the physician who had examined the victim after the incident, also were admitted into evidence. At the conclusion of the second hearing, Judge Harrington raised various questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">[THE COURT:] I can't think of any reason why the investigating officer would submit a report saying that a sex crime kit was used and evidence collected and turned over to the officer if all they did was draw blood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">I also can\u2019t think of any reason why the medical reports would list evidence box if all they did was draw blood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">It doesn't make sense to me and I think there needs to be some further investigation to see if there are any records anywhere and I\u2019m suggesting checking with Maryland State Police and the FBI to see if anything was submitted to either of those facilities for testing at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">I would also point out that Sergeant John Wood\u2019s signature is all over these property papers and I believe he\u2019s still in the area. So I think there needs to be a conversation with him to see if he can shed any light as to what procedures were being used, what might have happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">I think as regards to Sherry; Shelly Herold\u2019s affidavit I think there\u2019s legitimate question exactly how did she go about doing her search; what was she looking for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">At the third hearing, the State offered the testimony of Retired Sergeant John Wood, of the Charles County Sheriff\u2019s Office, as one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>familiar with the Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s evidence storage protocols at the time of the underlying investigation.

The language from Charles County Sheriffs Office\u2019s report was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">A sex crimes kit was used by the medical staff and evidence was collected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">The kit was then turned over to the undersigned officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Similarly, the report from Physician's Memorial Hospital noted:</p>\n<p id=\"ARl\">10:50pm Collected evidence given to Sheriff Officers</p>\n<p id=\"A3kk\">Sergeant Watts\u2019s signature appears on both the hospital report and the Sheriff\u2019s Office's report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b603-11\">.
