These convictions were based, in part, on the testimony of Detective Brian Edwards of the Baltimore County Police Department. Detective Edwards testified, without having been qualified as an expert witness under Maryland Rule 5-702,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that by interpreting Payne\u2019s and Bond\u2019s cell phone records subpoenaed from Sprint Nextel<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the period from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>August 26 to August 27, 2007, he was able to determine the location of cell phone towers through which particular calls were routed and to plot the locations of those towers on a map in relation to the crime scene. The attorneys for Payne and Bond objected to Detective Edwards\u2019s testimony arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that he should have been qualified as an expert. The trial judge overruled their objections and opined that Detective Edwards\u2019s testimony only related facts that could be independently verified from the phone records.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">The trial judge also admitted into evidence against both Payne and Bond six recorded phone conversations in which Bond was a participant but Payne was not, in which the discussions suggested an alibi on the night of the murder. After the trial judge had determined that a conspiracy to conceal the murder existed and that Payne and Bond were participants in that conspiracy, she admitted generally the six recordings.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed Payne\u2019s and Bond\u2019s convictions, ruling that the trial court erred in admitting Detective Edwards\u2019s testimony without his having been qualified as an expert witness. <em>Payne &amp; Bond v. State, </em>211 Md.App. 220, 231, 65 A.3d 154, 160-61 (2013). Thus, a new trial was ordered for both defendants. Concerning an issue likely to arise upon re-trial, the intermediate appellate court apparently determined that Bond\u2019s statements during the wiretapped telephone calls could be admitted against Payne, not as the statement of a co-conspirator, but under Maryland Rule 5-803(a)(l),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which permits admissions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>of a party-opponent. <em>Id. </em>at 252, 65 A.3d at 172-73. We granted the State\u2019s Petition for Certiorari to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">May a trial court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, allow a lay witness, without qualification as an expert, to testify about objectively verifiable facts that do not involve the witness forming any opinion or drawing any inference or conclusion?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">We also granted Payne\u2019s cross-petition to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err in ruling that wiretap statements made by respondent Bond but not respondent Payne were nevertheless admissible against Payne as statements by a party opponent?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-8\"><em>Payne </em>&amp; <em>Bond v. State, </em>434 Md. 311, 75 A.3d 317 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">We shall hold that Detective Edwards needed to be qualified as an expert under Maryland Rule 5-702 before being allowed to testify as to his process for determining the communication path of Payne\u2019s and Bond\u2019s cell phones, as well as his conclusion that the Menlo Drive cell tower and the Balmoral Towers cell tower were the most pertinent to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">The present case began when, in the early morning of August 27, 2007, officers of the Baltimore County Police Department, including Detective Brian Edwards, a fourteen year veteran of the force with four and a half years in the homicide unit, responded to a call and discovered a body on fire in the woods at Villa Nova and Queen Anne Roads in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Pikesville. Early in the investigation, detectives recovered a scrap of paper from the bedroom of the victim, Glen Stewart, containing two names and associated phone numbers, one of which was that of Desmond Jones. Investigation of Desmond Jones\u2019s cell phone records led detectives to identify numbers associated with Payne, Bond, Christopher Johnson, Tyrice McCant and Brittany Keller. Detectives obtained dialed number recorder (\u201cDNR\u201d) authorizations to capture the numbers of phones called by those individuals. According to the State in its brief, the \u201cDNRs showed numerous calls between McCant, Keller, Payne, Bond, Johnson, and Jones\u201d around the time of police interviews of McCant and Keller in late October and early November of 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Investigation of Jones\u2019s records also led Detective Edwards to subpoena additional sets of \u201cphone records\u201d associated with phone numbers with which Jones communicated, totaling \u201cclose to a hundred different sets of records\u201d. These \u201cphone records\u201d, which were received electronically from Sprint Nextel, totaled \u201cthousands of pages\u201d when printed. Detective Edwards testified that he then chose individuals identifiable as the most \u201cpertinent\u201d, including Payne and Bond, for whom he amassed records of their cell phone calls from August 3 through August 31, 2007. Apparently, the amassed information was in the form of Call Detail Records <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for Payne\u2019s and Bond\u2019s cell phones, which accounted for roughly thirty to forty pages for Payne, while Bond\u2019s were \u201cunder 10 pages\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Detective Edwards further testified that, once he isolated the separate working copies, he parsed Payne\u2019s records to a single page document and Bond\u2019s records to a quarter-page exhibit, of trimmed call entries depicting communications to or from Payne\u2019s and Bond\u2019s phones within the timeframe from August 26 to August 27, 2007, under the headings of \u201cDuration\u201d, \u201cDirection\u201d, \u201cDialed\u201d, \u201cBeginning Tower\u201d, \u201cEnding Tower\u201d, \u201cLat\u201d and \u201cLong\u201d; each document was admitted into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>evidence as Exhibit 12 and 11B, respectively.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Excluded from both exhibits was information that Detective Edwards determined was redundant, extraneous,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as well as identification numbers for the cell towers associated with each entry for which he substituted his own derived geographical coordinates.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Detective Edwards also testified that he could determine the call time, phone number called, whether the call was incoming or outgoing and the cell tower through which the cell phone communicated, based on the complete records he had received from Sprint Nextel. When Payne\u2019s counsel objected to the Detective\u2019s testimony on the ground that Detective Edwards needed to be qualified as an expert in order to interpret the data, the State responded that the actual records contained step-by-step instructions as to the use of the records, although neither the actual records nor the instructions were introduced into evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Detective Edwards proffered, outside of the presence of the jury, the procedure that he used to determine cell tower locations. According to him, the process required matching certain data points associated with a cell phone call to a table available on an unnamed \u201csecure Web site\u201d or on \u201can Excel spread sheet that comes with the records\u201d, to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>latitude and longitude of the corresponding cell tower.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Neither the \u201cExcel spread sheet that comes with the records\u201d nor the \u201csecure Web site\u201d that allegedly maintains cell tower information was admitted into evidence. Satisfied that Detective Edwards need not have been qualified as an expert to testify, as he did to that point, the trial judge permitted the State to further question the Detective about the location of the cell towers that transmitted Payne\u2019s and Bond\u2019s communications listed in Exhibits 12 and 11B.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">Detective Edwards testified thereafter regarding the location of the first cell tower to which Bond\u2019s cell phone allegedly connected on the night of the crime, a cell tower located on Menlo Drive, and opined that the cell tower was between one and a half to two miles from the crime scene.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>then offered, as Exhibit 9, a map Detective Edwards created upon which he had printed what he determined to be the location of the Menlo Drive tower as well as the location of the murder.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Detective Edwards further testified that he determined Bond\u2019s cell phone also registered off of a second cell tower located on the Balmoral Towers building, which, according to him, was located approximately a mile from the crime scene, all of which was reflected on Exhibit 9, which was admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">An oversized aerial photograph, already admitted into evidence as Exhibit 2, of the area surrounding Villa Nova and Queen Anne Roads then was shown to Detective Edwards. Exhibit 2 contained a preprinted graphic showing the location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>where the victim\u2019s body was found and a sticker identifying the home of a witness. The State then asked Detective Edwards to place a sticker depicting the location of the Balmoral Towers cell tower on Exhibit 2, which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The State then presented Exhibit 3 to Detective Edwards, which was another oversized aerial photograph showing, on a larger scale, the same general geographic area depicted on Exhibit 2 and which was admitted into evidence during Detective Edwards\u2019s testimony. On Exhibit 3, the State had identified the location where officers found the victim\u2019s body, in addition to the location of the residences of the victim, Payne, Bond and two others who had been investigated by police in connection with the murder.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Detective Edwards, at the State\u2019s request, again identified and indicated by stickers the locations of the Menlo Drive cell tower and the Balmoral Towers cell tower on Exhibit 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Detective Edwards further testified that, by using the call entries in Exhibit 12\u2014the edited records associated with Payne\u2014he determined that Payne\u2019s cell phone registered off of the Balmoral Towers cell tower on the night of the murder. The State then offered for admission Exhibit 10, a second map created by the Detective showing what he had determined to be the location of the Balmoral Towers cell tower, as well as the location of the crime scene.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Based on Detective Edwards\u2019s testimony, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, in his closing, repeatedly urged that Payne\u2019s and Bond\u2019s Call Detail Records \u201cpoint to their guilt\u201d and the \u201cevidence is significant ... because it puts them right there\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbR\">I am going to start with the cell phone calls, the evidence of the cell phone calls, the cell phone towers. The fact-that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Joseph Payne\u2019s cell phone registered off of the Balmoral Towers a half mile away from the body of [the victim] at the time of the murder, Jason Bond\u2019s cell phone registered off that same tower half a mile away at the time of the burning. But their cell phone calls point to their guilt. But that\u2019s not standing alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">All right, starting with the cell phones. First I am going to talk about Jason Bond. What does the evidence of the cell phone towers tell you? First, you heard that on August 26, 2007, at 9:14 p.m. Jason Bond\u2019s phone is registered off of Menlo Towers, a mile and a half, two miles away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">But what is really interesting about the cell tower information is that you heard from Detective Edwards that between those periods of August 23rd and August 30 when he monitored the phone calls coming from Jason Bond\u2019s phone, he registered off the Balmoral Towers one time at 1:03 a.m. No other time. And that makes sense. He lives in the City. He has no reason to <em>come out to the County </em>except for a dump-off. He has no reason to come out to the County except to burn [the victim\u2019s] body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">Joseph Payne.... The tower information tells you that at 10:02 p.m., right at the time [the victim] is being murdered, the defendant\u2019s phone is registering off of the Balmoral Towers a half mile away from the body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">Only one time did it register off of the Balmoral Tower. One time. And that was at the time 10:02 p.m. And that makes sense because Joseph Payne lives in the City. He has no reason to <em>come out to the County </em>to an isolated spot in the woods except for the dump-off.... That is why this information and this evidence is significant, and that is why it points to their guilt <em>because it puts them right there.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALN\">(italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">Clearly, Detective Edwards\u2019s testimony had significance in the present case. Whether the Detective should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>qualified as an expert before being allowed to engage in the process of identifying the geographic location of the cell towers and the locations themselves depends on understanding just what are cell phone records and what their contents reveal. Because understanding the significance of cell phone use in varying contexts extends far beyond merely placing and receiving phone calls, into e-mailing, photographing and internet browsing, <em>(see </em>Maeve Duggan &amp; Lee Rainie, Pew Research, Cell Phone Activities 2012, 2 (Nov. 25, 2012), <em>available at </em>http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Cell-Activities.aspx (last visited Dec. 8, 2014) (finding that more than half of cell phone owners use their cell phone to take pictures, send or receive text messages, or access the internet)), the potential retrievable information from cell phone use is extensive.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Rick Ayers et al., Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics 48-49 (May 2014), <em>available at </em>http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP. 800-101rl (last visited Dec. 8, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">A cell phone is, effectively, a sophisticated two-way radio that operates within a cellular network. Clifford S. Fishman &amp; Anne T. McKenna, Wiretapping &amp; Eavesdropping: Surveillance in the Internet Age \u00a7 28:2 (3d ed. 2014). A cellular network is a wireless network added to the Plain Old Telephone System (POTS), which is the regular, wired form of telecommunications. Larry E. Daniel &amp; Lars E. Daniel, Digital Forensics for Legal Professionals: Understanding Digital Evidence From the Warrant to the Courtroom \u00a7 33.1 (2012). In order to add a cellular network to the POTS network, equipment is added to the existing telecommunications system. <em>Id. </em>One piece of that equipment is the cell tower and its attached antennae, which is itself one component of a cell site.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>It is through the cell tower that a cell phone maintains a connection to the telecommunications network. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Cellular networks are comprised of a distribution of land areas called \u201ccells\u201d, each of which is served by at least one cell tower. <em>Id. </em>The arrangement of cells \u201cis based on the concept of dividing the landscape into coverage cells typically three miles in diameter\u201d, (Anna F.

A cellular network is designed so that the cells overlap,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Tapp, <em>supra, </em>at 4), and the cell tower lies where the several cells intersect, not at the center of a cell.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Fishman <em>&amp; </em>McKenna, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 28:2. The coverage of a particular cell may range from one-half mile,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> particularly in the urban environment, to as far as thirty miles from the cell tower. Blank, <em>supra, </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">There are a variety of factors affecting to which tower a cell phone will connect, beyond merely the distance between the originating cell phone, the receiving cell phone and the cell tower. These factors include technical characteristics of the site itself, such as the availability of a site and its location; technical characteristics of the antennae on a site, such as the direction they are facing; technical characteristics of the phone; and environmental and geographical factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">First, the technical characteristics of cell sites may affect signal strength: (1) the number of sites available; (2) maintenance or repairs being performed; (3) height of the cell tower; (4) height above sea level; (5) wattage output; and (6) range of coverage. Second, technical characteristics of the antennas on cellular sites may affect signal strength, such as the number of antennas, the angle and direction the antenna is facing, height of each antenna, and call traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>processed through each antenna. Third, technical characteristics of the phone, such as the wattage output and generation of the phone\u2019s broadband capability, may affect signal strength. Fourth, signal strength may depend upon environmental and geographical factors, including the weather, topography, and level of urban development. Finally, indoor or outdoor use of the phone may alter the strength of the signal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 6-7. <em>See also United States v. </em>Evans, 892 F.Supp.2d 949, 956 (N.D.Ill.2012) (describing the factors that could cause a phone to connect to a particular site, including the locations of buildings and high volumes of network traffic); Tapp, <em>supra, </em>at 7, 9 (\u201cA radio wave is impacted most by the physical nature of the land cover\u201d; \u201cWithout line of sight or near line of sight access to an antenna, the cellular phone will not receive a signal, regardless of its distance to the transmitter.\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">All cell phones connect to a cell tower for, <em>inter alia, </em>communication.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Daniel &amp; Daniel, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 38.2.1. \u201cCommunication\u201d occurs when a phone call is initiated, or a text message sent. <em>See </em>United Nations Global Pulse, <em>Mobile Phone Network Data for Development </em>at 1 (Oct. 2013), <em>available at </em>http://www.unglobalpulse.org/sites/default/files/ Mobile% 20Data% 20for% 20Development% 20Prim-er_Oct2013.pdf (last visited Dec. 8, 2014).

The trial judge, thus, determines whether to admit expert testimony dependent upon whether the witness could provide assistance to the finder of fact on the subject matter where a juror, lacking knowledge in a particular field, would resort to mere speculation and conjecture. <em>See </em>Rule 5-702.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">In <em>Ragland v. State, </em>385 Md. 706, 870 A.2d 609 (2005), we were confronted with a question, similar to that which we confront in the instant case, of whether police officers could render an opinion, based on their experience and without having to be qualified as experts under Rule 5-702, that certain conduct by the defendant constituted a drug transaction. In determining that the officers had to be qualified as experts, we adopted \u201cthe approach as reflected in the 2000 amendment to Fed.R.Evid. 701 and [held] that Md. Rules 5-701 and 5-702 prohibit the admission as \u2018lay opinion\u2019 of testimony based upon specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training or education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725, 870 A.2d at 620. We required the police officers in <em>Ragland </em>to be qualified as experts, because the opinions they formed regarding the nature of the defendant\u2019s actions as those of a drug transaction, were based on their \u201ctraining and experience\u201d derived from the \u201cconsiderable time [they had devoted] to the study of the drug trade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726, 870 A.2d at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">We applied <em>Ragland </em>in <em>State v. Blackwell, </em>408 Md. 677, 697, 971 A.2d 296, 307 (2009), in order to limit the State from offering \u201can expert witness in lay witness clothing.\u201d In <em>Blackwell, </em>we explored whether an officer\u2019s testimony regarding the result of a horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test he had performed on Blackwell during a traffic stop allegedly reflecting Blackwell\u2019s inebriation constituted expert testimony.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number><footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The State had asserted that the officer\u2019s testimony was not subject to Rule 5-702, because the officer \u201cdid not expressly provide an opinion as to Blackwell\u2019s state of intoxication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 971 A.2d at 305 (internal quotation marks omitted). We observed, however, that the HGN test differs from other field sobriety tests with which a person could \u201crely upon his or her personal experience\u201d, because \u201ctestimony [about HGN] has no significance to the average juror without an additional explanation of the scientific correlation between alcohol consumption and nystagmus\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 692, 971 A.2d at 304. In so doing, we opined that Rule 5-702 encompasses testimony regarding \u201cmore than just \u2018opinions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 971 A.2d at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In the present case the State asserts that <em>Ragland </em>and <em>Blackwell </em>are distinguishable from the present case because Detective Edwards did not render an opinion as to the location of Payne\u2019s and Bond\u2019s cell phones and that he merely read Sprint Nextel\u2019s business records and followed its directions in interpreting the data. We disagree. Detective Edwards engaged in a process to derive his conclusion that Payne\u2019s and Bond\u2019s cell phones communicated through the Menlo Park and Balmoral Towers cell towers that was beyond the ken of an average person; his conclusions regarding the communication path also required that he be qualified as an expert witness. Although the State urges that a \u201clayperson with the same phone records and instructions could have determined the location of the cell sites\u201d (even aside from the fact that the jury never received the full records and that the \u201cstep-by-step\u201d instructions were developed from another source), additional training and experience were required to parlay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>process from which Detective Edwards derived the communication path of each call.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">A Call Detail Record contains a string of data unfamiliar to a layperson and is not decipherable based on \u201cpersonal experience\u201d. <em>See Blackwell, </em>408 Md. at 692, 971 A.2d at 304. Detective Edwards, however, apparently relied on his experience to hone in on the entries in the Call Detail Records \u201cpertinent\u201d to the case. To understand, furthermore, the technical language of the entries in a Call Detail Record so that he could eliminate \u201cextraneous\u201d data in the records, Detective Edwards had to have relied on \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training or education.\u201d <em>See Ragland, </em>385 Md. at 725, 870 A.2d at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Once Detective Edwards had culled the records, he further relied on his knowledge and experience to understand the significance of a \u201cLAC ID\u201d and \u201cCell ID\u201d and how they related to identifying a particular cell tower amongst a cellular provider\u2019s records. Detective Edwards\u2019s testimony was that of an expert, because Call Detail Record entries are not entries typical of a cell phone bill where a juror could \u201crely upon his or her personal experience\u201d to understand their meaning. <em>Blackwell, </em>408 Md. at 692, 971 A.2d at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Detective Edwards needed to be qualified as an expert in order to also opine regarding the Menlo Drive and Balmoral Towers cell towers. Using the data he derived from his experience and expertise, Detective Edwards urged that he had determined the location of the cell towers through which Payne\u2019s and Bond\u2019s cell phone connected on the night of the murder and their location relative to the crime scene, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>only an expert could derive, based upon the fact that a cell phone may connect to several towers during a call which may not be recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We draw sustenance for our requirement of expert testimony in the instant case from <em>United States v. Ganier, </em>468 F.3d 920, 925 (6th Cir.2006), in which the United States Court of Appeals explored whether a witness who testified regarding the results obtained by \u201crunning commereially-available software\u201d to examine files on a computer was required to be qualified as an expert under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. The Government had urged that the witness\u2019s testimony was not based on \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\u201d, because he was merely reading the results provided by running the software, and the testimony was of the same types of facts \u201cthat could be observed by any person reasonably proficient in the use of commonly used computer software\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 925-26. The Sixth Circuit rejected the Government\u2019s argument and held that reading the results produced by running the program required expertise, explaining that a \u201clayperson today may be able to interpret the outputs of popular software programs\u201d, but the \u201creports generated by the forensic software display a heading, a string of words and symbols, date and time, and a list of words\u201d which would have been unfamiliar to a lay witness without specialized knowledge and experience. <em>Id. </em>at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">As a result of our determination that Detective Edwards was obligated to have been qualified as an expert, a retrial will be required, as the Court of Special Appeals concluded as well. Should the State choose to pursue the case against Payne and the trial judge does not sever Payne\u2019s case from Bond\u2019s, the issue may again arise regarding the admissibility of six wiretapped telephone conversations captured on the Baltimore County police wiretap, in which Payne was not recorded as a participant. Payne has raised the issue of the admissibility of the calls in his cross-petition in which he asks, \u201cDid the Court of Special Appeals err in ruling that wiretap statements made by respondent Bond but not respondent Payne were neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>less admissible against Payne as statements by a party-opponent?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">The facts pertinent to the wiretapped statements were that Tyrice McCant and Brittany Keller were individually confronted by police two months after Glen Stewart\u2019s murder in October and early November 2007, respectively; both told police that Payne, Bond and others were with Keller the night of the incident assisting her with car trouble, thereby providing Payne and Bond with an alibi. At trial, both women recanted their stories. Keller also testified that she discussed the need to maintain the false alibi with Bond in December 2007 in one cell phone conversation, a taped version of which was played at trial and admitted into evidence against Payne as a statement of a co-conspirator. Keller also testified about a face-to-face meeting with Payne in December 2007; in her testimony, she said: \u201cAs far as Joey was concerned, I spoke with him about what was said by Jason, but I didn\u2019t know what he was going to do as far as the police were concerned.\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Desmond Jones, an indicted co-conspirator who had pled guilty prior to trial, also testified at trial, during which five calls between Bond and Jones were played for the jury and also admitted into evidence against Payne as statements of co-conspirators. With respect to the six recorded telephone conversations, the State, in its brief, identified them as occurring within three hours of one another on December 12, 2007, after detectives had questioned Bond regarding the night of the crime, and described the calls as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">The first five calls are between Bond and Jones. In the first call, Bond tells Jones to go somewhere private so they can talk. In the second call, Bond relates that the \u201csuits\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>just left and he warns Jones to \u201clook out for them.\u201d Bond adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\">You already know, yo that niggars are just smoking &amp; drinkin, yo, all you really know, niggars left to get some gas one time, but other than that, all you really know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In the third call, Jones says \u201cthe Feds are on us Jay\u201d because the \u201cArmed Feds\u201d had been there. In the fourth call, Jones tells Bond that \u201cthey\u201d said they \u201cjust had enough time to catch up\u201d with him (Jones) and they asked to \u201ccatch up with [him] another time[.]\u201d Jones says that he asked for a number to call. Bond says: \u201cFor real for real if you don\u2019t remember what to say then don\u2019t call nobody yet\u201d and explains that he told the detectives the same thing \u201cWoody [Tyrise McCant] and Brittany [Brittany Keller]\u201d told them. In the fifth call, Bond asks if Jones has Brittany\u2019s number or anyone else\u2019s number. Jones says he has Brittany\u2019s number.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">In the sixth call, Bond calls Keller, who says she\u2019s on her way to Payne\u2019s house. The transcript of the conversation is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">[BOND]: Alright that\u2019s whats up, alright [inaudible] when, ah, when, you want to talk cause the D\u2019s[<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>] came to talk to me today.

The State argued to the trial court that Keller\u2019s face-to-face conversation with Payne on December 12, 2007, proved Payne\u2019s participation in the conspiracy to conceal. Months prior to trial, the State had proffered that DNR Reports reflecting a number of telephone calls between Payne, McCant, Keller, Bond, Johnson and Jones also linked the individuals together in a conspiracy to conceal.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Payne argued before the trial court that he was not a part of any conspiracy to conceal, that he was not a participant in any of the six calls and that the statements made during the calls were inadmissible hearsay. According to Payne, the State just did not prove that he was a part of any conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Before the phone call between Bond and Keller was played at trial, the trial judge specifically questioned how it was admissible against Payne and ultimately decided that \u201call the players knew that\u201d a false alibi had been offered to police, which was \u201cthe genesis of conspiracy.\u201d In so ruling, the judge referred to Keller\u2019s testimony regarding her face-to-face meeting with Payne as sufficient to provide the foundation for a conspiracy to allow the six statements to come in as to Payne:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>THE COURT: * * * Seems to me on all the evidence before me that the players all knew that that was the story, and that is the genesis of conspiracy. She talked to them directly by phone with one; she talked to that other person face-to-face. I think that is sufficient foundation to allow the statements to come in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">During Jones\u2019s testimony, the trial judge indicated, based upon her prior ruling as to the admissibility of the Bond and Keller call, that she thought there was an adequate foundation to admit the five calls between Bond and Jones against Payne and Bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Before the Court of Special Appeals, the State again relied on Keller\u2019s testimony about her face-to-face meeting with Payne as sufficient proof of a conspiracy to conceal; the State also argued that \u201cefforts to burn the victim\u2019s body\u201d was additional proof of a conspiracy to conceal.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The Court of Special Appeals disagreed with the trial court and denied the admissibility of the statements against Payne or Bond as statements of co-conspirators under Rule 5-803(a)(5), because there was no evidence of a conspiracy to conceal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">There is no evidence in this case that there was an express agreement between the parties, <em>at the outset, </em>to engage in concerted acts of concealment after committing the kidnapping and murder. The chief objective of appellants in committing the substantive offenses of kidnapping and murder was to punish and/or retaliate against [the victim] because they suspected him of reporting the robbery of [another] to police. Because the recordings admitted into evidence were neither hearsay statements of an agreement entered into <em>at the outset of the substantive criminal event </em>nor an express agreement to conceal <em>in furtherance of attaining the chief objective, i.e., to silence </em>[the victim], the hearsay statements are inadmissible to establish an express conspiracy of concealment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-9\"><em>Payne &amp; Bond, </em>211 Md.App. at 250, 65 A.3d at 171-72. The Court of Special Appeals seemingly stated, however, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>telephone calls were admissible as statements of party opponents under Rule 5-803(a)(l)<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> as to Payne, although the State before us questioned that the paragraph in the Court of Special Appeals opinion so held; the paragraph stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">Here, we have no difficulty concluding that Bond\u2019s statements in the wiretaps were admissible against him as statements by a party opponent. If there is any problematic issue, that concerns whether those statements were also admissible against Payne. The only recording involving Payne is the last one between him and Keller. In that recording, Keller informs Payne that \u201cJason just called me and they came to see him so umm I don\u2019t know if you ... inaudible ... me to tell you when I get there or what\u2019s up,\u201d to which Payne replied, \u201cokay, just tell me when you get here.\u201d Keller testified at trial that, following this phone conversation, she went and saw Payne directly. At that time, she told Payne about her conversation earlier that day with Bond, inferentially referring to the conversation about maintaining the false alibi in the face of further police investigation. We are persuaded the statements were admissible as to each party. We also note that, during jury instructions, the trial court instructed the jury that it was to \u201cconsider the evidence as it relate[s] to each defendant separately and you must consider separately each offense charged against each defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\"><em>Payne &amp; Bond, </em>211 Md.App. at 252, 65 A.3d at 172-73. Later in the opinion, however, our intermediate appellate court stated, \u201cAccordingly, we are persuaded that the wiretap recordings were admissible as to both Payne and Bond as statements of a party opponent. The trial court properly exercised its discretion in admitting them, albeit on grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>different than argued by the parties at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253-54, 65 A.3d at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">The State, nevertheless, urges before us that, \u201c[t]he Court of Special Appeals did not hold that Bond\u2019s statements were admissible against Payne; it held that Bond\u2019s statements were admissible against him as statements of a party-opponent.\u201d The State also argues that <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968) is not violated because the telephone conversations did not implicate \u201cPayne as an accomplice to the kidnapping and murder of Stewart\u201d. Finally, the State argues that the introduction of the recordings of the six telephone calls against Payne was harmless error, because \u201cthere was a plethora of other evidence.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Before us, Payne disputes that the party opponent rule, Rule 5\u2014803(a)(1), applies and permits the admission of the six telephone calls because Bond was not his party opponent; he unequivocally questions the evidentiary foundation for the admission of the six recordings at all. The error in the admission of the recordings is not harmless, he states, because there is no evidence that he was a part of any conspiracy to conceal.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The party opponent rule, Rule 5-803(a)(l), provides that, \u201cA statement that is offered against a party and is ... [t]he party\u2019s own statement, in either an individual or representative capacity\u201d is \u201cnot excluded by the hearsay rule\u201d. We have a dearth of authority in Maryland interpreting who a party opponent is, so we turn to our federal counterparts for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Federal Rule 801(d)(2)(A),<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> adopted in 1975, is on all fours with our Rule 5-803(a)(l). In interpreting who is a party opponent in the context of a criminal case in which there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>multiple defendants, the Second and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals have decried that a co-defendant cannot be a party opponent; only the Government is. In <em>United States v. Harwood, </em>998 F.2d 91, 94 (2d Cir.1993), Harwood and McKee were jointly tried. McKee had made statements to a journalist about Harwood\u2019s involvement, which Harwood tried to introduce at trial as exculpatory, and on appeal, argued that the statements were admissions by a party opponent under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(A). The trial court rejected the evidence, and the Second Circuit affirmed, \u201cbecause the admission sought to be introduced was made by a co-defendant who is not a party opponent. The Government is the party opponent of both defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97-98, quoting <em>United States v. Gossett, </em>877 F.2d 901, 906 (11th Cir.1989) <em>(per </em>curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1141, 107 L.Ed.2d 1045 (1990). In the instant case, Payne and Bond were tried together, and the State is the opponent of both; neither of them was the party-opponent of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Whether the six telephone calls can be properly admitted against Payne as statements of a co-conspirator under Rule 5-803(a)(5) with regard to a conspiracy to conceal depends upon the State having advanced a prima facie case that a conspiracy to conceal existed and, secondly, Payne\u2019s agreement to the conspiracy. Rule 5-803(a)(5) states that \u201ca statement by a coconspirator ... during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy ...\u201d is \u201cnot excluded by the hearsay rule\u201d. The Court of Special Appeals determined that no conspiracy to conceal existed, so that Rule 5-803(a)(5) was not implicated as to Payne and Bond, opining that there was an absence of proof of \u201can express agreement between the parties, at the outset, to engage in concerted acts of concealment after committing the kidnapping and murder\u201d, <em>(Payne &amp; Bond, </em>211 Md.App. at 250, 65 A.3d at 171), and further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAHQ\">Because the recordings admitted into evidence were neither hearsay statements of an agreement entered into at the outset of the substantive criminal event nor an express agreement to conceal in furtherance of attaining the chief objective, i.e., to silence Stewart, the hearsay statements are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>inadmissible to establish an express conspiracy of concealment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 250, 65 A.3d at 171-72. In so doing, our intermediate appellate court relied on the strictures of <em>State v. Rivenbark, </em>311 Md. 147, 158, 533 A.2d 271, 276 (1987), which held that the \u201cstatements made in connection with acts of concealment performed long after the conspirators have realized all benefits from the offense which they had agreed to commit\u201d are inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Although we agree with our intermediate appellate court that <em>Rivenbark </em>is controlling regarding the conspiracy to conceal, we disagree that there was not a prima facie showing of a conspiracy to conceal that could have gone to the jury,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <em>(see Hill v. State, </em>231 Md. 458, 190 A.2d 795 (1963)), though proof of Payne\u2019s participation was lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In <em>Rivenbark, </em>311 Md. at 150, 533 A.2d at 272, Ronald Johnson and Billy Rivenbark robbed and murdered Johnson\u2019s aunt. That same day, after the murder, Rivenbark told Shirley Wilson, Johnson\u2019s girlfriend, that \u201c[w]e got our alibis... . As long as everyone stays cool everything will be fine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 533 A.2d at 272. Rivenbark later told Wilson that he and Johnson \u201cshould not see each other for a while\u201d, and Johnson inflicted numerous beatings on Wilson in order to ensure her silence. <em>Id. </em>at 151, 533 A.2d at 272-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>In <em>Rivenbark, </em>we expressly considered \u201cwhether every criminal conspiracy includes, by implication, a subsidiary conspiracy to conceal evidence of the substantive offense that the conspirators agreed to commit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152-52, 533 A.2d at 273. We recognized two separate instances where a conspiracy to conceal may arise; at the outset of the underlying criminal act or after the completion of the act as a second conspiracy. In responding to the issue, we rejected \u201cthe theory that every criminal conspiracy includes, by implication, a subsidiary conspiracy to conceal evidence of the substantive offense that the conspirators agreed to commit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158, 533 A.2d at 276. We recognized, however, that \u201cif the conspirators expressly agree at the outset to engage in concerted acts of concealment after committing a substantive offense, then statements made in connection with those acts are admissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Regarding a subsequent conspiracy, we explained in <em>Rivenbark </em>that the evidence did not show an ongoing distinct and explicit agreement to conceal the underlying offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">In this case, neither conspirator distinctly or explicitly communicated to the other his assent to the \u201cagreement.\u201d Rivenbark\u2019s statement to Wilson that he and Johnson should not see one another for a while, and the beatings Johnson inflicted on Wilson, are unilateral acts that in no way indicate the presence of an agreement. While Riven-bark\u2019s statement that \u201cWe got our alibis,\u201d and Johnson\u2019s compliance with Rivenbark\u2019s order to \u201cmake sure the stuff was gone,\u201d may suggest an obvious understanding to conceal the crime soon after it happened, this evidence does not show an ongoing distinct and explicit agreement to conceal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 159, 533 A.2d at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Agreement is the essence of a conspiracy, as we opined in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>367 Md. 418, 424, 788 A.2d 628, 632 (2002), in which we further stated that, \u201cThis Court consistently has defined conspiracy as the agreement between two or more people to achieve some unlawful purpose or to employ unlawful means in achieving a lawful purpose.\u201d We have summarized the elements of a criminal conspiracy to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>The essence of a criminal conspiracy is an unlawful agreement. The agreement need not be formal or spoken, provided there is a meeting of the minds reflecting a unity of purpose and design. In Maryland, the crime is complete when the unlawful agreement is reached, and no overt act in furtherance of the agreement need be shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><em>Townes v. State, </em>314 Md. 71, 75, 548 A.2d 832, 834 (1988). <em>See Mason v. State, </em>302 Md. 434, 444, 488 A.2d 955, 960 (1985) (stating that the \u201cagreement is the crime, and the crime is complete without any overt act\u201d); <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 221, 582 A.2d 525, 528 (1990) (\u201cThe gist of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement.... The crime is complete when the unlawful agreement is made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">As to Payne, the State did not prove that he agreed to participate in a conspiracy to conceal, either from the beginning or subsequent to the murder. Although the trial court relied exclusively on Keller\u2019s testimony about her face-to-face meeting with Payne to establish that he agreed with the conspiracy to conceal, in which she said, \u201cAs far as Joey was concerned, I spoke with him about what was said by Jason, but I didn\u2019t know what he was going to do as far as police were concerned\u201d, Keller related no response from Payne reflecting that he had agreed to participate in an agreement to conceal.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In an attempt to augment what the trial court relied upon to determine that Payne was part of a conspiracy to conceal, the State before us refers to the DNR reports showing telephone calls, without corresponding content, that occurred between Payne, Keller, McCant, Bond, Jones and Johnson during the time that McCant and Keller were interrogated by police. In addition to the fact that the trial court did not rely on these to admit the calls, the DNRs do not provide additional proof that Payne expressly agreed to a conspiracy to conceal. The DNRs only provide a list of phone numbers dialed from specific phones, without any proof of who dialed the numbers, let alone any content from the calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>The State\u2019s final allegation is that Jones\u2019s testimony about the burning of the victim\u2019s body shows that Payne conspired to conceal, although this also was not relied upon by the trial court in the admission of the statements. Jones\u2019s testimony, however, does not reflect that Payne was a party in a conspiracy to conceal.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Should the State pursue a joint trial of Payne and Bond and wish to introduce as evidence the six wiretapped recordings against Bond, there are further inquiries that the Circuit Court must make.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The State asserts that the six recordings were non-testimonial and, therefore, could be played during a joint trial of Payne and Bond and introduced into evidence only against Bond, without violating the tenets of <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). Payne disagrees, asserting that, under <em>Bruton, </em>his trial should be severed from Bond, because he cannot adequately defend himself under the Confrontation Clause should the recordings be played. We agree, however, with the State as to the <em>Bruton </em>issue, because the six wiretapped conversations are non-testimonial in character under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and so do not implicate Payne\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\"><em>Crawford </em>defines the analysis for determining whether the admission of a hearsay statement violates an accused\u2019s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <em>Crawford, </em>541 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203. <em>See Cox v. State, </em>421 Md. 630, 642, 28 A.3d 687, 694 (2011) (noting that \u201cwe analyze the admission of out-of-court statements against criminal defendants under the framework created by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>\u201d). The Confrontation Clause analysis is triggered when hearsay, sought to be introduced, is \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203. <em>See Cooper v. State, </em>434 Md. 209, 233, 73 A.3d 1108, 1122 (2013) (\u201c[T]he right of confrontation is implicated only when two conditions are met: the challenged out-of-court statement or evidence must be presented for its truth and the challenged out-of-court statement or evidence must be \u2018testimonial.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">While the <em>Crawford </em>Court did not provide a comprehensive definition of the word \u201ctestimonial\u201d, it did provide several specific examples of such evidence. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 181 (listing \u201cprior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial\u201d and \u201cpolice interrogations\u201d). We have held that the proper inquiry to determine whether a statement is testimonial is \u201cwhether a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s situation would have made the statement \u2018with a primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cox, </em>421 Md. at 650, 28 A.3d at 698, quoting <em>Michigan v. Bryant, </em>562 U.S. 344,-, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 1155, 179 L.Ed.2d 93, 107 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">In <em>Cox, </em>we considered whether statements implicating Cox, made by a coconspirator to a jailhouse acquaintance cooperating with the authorities, were testimonial and could be intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>duced against Cox through the testimony of the jailhouse cooperator. When we considered whether the inmate\u2019s testimony violated Cox\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights, we held that the \u201cspontaneous\u201d statements implicating Cox made by the coconspirator during the jailhouse discussion were non-testimonial, because \u201cthe interaction was casual conversation between private acquaintances\u201d and the statements \u201cwere not made for the primary purpose of creating a substitute for trial testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650-51, 28 A.3d at 699. As a result, we affirmed Cox\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">As in <em>Cox, </em>the six wiretapped recordings in the present case were \u201cmore akin to casual remarks to an acquaintance than formal declarations to an official\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 650, 28 A.3d at 699, and, thus, were non-testimonial under <em>Crawford. </em>Various of our brethren in the federal system, when faced with wiretap evidence, have also recognized that the conversations are not testimonial. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>479 F.3d 1229, 1249 (10th Cir.2007) (holding statements of co-conspirators procured through a wiretap are non-testimonial); <em>United States v. Hendricks, </em>395 F.3d 173, 181 (3d Cir.2005) (holding that surreptitiously monitored private conversations and statements contained in wiretap recordings are not testimonial for purposes of <em>Crawford, </em>because, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe speakers certainly did not make the statements thinking that they \u2018would be available for use at a later trial\u2019 \u201d, quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Because <em>Crawford </em>is not implicated by the six recordings, Payne\u2019s <em>Bruton </em>rights are not triggered. <em>Bruton </em>rights are triggered when testimonial hearsay is introduced into evidence. In <em>Bruton, </em>the Supreme Court addressed \u201cwhether the conviction of a defendant at a joint trial should be set aside although the jury was instructed that a codefendant\u2019s confession inculpating the defendant had to be disregarded in determining his guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 124-25, 88 S.Ct. at 1622, 20 L.Ed.2d at 478. During Bruton\u2019s joint trial with Evans, Evans\u2019s out of court confession inculpating both defendants had been admitted into evidence. The trial judge had given a limiting instruction to the jury to consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>confession only against Evans, but not against Bruton. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>375 F.2d 355 (8th Cir.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The Supreme Court reversed. The Court held that the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction did not sufficiently protect Bruton\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights, because Evans had not testified, the introduction of Evans\u2019s confession added substantial weight to the Government\u2019s case against Bruton, and Bruton could not cross-examine Evans. <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 137, 88 S.Ct. at 1628, 20 L.Ed.2d at 485. The Court opined that a limiting instruction was insufficient to protect Bruton\u2019s right to cross-examine and that there was no basis upon which to admit Evans\u2019s confession against Bruton. When \u201cthe powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial\u201d, the Court concluded, \u201climiting instructions [were not acceptable] as an adequate substitute for [Bruton\u2019s] constitutional right of cross examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135-36, 137, 88 S.Ct. at 1628, 20 L.Ed.2d at 483, 484. <em>Bruton, </em>then, is premised upon the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment and limits joinder, as well as the efficacy of cautionary instructions when evidence of a testimonial nature is introduced. <em>See United States v. Avila Vargas, </em>570 F.3d 1004, 1008-09 (8th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Bruton </em>does not apply to non-testimonial co-conspirator statements); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>581 F.3d 320, 326 (6th Cir.2009) (opining that \u201cBecause it is premised on the Confrontation Clause, the <em>Bruton </em>rule, like the Confrontation Clause itself, does not apply to nontestimonial statements\u201d); <em>United States v. Smalls, </em>605 F.3d 765, 768 n. 2 (10th Cir.2010) (noting that \u201cthe <em>Bruton </em>rule, like the Confrontation Clause upon which it is premised, does not apply to nontestimonial hearsay statements\u201d); <em>United States v. Figueroa-Cartagena, </em>612 F.3d 69, 85 (1st Cir.2010) (noting that it is \u201cnecessary to view <em>Bruton </em>through the lens of <em>Crawford </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">As a result, because the six wiretapped recordings in this case are non-testimonial, their admission in a joint trial does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>not implicate Payne\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights under <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Bruton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The trial court, nevertheless, must consider whether joinder or a cautionary instruction will sufficiently avoid prejudice to Payne under the tenets of Maryland Rule 4-253(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">Prejudicial joinder. If it appears that any party will be prejudiced by the joinder for trial of counts, charging documents, or defendants, the court may, on its own initiative or on motion of any party, order separate trials of counts, charging documents, or defendants, or grant any other relief as justice requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Because we have stated that Payne was not a party to a conspiracy to conceal and not a party-opponent of Bond, the six telephone recordings are not admissible against Payne under a hearsay exception. We acknowledged in <em>Galloway v. State </em>that \u201c[prejudice within the meaning of Rule 4-253 is a \u2018term of art\u2019 and refers only to prejudice resulting to the defendant from the reception of evidence that would have been inadmissible against that defendant had there been no joinder.\u201d 371 Md. 379, 394 n. 11, 809 A.2d 653, 663 n. 11 (2002), quoting <em>Ogonowski v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 173, 186-87, 589 A.2d 513, 520 (1991). Therefore, the implication of Rule 4-253(c) also must be considered on remand in this case, insofar as Payne is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">In conclusion, based on our review of the intricacies of \u201ccell phone records\u201d and the training, experience and expertise required by Detective Edwards to determine the alleged cell towers with which Payne\u2019s and Bond\u2019s cell phones communicated, we conclude that Detective Edwards should have been qualified as an expert witness under Maryland Rule 5-702, and remand the cases for a new trial. As guidance in the new trial, we also conclude that Bond\u2019s statements in the six recordings obtained off of wiretaps could not be admitted against Payne as the statement of a party opponent and that, while there may have been sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie showing of a conspiracy to conceal, the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>did not support the determination that Payne was a part of that conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED.

When a judge on this Court concurs in the judgment only, it is helpful to explain why. Then the reader knows whether there is a substantive reason for that judge\u2019s reticence and can assess whether that reason has any merit. So\u2014here goes.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">The Majority holds that Detective Brian Edwards should have been qualified by the trial court as an expert under-Maryland Rule 5-702 to testify as to the process for determining the communication path of the defendants\u2019 cell phones and as to the importance of two particular cell towers. Majority op. at 684-85, 104 A.3d at 144. This holding appears based on a conclusion that Detective Edwards gave expert opinion testimony at trial. In my view, he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">At the trial, Detective Edwards essentially applied the telephone company\u2019s key to the cell phone records of the defendants and determined that their cell phones had registered off certain cell phone towers in the vicinity of the crime during its commission and cover-up. As the trial judge stated, the process that Detective Edwards used to locate the cell towers associated with particular calls on the telephone company records \u201cisn\u2019t rocket science.\u201d An analogy closer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>home may illustrate the point. A particular court may denominate a case with a designation like \u201cCiv. No. S-14-0026.\u201d One who has the key knows that this means that the particular action is a civil case (\u201cCiv.No.\u201d) assigned to Judge Smith (\u201cS\u201d) and was the 26th such case (\u201c0026\u201d) filed in the court in 2014 (\u201c14\u201d). One need not be a legal expert (\u00bfa, a lawyer) to decipher the case designation, although perhaps a lawyer would be necessary to explain accurately the claims and defenses in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Thus, in my view, Detective Edwards did not provide expert testimony and need not have been qualified as an expert to provide that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Why, then, do I concur in the judgment? In my view, there was a gap in the prosecution\u2019s proof that undermined the probative value of Detective Edwards\u2019 testimony. Information concerning the location of the cell phone towers associated with particular calls was only probative if it was evidence of where the defendants\u2014or at least their phones\u2014were located at the time of those calls. At the end of the trial the prosecutor argued that the fact that calls on the defendants\u2019 cell phones registered off cell phone towers in close proximity to the crime scenes was corroboration for the testimony that the defendants had been present and participated in those crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">But there was no testimony at trial as to the significance of the location of a cell phone tower in relation to the location of the user of the phone. In some communication technologies, the path taken by a message over the communications infrastructure may vary and the intermediate route may reveal little about the location of the sender or receiver. For example, each time one obtains a copy of this opinion over the Internet, the transmission may take a very different route to the same destination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Based on the technical discussion in the Majority opinion on cell phone technology<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and some readily available technical sources,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it appears that the inference urged by the prosecutor was likely correct. But we do not want jurors checking readily available technical resources\u2014or even judicial opinions\u2014to obtain technical information concerning the significance of the evidence before them. A properly qualified expert\u2014perhaps an electrical engineer or a communications engineer\u2014was needed. It would likely not have been the most sophisticated testimony concerning wireless communications, but it is not something that can be said to be within the common knowledge of a lay juror. Without such testimony, the jury was left to speculate\u2014perhaps reaching a correct conclusion, but still speculating\u2014as to the significance of the cell towers\u2019 location.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In the absence of expert testimony that would allow the jury to understand the significance of the towers\u2019 location, the testimony concerning the location of the cell towers was not admissible under Maryland Rules 5^02 (only relevant evidence admissible) and 5-403 (even relevant evidence may be excluded if relevance is outweighed by confusion).</p>\n<judges id=\"b757-6\">Chief Judge BARBERA and Judge HARRELL have advised that they join this opinion.</judges>\n<p id=\"b758-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>APPENDIX B</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>APPENDIX C</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">APPENDIX C\u2014Continued</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">Most people see the cell as the [solid-lined] hexagon, being defined by the tower in the center, with the antennae pointing in the directions indicated by the arrows.
