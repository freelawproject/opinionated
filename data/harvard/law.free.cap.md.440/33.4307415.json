Agent Peele testified that a bullet fragment found in Kulbicki\u2019s truck and a bullet found inside the victim were \u201cwhat you\u2019d expect if you were examining two pieces of the same bullet,\u201d and moreover, that a bullet recovered from a handgun found in Kulbicki\u2019s home \u201ccould have been in the same box\u201d as the bullet taken from the victim, relying on Comparative Bullet Lead Analysis (\u201cCBLA\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We determined, however, in 2006 that under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>Frye-Reed </em>standard,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> CBLA evidence was not generally accepted by the scientific community. <em>Clemons v. State, </em>392 Md. 339, 896 A.2d 1059 (2006). One of the major flaws of CBLA, we observed in <em>Clemons, </em>was that it had been predicated on the assumption that each source of lead from which bullets were derived was unique, allowing bullets that come from different batches to be distinguished from one another, an assumption that we determined to be questionable; \u201cThe assumption that each molten lead source is unique is also being questioned by analytical chemists and metallurgists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369, 896 A.2d at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Kulbicki was convicted before <em>Clemons </em>was decided. Nevertheless, within a few years of his conviction, he sought post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>conviction relief under the Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> arguing not only that the admission of \u201cunreliable\u201d CBLA evidence was a due process violation, but that his attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to adequately cross-examine Agent Peele.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Circuit Court Judge denied relief, opining with respect to Kulbicki\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim that \u201cquestions concerning the reliability of that science didn\u2019t even surface until long after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial\u201d, and therefore, Kulbicki\u2019s attorneys could not be faulted for not challenging the CBLA evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">With CBLA, ineffective assistance is not a legitimate argument. The questions concerning the reliability of that science didn\u2019t even surface until long after Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial. The reputation for reliability of the FBI laboratories, which performed the analysis in this case, was well known and there is no evidence in this record to demonstrate they could have been effectively challenged at trial. And the undisputed evidence was that no private laboratories routinely performed this service at that time. Thus counsel was faced with the unquestioned expert in this field, which was generally accepted as competent evidence at the time of trial. That expert was appropriately cross-examined. Counsel cannot reasonably be faulted concerning their approach to CBLA evidence at the time of trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in a reported opinion, without addressing Kulbicki\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim as it related to Kulbicki\u2019s attorneys\u2019 exploration of CBLA evidence. <em>Kulbicki v. State, </em>207 Md.App. 412, 450-53, 53 A.3d 361, 383-85 (2012). We granted certiorari to consider the following questions, which we have renumbered:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">1. Does the failure of defense counsel to investigate or challenge the State\u2019s scientific evidence and failure to object to improper closing arguments suggesting guilt constitute ineffective assistance of counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">2. Does a conviction obtained through the use of scientific evidence that is later demonstrated to be unreliable, misleading, and inadmissible violate a defendant\u2019s guarantee of due process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">3. Does the use of perjured expert testimony by a State expert violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights when the perjured testimony involves the expert\u2019s qualifications and background?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>Kulbicki v. State, </em>430 Md. 344, 61 A.3d 18 (2013). We also granted the State\u2019s conditional cross-petition to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err in stating that the State is chargeable with the \u201cknowing use of perjured testimony\u201d where the falsity is unknown at the time of the testimony?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Kulbicki did not argue that his attorneys were ineffective for failing to challenge the State\u2019s CBLA evidence before the Court of Special Appeals and the intermediate appellate court did not address the issue. Ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to the CBLA evidence, moreover, was not addressed in Kulbicki\u2019s brief before us; during oral argument, however, after the State argued that the admission of CBLA evidence was not a due process violation because Kulbicki\u2019s attorneys should have been able to test the flawed assumptions upon which CBLA was based at trial, questions were raised by the Court regarding ineffectiveness of counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">We shall hold that Kulbicki\u2019s attorneys rendered ineffective assistance when they failed to investigate and cross-examine the State\u2019s CBLA expert, Agent Ernest Peele, based upon a report he co-authored in 1991, which presaged the flaws in CBLA evidence, and therefore, will reverse Kulbicki\u2019s conviction and order a new trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The present case began when, during the course of a homicide investigation by the Baltimore County Police Department, a bullet was recovered from the victim\u2019s body. Thereafter, two bullet fragments were recovered from Kulbicki\u2019s vehicle in addition to six bullets taken from a handgun found in Kulbicki\u2019s home. The bullets were then analyzed by the FBI laboratory and the results were interpreted by Agent Ernest Peele, who testified for the State at Kulbicki\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Agent Peele testified that the CBLA process permitted him to analyze the chemical composition<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of the lead contained within bullets and, using the chemical composition numbers, determine if the composition in the bullets were the same or substantially similar to each other. Based on the compositional similarities of the bullets he tested, Agent Peele drew a number of conclusions that purported to connect Kulbicki to the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Agent Peele testified, first, that a bullet fragment taken from the victim\u2019s autopsy, designated \u201cQ-l\u201d, and one of the bullet fragments taken from Kulbicki\u2019s truck, \u201cQ-2\u201d, were \u201cwhat you\u2019d expect if you were examining two pieces of the same bullet\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: [W]hat conclusion did you draw, if any, when comparing Q-l and Q-2, those two bullet fragments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">[AGENT PEELE]: Well, Q-l and Q-2 have the same amounts of each and every element that we detected. To the extent that that\u2019s what you\u2019d expect if you were examining two pieces of the same bullet, they are that close, two pieces of the same source.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Uhm, I think in looking at your report you used the term analytically indistinguishable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">[AGENT PEELE]: Yes, sir. That\u2019s a term basically meaning we can see each and every element. We can see the same quantity of each and every element in two different pieces such that if we were to drop those pieces, all of the samples from each one of, each of Q-l and Q-2 on the floor and, we would not be able to put them back into their respective sample they are that close together in composition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Agent Peele then compared Q-6, one of the bullets recovered from the handgun, and the samples taken from the victim and Kulbicki\u2019s truck, stating that, compositionally, they were \u201cextremely\u201d and \u201cunusually close\u201d so that \u201cthere\u2019s some association\u201d between the bullets:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And what conclusions, if any, did you draw in comparing the compositional analysis or the composition of Q-6 in comparison to Q-l and Q-2, which are the bullet fragments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">[AGENT PEELE]: Well, Q-6 is measurably different from Q-l and Q-2 such that in the analytical process you can physically see that not all the elements have exactly the same composition. However, Q-6 is extremely close to Q1 and Q-2. It is unusually close in that that\u2019s not what you\u2019d expect, unless there\u2019s some association between the two groups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">In other words, Q-l and Q-6, the amount of copper is slightly different and the amount of arsenic is slightly different. All the other elements are the same and, certainly, those are types of things that you wouldn\u2019t expect to occur unless there\u2019s some association, such as being made by the same manufacturer on or about the same time, that kind of association. They are close enough that I have seen those differences, even in the same larger piece but, certainly, they are also different enough that I can\u2019t really include uhm [sic] as well as I would Q-l and 2 to each other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>During re-direct, Agent Peele explained that, although it was not conclusive, the closeness in composition of the three bullets\u2014the autopsy fragment, the truck fragment, and one of the bullets found in the handgun\u2014was consistent with having originated from the same box of bullets, because in each box, he asserted, you would expect to find a number of distinct chemical compositions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: [Y]our opinion was that as to Q-6, it\u2019s that one bullet, when compared to fragments, I think your term was unusually close, extremely close in composition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">[AGENT PEELE]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: [W]ould you expect to see differences in the composition of bullets from the same box, or are all bullets from the same box exactly the same?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">[AGENT PEELE]: Certainly not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Okay. Just explain that. I think you already answered. Just explain about the bullets in a box, how they can be different and you would expect them to be different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">[AGENT PEELE]: Yes, sir. Even in one box of ammunition, a box of 50 rounds of ammunition, the bullets in that box don\u2019t all have the same composition. Normally even in one box you\u2019ll have groups. For instance, 25 of the bullets may have the same composition such that it would have the same, that group would have the same amounts of each and every element measured. Another group would have a different composition\u2014by different, something that was measurably different in one or more elements. Maybe all of the elements could be slightly different which would constitute, then, a second group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">This group, again, would have a number of bullets in it or it could have a number of bullets in it all the way from one up to\u2014if the box only had two compositions and the first one had 25, this one would then have 25, as well. But, normally, there are several compositions in a box. Around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>five. Especially in Remington ammo, there are f\u00ed-, normally five compositions even in one box, and those compositions differ from each other by varying amounts. The differences that I see, even in one box, certainly are no more than the differences that I see right here. So all these bullets at one time could have been in the same box. I\u2019m not saying they were because they are different. And those differences may have been in the box; they may not have been but, certainly, these differences are not too great that all of them could not have been in the same box at one time\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Kulbicki\u2019s defense counsel cross-examined Agent Peele regarding the analysis that he performed in the case, which had been documented in a report provided to them pretrial. Using the report, counsel questioned Agent Peele, primarily, regarding his conclusions related to the similarities in chemical composition amongst the varying samples. Based upon a number of questions posed by defense counsel, Agent Peele testified that, in his report, he had \u201cgrouped\u201d the bullets based on the similarity of their composition, and placed four of the bullets taken from Kulbicki\u2019s handgun, Q-5 through Q-8, in a separate \u201cgrouping\u201d than the bullet found in the victim, indicating that there were differences in their compositions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3k\">[COUNSEL FOR KULBICKI]: Okay. Now, you\u2019ve testified on the second, on Page Two of your report, you have two groups listed within Group I and Group II, correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">[AGENT PEELE]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">[COUNSEL FOR KULBICKI]: And Group I you list that Q-l and Q-2 essentially have the same compositional components.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">[AGENT PEELE]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">[COUNSEL FOR KULBICKI]: Okay. You\u2019ve testified that Q-6 could be similar, but it\u2019s measurably different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">[AGENT PEELE]: Q-6 has very similar composition, has a very similar overall composition with slight differences in two of the elements, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR KULBICKI]: But you didn\u2019t list that in your report under Group I?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">[AGENT PEELE]: No, sir, I did not. I included only those that were exact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">[COUNSEL FOR KULBICKI]: And as far as specimens Q-5, Q-6, Q-7 and Q-8, you determined that they belonged in neither group?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">[AGENT PEELE]: Correct. They are all, they all have differences from what appears in Groups I and, II.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">[COUNSEL FOR KULBICKI]: Okay. The differences were so great that they could not be linked to either group, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">[AGENT PEELE]: The differences were enough so that they were not put in any group, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">During closing argument and rebuttal, the State seized on the CBLA testimony to argue that Kulbicki\u2019s truck was the scene of the murder, and moreover, that Kulbicki\u2019s handgun was the murder weapon. Specifically, the State argued that the \u201ctwo bullet fragments, the one from [the victim\u2019s] head, the one in the Defendant\u2019s truck, are the same.... You can\u2019t tell one from the other.\u201d Likewise, the State argued to the jury that the bullet found in Kulbicki\u2019s handgun was compositionally the same as the bullet found inside of the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApM\">Even more interesting is Agent Peele\u2019s examination of the bullets that he found inside that gun. Remember when he was talking about that Q-6, the Q-6 bullet and he said, I examined that compositionally. That Q-6 bullet is very nearly identical to the two bullet fragments, the one come coming from [the victim\u2019s] head and the one coming from the autopsy. Very close in composition in parts per million. Not exact. He did not say it was exactly identical; he said it was very nearly close when he broke it down into parts per million. Now, think about this. Out of all the billions of bullets in this world, is this just a coincidence that that bullet ends up in the Defendant\u2019s off-duty weapon? Is, is that just a coincidence? I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>(emphasis added). During closing argument, on behalf of Kulbicki, however, counsel never seriously challenged the State\u2019s arguments regarding the CBLA evidence, aside from asserting that none of the compositional numbers \u201cmatch up too closely\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">[W]hat we did was, when Agent Peele was testifying and we looked at his notes, you\u2019ll see the different calculations. And, no, none of uhm [sic] match up too closely. I\u2019m not an expert on bullets but, as you\u2019ll see, there\u2019s all different sorts of numbers on there. All different sorts of numbers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The State\u2019s CBLA evidence, therefore, was central to the State\u2019s case. Defense counsel sought to undermine Agent Peele\u2019s conclusions by questioning the compositional similarities or lack thereof among the various bullet fragments, but failed to explore, in any way, one of the fundamental assumptions of CBLA, which is that compositional sameness established an association among the bullets that were tested. Is this lapse significant for purposes of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Claims for ineffective assistance of counsel are evaluated under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Strickland, v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under <em>Strickland, </em>our analysis is twofold: we must decide whether counsel rendered constitutionally deficient performance and whether such deficient performance prejudiced the defendant\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693. In discerning whether performance was deficient, we start with the presumption that counsel \u201crendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment\u201d and our review of counsel\u2019s performance is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>Bowers v. State, </em>320 Md. 416, 421, 578 A.2d 734, 736 (1990); <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694. Applying this framework, we look to whether counsel\u2019s \u201crepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Harris v. State, </em>303 Md. 685, 697, 496 A.2d 1074, 1080 (1985). We assess reasonableness, moreover, at \u201cthe time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Evaluating the reasonableness of an attorney\u2019s conduct \u201cspawns few hard-edged rules\u201d, <em>State v. Borchardt, </em>396 Md. 586, 604, 914 A.2d 1126, 1136 (2007), but a number of principles have emerged that are relevant to the matter before us. In the course of representing a client, an attorney must make decisions on the basis of adequate investigation and preparation. <em>See Coleman v. State, </em>434 Md. 320, 338, 75 A.3d 916, 927 (2013). This obligation extends with equal force to forensic evidence; \u201c[f]ailure to investigate the forensic evidence is not what a competent lawyer would do.\u201d <em>Bowers, </em>320 Md. at 434, 578 A.2d at 743. We have also recognized that the failure to conduct an adequate cross-examination may be a basis for finding deficient performance under <em>Strickland. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has specifically recognized that the failure to properly investigate forensic methodology and adequately cross-examine a State\u2019s forensic expert may be a basis for deficient performance. In <em>Driscoll v. Delo, </em>71 F.3d 701, 704 (8th Cir.1995), Driscoll was charged with the murder of a corrections officer that occurred during a prison riot. The State argued that the murder had been committed with the use of a homemade knife that Driscoll had constructed while he was incarcerated. <em>Id. </em>at 707. At trial, the State presented the testimony of Dr. Su, the Chief Forensic Serologist with the Missouri Highway Patrol Crime Laboratory, whose report indicated that pursuant to a blood-identification test called the \u201cthread\u201d test, the victim\u2019s blood-type, type O, was not found on the knife; Dr. Su testified, however, that the lack of the victim\u2019s blood could be attributed to the presence of type-A blood from another victim, which, she argued, could have \u201cmasked\u201d the presence of the type O blood. <em>Id. </em>at 707. Defense counsel never questioned Dr. Su about whether she had performed any other blood-identification tests on the knife. <em>Id. </em>It was discovered during the post-conviction proceedings that Dr. Su had in fact performed another test, the \u201clattes\u201d test, which, unlike the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>thread test, prevented masking from occurring. <em>Id. </em>at 707-08. The results of the lattes test revealed that there was no type 0 blood on Driscoll\u2019s knife, but the existence of the lattes\u2019 result was not brought out in cross-examination, so that the jury was left with the impression that Driscoll\u2019s \u201cknife likely had been exposed to both type A and type 0 blood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">On appeal, the Eighth Circuit considered the issue of \u201cwhether defense counsel\u2019s performance in failing to investigate and to adequately cross-examine Dr. Su about the serology tests performed on the state\u2019s evidence fell below an objectively reasonable standard of representation\u201d and concluded that it had. <em>Id. </em>The court opined that Dr. Su\u2019s report should have alerted counsel to the \u201cpossibility of conclusively detecting both A and O on the same item of evidence\u201d, because the report indicated that both types of blood were found on the victim\u2019s boots. <em>Id. </em>at 709 (emphasis omitted). Given the serious charges that Driscoll faced as well as the significance to the State of proving that the victim\u2019s blood appeared on the alleged murder weapon, counsel\u2019s failure \u201cto prepare for the introduction of the serology evidence, to subject the state\u2019s theories to the rigors of adversarial testing, and to prevent the jury from retiring with an inaccurate impression that the victim\u2019s blood might have been present on the defendant\u2019s knife\u201d fell \u201cshort of reasonableness under the prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The failure, then, to appropriately investigate the State\u2019s forensic evidence and challenge the State\u2019s expert on cross-examination regarding a scientific method used to implicate the defendant may be a predicate upon which a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel may prevail. The Circuit Court Judge in the instant case, however, cognizant of the principle that counsels\u2019 performance must be assessed at the time of Kulbicki\u2019s trial, concluded that, \u201c[w]ith CBLA, ineffective assistance is not a legitimate argument\u201d, because, she reasoned, \u201cquestions concerning the reliability of that science didn\u2019t even surface until long after Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>In 1991, four years prior to Kulbicki\u2019s trial, Agent Peele and a number of his colleagues published a report which presaged the very flaw that ultimately lead us to conclude in <em>Clemons </em>that CBLA evidence was invalid and unreliable\u2014the faulty assumption that bullets produced from different sources of lead would have a unique chemical composition. <em>See </em>Ernest R. Peele et al., <em>Comparison of Bullets Using the Elemental Composition of the Lead Component </em>in <em>Proceedings of the International Symposium on the Forensic Aspects of Trace Evidence </em>61 (June 24-28, 1991) (hereinafter \u201cthe 1991 Peele Report\u201d). The study focused on the \u201ccompositional variability of bullet leads from four major U.S. Manufacturers\u201d, with the goal of defining \u201cthe variability in element composition within individual bullets, among bullets within boxes of cartridges, among boxes packaged on the same date, among boxes packaged on different dates, and among boxes from the different manufacturers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57. To that end, Agent Peele and his colleagues analyzed the elemental composition of cartridges contained within full boxes of four different brands of .38 caliber cartridges\u2014Cascade Cartridge Industries, Federal, Remington, and Winchester. <em>Id. </em>at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The 1991 Peele Report observed, with respect to the Federal-brand cartridges, that, of the four boxes of Federal-brand cartridges that were tested, \u201cthree boxes contained] two distinct compositional groups.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61. Significantly, the box identified as \u201cbox two\u201d had \u201coverlapping compositions\u201d with boxes one and four, but had been packaged <em>fifteen 'months earlier.

Overlapping compositions occur either by coincidence or because the bullets originated from the same analytically homogenous source of lead.

This confirmatory bias is based on the erroneous assumption that a theory is confirmed by the accumulation of facts consistent with the theory....

An attorney\u2019s strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\u201d (internal citations and quotations omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\">. Although the Circuit Court Judge concluded that Kulbieki was not entitled to post-conviction relief, she also noted the significance of the CBLA evidence, opining that, \"[c]learly the bullet analysis was central to the theory of the prosecution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b92-8\">. There may be instances in which a limited remand is the more appropriate remedy for errors committed by post-conviction courts on claims based on ineffective assistance of counsel. For example, in <em>State v. Thomas, </em>325 Md. 160, 599 A.2d 1171 (1992), the petitioner, Thomas, had alleged that post-conviction relief was appropriate because his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by permitting Thomas to be interviewed by a State psychiatrist before sentencing without an attorney. The State argued that the decision was a strategic one, and thus, did not constitute deficient performance. We observed, however, that the post-conviction court did not permit Thomas\u2019s attorney to testify as to prior psychiatric assessments of Thomas, and therefore, we were not equipped to discern whether such a decision could be attributed to strategy. Accordingly, we remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">A limited remand in the instant case is unnecessary because both of Kulbicki's attorneys were questioned substantially regarding their investigation and strategy with respect to the CBLA evidence, of which they had no recollection.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b93-5\">McDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Auq\">dissenting, in which HARRELL and RODOWSKY, JJ., join</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">This is a troubling case\u2014for many reasons.

Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The Majority opinion briefly and accurately recites the principles that govern application of those two prongs. But it does not suffice to recite those criteria. A court must apply them. The Majority opinion does not. First, contrary to the principles outlined by the Supreme Court in <em>Strickland, </em>the Majority opinion uses information developed long after Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s 1995 trial, and not available until years later, to find trial counsel\u2019s performance deficient in hindsight. Second, again contrary to <em>Strickland, </em>the Majority opinion makes no effort to assess the alleged deficiency in light of the other evidence against Mr. Kulbicki that was unaffected by the alleged deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\n<em>Whether Trial Counsel\u2019s Performance was Deficient</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">To establish that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, Mr. Kulbicki must demonstrate that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>sional norms. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Judicial review of defense counsel\u2019s performance is to be \u201chighly deferential\u201d and \u201ca court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see also Evans v.

Especially pertinent to this case, the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance must be assessed \u201cas of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In other words, this prong is satisfied only when, \u201cgiven the facts known at the time, counsel\u2019s choice was so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have made it.\u201d <em>State v. Borchardt, </em>396 Md. 586, 623, 914 A.2d 1126 (2007) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The Majority opinion holds that Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial counsel were ineffective because they failed to locate and make use of research concerning CBLA to discredit the forensic value of CBLA evidence generally. At the time of Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial in 1995, CBLA had been used in criminal trials for nearly 30 years without serious challenge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is true that this Court ultimately determined that CBLA evidence failed to satisfy the <em>Frye-Reed </em>standard for the admission of scientific evidence in Maryland courts. But that decision was not issued until more than a decade after Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial. <em>Clemons v. State, </em>392 Md. 339, 896 A.2d 1059 (2006). Obviously, Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial counsel were not deficient in failing to rely on that case. Nor, as of 1995, had any other reported case held such evidence inadmissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Nor can the Majority opinion fault Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial counsel for failing to find and use the various scholarly articles and reports critical of CBLA cited and quoted at length in the <em>Clemons </em>decision. They did not exist in 1995. The key articles that questioned the use of CBLA evidence, including those cited in <em>Clemons, </em>were not published until 2002 at the earliest, seven years after Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s second trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Clemons, </em>392 Md. at 363-72, 896 A.2d 1059. Those articles spurred the FBI to commission the National Research Council (\u201cNRC\u201d) of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive review of CBLA evidence. The definitive NRC Report did not appear until 2004, nearly a decade after Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial. The NRC Report found that the scientific techniques used to analyze the composition of bullets were sound, but that some inferences drawn from the composition analysis as to the source of particular bullets or fragments were unwarranted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the NRC Report did not recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>mend against the use of CBLA evidence, the FBI ultimately decided to cease providing CBLA testimony in 2005. In any event, these developments occurred long after Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Indeed, at the time of Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial, the individual widely credited with blowing the whistle on the failings of CBLA\u2014former FBI examiner William Tobin\u2014was still employed at the FBI, was three years away from retirement, and had yet to publish his doubts concerning that analysis. <em>See, e.g., </em>P. Giannelli, <em>Comparative Bullet Analysis: A Retrospective, </em>47 Crim. L. Bull. Art. (Spring 2011) (\u201c[CBLA] was not seriously challenged until a retired FBI examiner, William Tobin, began questioning the procedure in scientific and legal journals and in court testimony as well\u201d) (footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The sole basis on which the Majority opinion finds trial counsel ineffective relates to a single research paper coauthored by six analysts from the FBI\u2019s laboratories in Washington D.C. and Quantico, Virginia, including Special Agent Ernest Peele, who testified as one of the prosecution\u2019s forensic experts at Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial. <em>See </em>E.R. Peele, et al., <em>Comparison of Bullets Using the Elemental Composition of the Lead Compo'nent </em>(1991) (\u201cFBI study\u201d or \u201cFBI research paper\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As an initial matter, it is not entirely clear that the FBI study was readily available outside the FBI at the time of the 1995 trial, even to the most diligent researcher.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>caused a copy of the FBI study, which is not available online, is still not easy to obtain, and does not otherwise appear in the record of this case, to be posted with this opinion on the \u201chighlighted cases\u201d portion of the Court\u2019s website, http:// mdcourts.gov/coappeals/highlightedcases/index.html#kulbicki.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Of course, assuming trial counsel could even locate the FBI research paper, what would they have done with it? The FBI study does not criticize the use of CBLA as a forensic tool. Indeed, the FBI study reports that 25 years of study of analytical data collected by the FBI has led to the conclusion that \u201cif two bullets are produced from the same homogenous source of lead, then they will have analytically indistinguishable compositions.\u201d FBI study at 57. The goal of the study was to \u201cdefine the variability in element composition within individual bullets, among bullets within boxes of cartridges, among boxes packaged on the same date, among boxes pack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>aged on different dates, and among boxes from different manufacturers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After summarizing the numerical results of the study, the paper concludes that CBLA provides useful forensic results. For example, it states that \u201cwhen compositional overlap between boxes occurs, it is more reasonable to expect the overlap from boxes of the same types and brand of bullet, packaged near the same date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. The paper ends with a hypothetical example involving the use of CBLA evidence in a criminal case\u2014involving facts very similar to Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s case\u2014and concludes: \u201cIt is our opinion that these results are forensically significant in associating the victim, weapon, and suspect in this example.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A defense attorney who happened to locate the FBI study might reasonably decide that using it would be counter-productive to any effort to refute the CBLA evidence in Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The only use that the Majority opinion suggests that Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s counsel could have made of the paper was to point out that there might be overlapping compositions of bullets packaged on different dates. Majority op. at 48-53, 99 A.3d at 739-42. In fact, the FBI study reported that, for two manufacturers\u2014CCI and Remington\u2014\u201cthere are no compositional group overlaps among bullets from boxes with different assembly and packaging dates.\u201d FBI study at 61. There were overlapping compositions for bullets packaged on different dates for one manufacturer\u2014Federal\u2014but the FBI study concluded that this was attributable to a common lead production source and component storage before loading by that manufacturer. <em>Id. </em>at 61-62. A more complex compositional group distribution finding for a fourth manufacturer was attributed to the same reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 62. After analyzing all of the data, the study concluded that \u201c[compositional group overlap among bullet leads are generally expected from boxes with the same assembly and packaging dates and not expected from boxes with widely different dates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In an apparent concession that the FBI study actually supports the use of CBLA evidence, the Majority opinion criticizes the FBI study as being \u201cat odds with the scientific method\u201d and \u201cinconsistent with the scientific method.\u201d Major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>ity op. at 50-51 <em>&amp; </em>n. 11, 99 A.3d at 740 &amp; n. 11. Although it is not entirely clear from the Majority opinion, it appears that the Majority believes that trial counsel should have located the FBI study in 1995, somehow used it to discredit CBLA evidence generally during cross-examination of Agent Peele at Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial, and then simultaneously debunked the study\u2019s methods and conclusions as \u201cinconsistent with the scientific method.\u201d This would have been a peculiar way to advance Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s defense. Whether or not the Majority\u2019s critique of the FBI study is valid, it is not the study that is under review here\u2014it is defense counsel\u2019s performance at the 1995 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The Majority opinion downplays the extent to which defense counsel actually cross-examined Agent Peele at trial about the CBLA evidence. Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial counsel cross-examined Agent Peele at some length and in detail concerning the CBLA analysis. He obtained concessions that there was no industry-wide standard for lead composition of bullets, that Agent Peele could not identify the manufacturer of any of the bullets in question, that any manufacturer would make many bullets, that bullets in one box of ammunition could have different compositions, that one of the bullets from Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s gun was similar to but \u201cmeasurably different\u201d from the bullet fragments from the autopsy and truck and that he could not be certain they had a common source, that the other bullets from Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s gun were so different from the bullet fragments that Agent Peele did not place them in the same \u201cgroup,\u201d and that a random bullet handed to the Agent could have a \u201csimilar\u201d composition to the bullet fragments and bullets he tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Although the cross-examination was not the precise critique of CBLA that was later made in academic articles and the NRC Report, defense counsel was able to point out that the inferences drawn from composition analysis were not as rigorous as the composition analysis itself. And, in the end, Agent Peele\u2019s testimony was not inconsistent with the results reported in the FBI study. It is not at all clear what the use of that study by defense counsel during cross-examination would have added, other than to allow the prosecution to ask Agent Peele <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>on re-direct about the conclusion of the FBI study that CBLA yielded forensically significant conclusions in murder cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The only post-conviction case concerning forensic evidence that the Majority cites in support of its decision actually illustrates how aberrational the Majority opinion is. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 47-49, 99 A.3d at 738-39, discussing <em>Driscoll v. Delo, </em>71 F.3d 701 (8th Cir.1995). That case arose out of a prison riot during which two officers were stabbed, one fatally. Driscoll was charged with the stabbing that resulted in death. A key question at the murder trial concerned the absence of the murder victim\u2019s blood type\u2014type 0\u2014on the defendant\u2019s knife. A serologist testified at trial that a particular test that she had performed would not detect type 0 blood if type A blood (which happened to be the blood type of the surviving victim) was also on the knife. The Eighth Circuit held that trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to ask the serologist whether she had performed <em>another </em>test that would have detected type 0 blood even in the presence of type A blood. The court noted that defense counsel asked only two questions of the serologist in cross-examination and that it was evident from the lab report defense counsel received in discovery that the serologist was able to detect both blood type A and blood type 0 together on other evidence. 71 F.3d at 709. By contrast, in this case, Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s counsel cross-examined Agent Peele extensively, asking more than 70 questions (which was considerably more questions than the prosecutor asked on direct and re-direct examination combined), making use of the Agent\u2019s report to obtain concessions, and introducing exhibits. And there is no suggestion that Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s counsel received anything in discovery that provided any clue to the general flaws in CBLA analysis that were unearthed many years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">There is no question that, as developments subsequent to Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial revealed, some inferences that had been drawn by FBI examiners from lead compositional analysis were seriously flawed. Whether an individual convicted at a trial at which such evidence was introduced should receive a new trial on the ground of newly-discovered evidence under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the standards governing a writ of actual innocence (CP \u00a7 8-301) is a serious question. But, in the context of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Majority fails to take into account the standard that we are to apply to trial counsel\u2019s performance. Our review of counsel\u2019s performance is to be \u201chighly deferential\u201d and must take account of the information available and facts known to counsel <em>at the time of trial. Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689-90, 104 S.Ct. 2052.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To hold that Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s 1995 trial counsel should have foreseen the subsequent developments with respect to CBLA analysis\u2014 most of which did not occur until the next decade\u2014is to impose, in Judge Moylan\u2019s pithy phrase, an \u201cobligation to prophesy.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Boiled down to its essence, the Majority opinion holds that Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial counsel should have discovered and unraveled the flaws in CBLA analysis before anyone else did by locating and using an obscure research paper\u2014a paper that actually endorsed the use of CBLA to link a defendant to a crime involving a firearm, including murder cases in particular. That is simply not a basis on which to find that Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial counsel were deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\n<em>Whether There was Prejudice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">To establish prejudice, Mr. Kulbicki \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>Den</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>isyuk v. State, </em>422 Md. 462, 470, 30 A.3d 914 (2011). Even if counsel\u2019s performance is deficient, prejudice is not ordinarily presumed, except in rare cases. <em>Redman v. State, </em>363 Md. 298, 310-13, 768 A.2d 656 (2001). Thus, even if he can establish that his trial counsel\u2019s performance fell outside the \u201cwide range of reasonable professional assistance\u201d described in <em>Strickland, </em>Mr. Kulbicki must also show that there is a substantial possibility that the result of his trial would have been different. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The issue of prejudice must be assessed in relation to the other evidence in the case. \u201cIn making this determination, a court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of the evidence before the ... jury. Some of the factual findings will have been unaffected by the errors, and factual findings that were affected will have been affected in different ways.... Taking the unaffected findings as a given, and taking due account of the effect of the errors on the remaining findings, a court making the prejudice inquiry must ask if the defendant has met the burden of showing that the decision reached would reasonably likely have been different absent the errors.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695-96, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">A reader of the Majority opinion might be excused for believing that the evidence against Mr. Kulbicki began and ended with CBLA testimony. The Majority opinion makes no effort to consider the testimony, exhibits, and other forensic evidence that tied Mr. Kulbicki to the crime. That evidence is largely recounted in the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals in this case,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and I will not repeat it here other than to summarize the main items:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">\u2022 Mr. Kulbicki, a married 36-year-old police officer, had engaged in an on-again and off-again extra-marital affair with Gina Marie Neuslein, the 22-year-old victim. That relationship had occurred over the course of at least two years, had resulted in two pregnancies, and, at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the murder, had been recently terminated by Ms. Neuslein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">\u2022 Ms. Neuslein instituted child support proceedings against Mr. Kulbicki. Although Mr. Kulbicki adamantly denied that he had had sex with her (a denial he repeated to detectives investigating the murder), a paternity test established that he was the father of her 18-month old child and a court hearing was scheduled in the child support proceeding. Ms. Neuslein was murdered the weekend before the scheduled hearing. (At his murder trial, Mr. Kulbicki conceded that he had fathered the child).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\u2022 On the day before the murder, Mr. Kulbicki picked up Ms. Neuslein in his truck while she was walking to her job at a Royal Farms Store and dropped her off at the store. According to a fellow employee, Ms. Neuslein arrived upset and appeared to have finger marks on her face. Later that evening, Mr. Kulbicki was observed sitting in his truck outside the store and later in an alley near the Neuslein residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">\u2022 On the day of the murder, Ms. Neuslein was apparently abducted while walking to work and killed shortly thereafter by a close range gunshot to the head. Her body was found in a state park some distance from her residence and workplace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\u2022 Based on the condition of Ms. Neuslein\u2019s body and the location where it was found\u2014signs that the body had been dragged and the absence of shell casings or bullets in the vicinity\u2014homicide investigators concluded that the murder had been committed elsewhere and the body transported to the park.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">\u2022 During the time frame of the murder, as estimated by the medical examiner, an eyewitness observed Mr. Kulbicki in his truck at the area of the park where Ms. Neuslein\u2019s body was found.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">\u2022 A search of Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s home two days after the murder resulted in the seizure of Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s denim work jacket, which had a blood stain that matched Ms. Neuslein\u2019s DNA and blood type, but not Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>A .38 caliber revolver was also seized from Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s home and was determined to be operable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">\u2022 The police also seized Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s truck two days after the murder. Although the interior of the front of the truck appeared to have been cleaned, investigators found human bone fragments (including a larger fragment identified as a skull fragment), a bullet fragment, and human blood stains.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\u2022 Expert serology and DNA analysis linked Ms. Neuslein to the bone fragments and blood stains in Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s truck. DNA analysis of the bone fragments found in Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s truck excluded Mr. Kulbicki but were sufficiently consistent with Ms. Neuslein\u2019s DNA such that she could not be excluded. A number of the blood stains in the truck also bore genetic markers consistent with Ms. Neuslein\u2019s blood, but inconsistent with Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">\u2022 Expert testimony by a Smithsonian scientist established that the larger bone fragment in Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s truck had been created by a tremendous amount of traumatic force, consistent with a contact gunshot wound, and contained lead and carbon deposits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">\u2022 Expert ballistics analysis\u2014not CBLA analysis\u2014of the bullet fragment from Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s truck established that it had markings consistent with being fired from a .38 or larger caliber gun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">None of this evidence depended on the CBLA analysis. The Majority opinion makes no mention of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s post-conviction counsel have, at various times, challenged the admissibility of other items of evidence and other aspects of his trial, but the Majority opinion does not purport to find merit in any of those challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"ACz\">\n<em>Conclusion,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">If Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial counsel were ineffective, it was not with respect to their challenge of the CBLA evidence. Neither prong of <em>Strickland </em>is satisfied here. As the Majority appears to concede, no other court that has considered a similar claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the failure to discover the flaws in CBLA evidence at a trial held during the 1990s amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">To conclude that Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial counsel were ineffective in not discrediting CBLA analysis before anyone else raised doubts about CBLA evidence is to distort the <em>Strickland </em>standards. One might chalk that up to the cliche that hard cases make bad law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But while, for many reasons, this may be a hard case, the question whether trial counsel were ineffective with respect to the CBLA evidence is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">All of this is not to say that the use of the CBLA evidence in Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial is not troubling. Post-conviction counsel briefed and argued before us other grounds on which to vacate Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s conviction based on other legal theories related to the use of the CBLA testimony at his trial. See footnote 4 above. Although my inclination would be to find that those bases are either without merit or not ripe at this time,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>would have formed a sounder basis for the Majority\u2019s decision without distorting the law governing ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-5\">Judge HARRELL and Judge RODOWSKY have authorized me to say that they join this opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-8\">. This was the second jury to reach that conclusion.

Some refer to this analysis as \"compositional analysis of bullet lead\" and use the acronym \"CABL.\u201d <em>See </em>National Research Council, Forensic Analysis: Weighing Bullet Lead Analysis (2004). For the sake of consistency, I will use the acronym adopted by the parties and used by the Majority opinion to denote this type of evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\">. Mr. Kulbicki's very competent post-conviction counsel did argue that the admission of the CBLA evidence violated due process and also suggested that developments concerning CBLA subsequent to his trial should be treated as newly discovered evidence that could be a basis for vacating his conviction under Maryland Code, Criminal Procedure Article (\"CP\u201d), \u00a7 8-301. However, the Majority opinion does not base its decision on either of those grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b94-9\">. This Court has held that the federal and State constitutional provisions are coextensive. <em>Lodowski v. State, </em>307 Md. 233, 247, 513 A.2d 299 (1986). Thus, Maryland courts apply the standards set forth in <em>Strickland </em>in judging claims for post-conviction relief on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See, e.g., Coleman v. State, </em>434 Md. 320, 334, 75 A.3d 916 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\">. CBLA was apparently first developed as part of the investigation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. <em>See </em>P.C.

The reported opinions in which CBLA evidence has been determined to be inadmissible were issued more than 10 years after Mr. Kulbicki's 1995 trial and concerned trials that occurred after the publication of reports critical of CBLA in the early 2000s. <em>See Clemons v. State, supra </em>(2002 trial; 2006 appellate opinion); <em>Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>191 S.W.3d 569 (Ky.2006) (2002 trial; 2006 appellate opinion). To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>extent that CBLA evidence was challenged prior to Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial, courts had held that the evidence was admissible. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>425 N.E.2d 128 (Ind.1981); <em>State v. Krummacher, </em>269 Or. 125, 523 P.2d 1009 (1974). Indeed, in re-cross-examination of the prosecution\u2019s expert in his case, Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s counsel was able to elicit the same point emphasized by the dissent in the <em>Jones </em>case\u2014that any of a large number of bullets manufactured by the same maker might be \"similar\" in composition. 425 N.E.2d at 135.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b96-6\">. <em>See </em>R.D.

National Research Council, <em>Forensic Analysis: Weighing Bullet Lead Evidence </em>(2004) (\"NRC Report\u201d). The NRC Report concluded that the analytical techniques employed by the FBI laboratory to determine the composition of bullet lead samples led to sound results. The potential problem lay in the conclusions analysts drew from those results. In the view of the NRC Report, there was some danger that expert witnesses were drawing broader conclusions from the analysis than was warrant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>ed, such as assertions that two specimens came from the same box of ammunition.

Indeed, the critical passage from the <em>Clemons </em>opinion concerning three underlying premises of CBLA analysis that the Majority quotes, Majority op. at 36-37 n. 2, 99 A.3d at 732 n. 2, is a virtually verbatim quotation of a 2004 article by Mr. Tobin. <em>See </em>W.

The Majority provides a hyperlink to show that the FBI study was distributed to depository libraries sometime in 1994, although it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>clear when the article would have been cataloged at any particular library. Moreover, given that depository libraries may select, with some exceptions, the government documents they choose to receive, it is not entirely clear which libraries in the Baltimore vicinity would have had a copy of the FBI study at the time of Mr. Kulbicki's second trial. <em>See Amending Your Library\u2019s Selection Profile, </em>FDLP (August 19, 2014) http://www.fdlp.gov/requirements-guidance-2/guidance/10-amendingyour-library-s-selection-profile. Obviously, Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s counsel would not have found a link to the article in the way that the Majority did. In 1995, public use of the Internet was in its infancy. Google did not yet exist. <em>See Internet Users, </em>Internet Live Stats (July 31, 2014), http://www.internetlivestats.eom/internet-users/#trend (less than 1% of world population had access to Internet in 1995); <em>World Wide Web Timeline, </em>Pew Research Internet Project (July 31, 2014), http://www. pewinternet.org/2014/03/ll/world-wide-web-timeline/ (as of 1995, 18 million Americans were online, but only 3% of that number had ever signed on to the world wide web).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In a federal district court case concerning alleged discovery violations related to CBLA evidence, it was alleged that the FBI study was not publicly available at the time of a <em>1999 </em>trial\u2014a trial that occurred four years after Mr. Kulbicki\u2019s trial. Ultimately, the court did not resolve that question, given that a similar study had been published in 1999. <em>See United States v.
