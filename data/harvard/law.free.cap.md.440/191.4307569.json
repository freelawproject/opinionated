The attorney, who did not maintain a separate trust account, deposited the client\u2019s payment into a general account and never returned the unearned fee to the client. The attorney did not cooperate with Bar Counsel\u2019s disciplinary investigation, failed to respond to the disciplinary charges later filed against her, and did not participate in the proceedings before the hearing judge or our Court. As a result, we have no information that would mitigate the sanction for her misconduct. We hold that she violated multiple provisions of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) as well as related rules and statutes and, based on those violations, disbar her.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\n<em>Procedural Context</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On June 5, 2013, the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), through Bar Counsel, filed with this Court a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action against Christine Boco Gage-Cohen. The Commission charged Ms. Gage-Cohen with violating MLRPC 1.1 (competence), 1.2(a) (scope of representation and allocation of authority between client and lawyer), 1.3 (diligence), 1.4 (communication), 1.5(a) (fees), 1.15 (safekeeping property), 1.16(a) and (d) (declining or terminating representation), 8.1(b) (bar admission and disciplinary matters), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d) (misconduct). She was also charged with violating Maryland Rules 16-604 (trust account\u2014required deposits), 16-606.1 (trust account recordkeeping), and 16-609(a) (prohibited transactions); and Maryland Code, Business Occupations and Professions Article (\u201cBOP\u201d), \u00a7 10-306 (misuse of trust money).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a), this Court designated Judge William C. Mulford, II, of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, to conduct a hearing and to provide findings of fact and recommended conclusions of law. After several unsuccessful attempts to locate Ms. Gage-Cohen, she was personally served in Tennessee on November 19, 2013. She did not respond to the summons and, on December 19, 2013, Bar Counsel filed a Motion for an Order of Default. The motion was granted on December 27 and entered on December 30, 2013; a hearing was scheduled for February 11, 2014. Ms. Gage-Cohen did not move to vacate the order; nor did she attend the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The hearing judge issued findings of fact and recommended conclusions of law on March 4, 2014. Neither party filed exceptions. This Court heard oral argument on September 3, 2014. Ms. Gage-Cohen did not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Ms. Gage-Cohen was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1985. On March 13, 2013, while this matter was under investigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>she was suspended for failing to pay the Client Protection Fund assessment. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 16-811.6(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">As noted above, neither party excepted to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact concerning the alleged violations. We accept those findings as established. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A). Those findings concerned Ms. Gage-Cohen\u2019s failure to follow through with her agreement to represent a client in a divorce case, her mishandling of funds related to that representation, and her lack of responsiveness to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">On March 14, 2012, Mary L. Turner paid Ms. Gage-Cohen $2,500 with the understanding that Ms. Gage-Cohen would seek a Limited Divorce Agreement and eventually an Absolute Divorce on Ms. Turner\u2019s behalf. Ms. Turner also gave Ms. Gage-Cohen several documents, including financial statements and a separation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Ms. Gage-Cohen did not deposit Ms. Turner\u2019s $2,500 payment into a client trust account, and did not obtain Ms. Turner\u2019s informed, written consent to make other arrangements. The hearing judge found Ms. Gage-Cohen did not maintain an attorney trust account at all in 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">After accepting Ms. Turner\u2019s payment, Ms. Gage-Cohen apparently abandoned Ms. Turner\u2019s case. Ms. Turner called and emailed Ms. Gage-Cohen repeatedly over several months, with no response. Eventually, Ms. Turner attempted to terminate the representation and sought a refund of her payment and the return of her documents. But Ms. Gage-Cohen did not respond and did not return Ms. Turner\u2019s documents or the unearned fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Ms. Turner filed a complaint with the Commission on June 14, 2012. On June 22, July 20, and August 17, 2012, Bar Counsel sent letters to Ms. Gage-Cohen at the address on file with the Client Protection Fund requesting her response to the complaint. Ms. Gage-Cohen did not answer any of those requests. Beginning on August 30, 2012, Commission Investigator Dennis Biennas attempted to contact Ms. Gage-Cohen personally. She did not answer Mr. Biennas\u2019 phone calls, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>agreed to speak with him when he arrived unannounced at her office on September 25, 2012. She admitted receiving the letters from the Commission, ascribed her lack of response to \u201cpersonal issues,\u201d and promised to respond within three days. She never responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">In November 2012, Bar Counsel sent Ms. Gage-Cohen a final request, soliciting the following information and records: (1) a response to Ms. Turner\u2019s complaint, (2) her reasons for failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s earlier requests, (3) her entire client file for Ms. Turner, (4) a statement about Ms. Gage-Cohen\u2019s then-pending traffic citations in the District Court, and (5) her attorney trust account records for the period March 2012 through October 2012. Ms. Gage-Cohen neither responded to the letter nor produced any of the requested information or records. She did return Ms. Turner\u2019s documents at some point after the Commission\u2019s investigation and apparently left Maryland for Tennessee, where she was ultimately served with the charges in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The hearing judge found that Ms. Gage-Cohen committed all of the charged violations. We review the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law without special deference. Maryland Rule 16\u2014759(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\n<em>Abandonment of the Client</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">MLRPC 1.1 states that \u201c[a] lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d In other words, a knowledgeable and skillful attorney may nevertheless provide incompetent representation if the lawyer is not thorough or is unprepared. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brady, </em>422 Md. 441, 457, 30 A.3d 902 (2011); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McCulloch, </em>404 Md. 388, 397-98, 946 A.2d 1009 (2008); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 54, 891 A.2d 1085 (2006). A lawyer\u2019s failure to prepare a case after accepting a fee violates MLRPC 1.1. <em>Attorney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>Grievance Comm\u2019n v. De La Paz, </em>418 Md. 534, 553-54, 16 A.3d 181 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">MLRPC 1.2(a) states, in relevant part, that \u201ca lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and, when appropriate, shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued.\u201d We have held that \u201c[w]hen a lawyer fails to take any steps towards the client\u2019s objective, the lawyer necessarily fails to abide by the client\u2019s decision concerning that objective.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garrett, </em>427 Md. 209, 223, 46 A.3d 1169 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">MLRPC 1.3 provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d A lawyer who takes \u201cno action whatsoever\u201d in representing a client violates this rule. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shakir, </em>427 Md. 197, 205, 46 A.3d 1162 (2012); <em>see also De La Paz, </em>418 Md. at 554, 16 A.3d 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">MLRPC 1.4 states, in p\u00e9rtinent part, that \u201c[a] lawyer shall ... keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; [and] promptly comply with reasonable requests for information ...\u201d As in the instant case, conduct that violates the diligence and promptness standard of MLRPC 1.3 often also violates the communication standard of MLRPC 1.4. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pinno, </em>437 Md. 70, 80, 85 A.3d 159 (2014); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kremer, </em>432 Md. 325, 336, 68 A.3d 862 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">MLRPC 1.5(a) states, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses.\u201d When an attorney charges a fee but does no work, the fee is <em>per se </em>unreasonable. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. 467, 502, 813 A.2d 1145 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Chapman, </em>430 Md. 238, 275, 60 A.3d 25, 48 (2013); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Stinson, </em>428 Md. 147, 184, 50 A.3d 1222 (2012). It is irrelevant that the fee is \u201cinitially reasonable\u201d if the attorney fails to perform any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>services for which the attorney was paid. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lawson, </em>401 Md. 536, 580, 933 A.2d 842 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">MLRPC 1.16(a) provides, with an exception not pertinent here, that \u201ca lawyer shall not represent a client or, where representation has commenced, shall withdraw from the representation of a client if: ... (2) the lawyer\u2019s physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer\u2019s ability to represent the client; or (3) the lawyer is discharged.\u201d Section (d) of that rule provides that \u201c[u]pon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred.\u201d When an attorney does nothing to advance the client\u2019s interest, and then abandons the client without notice and without returning unearned fees, the attorney violates MLRPC 1.16(d). <em>Kremer, </em>432 Md. at 336, 68 A.3d 862; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Park, </em>427 Md. 180, 193, 46 A.3d 1153 (2012); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Costanzo, </em>432 Md. 233, 255, 68 A.3d 808 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">MLRPC 8.4(a) states that \u201c[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: (a) violate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Ms. Gage-Cohen accepted $2,500 to represent Ms. Turner in a divorce case, but took absolutely no action to advance Ms. Turner\u2019s case. This failure to act amounted to incompetent representation in violation of MLRPC 1.1, was inconsistent with her client\u2019s decisions in violation of MLRPC 1.2, and fell well short of the diligence and promptness required by MLRPC 1.3. Ms. Gage-Cohen\u2019s communication with Ms. Turner was not just inadequate, it was non-existent. She never contacted Ms. Turner after the initial consultation. Nor did she respond to Ms. Turner\u2019s repeated calls and emails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>requesting information. Her lack of communication violated MLRPC 1.4. Ms. Gage-Cohen\u2019s $2,500 fee, for which she evidently performed no work, was unreasonable under MLRPC 1.5. Ms. Gage-Cohen abandoned the representation without notifying Ms. Turner, without allowing her to obtain other counsel in a timely manner, and without refunding any of the unearned fee. Ms. Gage-Cohen only returned Ms. Turner\u2019s documents at some point shortly before Bar Counsel filed charges against her. She thus failed to terminate the representation in the manner required under MLRPC 1.16. Because Ms. Gage-Cohen violated numerous provisions of the MLRPC, she also violated Rule 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\n<em>Misappropriation of Client Funds</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">MLRPC 1.15(a) and (c) state, in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">(a) A lawyer shall hold property of clients ... that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate account maintained pursuant to Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules, and records shall be created and maintained in accordance with the Rules in that Chapter.... Complete records of the account funds and of other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of at least five years after the date the record was created.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">(c) Unless the client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing, to a different arrangement, a lawyer shall deposit legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance into a client trust account and may withdraw those funds for the lawyer\u2019s own benefit only as fees are earned or expenses incurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">In short, the rule mandates that attorneys \u201cmaintain a separate account to safeguard funds of clients ... and ... deposit unearned fees into the client trust account, unless the client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing, to a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>arrangement.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tanko, </em>427 Md. 15, 32, 45 A.3d 281 (2012) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Maryland Rule 16-604 similarly provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">[A]ll funds, including cash, received and accepted by an attorney or law firm in this State from a client or third person to be delivered in whole or in part to a client or third person, unless received as payment of fees owed the attorney by the client or in reimbursement for expenses properly advanced on behalf of the client, shall be deposited in an attorney trust account in an approved financial institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Consistent with MLRPC 1.15, this rule requires attorneys to keep all client funds in a trust account until earned as fees or otherwise distributed in accordance with the representation agreement. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Van Nelson, </em>425 Md. 344, 360, 40 A.3d 1039 (2012). Finally, Maryland Rule 16-606.1 sets forth the requirements for creating and maintaining attorney trust accounts, including detailed records of every transaction in each client matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">MLRPC 8.4(c) states, \u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: ... (c) [ejngage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation!.]\u201d When an attorney misappropriates client funds, the attorney violates MLRPC 8.4(c). <em>Costanzo, </em>432 Md. at 256, 68 A.3d 808; <em>McCulloch, </em>404 Md. at 400, 946 A.2d 1009; <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Goff, </em>399 Md. 1, 30, 922 A.2d 554 (2007). Failure to deposit unearned fees into an attorney trust account is a violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Rule 16-609, and therefore of BOP \u00a7 10-306 as well. <em>Costanzo, </em>432 Md. at 255, 68 A.3d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Ms. Gage-Cohen did not deposit the payment fees she received from Ms. Turner into a separate trust account. Nor did she obtain Ms. Turner\u2019s informed, written consent to an alternate arrangement, as required by MLRPC 1.15(c). The hearing judge found that Ms. Gage-Cohen did not maintain trust account records, and did not maintain a trust account at all in 2012. This mismanagement of funds violated MLRPC 1.15(a) &amp; (c), and 8.4(c), Maryland Rules 16-604, 16-606.1, and 16-609, and BOP \u00a7 10-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\n<em>Failure to Cooperate with Bar Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">MLRPC 8.1(b) states, in pertinent part, that a lawyer \u201cin connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not: ... (b) knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority....\u201d This Court has repeatedly held that this rule requires an attorney to timely answer requests from the Commission regarding a complaint in a potential disciplinary matter. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gray, </em>436 Md. 513, 521, 83 A.3d 786 (2014); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

When the Commission investigator called her, she did not return his calls, and she only spoke with him when he appeared at her office unannounced. At that point, Ms. Gage-Cohen acknowledged receiving Bar Counsel\u2019s letters and promised to respond, but she never made good on that promise. Accordingly, she violated MLRPC 8.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\n<em>Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Under MLRPC 8.4(d), \u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: ...

In <em>Van Nelson, </em>this Court held that charging an unreasonable fee, refusing to return unearned fees, and failing to respond to Bar Counsel violated MLRPC 8.4(d). <em>Id. </em>at 362-63, 40 A.3d 1039; <em>cf.
