The State, Respondent, charged Howard with first-degree rape and other crimes. On December 2, 2008, Howard was arraigned in the Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>for Baltimore City (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d), which scheduled trial for February 23, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Thereafter, the circuit court postponed trial eight times; Howard requested, either jointly with the State or separately, five of the postponements. On February 23, 2009, the circuit court granted a jointly-requested postponement, for which the circuit court charged both parties because the State had just provided discovery materials to Howard\u2019s counsel, who needed time to investigate. On May 5, 2009, the circuit court granted a State-requested postponement, for which the circuit court charged the State because Howard\u2019s counsel had not yet received DNA test results; on that date, in the circuit court, Howard stated: \u201c[T]hey took my DNA four times.\u201d On August 11, 2009, the circuit court granted a jointly-requested postponement, for which the circuit court did not charge either party because Howard\u2019s counsel was awaiting her expert\u2019s analysis of the DNA test results. On November 4, 2009, the circuit court granted a State-requested postponement, for which the circuit court charged the State because a State\u2019s witness was unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">On December 17, 2009, on his own behalf, Howard filed in the circuit court the first of multiple motions to dismiss for violation of his right to a speedy trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 22, 2010,' the circuit court granted a State-requested postponement because a State\u2019s witness was unavailable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 27, 2010, the circuit court granted a defense-requested postponement, for which the circuit court charged Howard because he had discharged his first lawyer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and needed time to be assigned a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>new one. On July 20, 2010, the circuit court granted a defense-requested postponement, for which the circuit court charged Howard because his second lawyer needed time to prepare. On October 27, 2010, the circuit court advised Howard that the maximum penalty for first-degree rape and first-degree sexual offense was imprisonment for life; informed Howard of the right to counsel and the importance of assistance of counsel; and informed Howard that trial would proceed as scheduled with Howard unrepresented by counsel if Howard discharged counsel and did not have new counsel. On that date, Howard discharged his second lawyer, and the circuit court granted a jointly-requested postponement, for which the circuit court charged the State because a State\u2019s witness was unavailable. At that time, the circuit court scheduled trial for January 21, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">On January 21, 2011, the circuit court made certain that Howard had received a copy of the charging document containing notice as to the right to counsel; informed Howard of the right to counsel and the importance of assistance of counsel; and ensured that Howard was aware of the allowable penalties for the charges. Afterward, Howard expressly waived the right to counsel. On January 24, 2011, the circuit court denied the motions to dismiss for violation of Howard\u2019s right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">On January 26, 2011, Howard appeared before the trial judge, who was not the circuit court\u2019s administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee. Howard requested a postponement and requested the appointment of counsel, alleging that, within the previous week, the State had provided him with discovery materials. The trial judge denied the request for a postponement and the request for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">On January 31, 2011, trial began. A jury convicted Howard of first-degree rape and first-degree sexual offense. Howard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion. Howard filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>which this Court granted. <em>See Howard v. State, </em>435 Md. 266, 77 A.3d 1084 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Howard contends that the trial judge lacked the authority to deny the motion to postpone because only a county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee may deny a motion to postpone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, Howard argues that Md.Code Ann., Crim. Proc. (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.) (\u201cCP\u201d) \u00a7 6-103(b) and Maryland Rule 4-271(a)(l) deprive circuit court judges other than county administrative judges or those judges\u2019 designees of the authority to deny motions to postpone. The State responds that the trial judge had the authority to deny the motion to postpone because, based on CP \u00a7 6-103(b)\u2019s and Maryland Rule 4-271(a)(l)\u2019s plain language and purpose, any circuit court judge may deny a motion to postpone.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">An appellate court reviews without deference a trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute or a Maryland Rule. <em>See Lowery v. State, </em>430 Md. 477, 487, 61 A.3d 794, 800 (2013) (\u201c[W]e review a trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute through a non-deferential prism.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Fuster v. State, </em>437 Md. 653, 664, 89 A.3d 1114, 1120 (2014) (\u201cAn appellate court reviews without deference a trial court\u2019s interpretation of a Maryland Rule.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">In interpreting a statute or a Maryland Rule, a court first considers the statute\u2019s or Maryland Rule\u2019s language, which the court applies if the statute\u2019s or Maryland Rule\u2019s language \u201cis unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s [or Maryland Rule\u2019s] apparent purpose[.]\u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number><em>Weems, </em>429 Md. 329, 337, 55 A.3d 921, 926 (2012) (citation omitted); <em>Fuster, </em>437 Md. at 664, 89 A.3d at 1120 (\u201cA court interprets a Maryland Rule by using the same canons of construction that the court uses to interpret a statute.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">CP \u00a7 6-103(b)(l) states: \u201cFor good cause shown, the county administrative judge or a designee of the judge may grant a change of the trial date in a circuit court[.]\u201d Maryland Rule 4-271(a)(l) states: \u201c[F]or good cause shown, the county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee may grant a change of a circuit court trial date.\u201d CP \u00a7 6\u2014103(b)(2) states: \u201cIf a circuit court trial date is changed ..., any subsequent changes of the trial date may only be made by the county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee for good cause shown.\u201d Maryland Rule 4-271(a)(l) states: \u201cIf a circuit court trial date is changed, any subsequent changes of the trial date may be made only by the county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee for good cause shown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In <em>Jones v. State, </em>403 Md. 267, 302, 941 A.2d 1082, 1102 (2008), this Court held that two circuit court judges \u201cproperly exercised their respective discretion ... to deny [a defendant] a postponement of his trial.\u201d The defendant made a motion to postpone, which a county administrative judge\u2019s designee denied. <em>See id. </em>at 282-83, 285, 941 A.2d at 1091, 1092. On \u201cthe same day[,]\u201d the defendant appeared before another circuit court judge, before whom the defendant \u201casked that he be sent back to\u201d the county administrative judge\u2019s designee. <em>Id. </em>at 285-86, 941 A.2d at 1093. The circuit court judge stated: \u201cI will consider that motion to be renewed and denied again[J\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 941 A.2d at 1102. This Court concluded: \u201cWhile it was within [the circuit court judge]\u2019s discretion to send [the defendant] back to [the county administrative judge\u2019s designee], he was not duty-bound to do so on the facts of this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 941 A.2d at 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Here, we unequivocally conclude that any circuit court judge may deny a motion to postpone in a criminal case. Since before CP \u00a7 6-103(b)\u2019s and Maryland Rule 4-271(a)(l)\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>predecessors<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> took effect in the 1970s, all circuit court judges have had the discretion to deny motions to postpone. <em>See McKenzie v. State, </em>236 Md. 597, 601, 204 A.2d 678, 680 (1964) (\u201c[T]he denial of a request for a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d). In authorizing only county administrative judges or those judges\u2019 designees to grant motions to postpone, CP \u00a7 6-103(b)\u2019s and Maryland Rule 4-271(a)(l)\u2019s predecessors did not deprive other circuit court judges of the discretion to deny motions to postpone.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The plain language of CP \u00a7 6-103(b), Maryland Rule 4-271(a)(l), and their predecessors states that only a county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee may \u201cchange\u201d a trial date <em>(i.e., </em>grant a motion to postpone); neither the statute nor the rule precludes another circuit court judge from declining to change a trial date (i.e., denying a motion to postpone).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added). <em>See Jones, </em>403 Md. at 302, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>941 A.2d at 1102 (This Court held that a circuit court judge\u2014 who was neither a county administrative judge nor that judge\u2019s designee\u2014\u201cproperly exercised [his] discretion ... to deny [the defendant] a postponement of his trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Howard mischaracterizes <em>Jones </em>in contending that, in <em>Jones, id. </em>at 301-02, 941 A.2d at 1101-02, this Court held only that the circuit court judge did not abuse his discretion in declining the defendant\u2019s request to return to the administrative judge\u2019s designee. The circuit court judge explicitly treated the defendant\u2019s request as a \u201crenewed\u201d motion to postpone, which the circuit court judge denied. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 941 A.2d at 1102. Thus, <em>Jones </em>belies Howard\u2019s contention that only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee may deny a motion to postpone.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Permitting any circuit court judge to deny a motion to postpone fulfills CP \u00a7 6-103\u2019s and Maryland Rule 4-271\u2019s purpose, which is \u201cto further society\u2019s interest in the prompt disposition of criminal trials[.]\u201d <em>State v. Frazier, </em>298 Md. 422, 456, 470 A.2d 1269, 1287 (1984) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> CP \u00a7 6-103\u2019s and Maryland Rule 4-271\u2019s purpose is fulfilled by curbing the number of grants of motions to postpone, not the number of denials of motions to postpone. <em>See Frazier, </em>298 Md. at 453, 470 A.2d at 1285 (\u201cThe major safeguard contemplated by [CP \u00a7 6-103 and Maryland Rule 4-271 is] assuring that criminal trials are not needlessly postponed[.]\u201d); <em>State v. Dorsey, </em>114 Md.App. 678, 693, 691 A.2d 730, 737 (1997), <em>aff'd, </em>349 Md. 688, 709 A.2d 1244 (1998) (\u201cThe ever-escalating problem through the decade of the 1960\u2019s that produced [CP \u00a7 6-103] in 1971 and [Maryland Rule 4-271] in 1977 was the alarming backlog of untried criminal cases.... Even as backlogs were building, criminal courtrooms were lying fallow because of the promiscuous requesting and granting of postponements.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">We reject Howard\u2019s contentions that: (1) CP \u00a7 6-103\u2019s and Maryland Rule 4-271\u2019s purpose is fulfilled by limiting the authority to deny motions to postpone, resulting in greater consistency among denials of motions to postpone; and (2) our holding diminishes the authority of a county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee, as a denial of a motion to postpone affects a circuit court\u2019s schedule \u201cjust as much as a grant\u201d of a motion to postpone. In our view, CP \u00a7 6\u2014103(b) and Maryland Rule 4-271(a)(l) were intended to create consistency as to the grant of a motion to postpone, as the grant of a motion to postpone requires \u201cthe expertise, the knowledge as to the state of the docket, and the responsibility of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>administrative judge[.]\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>114 Md.App. at 694, 691 A.2d at 738. By contrast, a denial of a motion to postpone requires no such expertise, knowledge, or responsibility, as a denial of a motion to postpone maintains the scheduled trial date\u2014which a county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee assigned in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Moreover, Howard\u2019s interpretation would frustrate CP \u00a7 6-103\u2019s and Maryland Rule 4-271\u2019s primary purpose, which is \u201cto further society\u2019s interest in the prompt disposition of criminal trials[.]\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>298 Md. at 456, 470 A.2d at 1287 (footnote omitted). Under Howard\u2019s interpretation, a circuit court judge would needlessly delay trials by referring every motion to postpone, no matter how belated or frivolous, to a county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee. <em>Cf. Jones, </em>403 Md. at 302, 301, 941 A.2d at 1102, 1101 (This Court held that a circuit court judge\u2014who was neither a county administrative judge nor that judge\u2019s designee\u2014\u201cproperly exercised [his] discretion ... to deny [the defendant] a postponement of his trial\u201d where, on the day on which trial was scheduled to begin, the defendant moved to postpone to obtain counsel; the defendant \u201chad many opportunities to secure counsel prior to the day of trial, but knowingly waived those opportunities despite the solicitous suggestions by various judges that he would be better off with legal representation.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We are unpersuaded by Howard\u2019s reliance on isolated quotations from cases in which this Court stated in <em>dicta </em>that only a county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee may deny a motion to postpone. <em>See Frazier, </em>298 Md. at 450, 470 A.2d at 1284 (A \u201cjudge [other than a county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee] has been deprived of the authority to exercise independent judgment concerning good cause for postponement.\u201d); <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>299 Md. 1, 7, 472 A.2d 436, 439 (1984) (\u201c[T]he exercise of judgment in determining the presence or absence of good cause for postponement is vested in the administrative judge or his [or her] designee.\u201d (Citing <em>Frazier, </em>298 Md. at 450, 470 A.2d at 1284)); <em>State v. Brown, </em>355 Md. 89, 98, 733 A.2d 1044, 1048 (1999) (\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>determination of good cause ... was entrusted to the sound discretion of the County Administrative judge[.]\u201d (Citing <em>Frazier, </em>298 Md. at 450, 470 A.2d at 1288)). Neither <em>Frazier, Calhoun, </em>nor <em>Brown </em>involved a denial of a motion to postpone; rather, all three cases involved grants of motions to postpone.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Frazier, </em>in considering grants of motions to postpone, this Court used broad language that did not apply to a denial of a motion to postpone; and, in <em>Calhoun </em>and <em>Brown, </em>in considering grants of motions to postpone, the Court simply repeated such language. Thus, the above quotations are <em>dicta </em>with respect to a denial of a motion to postpone.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">As Howard points out, under our holding, where a circuit court judge refrains from denying a motion to postpone, the circuit court judge will refer the motion to postpone to a county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee, who will rule on the motion to postpone. In short, neither the plain language nor the purpose of CP \u00a7 6-103 and Maryland Rule 4-271 confers on a defendant the right to have a motion to postpone considered only by a county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 6-103(b)(l) (\u201cFor good cause shown, the county administrative judge or a designee of the judge may grant a change of the trial date in a circuit court[.]\u201d); CP \u00a7 6-103(b)(2) (\u201cIf a circuit court trial date is changed ..., any subsequent changes of the trial date may only be made by the county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee for good cause shown.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Md. R. 4-271(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">For the above reasons, any circuit court judge may deny a motion to postpone.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, here, the trial judge had the authority to deny the motion to postpone.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Howard contends that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying the motion to postpone to obtain counsel because the trial judge did not ask him any questions. Alternatively, Howard argues that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying the motion to postpone to review discovery materials because he alleged that, within the previous week, the State had provided him with discovery materials. The State responds that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion to postpone because the trial judge was not required to question Howard and Howard\u2019s motion to postpone was to obtain counsel, not to review discovery. Simply put, we agree with the State.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">An appellate court reviews for abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to postpone. <em>See Ware v. </em>State, 360 Md. 650, 706, 759 A.2d 764, 794 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1115, 121 S.Ct. 864, 148 L.Ed.2d 776 (2001) (\u201c[T]he decision whether to grant a postponement is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d (Citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">A.

This Court has declined to \u201cplace limiting factors on the exercise of broad discretion \u2018in the interest of justice[,]\u2019 \u201d and instead has stated that the meaning of \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d varies depending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>on each case\u2019s \u201cunique circumstances.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>403 Md. at 294, 941 A.2d at 1097-98 (citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Here, we conclude that a trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to postpone to obtain counsel because the trial court does not ask questions of a self-represented defendant who has expressly waived the right to counsel after being advised of the right to counsel under Maryland Rule 4-215(b) (Express Waiver of Counsel). Aside from relying on the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, Howard offers no constitutional provision, statute, Maryland Rule, or holding of this Court\u2014and we know of none\u2014under which a trial court is required to question a self-represented defendant who has expressly waived the right to counsel before the trial court denies a motion to postpone to obtain counsel. Certainly, Maryland Rule 4-215(b) lacks such a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">We reject Howard\u2019s contention that, under <em>Jones, </em>403 Md. 267, 941 A.2d 1082, before denying a motion to postpone to obtain counsel, a trial court is required to question a self-represented defendant who has expressly waived the right to counsel. In <em>Jones, id. </em>at 300, 272, 941 A.2d at 1101, 1085, this Court held that a trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a self-represented defendant\u2019s motion to postpone to obtain counsel after the defendant expressly waived the right to counsel. The trial court \u201cquestioned [the defendant] extensively about both [a] discovery issue and the need for an attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299, 941 A.2d at 1101. Nowhere in <em>Jones </em>did this Court state that a trial court abuses its discretion in denying a motion to postpone to obtain counsel because the trial court does not ask any questions of a self-represented defendant who has previously expressly waived the right to counsel. Indeed, in <em>Jones, id. </em>at 300, 941 A.2d at 1101, this Court simply stated: \u201cWe find it <em>preferable </em>that [ ] a [trial court] review all relevant and available facts when determining whether to grant or deny a postponement.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>By the time that a self-represented defendant requests a postponement to obtain counsel after having expressly waived the right to counsel, multiple procedural safeguards under Maryland Rule 4-215(b) have already protected the defendant.

R. 4\u2014215(a)(2); \u201c[a]dvise the defendant of the nature of the charges in the charging document, and the allowable penalties, including mandatory penalties, if any[,]\u201d Md. R. 4-215(a)(3); and, \u201c[i]f trial is to be conducted on a subsequent date, advise the defendant that if the defendant appears for trial without counsel, the court could determine that the defendant waived counsel and proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel.\u201d Md. R. 4-215(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Here, in accepting Howard\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel, the circuit court complied with Maryland Rule 4-215. The circuit court made certain that Howard had received a copy of the charging document containing notice as to the right to counsel; informed Howard of the right to counsel and the importance of assistance of counsel; and ensured that Howard was aware of the allowable penalties for the charges. Afterward, Howard expressly waived the right to counsel. Given that Howard had been properly advised of the right to counsel under Maryland Rule 4\u2014215(b), the circuit court was under no obligation to question Howard further as to his desire to obtain counsel five days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>B. Motion to Postpone to Review Discovery Materials</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Here, we conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion to postpone because Howard alleged that, within the previous week, the State had provided him with discovery materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In short, after discharging two lawyers and expressly waiving the right to counsel, Howard requested a postponement. Howard contends that the request for a postponement was based, in part, on his desire to review discovery materials. The State argues that Howard\u2019s request for a postponement was limited to a request for counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Without addressing the accuracy of Howard\u2019s contention, we conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Howard\u2019s postponement request under either circumstance. As Howard\u2019s counsel conceded at oral argument, the State complied with Maryland Rule 4-263 (Discovery in Circuit Court). The trial judge found that the State timely provided discovery to Howard\u2019s counsel. As the State points out, Maryland Rule 4-263 does not require the State to reissue discovery materials to a self-represented defendant who has discharged counsel. By way of comparison, we observe that a trial court is under no obligation to grant a motion to postpone even when confronted with a discovery violation; <em>ie., </em>under that circumstance, the trial court may exercise its discretion to fashion any remedy that it deems appropriate. <em>See </em>Md. R. 4-263(n) (\u201cIf at any time during the proceedings the court finds that a party has failed to comply with this Rule ..., the court may order that party to permit the discovery of the matters not previously disclosed, ... grant a reasonable continuance, ... or enter any other order appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d). Where there has been no violation of Maryland Rule 4-263, the trial court is under even less of an onus to grant a motion to postpone to review discovery materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The record indicates that, far in advance of January 26, 2011 (the date on which Howard moved to postpone), Howard was on notice of this case\u2019s complexity and seriousness. On De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>cember 2, 2008, Howard was arraigned in the circuit court. At that time, Howard would have been advised of the nature of the charges pending against him\u2014first-degree rape and first-degree sexual offense\u2014and of the maximum penalty\u2014 imprisonment for life. On May 5, 2009, in the circuit court, Howard stated: \u201c[T]hey took my DNA four times.\u201d Clearly, as of May 5, 2009, Howard knew that this case involved DNA evidence. On October 27, 2010 (the date on which Howard discharged his second lawyer), the circuit court again advised Howard that the maximum penalty for first-degree rape and first-degree sexual offense was imprisonment for life. Thus, Howard was again made aware that he faced extremely serious charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The record indicates that Howard was also made aware that discharging his second lawyer carried serious consequences. On October 27, 2010, the circuit court informed Howard of the importance of assistance of counsel, and informed Howard that trial would proceed as scheduled with Howard unrepresented by counsel if Howard discharged counsel and did not obtain new counsel. Thus, Howard knowingly and voluntarily decided to discharge his second lawyer even though he was aware that his case involved complex DNA evidence and that he could be convicted of an offense with a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">We find no merit in Howard\u2019s contention that the trial judge erred in failing to expressly find that a postponement would not have been in the interest of justice. In denying Howard\u2019s motion to postpone, the trial judge observed that the case was \u201cold,\u201d that Howard had moved to dismiss for violation of his right to a speedy trial, that discovery had been provided to Howard\u2019s counsel, and that the court was \u201cnot unconvinced\u201d that Howard had not been \u201cprivy\u201d to discovery, but that this was a consequence that Howard faced by discharging his lawyer. The trial judge also noted that Howard had discharged two lawyers. Although the trial judge did not state that it considered whether granting the postponement was in the interest of justice, the trial judge took into account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>factors such as the age of the case, motions to dismiss, and Howard\u2019s discharge of counsel. Hence, the trial judge considered this case\u2019s unique circumstances and denied the postponement request.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Maryland Rule 4-215(b) does not require that, in denying a motion to postpone, a trial court expressly announce that a postponement would not be in the interest of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Under these circumstances, we are not at all convinced that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying the motion to postpone to review discovery materials. See Md. R. 4-215(b); <em>Kusi v. State, </em>438 Md. 362, 386, 91 A.3d 1192, 1205 (2014) (\u201cA trial court [ ] abuses its discretion when[ ] no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court [ ] ... or when the court acts without reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (Ellipsis and last two alterations in original)). <em>See also Jones, </em>403 Md. at 291, 941 A.2d at 1096 (\u201c[A] discretionary ruling will generally not be deemed an abuse of discretion unless it is well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court or is beyond the fringe of what the reviewing court deems minimally acceptable.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Howard contends that his constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated because of the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, his assertion of his right, and presumed prejudice to him. The State responds that Howard\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated because of the neutral reasons for the delay and the lack of actual prejudice to Howard.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">An appellate court reviews without deference a trial court\u2019s conclusion as to whether a defendant\u2019s constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>right to a speedy trial was violated. <em>See Glover v. State, </em>368 Md. 211, 220, 792 A.2d 1160, 1165 (2002) (\u201cIn reviewing the judgment on a motion to dismiss for violation of the constitutional right to a speedy trial, we make our own independent constitutional analysis.\u201d (Citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy ... trial[.]\u201d U.S. Const, amend.

None of these four factors alone establishes a violation of the right to a speedy trial; thus, a court considers the four factors \u201ctogether[.]\u201d Barker, 407 U.S. at 533, 92 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Here, we conclude that Howard\u2019s right to a speedy trial was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">As to the length of the delay, Howard\u2019s trial began approximately twenty-eight months after Howard\u2019s arrest.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Generally, a delay of \u201cat least ... one year\u201d \u201ctrigger[s] a speedy trial analysis[.]\u201d <em>Doggett v.

However, \u201cthe length of the delay is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>least determinative of the four factors that [a court] consider^] in\u201d determining whether a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial was violated. <em>State v. Kanneh, </em>403 Md. 678, 690, 944 A.2d 516, 522 (2008). Indeed, in <em>Kanneh, id. </em>at 694, 688, 944 A.2d at 525, 521, this Court held that a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial was not violated where the defendant\u2019s trial began approximately thirty-five months after the defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In the aggregate, the reasons for the delay are neutral. Howard caused 183 days of delay because he discharged his first lawyer and his second lawyer needed time to prepare.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Neither party caused 223 days of delay;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> thus, the reason for such delay was neutral. Both parties caused 71 days of delay;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> thus, the reason for such delay was neutral. The State caused 270 days of delay due to States\u2019 witnesses\u2019 unavailability;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> however, \u201ca valid reason, such as a missing witness, should serve to justify appropriate delay.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. 2182. The State also caused 98 days of delay because Howard\u2019s counsel had not yet received DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>test results;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> however, \u201c[wjhere, as here, a postponement is the result of the unavailability of DNA evidence, and there is no evidence that the State failed to act in a diligent manner, the grounds for postponement are essentially neutral and justified.\u201d <em>Kanneh, </em>403 Md. at 690, 944 A.2d at 523 (citing <em>Glover, </em>368 Md. at 226, 792 A.2d at 1169).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">As the State concedes, Howard \u201cfrequently and strongly asserted his right to a speedy trial\u201d through motions filed on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Howard, however, does not allege that the delay caused him actual prejudice; and a review of the record demonstrates that the delay did not cause any actual prejudice. In his brief, Howard exclusively relies on \u201c[t]he assumed inherent prejudice\u201d and does not explicitly allege that he suffered \u201coppressive pretrial incarceration [or] anxiety and concern\u201d;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and, even more importantly, Howard does not allege that his \u201cdefense [was] impaired.\u201d <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 654, 112 S.Ct. 2686 (quoting <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. 2182) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 654, 112 S.Ct. 2686 (Impairment of a defense is \u201cthe most serious\u201d form of prejudice to a defendant. (Quoting <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. 2182)). Howard does not speculate\u2014much less proffer\u2014that the delay caused any evidence to go missing, caused any witnesses to become unavailable, or caused any memory to fade. Indeed, some of the delay was intended to benefit Howard by allowing time for him to be assigned a new lawyer after he discharged his first lawyer and allowing time for the second lawyer to prepare.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Weighing all four factors, we conclude that the lack of actual prejudice and the neutral reasons for the delay outweigh the length of the delay and Howard\u2019s assertion of his right to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>speedy trial.

Although the circuit court did not state that it charged the State for the fifth postponement, we infer that the circuit court charged the State for the fifth postponement because Howard objected to the postponement, which the State had requested primarily on the ground that a State\u2019s witness was unavailable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\">. Although the record does not reveal the circumstances of Howard's discharge of his first lawyer, the record indicates that Howard had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>expressed animosity towards his first lawyer. For example, on January 22, 2010, on his own behalf, Howard filed a \u201cMotion to Suppress\u201d in which he alleged that his first lawyer had \"been working to deny him his IV and VI Amendment rights[J\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b470-10\">.

CP \u00a7 6-103(b) and Maryland Rule 4-271(a)(l) are substantively identical to their predecessors. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Art. 27, \u00a7 591(a) (\"The date established for the trial of the matter shall not be postponed except for good cause ... and only with the permission of the administrative judge[.]\u201d); Md.

This is not the first instance in which the Court has distinguished a grant of a motion to postpone from a denial of a motion to postpone; in many cases, this Court has noted that only a county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee may grant a motion to postpone. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>298 Md. 422, 453, 470 A.2d 1269, 1285 (1984) (\"[T]he administrative judge or his [or her] designee, rather than any judge, order[s] the postponement.\u201d); <em>Calhoun v.

Although we agree with the State that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion to postpone, we do not address the State\u2019s contention that Howard moved to postpone only to obtain counsel, not to review discovery materials; instead, we assume, without deciding, that Howard moved to postpone both to obtain counsel and to review discovery materials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b479-5\">.
