Husband filed a complaint against Zhang with the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">On April 15, 2013, on the Commission\u2019s behalf, Bar Counsel filed in this Court a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Zhang, charging her with violating Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) 1.1 (Competence), 1.2 (Scope of Representation), 1.4 (Communication), 1.7 (Conflict of Interest: General Rule), 3.7 (Lawyer as Witness), 4.1 (Truthfulness in Statements to Others), 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation), 8.4(d) (Conduct That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice), and 8.4(a) (Violating the MLRPC). On May 28, 2013, Bar Counsel filed in this Court an \u201cAmended Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d to add charges that Zhang violated MLRPC 1.16 (Declining or Terminating Representation), 3.1 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions), 5.5 (Unauthorized Practice of Law), and 7.4 (Communication of Fields of Practice), as well as the corresponding Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cVRPC\u201d) and District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cDCRPC\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>On April 17, 2013, this Court designated the Honorable Michael John Algeo (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to hear this attorney discipline proceeding. On August 29, 2013, the hearing judge conducted a hearing. On October 24, 2013, the hearing judge filed in this Court findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that Zhang violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.4(a), 1.7(a), 1.16(a), 3.1, 3.7(a), 4.1(a), 5.5(a), 7.4(a), 8.4(c), 8.4(d), and 8.4(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">On May 6, 2014, we heard oral argument. For the below reasons, we disbar Zhang.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In his opinion, the hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">On June 21, 2000, this Court admitted Zhang to the Bar of Maryland. Zhang maintains a solo practice, The Law Offices of Runan Zhang, with offices in Rockville, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Zhang\u2019s website states that she specializes in immigration and corporate practice, and that she practices family law in Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">On April 10, 2010, Wife, Zhang\u2019s niece, a non-United States citizen, married Husband, a United States citizen, in Fairfax, Virginia. On April 21, 2010, Zhang filed a Form 1-130 (Petition for Alien Relative), with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) on Husband\u2019s behalf for Wife\u2019s benefit. From April 2010 until she withdrew her appearance on November 26, 2010, Zhang represented Husband in the immigration matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>By November 2010, Husband and Wife had separated, and Wife wished to pursue an annulment of the marriage. In November 2010, Zhang assisted Wife in drafting a complaint for annulment that Wife could file <em>pro se </em>in the Virginia Court. Zhang was not a member of the Bar of Virginia and, accordingly, asked her colleague, Diana Metcalf (\u201cMetcalf\u2019), \u201cto serve as co-counsel.\u201d Metcalf is a member of both the Bar of Maryland and the Bar of Virginia, and had shared office space with Zhang in Rockville, Maryland since approximately 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">On November 11, 2010, Zhang and Metcalf agreed: (1) that they would represent Wife as co-counsel; and (2) that Metcalf would move for Zhang\u2019s admission to the Virginia Court <em>pro hac vice. </em>An agreement memorializing those two points was drafted but not executed. At the beginning of the representation, Zhang provided Wife\u2019s e-mail address to Metcalf, but advised that Wife did not fluently speak English, and that Metcalf would thus be unable to directly communicate with Wife. Zhang assumed the responsibility of directly communicating with Wife. In reliance on Zhang\u2019s advisement concerning Wife\u2019s inability to fluently speak English, Metcalf had no direct contact with Wife from November 2010, when she was first retained, until March 1, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">On November 15, 2010, Zhang recognized that she had a conflict of interest due to her representation of Husband in the immigration matter, so she did not enter her appearance in the annulment matter. Instead of resolving the conflict, Zhang deliberately and consciously chose to continue to act as counsel in all matters except for entering her appearance in the annulment matter and disclosing the representation to the Virginia Court. On November 18, 2010, Wife, <em>pro se, </em>filed in the Virginia Court a Complaint for Annulment, which had been prepared by Zhang on Wife\u2019s behalf. Although Zhang had prepared the complaint for annulment, Wife filed the complaint for annulment <em>pro se </em>in an attempt to conceal from the Virginia Court Zhang\u2019s conflict of interest and role as Wife\u2019s counsel. The complaint for annulment contained allegations of immigration fraud as to the marriage and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Petition for Alien Relative that Zhang had filed on Husband\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">On December 10, 2010, Husband, through his attorney Leon S. Demsky (\u201cDemsky\u201d), filed a demurrer to the complaint for annulment. On January 7, 2011, Zhang, Metcalf, and Demsky appeared in the Virginia Court for a hearing, and Metcalf entered her appearance as Wife\u2019s counsel. At some point before the hearing, Zhang and Metcalf had negotiated an agreement (\u201cthe January Agreement\u201d) with Husband and Demsky. The January Agreement provided that Husband would withdraw the demurrer, Wife would amend the complaint for annulment, and the parties would seek only an annulment, not monetary or other equitable relief. Based on Zhang\u2019s assurances that Wife had consented to the January Agreement\u2019s terms, Metcalf signed the January Agreement on Wife\u2019s behalf. Although Zhang assured Metcalf that Wife had consented to the terms of the January Agreement, in actuality, Zhang had not discussed the terms of the January Agreement with Wife before its execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">After execution of the January Agreement, the parties could not agree on the ground for the annulment. As a result, Husband, through Demsky, filed a second demurrer. Meanwhile, Zhang, who was acting as Wife\u2019s immigration attorney, arranged for Wife to obtain a visa to travel from China to the United States to participate at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">On February 9, 2011, Zhang conducted legal research and prepared an amended complaint for annulment and an opposition to the second demurrer, and offered to Metcalf to file the pleadings under Metcalfs name or Wife\u2019s name. On February 10, 2011, with Metcalfs permission, Zhang signed Metcalfs name to the opposition, which she filed in the Virginia Court. On February 16, 2011, Metcalf filed in the Virginia Court the amended complaint for annulment.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">On February 17, 2011, Michael W. Lu (\u201cLu\u201d), Demsky\u2019s co-counsel, e-mailed Zhang to explore potential settlement of the annulment matter. Lu suggested that an annulment be pursued on the grounds of misunderstanding and mutual mistake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>based on the circumstance: \u201cthat Wife, due to immigration issues, had been unable to return to the United States following the marriage to complete the marriage ceremonies, and that while the parties had registered for marriage, the marriage was never consummated.\u201d As Wife\u2019s \u201clegal counsel,\u201d Zhang e-mailed Lu that mutual misunderstanding and mutual mistake were not acceptable grounds for the annulment; Zhang instead suggested that the parties pursue an annulment based on an alleged medical condition of Husband, namely, impotency. As of February 17, 2011, when the e-mail exchange between Zhang and Lu occurred, Zhang had never discussed with Wife whether the couple had engaged in marital relations, and had no basis to pursue an annulment based on impotency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Zhang and Lu eventually agreed that Husband would pay $1,500 for a \u201cglobal settlement\u201d and \u201cadmit he has an impotency problem.\u201d On February 17, 2011, at 6:25 p.m., Zhang forwarded to Metcalf a copy of her e-mail correspondence with Lu with the message: \u2018We may need to sign an agreement in court tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">On the morning of February 18, 2011, Metcalf appeared in the Virginia Court to argue in opposition to the second demurrer. Metcalf had not read the e-mail that Zhang had sent the previous evening, and thus was not aware that any settlement discussions had occurred between Zhang and Lu. Approximately fifteen minutes before the hearing, Zhang advised Metcalf that Husband was \u201cimpotent\u201d and that, the previous night, Zhang and Lu had reached an agreement under which Wife would pursue an annulment based on Husband\u2019s medical condition. Metcalf questioned Zhang about how Husband\u2019s medical condition was discovered at such a late date, and inquired about the details of the negotiations. Zhang assured Metcalf that Wife had participated in the negotiations and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>she had communicated with Wife and Lu late into the evening until the agreement was reached. Wife had not, however, participated in the settlement discussions that occurred on February 17, 2011. In actuality, it was not until February 19, 2011, that Zhang, for the first time, discussed the terms of the agreement with Wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">On February 18, 2011, before the hearing began, Demsky, Metcalf, and Zhang negotiated the final terms of the settlement agreement (\u201cthe February Agreement\u201d), which, in pertinent part, provided that Husband would pay Wife $2,000 as full and complete settlement of all claims, and that Husband \u201cagrees that the annulment is uncontested, he will not object, defend, or contest any Complaint for Annulment based upon [his] being impotent[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Prior to execution of the February Agreement, Zhang told Metcalf that: (1) she (Zhang) had discussed the terms of the February Agreement with Wife; (2) Wife understood and agreed to the terms; and (3) Wife authorized Metcalf to sign the February Agreement on her behalf. Metcalf was concerned about the implications of signing the February Agreement without speaking with Wife, and repeatedly asked Zhang whether Wife had agreed to the February Agreement\u2019s terms. Zhang repeatedly responded that Wife had agreed to the terms and authorized Metcalf to sign the February Agreement. In reliance on Zhang\u2019s representations, Metcalf signed the February Agreement on Wife\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">On February 18, 2011, Demsky and Metcalf submitted to the Virginia Court a proposed consent order reflecting the February Agreement\u2019s terms. The Honorable Lon E. Ferris signed the proposed consent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">On February 19, 2011, for the first time, Zhang spoke with Wife about the February Agreement. Wife immediately advised Zhang that Husband was not, in fact, \u201cimpotent.\u201d Instead of informing Metcalf at that time that the February Agreement had been signed without Wife\u2019s authorization, Zhang attempted to negotiate additional terms binding Husband to the February Agreement. On February 25, 2011, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the first time, Zhang admitted to Metcalf that she had not discussed the terms of the February Agreement with Wife prior to its execution and that Wife had advised her that Husband did not have the alleged medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">On March 1, 2011, Wife directly contacted Metcalf for the first time, sending an email in which she wrote, in fluent English, that: (1) she had not been advised of the terms of the February Agreement before its execution; (2) Husband was not \u201cimpotent\u201d; and (3) she did not consent to or authorize the execution of the February Agreement. Between March 1 and March 3, 2011, Zhang and Metcalf researched Virginia law and drafted a motion to set aside the February Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">On March 3, 2011, Zhang filed in the Virginia Court a motion to set aside the February Agreement and consent order. The Virginia Court scheduled a hearing on the motion for March 18, 2011. Between March 3 and March 18, 2011, Zhang worked with Metcalf, as co-counsel, to prepare for the hearing. As part of that preparation, Zhang drafted notes and an argument for Metcalf. The notes that Zhang prepared contained multiple misrepresentations, including that: (1) Wife had given Metcalf \u201cgeneral authorization\u201d to settle the case; (2) Husband had \u201cdemanded to get the settlement done in court on February 18, 2011\u201d; and (3) there had been a \u201cmiscommunieation\u201d between Metcalf and Wife \u201cdue to language difficulties.\u201d As a means of shielding herself from her misconduct <em>(ie., </em>her misrepresentation to Metcalf that Wife authorized her to sign the February Agreement), Zhang attempted to persuade Metcalf to make these misrepresentations to the Virginia Court in support of the motion to set aside the February Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">On March 18, 2011, Zhang, Metcalf, and Demsky appeared in the Virginia Court for the hearing on the motion to set aside. Metcalf advised the Virginia Court that Zhang had assured her that Wife knew of and agreed to the February Agreement\u2019s terms. The Virginia Court vacated the February 18, 2011 consent order, and stated that an attempted fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>had been perpetrated on the Virginia Court and that there was no good faith basis for the \u201cimpotency\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">On April 7, 2011, Husband filed in the Virginia Court a counter-complaint for divorce. In response to interrogatories that Husband propounded, Wife identified Zhang as a potential witness related to the immigration representation and allegations of events that occurred before and during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">On August 18, 2011, the Virginia Court denied Wife\u2019s complaint for annulment. At some point afterward, Husband and Wife were granted a divorce based on mutual separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In short, the hearing judge found as follows concerning Zhang\u2019s role in the representation of Wife:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">Beginning in November 2010 and continuing at all relevant times thereto, [Zhang] represented Wife in her pursuit of an annulment and divorce in Prince William County, Virginia. Although [Zhang] did not enter her appearance in the [Virginia Court], there is no question that she was acting as an attorney as she provided legal counsel, advice, and representation to Wife as co-counsel to [ ] Metcalf [ ]. [Zhang] provided legal advice, drafted pleadings and motions, assisted in preparation for hearings, conducted legal research, and participated in settlement negotiations on behalf of Wife. [Zhang] also stated to [Lu] that she represented Wife. The Court finds [Zhang]\u2019s argument that she was not acting as an attorney and only as a \u201cconcerned family member\u201d to be without merit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">In an attorney discipline proceeding, this Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and reviews without deference the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-759(b)(l) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals shall review de novo the [hearing] judge\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d); Md. R. 16-759(b)(2)(B) (\u201cThe Court shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>nesses.\u201d); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fader, </em>431 Md. 395, 426, 66 A.3d 18, 36 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">As to exceptions, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bocchino, </em>435 Md. 505, 529, 80 A.3d 222, 235 (2013), we recently reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">When a party files exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, those exceptions will be overruled so long as the findings are not clearly erroneous. When a party takes exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, those exceptions will be overruled so long as the conclusions are supported by the facts found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AH0\">A. Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Zhang moves to dismiss this attorney discipline proceeding on the grounds that the MLRPC do not apply to her conduct and that the Amended Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action was not sufficiently clear and specific to inform her of which rules of professional conduct applied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">We conclude that the MLRPC apply to Zhang\u2019s conduct. Zhang had a law office in Maryland, and shared with Metcalf a conference room in a building in which Metcalf rented law office space in Maryland. As did the hearing judge implicitly, we reasonably infer that a substantial part of Zhang\u2019s conduct (including her representation that Wife had difficulty communicating in English, her soliciting Metcalf to serve as co-counsel, her authoring notes for Metcalf, and her discussions and preparation with Metcalf about the case) occurred in Maryland. Generally, \u201cthe rule[s] of professional conduct to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>be applied shall be ... the rules of the jurisdiction in which the lawyer\u2019s conduct occurred[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.5(b)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We conclude that the Amended Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action was \u201csufficiently clear and specific to inform [Zhang] of any professional misconduct charged[.]\u201d Md. R. 16-751(c). In the Amended Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, Bar Counsel charged Zhang with violating rules of professional conduct that have substantively identical counterparts in the MLRPC, VRPC, and DCRPC.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, Zhang fails to identify any material conflict among the MLRPC, VRPC, and DCRPC in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">For the above reasons, we deny the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">B. Contentions Other Than Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">We address (and reject) Zhang\u2019s five contentions that do not constitute exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>First, we reject Zhang\u2019s contention that Bar Counsel inhibited her ability to contact Husband before the hearing. Bar Counsel offered to attempt to facilitate a telephonic or electronic deposition of Husband. Additionally, Bar Counsel provided Zhang\u2019s counsel with Husband\u2019s address. Thus, Bar Counsel actually facilitated Zhang\u2019s ability to contact Husband before the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Second, we reject Zhang\u2019s contention that her rights were violated because she could not confront the complainant <em>(i.e., </em>Husband), who did not testify at the hearing. The right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of Maryland Declaration of Rights applies to a criminal case, not an attorney discipline proceeding. <em>Cf. Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Marcalus, </em>414 Md. 501, 521, 996 A.2d 350, 362 (2010) (\u201cAn attorney disciplinary proceeding ... is not governed by the same standard of proof as a criminal trial, and it does not demand the same evidentiary burdens as does a criminal prosecution.\u201d (Citation omitted)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Third, we reject Zhang\u2019s contention that the hearing judge erred in sustaining Bar Counsel\u2019s objections after Zhang\u2019s counsel asked Metcalf: \u201cWhat provision of the Maryland or Virginia or the District of Columbia rules excuses you from having to communicate directly with your client?\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\u201c[A]re you aware of any exception to Rule 1.4 in Maryland or Virginia that creates an exception excusing you in communicating directly with your client?\u201d; and \u201cIsn\u2019t the critical inquiry whether or not there is confidential information that is being used in one representation to the next?\u201d Zhang\u2019s counsel asked for Metcalfs opinion about the MLRPC, VRPC, DCRPC, and conflicts of interest. The hearing judge had not admitted Metcalf as an expert in the fields of the MLRPC, VRPC, DCRPC, or conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Fourth, we reject Zhang\u2019s contention that the hearing judge erred in sustaining Bar Counsel\u2019s objections after Zhang\u2019s counsel asked Zhang: \u201cGoing back to your representation in the immigration matter, did you obtain from [Husband] any confidential information during the course of that representation?\u201d; and \u201cIn the course of your immigration representation, did you obtain any information from [Husband] aside from his name, address, and that he would be the sponsor for [Wife]\u2019s immigration application?\u201d Zhang\u2019s counsel asked for confidential information. Generally, \u201c[a] lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a dient[J\u201d MLRPC 1.6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Fifth, we reject Zhang\u2019s contention that the hearing judge erred in declining to admit into evidence the Commission\u2019s investigator\u2019s report. In so contending, Zhang cites multiple exceptions to the rule against hearsay, but fails to explain why any such exception applies to the Commission\u2019s- investigator\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">C. Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The Commission does not except to any of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. Zhang excepts to a multitude of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. We sustain only one of Zhang\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">First, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that her website stated that she practiced family law in Virginia. The hearing judge admitted into evidence printouts of Zhang\u2019s website, which contained a page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>that was entitled \u201cRepresentation in Civil Action, especially family law practice\u201d and, below \u201cPractices includ[e,]\u201d included a link to <em>\u201cType of divorce at Virginia.\u201d </em>Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that Zhang\u2019s website stated that she practiced family law in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Second, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she filed a Form 1-130 (Petition for Alien Relative) with USCIS on Husband\u2019s behalf for Wife\u2019s benefit. The Form 1-130 states that Husband is \u201cthe petitioner\u201d and that \u201c[y]our relative <em>[i.e., </em>Wife] is the beneficiary.\u201d Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that Zhang filed the Form 1-130 with USCIS on Husband\u2019s behalf for Wife\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Third, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she represented Husband in the immigration matter \u201cfrom April 2010 until ... November 26, 2010.\u201d On April 21, 2010, Zhang filed the Form 1-130 with USCIS. In a letter dated August 3, 2010, Husband informed the USCIS that he was withdrawing the Form I-130.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In a letter dated November 26, 2010, Zhang informed USCIS: \u201cIt came to my attention recently that [Husband] ... has withdrawn his petition ..., therefore, this is my notice that I am no longer on this case[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). The record contains no written communications that indicate that Zhang learned about Husband\u2019s letter before November 2010. Thus, the hearing j\u00fcdge did not clearly err in finding that Zhang represented Husband in the immigration matter \u201cfrom April 2010 until ... November 26, 2010[,]\u201d when she notified USCIS that she was no longer involved with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Fourth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she drafted the complaint for annulment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>that Wife filed <em>pro se. </em>On November 15, 2010, Zhang emailed Metcalf, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">I got all the documents ready for filing the annu[ ]lment case in VA. But realized that I was the counsel representing both [Wife] and [Husband.] If he hired a[ ] lawyer, they would disqualify me for the conflict interest. I am thinking to file the complaint first as the pro se case, and get you involved when the court hearing comes up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">(Emphasis added). Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that Zhang drafted the complaint that Wife filed <em>pro se </em>in the annulment/divorce matter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Fifth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she provided legal advice to Wife and represented Wife in the annulment/divorce matter. As Zhang has acknowledged, she drafted pleadings, prepared for hearings, and conducted legal research on Wife\u2019s behalf. Metcalf testified that it had been her understanding that Zhang would represent Wife in the annulment/divorce matter, and that Metcalf was \u201cto sponsor [ ] Zhang, who is not admitted to practice in Virginia pro hac vice.\u201d And, the hearing judge expressly discredited Zhang\u2019s allegation that she acted only as a concerned relative of Wife. In any event, \u201ca personal relationship ... with a purported \u2018client\u2019 does not preclude a court from finding that an attorney-client relationship exists.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shoup, </em>410 Md. 462, 489, 979 A.2d 120, 136 (2009) (citation omitted). Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that Zhang provided legal advice to Wife and represented Wife in the annulment/divorce matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Sixth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she informed Lu that she represented Wife in the annulment/divorce matter. On February 17, 2011, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Zhang e-mailed Lu, stating that, as Wife\u2019s \u201clegal counsel[,]\u201d she could not agree to a proposed ground for annulment. (Emphasis added). Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that Zhang informed Lu that she represented Wife in the annulment/divorce matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Seventh, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she was Metcalfs \u201ccolleague\u201d and, per agreement, co-counsel in the annulment/divorce matter. At the hearing, in at least three instances, Metcalf testified that Zhang was her \u201cco-counsel.\u201d Additionally, the record establishes that, on at least two occasions, Zhang and Metcalf met to discuss Wife\u2019s case, the possible grounds for annulment, the complaint for annulment, and Metcalfs sponsoring Zhang for <em>pro hac vice </em>admission before the Virginia Court. Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that Zhang was Metcalfs \u201ccolleague\u201d and, per agreement, co-counsel in the annulment/divorce matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Eighth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she recognized she had a conflict of interest and deliberately and consciously chose to continue to act as counsel in all manners except for entering her appearance in the annulment matter and disclosing the representation to the Virginia Court. On November 15, 2010, Zhang emailed Metcalf, stating that she \u201crealized that [she]was the counsel representing both [Wife] and [Husband] in the green card application immigration case. If he hired a[] lawyer, they would disqualify me for the conflict interest.\u201d (Emphasis added). Additionally, Metcalf testified that she did not sponsor Zhang for <em>pro hac vice </em>admission because Zhang remembered that she \u201chad represented [H]usband in the sponsorship of her other family member[,]\u201d and thus \u201ccould not now represent an opposing party to him in a divorce.\u201d Nonetheless, Zhang continued representing Wife by drafting pleadings, preparing for and attending hearings, and participating in settlement negotiations. Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that Zhang recognized she had a conflict of interest and deliberately and consciously chose to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>continue to act as Wife\u2019s counsel in all manners except for entering her appearance in the annulment matter and disclosing the representation to the Virginia Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Ninth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she informed Metcalf that Wife did not fluently speak English and would not be able to directly communicate with Metcalf. At the hearing, Metcalf testified that Zhang informed her that Wife \u201cwanted all of the communication to go through [ ] Zhang\u201d and that Wife\u2019s \u201cEnglish was not very good[.]\u201d Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that Zhang informed Metcalf that Wife did not fluently speak English and would not be able to directly communicate with Metcalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Tenth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she \u201cappeared\u201d in the Virginia Court for hearings on January 7, 2011 and March 18, 2011. The context of the hearing judge\u2019s opinion makes clear that the hearing judge found that Zhang was physically present in the Virginia Court, not that Zhang had entered an appearance in the Virginia Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Eleventh, we sustain Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Metcalf signed the January Agreement on Wife\u2019s behalf \u201cbased on [Zhang]\u2019s assurances that Wife consented to the terms\u201d; the record indicates that Metcalf signed the January Agreement based on Zhang\u2019s assurances that Metcalf was authorized to sign the agreement because Zhang \u201chad authority to speak for\u201d Wife. At the hearing, Metcalf testified: \u201cZhang represented that communications by [Wife]\u2019s request would go through [Zhang, a]nd that [Zhang] had authority to speak for\u201d Wife. At a deposition, Zhang testified that: (1) Wife and Wife\u2019s parents had authorized Zhang \u201cto make the decision for the best for\u201d Wife; (2) Zhang had informed Metcalf that Metcalf was authorized to sign the January Agreement on Wife\u2019s behalf; and (3) although Zhang spoke with Wife and Wife\u2019s parents before the January 7, 2011, hearing, Zhang did not discuss the January Agreement\u2019s terms, which had not been determined yet. Thus, the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>judge\u2019s finding that Zhang assured Metcalf that Wife specifically consented to the terms of the January Agreement was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Twelfth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she did not discuss the January Agreement\u2019s terms with Wife before its execution. The record demonstrates that neither Zhang nor Metcalf discussed the January Agreement\u2019s terms with Wife before its execution, and that Metcalf executed the January Agreement in reliance on Zhang\u2019s representation that Zhang had the authority to speak for Wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Thirteenth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that, on February 9, 2011, she prepared an amended complaint for annulment and opposition to be filed under Metcalfs or Wife\u2019s name. On February 9, 2011, Zhang e-mailed Metcalf, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">I am going to Manassas tomorrow, will file the amended complaint and the opposition tomorrow. I called the clerk, she said the judge order[ed] the amendment to [the] complaint, [so] I changed the complaint to a simple form based on the fraud. I can file under your name or my niece\u2019s name whichever you prefer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that, on February 9, 2011, Zhang prepared an amended complaint and opposition to be filed under Metcalfs or Wife\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Fourteenth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that \u201c[b]ecause Wife was the Plaintiff, she carried the burden of affirmatively proving the grounds for annulment.\u201d As Zhang concedes, this is an accurate statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">Fifteenth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that on February 17, 2011, she \u201cimmediately made clear [to Lu] that Wife sought an annulment, by whatever avenue may be available.\u201d On February 17, 2011, in response to Lu\u2019s email about a potential settlement of the case, Zhang e-mailed Lu, stating that Wife was \u201cwilling to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>fight in the court for the annulment^]\u201d Wife\u2019s \u201cgoal [wa]s to annul the marriage,\u201d and \u201cthe cour[t] has to grant the annulment.\u201d Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that Zhang made it clear to Lu that Wife wanted an annulment through any available means.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Sixteenth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she suggested the parties pursue an annulment on the ground of Husband\u2019s alleged \u201cimpotency.\u201d On February 17, 2011, in response to Lu\u2019s settlement offer, Zhang emailed Lu, rejecting the proposed settlement and suggesting for the first time: \u201cYou might consider the following ground for the annulment: Grounds for annulment can also include impotency.... If a marriage was never consummated, this constitutes viable grounds for annulment.\u201d (Paragraph break omitted). Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that it was Zhang who first suggested that the parties pursue an annulment on the ground of Husband\u2019s alleged \u201cimpotency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Seventeenth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she misunderstood the difference between failure to consummate a marriage and \u201cimpotency\u201d and did not have any basis in fact to suggest either as a ground for annulment. At the hearing, Zhang testified that her only research as to failure to consummate a marriage consisted of \u201cGoogling\u201d the phrase \u201cno marriage consummation\u201d and reading that \u201cno consummation [was] equal to[, and was] a ground for impotency.\u201d Zhang admitted that she did not know what \u201cimpotency\u201d meant, but \u201cassumed it was the same as the no consummation.\u201d At a deposition, Zhang also admitted that, prior to negotiating with Lu, she had not discussed with Wife whether the couple had engaged in marital relations. Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that Zhang misunderstood the distinction between failure to consummate a marriage and impotency, and that she lacked a basis for suggesting either as a ground for annulment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Eighteenth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she told Metcalf that she had spoken with Wife and obtained her consent to the February Agreement. Metcalf testified that, on February 18, 2011, Zhang advised that the parties had reached an agreement to pursue an annulment based on Husband\u2019s \u201cimpotency,\u201d and led her to believe that Wife had actively participated in the negotiations. Metcalf testified that she repeatedly asked Zhang whether she had discussed the terms with Wife and whether Wife was \u201cokay\u201d with the February Agreement, and Zhang responded affirmatively. Metcalf testified that, afterward, Zhang informed her \u201cthat she had not, in fact, talked to [Wife] the night of the 17th.\u201d Zhang\u2019s testimony confirms that she did not speak with Wife during the negotiation process or prior to execution of the February Agreement; according to Zhang, she did not speak with Wife until the day after the February Agreement was signed. Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that Zhang told Metcalf that she had spoken with Wife and obtained Wife\u2019s consent to the February Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Nineteenth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she attempted to persuade Met-calf to make misrepresentations to the Virginia Court in support of the Motion to shield herself from her misconduct-namely, misrepresenting to Metcalf that Wife authorized her to sign the February Agreement. On March 17, 2011, Zhang provided Metcalf notes containing a \u201cstatement that [she] could make or that [she] could use in [her] preparations for what [she] was going to say to the\u201d Virginia Court. The statement contained multiple misrepresentations, including that: (1) Wife had given Metcalf \u201cgeneral authorization\u201d to settle the case; (2) Husband \u201cdemanded to get the settlement done in court on February 18, 2011\u201d; and (3) there was \u201cmiscommunication\u201d between Metcalf and Wife due to \u201clanguage difficulties.\u201d Zhang\u2019s notes did not mention Zhang or the role she played during the settlement negotiations. Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that, to shield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>herself from her misconduct, Zhang attempted to persuade Metcalf to make misrepresentations to the Virginia Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Twentieth, we overrule Zhang\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that the Virginia Court stated that an attempted fraud had been perpetrated on the Virginia Court and that there was no good faith basis for the \u201cimpotency\u201d claim. The hearing judge admitted into evidence a transcript of the March 18, 2011, hearing before the Virginia Court. According to the transcript, the Virginia Court granted the motion to set aside and stated: \u201cThis is a mutual fraud on the Court ... I\u2019m going to vacate the prior order as there is no good faith basis for the impotency claim on either party.\u201d Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that the Virginia Court stated an attempted fraud had been perpetrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">D. Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The Commission does not except to any of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. As a preliminary matter, Zhang contends that the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law \u201care categorically flawed\u201d because the hearing judge applied the MLRPC and failed to \u201cdifferentiate predicate facts underlying Virginia [R]ule violations and predicate facts underlying Maryland Rule violations.\u201d For the above reasons, the hearing judge properly applied the MLRPC to the facts of this case. We, therefore, overrule this general exception. Next, we address Zhang\u2019s specific exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">MLRPC 1.1 (Competence)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Zhang excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s determination that she violated MLRPC 1.1, and argues that clear and convincing evidence does not establish she was incompetent because Metcalf was Wife\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">\u201cA lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>necessary for the representation.\u201d MLRPC 1.1. \u201cCompliance with [MLRPC 1.1] requires more than knowing what to do. It requires applying the knowledge to the client\u2019s problem---\u2018Evidence of a failure to apply the requisite thoroughness and/or preparation in representing a client is sufficient alone to support a violation of [MLRPC] 1.1\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McCulloch, </em>404 Md. 388, 397-98, 946 A.2d 1009, 1015 (2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Zhang violated MLRPC 1.1. The record demonstrates that Zhang acted as counsel for Wife in the annulment/divorce matter in Virginia, despite not being licensed to practice law in Virginia, and without the \u201clegal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d MLRPC 1.1. Zhang\u2019s lack of the legal knowledge and thoroughness to represent Wife is most vividly demonstrated by her negotiation of the February Agreement. Zhang did not understand or appreciate the legal distinction between a failure to consummate a marriage and Husband\u2019s alleged \u201cimpotence,\u201d and her research into the matter consisted only of a Google search of the phrase \u201cno marriage consummation[.]\u201d Zhang testified that, at the time, she did not know what \u201cimpotency\u201d meant, but \u201cassumed it was the same as the no consummation.\u201d Nevertheless, Zhang failed to conduct any legal research or to speak with Wife before suggesting to Lu that Husband consider an annulment on the ground of Husband\u2019s \u201cimpotence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">MLRPC 1.2(a) (Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority Between Client and Lawyer)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Zhang excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated MLRPC 1.2(a) because the record demonstrates that she had \u201cgeneral authority to represent [Wife]\u2019s interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">MLRPC 1.2(a) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">[A] lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and, when appropriate, shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>be pursued. A lawyer may take such action on behalf of the client as is impliedly authorized to carry out the representation. A lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decision whether to settle a matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thaxton, </em>415 Md. 341, 362, 1 A.3d 470, 482 (2010), we held that a lawyer violated MLRPC 1.2(a) by \u201cfail[ing] to obtain his client\u2019s consent to a settlement!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Zhang violated MLRPC 1.2(a). The record demonstrates that Zhang authorized Metcalf to sign both the January Agreement and the February Agreement, even though Wife did not know of the terms of the agreements and had not consented to the agreements. Metcalf executed the January Agreement based Zhang\u2019s assurances that she was authorized to sign the agreement, even though Zhang acknowledged at deposition that she had not discussed the terms of the agreement with Wife prior to its execution. Metcalf executed the February Agreement based on Zhang\u2019s assurances that that she had discussed the February Agreement\u2019s terms with Wife, and that Wife had participated in the negotiations and consented to the terms of the agreement. In actuality, Zhang had not spoken with Wife about the February Agreement or obtained Wife\u2019s consent, and did not speak with Wife until the day after the February Agreement was signed. Put simply, there were two occasions on which Zhang instructed Metcalf to execute settlement agreements on Wife\u2019s behalf despite not having discussed the terms with Wife and not securing Wife\u2019s consent to enter into the settlement agreements.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>MLRPC 1.4(a) (Communication)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Zhang excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s determination that she violated MLRPC 1.4(a) given her general authority to \u201crepresent ] the interests of [Wife] in negotiations to achieve an annulment[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">MLRPC 1.4(a) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">A lawyer shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">(1) promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client\u2019s informed consent, as defined in Rule 1.0(f), is required by these Rules;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">(2) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">(3) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">(4) consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyer\u2019s conduct when the lawyer knows that the client expects assistance not permitted by the [MLRPC] or other law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Comment [2] to MLRPC 1.4 explains that \u201ca lawyer who receives from opposing counsel an offer of settlement in a civil controversy ... must promptly inform the client of its substance unless the client has previously indicated that the proposal will be acceptable or unacceptable or has authorized the lawyer to accept or to reject the offer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Zhang violated MLRPC 1.4(a). There were at least two occasions where Zhang failed to communicate with Wife, <em>ie., </em>when Zhang authorized Metcalf to execute settlement agreements on Wife\u2019s behalf despite Wife\u2019s lack of knowledge of, and consent to, the terms of the agreements. Zhang\u2019s authorization to act in Wife\u2019s best interests, as well as her general knowledge that Wife wanted to pursue an annulment, did not relieve Zhang of her responsibility under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>MLRPC 1.4(a) to communicate with Wife. As Comment [2] explains, a lawyer receiving a settlement offer \u201cmust promptly inform the client of its substance unless the client has previously indicated that the proposal will be acceptable or unacceptable or has authorized the lawyer to accept or to reject the offer.\u201d Here, the record does not demonstrate that Wife knew of the substance of the proposed settlements prior to their execution. And, in the case of the February Agreement, it is clear that not only did Wife not know of the terms of the agreement, but that she would not have agreed to the terms had she known them. Zhang was obligated to communicate with Wife and to \u201cpromptly inform\u201d Wife about the settlement agreements. MLRPC 1.4(a)(1). Zhang did not do so.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">MLRPC 1.7(a) (Conflict of Interest: General Rule)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Zhang excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated MLRPC 1.7(a), and argues that she did not have an attorney-client relationship with Wife, as Metcalf was Wife\u2019s counsel. Zhang asserts that there was no conflict of interest because Husband was a former client whose representation ended on August 3, 2010, months prior to the start of the annulment/divorce case.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">MLRPC 1.7 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest exists if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">(1) the representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">(2) there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXi\">(b) Notwithstanding the existence of a conflict of interest under paragraph (a), a lawyer may represent a client if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">(1) the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">(2) the representation is not prohibited by law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">(3) the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">(4) each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Zhang violated MLRPC 1.7(a). Zhang was Metcalfs co-counsel, and she represented Wife in the annulment/divorce matter. That Wife is Zhang\u2019s niece does not mean that Zhang\u2019s relationship with Wife during the annulment/divorce matter was strictly one of a concerned family member. It is entirely possible for a lawyer to be both a lawyer and a concerned relative in connection to a relative-client. <em>See Shoup, </em>410 Md. at 489, 979 A.2d at 136 (\u201c[A] personal relationship ... with a purported \u2018client\u2019 does not preclude a court from finding that an attorney-client relationship exists.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Zhang\u2019s representation of Husband in the immigration matter did not conclude until she withdrew her appearance on November 26, 2010. Zhang\u2019s representation of Wife began in November 2010. Accordingly, Zhang\u2019s representation in the two matters overlapped in November 2010. Moreover, the allegations included in the original complaint for annulment, prepared by Zhang, contained allegations related to the immigration matter, including that Husband \u201cused the green card application for [Wife] as the inducement tool for her to marry him[.]\u201d In other words, the conflict of interest is substantiated by the circumstances of the overlapping cases, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the taking of conflicting positions in the two cases\u2014on one hand seeking of immigration status for Wife based on the existence of the marriage and on the other hand seeking an annulment/divorce\u2014as Zhang herself recognized in an e-mail to Metcalf on November 15, 2010, in which she stated that if Husband hired a lawyer, \u201cthey would disqualify [her] for the conflict [of] interest.\u201d As such, under MLRPC 1.7(a), Zhang could not represent Wife, absent compliance with MLRPC 1.7(b).

Thus, although Zhang did not enter her appearance in the Virginia Court\u2014and, indeed, could not enter her appearance because she was not licensed to practice in Virginia or admitted <em>pro hac </em>vice\u2014Zhang was obligated to not represent Wife at all because her representation constituted a violation of MLRPC 1.7(a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Zhang did so anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>MLRPC 3.1 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Zhang excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated MLRPC 3.1, and argues that Lu first represented that Husband was \u201cimpotent\u201d via e-mail on which Demsky and Husband were copied and which neither Demsky nor Husband corrected.

The record demonstrates that Zhang\u2014not Lu\u2014first suggested an annulment based on Husband\u2019s \u201cimpotence\u201d despite having no knowledge of, or reason to believe, that Husband had such a medical condition, and despite not having discussed the matter with Wife. Zhang admitted as much at a deposition. In other words, Zhang lacked a good faith basis for asserting Husband\u2019s alleged medical condition as a ground for annulment. That Husband\u2019s counsel agreed with Zhang\u2019s suggestion does not absolve Zhang from proposing \u201cimpotence\u201d as a ground for annulment without any knowledge or basis for believing that Wife would be able to prevail on such a ground. The lack of a good faith basis for asserting such a ground was manifest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>ed by the Virginia Court\u2019s order setting aside the February Agreement at Wife\u2019s behest.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">MLRPC 3.7(a) (Lawyer as Witness)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Zhang excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated MLRPC 3.7(a), and maintains that, because she never considered herself to be Wife\u2019s attorney, there was no need for her \u201cto strike herself as a witness or resign as [Wife\u2019i\u2019s attomey[.]\u201d Zhang argues that the Rule was not implicated because, having not entered her appearance in the Virginia Court, she did not \u201cact as advocate at a trial[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">MLRPC 3.7(a) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">A lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">(1) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">(2) the testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">(3) disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Zhang violated MLRPC 3.7(a). Zhang was Wife\u2019s counsel. Zhang\u2019s contention that a lawyer does not act as an advocate where he or she does not enter his or her appearance in a particular court lacks merit. MLRPC 3.7 does not state that the \u201cadvocate at a trial\u201d must have entered his or her appearance in a court to be considered an \u201cadvocate.\u201d And the term \u201cadvocate\u201d is defined by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary as \u201c[a] person who assists, defends, pleads, or prosecutes for another.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 60 (8th ed. 2004). Thus, that Zhang did not enter her appearance does not relieve her of the responsibility of complying with MLRPC 3.7(a). Indeed, the very matter at issue demonstrates that Zhang violated MLRPC 3.7(a). In the answers to interrogatories that Zhang provided to Metcalf, Zhang is identified as a potential witness. This demonstrates that Zhang, while acting as an advocate for Wife by preparing answers to interrogatories, identified herself (the advocate) as a potential witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>MLRPC 4.1(a) (Truthfulness in Statements to Others)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Zhang excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated MLRPC 4.1(a), and argues that the conclusion is not supported by clear and convincing evidence. MLRPC 4.1(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">In the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">(1) make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">(2) fail to disclose a material fact when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Comment [1] to MLRPC 4.1 explains that misrepresentations can occur in one of two manners: \u201cA misrepresentation can occur if the lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that the lawyer knows is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Zhang violated MLRPC 4.1(a). Zhang falsely told or led Metcalf to believe that Wife had difficulty with the English language and that all communication had to be handled through her. Zhang also falsely led Metcalf to believe that Wife had participated in the settlement negotiations on February 17, 2011, and that Wife knew of and consented to the terms of the February Agreement. Metcalf testified that, after discussing the matter with Zhang, there was \u201cno question in [her] mind\u201d that she was left with the \u201cimpression\u201d that Zhang had discussed the February Agreement\u2019s terms with Wife prior to the execution of the February Agreement and that Wife was \u201cokay\u201d with the terms. Thus, there are at least two instances where Zhang made false statements of material fact to Metcalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>MLRPC 5.5(a) (Unauthorized Practice of Law)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Zhang excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated MLRPC 5.5(a), and argues that she did not represent Wife before the Virginia Court in the annulment/divorce matter; <em>ie., </em>she did not practice law in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">MLRPC 5.5(a) states: \u201cA lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction, or assist another in doing so.\u201d Comment [1] to MLRPC 5.5 further explains, in relevant part: \u201cA lawyer may practice law only in a jurisdiction in which the lawyer is authorized to practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Zhang violated MLRPC 5.5(a). It is readily apparent that Zhang represented Wife in the annulment/divorce matter. Although Zhang did not sign any pleadings submitted to the Virginia Court, it is undisputed that Zhang drafted and prepared pleadings to be filed, participated in settlement negotiations, and prepared for hearings. Drafting pleadings, engaging in negotiations, conducting research, and preparing for hearings are actions routinely taken by lawyers in the practice of law. To engage in the practice of law does not require that one enter an appearance, or even initiate a lawsuit. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brisbon, </em>422 Md. 625, 641, 31 A.3d 110, 120 (2011) (\u201cWhere trial work is not involved but the preparation of legal documents, their interpretation, the giving of legal advice, or the application of legal principles to problems of any complexity, is involved, these activities are still the practice of law.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).

Zhang was not truthful in her dealings with Metcalf concerning Wife\u2019s representation, and made false statements of material fact to Metcalf about Wife\u2019s ability to communicate in English and Wife\u2019s knowledge of, and consent to, the terms of the February Agreement. These circumstances alone demonstrate that Zhang engaged in conduct involving dishonesty and misrepresentation. In addition, prior to the hearing on the motion to set aside, Zhang provided Metcalf with notes that contained numerous misrepresentations, including that Wife had given Metcalf \u201cgeneral authorization\u201d to settle the case when, in actuality, it was Zhang who advised Metcalf that she (Zhang) had authorization to speak for Wife, and it was Zhang who testified at deposition that she had been given a global authorization by Wife and Wife\u2019s parents. The statement prepared by Zhang obscured her role in Wife\u2019s representation altogether and misrepresented the facts of the case. This conduct certainly involved dishonesty, if not an intent to deceive the Virginia Court as to Zhang\u2019s role in Wife\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">MLRPC 8.4(d) (Conduct That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Zhang excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated MLRPC 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(d). \u201cIn general, a [lawyer] violates [MLRPC] 8.4(d) when his or her conduct impacts negatively the public\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>perception or efficacy of the courts or legal profession.\u201d <em>Dore, </em>433 Md. at 696, 73 A.3d at 167 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Zhang violated MLRPC 8.4(d).

She failed to convey the terms of the January and February settlement agreements to Wife, yet she authorized Metcalf to sign the agreements on Wife\u2019s behalf. Zhang engaged in dishonest conduct, making false statements and misrepresentations to Metcalf and concealing her role in Wife\u2019s representation from the Virginia Court. And, Zhang\u2019s conduct resulted in the February Agreement being set aside. Considered in its entirety, Zhang\u2019s conduct negatively reflected on attorneys and the legal profession, and had the effect of bringing the legal profession into disrepute.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">MLRPC 8.4(a) (Violating the MLRPC)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Zhang excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated MLRPC 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to[] violate or attempt to violate the [MLRPC], knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Zhang violated MLRPC 8.4(a).

In determining an appropriate sanction, we often refer to the American Bar Association\u2019s <em>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, </em>which focus on the nature of the ethical duty violated, the lawyer\u2019s mental state, the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct, and any aggravating or mitigating [factor]s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">(Second alteration in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Here, as to the nature of the ethical duty violated, Zhang violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.4(a), 1.7(a), 1.16(a), 3.1, 3.7(a), 4.1(a), 5.5(a), 7.4(a), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d) by representing Wife in an annulment/divorce matter despite a conflict of interest; by failing to provide competent representation and to conduct adequate research into grounds for annulment; by making misrepresentations to Metcalf concerning Wife\u2019s ability to communicate in English and Wife\u2019s knowledge of, and consent to, the terms of the February Agreement; and by effectively concealing her role in Wife\u2019s representation from the Virginia Court. As to Zhang\u2019s state of mind, the record demonstrates that, Zhang purposefully engaged in misconduct to assist Wife in a personal matter. As to the actual or potential injury that Zhang\u2019s misconduct caused, Zhang\u2019s misconduct negatively impacted the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession, and necessitated that the February Agreement be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Moreover, we do not overlook [the lawyer\u2019s fine reputation as a lawyer, his otherwise unblemished disciplinary record, and the \u201cmodicum\u201d of remorse found by [the hearing judge].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">And, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Keiner, </em>421 Md. 492, 521-22, 527, 27 A.3d 153, 171, 174 (2011), we disbarred a lawyer who violated MLRPC 1.4(a), 1.4(b), 8.4(a), 8.4(b), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d). The lawyer failed to communicate with clients; \u201cmisappropriated the law firm\u2019s resources, by using the firm\u2019s postage, paper, various office supplies, and Accurint subscription to locate potential clients\u201d; and \u201caltered and deleted documents within the firm\u2019s electronic client files.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522- 23, 27 A.3d at 171. The lawyer\u2019s actions were taken \u201cwith the intention of taking those clients from the law firm and making them his, once he established his own practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 27 A.2d at 171-72. We concluded that the lawyer\u2019s \u201cintentional dishonest conduct, motivated exclusively by his desire for personal gain,\u201d warranted disbarment, as the lawyer failed to prove any compelling extenuating circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 527, 27 A.2d at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Here, Zhang represented her niece, Wife, in an annulment/divorce matter in Virginia despite a conflict of interest with her representation of Husband in an immigration matter and despite not being licensed to practice law in Virginia.

Moreover, two aggravating factors accompany Zhang\u2019s misconduct\u2014Zhang engaged in a pattern of misconduct and violated numerous MLRPC. We have carefully examined Zhang\u2019s mental state. <em>See Dore, </em>433 Md. at 717, 73 A.3d at 180 (This Court considers the \u201clawyer\u2019s mental state\u201d in determining an appropriate sanction.). Although Zhang\u2019s assistance of Wife involved no intent for personal financial gain, nor any intent for personal financial or business gain for Wife, a young relative for whom Zhang testified she felt parental responsibility,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Zhang\u2019s misconduct consisted of: (1) failing to communicate settlement offers to Wife; (2) misrepresenting Wife\u2019s ability to communicate in English to Metcalf, thereby causing Metcalf to not speak directly with Wife for over three months; (3) misleading Metcalf as to Wife\u2019s knowledge of and consent to the February Agreement and Wife\u2019s participation in the settlement negotiations leading up to the execution of the February Agreement; (4) authorizing Metcalf to execute the January Agreement and February Agreement on Wife\u2019s behalf despite Wife\u2019s lack of knowledge of or consent to the agreements; (5) falsely telling Metcalf that Wife had agreed to the February Agreement\u2019s terms; (6) using her website to hold herself out publicly as a specialist in immigration and corporate law; (7) using her website to falsely \u00abtate that she was authorized to practice law in Virginia; (8) engaging in the unauthorized practice of law in Virginia; (9) representing Wife despite the existence of a conflict of interest; (10) falsely asserting Husband\u2019s alleged medical condition as a ground for annulment despite the lack of a good faith basis for asserting the claim; (11) having Metcalf present false information to the Virginia Court as to Husband\u2019s alleged medical condition; and (12) causing the Virginia Court to enter the consent order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>memorializing the terms of the February Agreement containing false information regarding Husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Over time, Zhang\u2019s mental state changed from helping a family member to concealment of her misconduct from the Virginia Court through intentional dishonest acts committed over a sustained period of time. Zhang took steps to conceal her representation of Wife from the Virginia Court, by dropping the plan to seek <em>pro hac vice </em>admission to the Bar of Virginia because she realized a conflict of interest existed. Later, Zhang asked Metcalf to misrepresent the facts and circumstances that led to the signing of the February Agreement at the March 18, 2011, hearing to conceal Zhang\u2019s role in Wife\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Although ostensibly similar, Zhang\u2019s misconduct is more serious than that of the lawyer in <em>McGlade, </em>425 Md. at 549-50, 42 A.3d at 549, in which this Court refrained from disbarring the lawyer where: (1) the lawyer did not \u201cperpetrate[ ] an actual fraud upon the court\u201d; (2) the lawyer\u2019s misconduct was comprised of an isolated incident; and (3) remorse mitigated the lawyer\u2019s misconduct. By contrast, here: (1) Zhang\u2019s false statements to Metcalf and Lu eventually led to the Virginia Court\u2019s vacating the consent order and stating that an attempted fraud had been perpetrated on the Virginia Court; (2) Zhang made multiple misrepresentations over a prolonged period of tim\u00e9; and (3) the record does not demonstrate that remorse mitigates Zhang\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Simply put, we are satisfied that disbarment is the sanction that will best \u201cprotect the public[.]\u201d <em>Dore, </em>433 Md. at 717, 73 A.3d at 180 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Even taking into account Zhang\u2019s initial mental state to help a relative, and even if that mental state were to be deemed a mitigating factor, such circumstances would not prevent imposition of disbarment where Zhang\u2019s conduct involved intentionally dishonest conduct\u2014pervasive misrepresentations that are not excused by compelling extenuating circumstances. Thus, despite our recognition that Zhang\u2019s initial motivation or mental state may have been to help a family member, inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>tional dishonest conduct of the type and pervasiveness that Zhang displayed, and the lack of compelling extenuating circumstances, leads to the inescapable conclusion that disbarment is the appropriate sanction. To conclude otherwise would be to carve a one-case exception out of years\u2019 worth of case law. <em>See, e.g., Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 418, 773 A.2d at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Zhang engaged in a pattern of deception that at first was motivated by a desire to help a family member, <em>cf.

Although the hearing judge admitted into evidence an excerpt of a deposition at which Zhang testified that she did not assist Wife in preparing the complaint, \u201cresolving any conflict in the evidence\u201d is the hearing judge\u2019s role. <em>Marcalus, </em>414 Md. at 512, 996 A.2d at 356 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\">. Although Zhang may have had general authority to speak on behalf of Wife and to make decisions in Wife\u2019s best interests, such authority did not extend to execution of settlement agreements absent Wife's consent. It was not in Wife\u2019s best interests to enter into the February Agreement on the false ground of Husband's \"impotence,\u201d as Wife \u201cdid not agree that [Husband] was impotent\u201d and a motion to set aside the February Agreement had to be filed.

Zhang's attempt to blame Metcalf for the lack of communication is unavailing. That Metcalf was the attorney of record does not diminish Zhang\u2019s role in the negotiation process. It is clear that Zhang, not Metcalf, took the lead in negotiating the February Agreement, and that she specifically represented to Metcalf that the terms of the February Agreement had been discussed with Wife, and that Wife consented to the terms. And, in any event, whether Metcalf\u2019s conduct violates the MLRPC or VRPC is not at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\">. Contrary to Zhang's contention, MLRPC 1.16(a) does not state that the lawyer shall withdraw his or her \"appearance,\u201d and instead states that a lawyer \"shall withdraw from the representation\u201d if the representation has commenced. Thus, Zhang's argument that she was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>required to withdraw from the representation of Wife because she never entered her appearance in the Virginia Court is based on a misreading of MLRPC 1.16(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b204-11\">. Although there is no specific allegation in the amended petition filed by Bar Counsel identifying these statements from the website, Bar Counsel charged a violation of MLRPC 7.4, thus placing Zhang on notice that she was being charged with holding herself out publicly as a specialist.

We disagree with Zhang\u2019s recommendation of a reprimand. Reprimands or short periods of suspension from the practice of law may be appropriate in cases in which there are few violations of the MLRPC or where the conduct is fairly innocuous. <em>See, e.g., Elmendorf, </em>404 Md. at 363, 946 A.2d at 548.

One of the potential mitigating factors that we recognize is the \u201cabsence of a ... selfish motive.\u201d Majority op. at 172, 100 A.3d at 1137. There appears to be no disagreement that Ms. Zhang became involved in the Virginia proceeding that led to this disciplinary action because she wished to help a young niece\u2014for whom she felt responsible\u2014who was in the process of immigrating to this country and who apparently had made a mistake in entering into a marriage. The Majority concedes that \u201cthe motivation of helping a relative may not be at the most egregious end of selfishness,\u201d but discounts it on the ground that she had \u201ca personal interest in achieving a positive outcome for her relative\u201d and therefore was \u201cnot free from self-interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173, 100 A.3d at 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">In my view, \u201cabsence of a selfish motive\u201d does not mean \u201cselfless.\u201d In other words, an errant attorney need not be a candidate for canonization to be worthy of a sanction short of disbarment. Rather, this mitigating factor helps distinguish situations in which an attorney acts for purposes of self-advancement, greed, or some dishonest purpose, from those in which an attorney goes astray in a misguided effort to help another. Although many of her actions were wrong, misleading to a court, and self-defeating, Ms. Zhang\u2019s underlying motivation was to help her niece and, unlike the situation in Sheinbein,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the goal of obtaining a divorce for her niece was perfectly legal.

One of the violations in this case suggests that a rule is ripe for revision. In particular, we find that Ms. Zhang violated MLRPC 7.4(a) because she stated on her website that she \"specialized\u201d in certain areas of practice. Majority op. at 166-68, 100 A.3d at 1134-35. This appears to be a violation of the rule, but does the rule itself make sense?</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">A random walk through the websites of law firms listed in the yellow pages of the Maryland Lawyers' Manual yields many instances in which lawyers strongly imply, or state in other words, that they specialize in certain fields. Limitation of one\u2019s practice to certain areas and disclosure of that limitation to the public is a good thing. A lawyer who tries to be a jack of all trades will be competent at none and may commit more serious violations of the MLRPC. A person who is looking for a lawyer to help with a divorce should not waste time considering whether to hire a lawyer whose practice is devoted entirely to workers' compensation. At worst, the violation of MLRPC 7.4(a) here is a case of \"ineligible synonym,\u201d perhaps worthy of a five-yard penalty from the podium, but not itself a cause for disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">The Maryland version of Rule 7.4(a) flatly prohibits a lawyer from holding out as \"specialist.\u201d By contrast, Rule 7.4(a) of the current version of the model rules adopted by the American Bar Association (\"ABA\u201d) prohibits a lawyer from stating or implying that the lawyer is \"certified as a specialist\u201d\u2014a statement that implies that some regulatory body has endorsed the lawyer\u2019s ability in a particular area. The commentary to the model rule states that \"A lawyer is generally permitted to state that the lawyer is a 'specialist,' practices a 'specialty,' or 'specializes in\u2019 particular fields, but such communications are subject to the 'false and misleading' standard applied in Rule 7.1 concerning a lawyer\u2019s services.\u201d ABA, Model Rules of Professional Conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>(2013), Rule 7.4, Comment [1], at 561.
