In 2002, Reno began practicing criminal law at the Law Offices of Jim Baldwin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">On or about February 18, 2004, Cortney Stevens [ (\u201cStevens\u201d) ] was convicted of possession of a controlled dangerous substance other than marijuana. In 2005, Reno met Stevens and later served as his lawyer. In 2008, while represented by someone other than Reno, Stevens was convicted of making a false prescription. Sometime before 2010, Stevens informed Reno that he had a prior drug charge for which he received probation before judgment. Stevens also informed Reno of a prescription forgery charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>On or about September 14, 2010, Stevens visited Chesapeake Guns, a firearms store in Stevensville. At Chesapeake Guns, Stevens completed an application to buy a .45 caliber 1911 handgun. In a letter dated September 22, 2010, the Firearms Registration Section of the Maryland State Police informed Stevens that his application had been disapproved. The letter did not include the reasons for Stevens\u2019s application\u2019s disapproval. Reno learned of the letter and testified that she thought that the reason for Stevens\u2019s application\u2019s disapproval was a minor issue such as a failure by Stevens to have paid a fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">On November 6, 2010, Reno visited On Target, a firearms store in Severn. At On Target, Reno obtained a .45 caliber 1911 handgun (\u201cthe handgun\u201d). Reno immediately transported the handgun to Stevens\u2019s place of employment, where she gave the handgun to Stevens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">On November 16, 2010, at her home, Reno was visited by Corporal Marcus Jackson and Senior Trooper First Class Ryan List (\u201cthe troopers\u201d) of the Gun Enforcement Unit of the Maryland State Police. The troopers told Reno that they were conducting a handgun investigation. Reno escorted the troopers to Stevens\u2019s home and retrieved the handgun, which the troopers confiscated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">Sometime between November 4, 2011, and November 16, 2011, Reno learned that the State had charged her with violating the statute that is currently codified at [Md.Code Ann., Pub. Safety (2003, 2011 Repl.Vol., 2013 Supp.) (\u201cPS\u201d) ] \u00a7 5-144. On February 28, 2012, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, Reno pled not guilty and joined [an] agreed statement of facts. The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County granted Reno probation before judgment. Sometime before October 21, 2013, the records of Reno\u2019s criminal case were expunged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">Reno should have known that Stevens was a prohibited person, but it was not established by clear and convincing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>evidence that Reno in fact knew that Stevens was a prohibited person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">(Brackets, emphasis, and some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The hearing judge found that Reno: (1) has never before received attorney discipline; (2) reported herself to the Commission; (3) is \u201chonest[] and forthright[ ]\u201d;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (4) suffered \u201cgreat embarrassment\u201d; and (5) withdrew her application to be a judge of the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Queen Anne\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\n<em>Reno I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">In <em>Reno </em>I, 436 Md. at 509, 510, 511-12, 83 A.3d at 784-85, we determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">As the hearing judge found, it is undisputed that Reno gave the handgun <em>(ie., </em>a regulated firearm)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to Stevens, who had been convicted of disqualifying crimes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">Reno violated PS \u00a7 5-134(b)(2), a regulatory provision, which states that: \u201cA ... person may not ... transfer a regulated firearm to a ... transferee who the ... person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>knows or has reasonable cause to believe ... has been convicted of a disqualifying crime[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">Reno violated MLRPC 8.4(d), which provides: \u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]\u201d ... Reno knew that: (1) Stevens had applied to buy a .45 caliber 1911 handgun; and (2) the Firearms Registration Section of the Maryland State Police disapproved Stevens\u2019s application. Nonetheless, Reno gave Stevens a handgun of the exact type for which he had applied. Even if (as the hearing judge found) Reno thought that the reason for Stevens\u2019s application\u2019s disapproval was a minor issue such as a failure by Stevens to have paid a fine, Reno nonetheless circumvented the law by giving the handgun to Stevens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATK\">(Alterations, footnotes, and some ellipses in original) (emphasis, one footnote, internal quotation marks, and some brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The Commission recommends that we suspend Reno from the practice of law in Maryland for six months. Reno recommends that we reprimand her.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McDowell, </em>439 Md. 26, 45-46, 93 A.3d 711, 722-23 (2014), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">This Court sanctions a lawyer not to punish the lawyer, but instead to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. This Court protects the public by: (1) deterring other lawyers from engaging in similar misconduct; and (2) suspending or disbarring a lawyer who is unfit to continue to practice law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">In determining an appropriate sanction for a lawyer\u2019s misconduct, this Court considers: (a) the duty violated; (b) the lawyer\u2019s mental state; (c) the potential or actual injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct; and (d) the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-11\">Aggravating factors include: (a) prior attorney discipline; (b) a dishonest or selfish motive; (c) a pattern of miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>duct; (d) multiple violations of the MLRPC; (e) bad faith obstruction of the attorney discipline proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the Maryland Rules or orders of this Court; (f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the attorney discipline proceeding; (g) refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the misconduct; (h) vulnerability of the victim; (i) substantial experience in the practice of law; (j) indifference to making restitution; and (k) illegal conduct, including that involving the use of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">Mitigating factors include: (a) the absence of prior attorney discipline; (b) absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; (c) personal or emotional problems; (d) timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of the misconduct; (e) full and free disclosure to the Commission or a cooperative attitude toward the attorney discipline proceeding; (f) inexperience in the practice of law; (g) character or reputation; (h) physical disability; (i) a mental disability or chemical dependency including alcoholism or drug abuse where: (1) there is medical evidence that the lawyer is affected by a chemical dependency or mental disability; (2) the chemical dependency or mental disability caused the misconduct; (3) the lawyer\u2019s recovery from the chemical dependency or mental disability is demonstrated by a meaningful and sustained period of successful rehabilitation; and (4) the recovery arrested the misconduct and recurrence of the misconduct is unlikely; (j) delay in the attorney discipline proceeding; (k) the imposition of other penalties or sanctions; (l) remorse; and (m) remoteness of prior violations of the MLRPC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">(Brackets, citations, footnote, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Howell, </em>434 Md. 1, 19, 8, 15, 73 A.3d 202, 213, 207, 211 (2013), this Court suspended from the practice of law in Maryland for one year a lawyer who violated MLRPC 8.4(b) (Criminal Act), 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation), and 8.4(d) (Conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice). The lawyer forwarded to an inmate a letter from another inmate by secretly taping the letter to docket entries. <em>See id. </em>at 8, 78 A.3d at 206-07. The lawyer \u201cknew [that] it was against prison policy to forward mail from inmate to inmate\u201d; thus, the lawyer \u201ccireumvent[ed] the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 73 A.3d at 206-07. The lawyer\u2019s misconduct had the potential to cause injury. <em>See id. </em>at 17, 73 A.3d at 212. This Court did not note any aggravating factors or mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Here, as to the duty violated, Reno violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by giving the handgun to Stevens, who could not legally possess a regulated firearm. As to Reno\u2019s mental state, Reno knew that the Firearms Registration Section of the Maryland State Police had disapproved Stevens\u2019s application to buy a handgun. From this information, Reno should have known that Stevens could not legally possess a regulated firearm. Nonetheless, Reno intentionally gave the same kind of handgun to Stevens.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Reno\u2019s misconduct\u2014giving a deadly weapon to a convicted felon\u2014had the potential to cause injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>We note two aggravating factors: (1) substantial experience in the practice of law, as Reno has been a member of the Bar of Maryland for almost twenty-three years and a criminal defense attorney for more than twelve years;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (2) illegal conduct, as Reno violated PS \u00a7 5\u2014134(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We note three mitigating factors: (1) the absence of prior attorney discipline; (2) full and free disclosure to the Commission, as Reno reported herself to the Commission; and (3) character, as the hearing judge found that Reno is \u201chonest[ ] and forthright[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We reject the Commission\u2019s curious assertion that Reno\u2019s misconduct is mitigated by the absence of a conviction and the expungement of the records of Reno\u2019s criminal case. These circumstances do not correspond to any of the mitigating factors that this Court has identified in its attorney discipline jurisprudence. <em>See McDowell, </em>439 Md. at 46, 93 A.3d at 723. Indeed, in an attorney discipline proceeding, this Court considers a lawyer\u2019s misconduct, regardless of the disposition of any criminal case that arises out of the lawyer\u2019s misconduct. <em>See Howell, </em>434 Md. at 7 n. 7, 73 A.3d at 206 n. 7 (\u201cAbsence of criminal prosecution does not preclude violations of the MLRPC.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">We find no merit in Reno\u2019s contention that her misconduct is mitigated by the imposition of other penalties in the form of embarrassment and the \u201cscar[r]ing of [her] rep[u]tation[.]\u201d Generally, embarrassment and diminished reputation are not mitigating factors. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goldsborough, </em>330 Md. 342, 362, 624 A.2d 503, 512 (1993) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>(This Court rejected a lawyer\u2019s contention that his misconduct was mitigated by \u201cmedia attention[, which] already \u2018ruined\u2019 his reputation\u201d; this Court stated: \u201cMedia attention, however embarrassing or humiliating to the attorney, is no substitute for the responsibility of this Court to enforce the [MLRPC]. Our role in these proceedings, unpleasant and difficult as it may sometimes be, is one of utmost importance, and we will not shirk it or delegate it to the media or public opinion.\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, as Chief Judge Barbera aptly pointed out at oral argument, if embarrassment or stress were definitively mitigating factors, they would apply in nearly every attorney discipline proceeding; \u201c[t]hat doesn\u2019t stop us from imposing what we believe is the appropriate sanction[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Similarly, we find no basis for Reno\u2019s contention that her misconduct is mitigated by the imposition of another penalty in the form of withdrawing her application to be a judge. In Maryland, the judicial selection process is rigorous, and consists of being interviewed and rated by bar associations, being nominated by the Judicial Nominating Commission, and being appointed by the Governor; thus, there is no guarantee that Reno would have become a judge but for her misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Additionally, we reject Reno\u2019s contention that her misconduct is mitigated by four factors that the hearing judge did not find: (1) the absence of a selfish motive; (2) timely good faith efforts to rectify the consequences of the misconduct; (3) delay in the attorney discipline proceeding; and (4) unlikeli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>hood of repetition of misconduct. The hearing judge\u2019s finding that Reno did not violate MLRPC 8.4(b) (Criminal Act) or MLRPC 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation) does not establish that Reno lacked a selfish motive.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Reno\u2019s self-reporting to the Commission establishes full and free disclosure to the Commission, not timely good faith efforts to rectify the consequences of Reno\u2019s misconduct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The hearing judge did not find that there was any delay in this attorney discipline proceeding or that Reno is unlikely to repeat her misconduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">We agree with the Commission that the appropriate sanction for Reno\u2019s misconduct is a six-month suspension from the practice of law in Maryland. Reno knew that the Firearms Registration Section of the Maryland State Police had disap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>proved Stevens\u2019s application to buy a handgun. Despite this knowledge, Reno intentionally gave the same kind of handgun to Stevens, who, as Reno should have known, could not legally possess a regulated firearm. And, as the hearing judge found, there was a \u201cpotential danger\u201d in giving a deadly weapon to a convicted felon. Reno\u2019s misconduct is aggravated by substantial experience in the practice of law and unlawful conduct. Reno\u2019s misconduct is mitigated by the absence of prior attorney discipline, full and free disclosure to the Commission, and a finding of character for honesty.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">We agree with the Commission that Reno\u2019s misconduct is similar to, but not as egregious as, the misconduct of the lawyer in <em>Howell, </em>434 Md. 1, 73 A.3d 202. Like the lawyer in <em>Howell, id. </em>at 8, 17, 73 A.3d at 206-07, 212, Reno circumvented the law by intentionally giving an item to someone who could not legally possess the item, thus creating the potential for injury. In contrast to the lawyer in <em>Howell, id. </em>at 8, 15, 73 A.3d at 207, 211, Reno did not violate MLRPC 8.4(b) (Criminal Act) or 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation). Thus, Reno\u2019s misconduct does not warrant the one-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>suspension that this Court imposed in <em>Howell, id. </em>at 19, 73 A.3d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Reprimanding Reno would not suffice to protect the public and deter other lawyers from similar misconduct. Reno potentially endangered the public by giving a deadly weapon to a convicted felon. Although the hearing judge found that Reno did not know that Stevens could not legally possess a regulated firearm, the hearing judge found that Reno should have known. Despite knowing that the Firearms Registration Section of the Maryland State Police had disapproved Stevens\u2019s application to buy a handgun, Reno circumvented the law by intentionally giving the same kind of handgun to Stevens, who, as Reno should have known, could not legally possess a regulated firearm. We cannot take lightly a lawyer\u2019s failure to obey the law that the lawyer swore to uphold. Nor can we ignore the potential for danger that Reno caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">For the above reasons, we suspend Reno from the practice of law in Maryland for six months. The suspension will begin thirty days after the date on which this opinion is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761(b), FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST SANDRA LYNN RENO.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-10\">. <em>Reno I, </em>436 Md. at 505-06, 83 A.3d at 781-82, contains this attorney discipline proceeding\u2019s prior procedural background.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-11\">.

We reject Reno\u2019s contention that her mental state was one of negligence. Reno did not carelessly leave the handgun unattended, thus inadvertently allowing Stevens to obtain it; instead, Reno intentionally gave the handgun to Stevens, despite knowing that the Firearms Registration Section of the Maryland State Police had disapproved Stevens\u2019s application to buy the same kind of handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Also, although the hearing judge found that Reno thought that the reason lor Stevens's application's disapproval was \"a minor issue such as a failure [by] Stevens to have paid a fine[,]\u201d we observe that no provision of Title 5 (Firearms) of the Public Safety Article prohibits the possession of a regulated firearm by a person who has failed to pay a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Reno raises red herrings in pointing out that the record does not indicate that she intended to: (1) aid in the commission of a crime; (2) transfer ownership of the handgun to Stevens; or (3) allow Stevens to use the handgun. None of these circumstances change the fact that, despite knowing that the Firearms Registration Section of the Maryland State Police had disapproved Stevens\u2019s application to buy the same kind of handgun, Reno intentionally gave the handgun to Stevens, whom she should have known could not legally possess a regulated firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b457-9\">. Reno is incorrect in asserting that the hearing judge did not find that a handgun is dangerous and could be used to aid in the commission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>a crime. The hearing judge explicitly found (and common sense dictates) that it is \" \u2018potentially] danger[ous]\u2019 \" to give a handgun to someone who cannot legally possess a regulated firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\">. We correct the parties\u2019 misconception that substantial experience in the practice of law is a mitigating factor where a lawyer has never before received attorney discipline. \"[Sjubstantial experience in the practice of law\u201d is an aggravating factor, whereas \"the absence of prior attorney discipline\u201d is a mitigating factor. <em>McDowell, </em>439 Md. at 46, 93 A.3d at 723 (brackets and citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b459-7\">. This Court has considered adverse media coverage to be a mitigating factor where the adverse media coverage caused other, more tangible penalties. <em>See, e.g., McDowell, </em>439 Md. at 47, 93 A.3d at 724 (This Court held that a lawyer\u2019s misconduct was mitigated by \u201cother penalties in the form of being sued, receiving adverse media coverage, voluntarily stopping the active practice of law, and withdrawing from the [the lawyer\u2019s law firm], which no longer [bore the lawyer\u2019s name[.]\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

For two reasons, we also reject Reno's contention that she lacked a selfish motive based on her testimony that she gave the handgun to Stevens because she wanted to avoid injuring herself or her children. First, the hearing judge did not explicitly credit that part of Reno\u2019s testimony. Second, as the Commission points out, the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact lead to the conclusion that Reno had a selfish motive. Specifically, the hearing judge found that, after the Firearms Registration Section of the Maryland State Police disapproved Stevens\u2019s application to buy a handgun, Reno gave the same kind of handgun to Stevens\u2014whom Reno was dating at the time. The hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact give rise to the inference that Reno's transfer of the handgun was a favor for Stevens, her significant other. That said, given that the hearing judge did not find that Reno had (or lacked) a selfish motive, we do not resolve this factual matter in either party's favor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b460-7\">. Put plainly, Reno's contention that she made timely good faith efforts to rectify the consequences of her misconduct by retrieving the handgun for the troopers is frivolous. Reno did not initiate contact with the troopers; instead, on their own initiative, the troopers visited Reno at her home and told Reno that they were conducting a handgun investigation. Then and only then did Reno escort the troopers to Stevens\u2019s home and retrieve the handgun, which the troopers confiscated. In other words, Reno cooperated with law enforcement only after being told of an ongoing handgun investigation, which Reno did not cause to occur. At no point did Reno report herself to law enforcement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\">. In its written recommendation, Bar Counsel states that Reno\u2019s misconduct is \"unlikely to be repeated\"; however, the hearing judge made no such finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\">. Although we agree with the Commission that the appropriate sanction for Reno\u2019s misconduct is a six-month suspension from the practice of law in Maryland, we are unpersuaded by the Commission's reliance on <em>Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. Smith, </em>405 Md. 107, 130, 129, 950 A.2d 101, 114, 113 (2008), in which this Court suspended from the practice of law in Maryland for six months a lawyer who violated MLRPC 8.4(b) (Criminal Act), 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation) and 8.4(d) (Conduct That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice) by intentionally falsely representing himself to be a law enforcement officer. To liken <em>Smith </em>to this attorney discipline proceeding is to compare apples to oranges. In <em>Smith, </em>the respondent\u2019s misconduct was comprised of a statement, which constituted a false representation; by contrast, Reno\u2019s misconduct is comprised of an act, which constituted a circumvention of the law. We infer that the Commission relies on <em>Smith </em>because <em>Smith </em>included the same sanction (Le., a six-month suspension) that the Commission recommends here. Although this Court strives for consistency in attorney discipline proceedings, this Court need not rely on a case that includes the same sanction that this Court imposes. We decline the Commission\u2019s invitation to consider <em>Smith </em>in our determination of the appropriate sanction for Reno's misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
