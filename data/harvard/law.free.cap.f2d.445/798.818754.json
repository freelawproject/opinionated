Defendant, indicted for theft of cartons of merchandise from an interstate shipment, asks extraordinary review of an order of the district court requiring him to have his palmprint taken. Correctly, he does not claim invasion of any Fifth Amendment rights, and seemingly he agrees, again correctly, that the palm-print might have been taken when he was arrested or arraigned. Seemingly, also, he would distinguish an order of the district court made during the course of trial, as he is careful to limit his objection to the time of the order, as being in the nature of improper pretrial discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">The grounds for this objection are frivolous. In the first place, extensive argument is made that the magistrate had no power to make the order, qua magistrate. This question is not presented, since the order was affirmed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">Secondly, defendant argues that the prosecution\u2019s evidence cannot be obtained by an administrative summons, such as a tax summons. Again, no comment is called for.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\"> Thirdly, defendant would distinguish the case of United States v. Izzi, 2 Cir., 1970, 427 F.2d 293, where a defendant was \u201crequired\u201d to execute pretrial handwriting exemplars as \u201cnot helpful\u201d because it did not appear in the opinion that this requirement was over the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">Finally, defendant suggests that the government should be obliged to persuade the court that the evidence is needed \u201cin the sense that, without it, the prosecution would probably fail.\u201d No authority is given for such a limitation. The government\u2019s affidavit states that \u201cthere now exists certain physical evidence containing a defined latent palm-print of value. Identification of that palmprint is material to the government\u2019s proof.\u201d We consider that sufficient. Defendant can take nothing from the fact that palmprints are not listed in the Criminal Discovery and Inspection Rule 16, 18 U.S.C. We find it inherent in cases holding that the defendant is not protected by the Fifth Amendment from furnishing the government certain physical identifications, <em>see, e. g., </em>Napol-itano v. United States, 1 Cir., 1965, 340 F.2d 313 (fingerprints); United States v. Kelly, 2 Cir., 1932, 55 F.2d 67 (fingerprints), that no rule is needed for the government\u2019s assistance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">Upon defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the court\u2019s order his bail will be revoked.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
