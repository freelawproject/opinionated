It is for this delay, and the consequent pain and suffering, that he seeks damages. The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of a legally responsible defendant. Plaintiff appealed and we now have a motion for summary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-22\">We note, in passing, that a hospital record attached to the answer filed by the Worcester City Solicitor as \u201cAttorney for the defendants\u201d (whoever they may be \u2014 defense counsel appears to think the City is included) indicates that plaintiff was \u201cnot in acute distress,\u201d and that he informed the hospital that the 22-calibre bullet, which was recovered, had been self-inflicted at 1 a. m., to wit, twenty hours before. This might lead one to think the plaintiff\u2019s urgent need to go to the hospital arose more from the arrest than from acute physical discomfort. However that may be, plaintiff has not named, let alone attempted to serve, any defendant subject to the Civil Rights Act. The City of Worcester, if that is the intended defendant, is not liable under this statute. Monroe v. Pape, 1961, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492. Nor is the Police Department a suable entity. United States ex rel. Lee v. People of State of Illinois, 7 Cir., 1965, 343 F.2d 120. If a Police Department may be successfully sued, it is the city which will pay; the result is the same as suing the city \u2014 a result foreclosed by Monroe v. Pape, <em>ante. </em>For want of any proper party defendant the district court properly dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
