The Board has also filed a cross-petition for enforcement. Finding upon examination of the numerous issues raised that the Board has committed no errors of law and that its findings are amply supported by substantial evidence, we deny both petitions for review and grant the Board\u2019s request for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The issues presented here arise from a fact pattern which has become familiar to this court and to the other Courts of Appeals in reviewing the Board\u2019s unfair labor practice decisions. The dispute in this instance arose under the following circumstances. Shortly after the employer took over the operation of a newly constructed helium plant, the union with the assistance of several key employees launched a campaign to organize the plant\u2019s production and maintenance personnel. The union quickly obtained signed union authorization cards from 18 of the 22 employees involved. Upon being notified that a majority of its employees had signed cards designating the union as their collective bargaining representative, the employer called for a formal election to be conducted by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\"> During the months before the scheduled election the employer, through the conduct of its sole owner, engaged in numerous activities in an apparent effort to dissipate employee enthusiasm for union representation. The Trial Examiner found that the employer had committed unfair labor practices in violation of Section 8(a) (1) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1) (1964), by coercively interrogating each employee in the plant, by making statements to several of its employees indicating an animus toward the union, and by making veiled threats against the union and its sympathizers in a speech at a dinner given for all the employees. The Examiner also found violations of Section 8(a) (3), (5), and (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (3), (5), (1) (1964), in (a) the discriminatory discharge of 6 pro-union employees, (b) the granting of a unilateral wage increase immediately prior to the date scheduled for the election, and (c) the persistent refusal to bargain with the employees\u2019 designated representative. The Board approved each of the Examiner\u2019s conclusions, 176 N.L.R.B. No. 115, and since, viewed as a whole, the record amply reflects the existence of substantial supporting evidence, we affirm the Board\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The second Board order under review, 176 N.L.R.B. No. 116, deals exclusively with the suspension and second discharge of one of the 6 pro-union employees who had been previously discharged and reinstated. The Trial Examiner and the Board found that this discharge constituted an unfair labor practice offending Section 8(a) (3), (4), and (1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (3), (4), (1) (1964). This finding is also clearly founded upon substantial evidence, and we leave it undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In so sustaining the Board\u2019s orders as against the claims of error pressed upon us by the employer,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the single substantive issue meriting extended exposition is the \u201caging but nevertheless persistently vexing problem of whether or not an employee is a supervisor.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That inquiry here focuses on the status of the plant\u2019s \u201csenior operators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The Labor Management Relations Act in terms confers upon <em>employees </em>the rights of self-organization, collective bargaining through chosen representatives, and engaging in concerted activities for their mutual benefit. Section 7, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 (1964). The Act further protects <em>employees </em>from the unfair labor practices of their employers which interfere with those rights. Seetion 8(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1964). Section 2(3), as pertinent to our consideration, defines the term \u201cemployee\u201d as follows: \u201cThe term \u2018employee\u2019 shall include any employee * * * but shall not include <em>* </em>* * any individual employed as a supervisor * * 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3) (1964). Given this statutory framework, it is critical, both in ascertaining the appropriate bargaining unit and in evaluating allegations of unfair labor practices, to determine whether particular individuals are \u201cemployees\u201d or \u201csupervisors.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Quite understandably, this statutory dichotomy has spawned substantial Board and appellate litigation. The statutory definition with which we deal reads in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-15\">\u201cThe term \u2018supervisor\u2019 means any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibility to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not merely routine or clerical in nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-16\">Section 2(11), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11) (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>The Board found the class of employees in question here not to be supervisors. In applying the statutory test to the factual setting of this ease, the Board\u2019s decision is, of course, entitled to great weight. The substantial evidence standard for review of agency fact determinations (Section 10(e), (f), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), (f) (1964)) takes on special significance where the issue lies so squarely within the Board\u2019s ambit of expertise. On this score we find ourselves in firm agreement with a recent opinion by Judge Waterman of the Second Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\">\u201cInasmuch as infinite variations and gradations of authority can exist within any one industrial complex and any drawing of the line between the personnel of management and the rank and file workers may require some expertise in evaluating actual power distributions which exist within an enterprise, the Board\u2019s findings relative thereto are entitled to great weight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">NLRB v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 405 F.2d 1169, 1172 (2d Cir. 1968). <em>See also </em>Food Store Employees Union, Local 347 v. NLRB, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 248, 253, 422 F.2d 685, 690 (1969); Amalgamated Clothing Workers v. NLRB, 137 U.S. App.D.C. 93, 97, 420 F.2d 1296, 1300 (1969). With that limitation on our review power in mind, we turn to a consideration of the facts underlying the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Kansas Refined Helium Company is a highly automated plant engaged primarily in the process of extracting helium from natural gas. The facility is in operation around the clock, seven days a week, and is staffed by approximately 25 persons spread out over three suces-sive shifts. Filling the top positions of responsibility are the plant manager, the operations and engineering manager, and the chief of maintenance. These three fall clearly within the management echelon and there is no controversy as to their supervisory status. The remainder of the employees, with the exception of several repair and maintenance personnel, are classified as either senior or junior operators. It is the status of the four senior operators, all of whom signed union authorization cards and some of whom participated in soliciting signatures from other employees, which is the critical issue in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The responsibilities of the \u201coperating\u201d employees \u2014 the senior and junior operators \u2014 consist primarily of observing the indicators and gauges, which reflect the progress of the various stages in the refining process, and of making adjustments as necessary. On each shift there is one senior operator and either two or three junior operators. Generally the senior operator stations himself in the main control room in front of the central indicator board; the junior operators move throughout the plant performing other routine functions such as checking machinery and controls in the outbuildings. The standard operating activities of both the senior and junior operators are performed in accordance with an instructional manual known as the \u201cblue book.\u201d Any nonroutine instructions, required to take care of unusual circumstances, are assigned by the three managerial supervisors. Communication of such special instructions from one shift to the next is accomplished through notations penciled into the \u201cspecial orders book\u201d by the assigning manager. This book is periodically consulted by all operators. One of the responsibilities of each senior operator is to ascertain that the junior operators on his shift have fulfilled any such special assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Because of the full-time operation of the plant, there are many hours during the day when the managerial supervisors are not present. The employer has relied heavily in these proceedings on this fact as indicating that, at least during substantial segments of any workday, the senior operators do have the obligation \u201cresponsibly to direct\u201d the junior operators on their shifts. It is clear, however, that all but the rou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>tine directives come directly from the plant managers rather than from the senior operators. Furthermore, there is ample evidence that, in cases of emergency, or whenever unusual circumstances have arisen at the plant, the senior operators were instructed to communicate with the plant manager rather than to exercise \u201cindependent judgment.\u201d Under these circumstances slight weight can be given to the consideration that senior operators are often on duty with no supervisor over them. <em>Compare </em>Ohio Power Co. v. NLRB, 176 F.2d 385, 386 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 338 U.S. 899, 70 S.Ct. 249, 94 L.Ed. 553 (1949) (broad emergency power), <em>with </em>NLRB v. Security Guard Serv., 384 F.2d 143, 148 (5th Cir. 1967), and United States Gypsum Co., 116 N.L.R.B. No. 91, 1956-1957 CCH NLRB Dec. \u00b6 54,013, at 53,946-947 (no emergency power).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In addition to its argument regarding the full-time nature of plant operations, the employer directed the Board\u2019s attention to a number of other factors which it contends lead inescapably to the conclusion that the four senior operators are within the supervisory structure. Great reliance is placed on the pay differential between the two classes of operators: the seniors receive 80 to 85 cents more per hour than their junior counterparts. The employer\u2019s position is that, since the plant\u2019s training program is the same for both classes and since junior operators not infrequently perform the senior operator\u2019s tasks in his absence, thereby tending to show that their skills are comparable, income disparity cannot be accounted for in any way other than as a reflection that the company is compensating the senior operators for their added responsibilities in exercising authority and control over the junior operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The Trial Examiner rejected this thesis, finding that the pay difference could be fairly attributed to other factors, such as the senior operators\u2019 seniority in length of service over most of the junior operators. It is also reasonable to conclude, as the Trial Examiner did, that the pay of senior operators simply reflects the value to the employer of the technical responsibilities performed in the plant\u2019s \u201cnerve center.\u201d Furthermore, we have discovered no cases in which disparities in compensation were accorded litmus paper significance in the absence of solid evidence of the actual possession of supervisory responsibility. <em>See, e. g., United States Gypsum Co., supra, </em>at 53,947. Such evidence is lacking in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">While the employer conceded before the Board that \u201cthe senior operators did [not] actually suspend, lay-off, recall, promote, transfer or discharge\u201d employees, it contended that senior operators could \u201ceffectively recommend\u201d wage increases for junior operators and could also \u201ceffectively recommend\u201d disciplinary action where necessary. The testimony of the plant manager is, we think, dispositive against the employer on both counts. On the question of disciplinary action, the plant manager testified that he had informed the senior operators that, although their recommendations would receive considerable weight, in cases of disciplinary controversies they were to take no direct action themselves but were instead to call the plant manager who would come to the plant immediately. As to the question of whether senior operators exercised supervisor-type functions with respect to wage increases, the evidence is that only one of the four senior operators had ever recommended pay raises for the junior operators on his shift. And, in that isolated instance, plant-wide wage increases had already been contemplated and the decision to grant the raises was made by the plant manager without appreciable reliance on the senior operator\u2019s evaluation. We think the Board\u2019s decision that no supervisory power was visible in these areas of the senior operators\u2019 activities finds substantial support in the record and warrant in the case law. <em>Compare </em>NLRB v. Southern Bleachery &amp; Print Works, Inc., 257 F.2d 235, 238 (4th Cir. 1958), cert. de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>nied, 359 U.S. 911, 79 S.Ct. 588, 3 L.Ed. 2d 575 (1959) (machine printers not supervisors), <em>with </em>NLRB v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., <em>supra, </em>405 F.2d at 1174-1177 (watch engineers are supervisors).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Finally, the Trial Examiner considered the several notices and directives which had been posted in the plant from time to time, and which were offered as indicators of management\u2019s view of the senior operators\u2019 role in the operation of the facility. Included in those notices were statements indicating that senior operators were to be \u201cresponsible\u201d for their shift, that they were to \u201csupervise the personnel on [their] shift,\u201d that a particular senior operator had been assigned \u201cto run the fourth shift,\u201d and that each senior operator \u201cshall follow up these instructions and see that the employees take care of [particular tasks].\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ordinarily we would find such internal memoranda and notices to be of substantial probative worth when, as here, they were prepared and circulated prior to the time that any campaign had been undertaken within the company to designate the union as the employees\u2019 bargaining representative. In such an atmosphere, untainted by live controversies over the statutory status of any particular group of employees, management\u2019s statements conferring responsibilities and allocating duties are likely to be more reliable than similar statements made in the context of union conflict when directives are often addressed as much to the Board as they are to the company\u2019s personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">While most of the company notices relied on here were posted prior to the advent of labor disputes, the Board nonetheless found them unpersuasive because they were unsupported by evidence that they constituted anything more than naked designations of \u201cpaper power. We agree that, beyond the statements or directives themselves, what the statute requires is evidence of actual supervisory authority visibly translated into tangible examples demonstrating the existence of such authority. In NLRB v. Security Guard Serv., Inc., 384 F.2d 143, 149, the Fifth Circuit succinctly stated the essential point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">\u201c* -x- * what is amiss with this argument which is based on paper credentials is that there is lack of actual authority to match. The concept of supervision has some elasticity, but it must have substance and not be evanescent. * * * A supervisor may have potential powers, but theoretical or paper power will not suffice. Tables of organization and job descriptions do not vest powers. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Akd\"><em>See also </em>Food Store Employees Union, Local 347 v. NLRB, <em>supra </em>137 U.S.App. D.C. at 253, 422 F.2d at 690; NLRB v. American Oil Co., 387 F.2d 786 (7th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">The employer, challenging the Ex aminer\u2019s refusal to draw controlling inferences of supervisory responsibility either from such internal directives or from testimony offered by company witnesses, accuses the Board of violating a judicial rule employed in evaluating personnel status, <em>i. e., </em>that it is the <em>existence </em>of any of Section 2(ll)\u2019s enumerated powers, rather than their <em>exercise, </em>that is critical. <em>See, e. g., </em>West Penn Power Co. v. NLRB, 337 F.2d 993, 996 (3d Cir. 1964); Ohio Power Co. v. NLRB, <em>supra, </em>176 F.2d at 388. The language on which the employer relies as showing that the Examiner and the Board have fallen into error is the statement, found in the former\u2019s Preliminary Decision, that \u201cwhere the facts concerning supervisory status are in dispute, as they are here, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>regard evidence of supervisory power exercised \u2014 or not exercised \u2014 as far more persuasive than self-serving testimony concerning their mere conferral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"> It is a well settled proposition, mandated by the statute, that, once the existence of supervisory authority is established, the degree or frequency of its exercise is of little consequence. We do not, however, read the Examiner\u2019s opinion as quarreling with that proposition. On the contrary, it is the very issue .of the existence of authority on which his inquiry is focused. The thrust of his conclusion is that, while numerous allegations of supervisory authority have been made, the nearly total lack of evidence of authority actually exercised negates its existence. <em>See </em>NLRB v. Southern Bleachery &amp; Print Works, Inc., <em>supra, 257 </em>F.2d at 239; NLRB v. Leland-Gifford Co., 200 F.2d 620, 625 (1st Cir. 1952). We do not see how the Examiner could have concluded otherwise in the face of the clear mandate of Section 2 (11) that a supervisor is not merely one who has \u201cauthority\u201d to act in the interest of the employer but is one who, in the <em>\u201cexercise </em>of such authority,\u201d is required to use \u201cindependent judgment.\u201d On this record we find substantial evidence to support the finding that the senior operators were not supervisory personnel within the contemplation of the statute but were merely \u201clead men\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> among the operating employees on each shift. Our affirmance of the Board\u2019s order is not, therefore, precluded by this claim of supervisory status.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">In addition to our conclusions that there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings both as to unfair labor practices and as to the status of the senior operators, we find the several remedies fashioned by the Board to be appropriate. The major remedial measures imposed included orders that the employer (1) cease and desist from its unlawful practices, (2) recognize and bargain with the union, (3) reinstate the discharged employees, and (4) award back pay to the dischargees computed in the customary manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">First, the union has contested the determination that the dischargees\u2019 back pay award is to be limited to <em>net </em>back pay (back pay offset by interim earnings at other employment) rather than <em>gross </em>back pay. The union\u2019s argument, that only full back pay would \u201cef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>fectuate the purposes of the Act\u201d as required by Section 10(c), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (c) (1964), rests on two propositions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The union first points out that net back pay is always inadequate because it can never make a discharged employee whole. This is so because the remedy fails to take into account such factors as inflation, the humiliation of being fired, and the frustration of searching for another job. Furthermore, the 6 percent interest allowed fails to recoup the interest that a discharged employee might have been forced to pay on money borrowed to sustain himself and his family during the period of joblessness. Nor does net back pay make allowance for such intangibles as the loss of credit occasioned by the dischargee\u2019s inability to maintain payments on debts incurred prior to his discharge. The union\u2019s second point is that the Board\u2019s refusal to invoke a remedy which fully compensates discharged employees discourages them, and all employees generally, from exercising to the fullest extent their statutory rights. An employee who knows that the Board\u2019s actions will not fully protect him in the event of an unlawful discharge will be, to that extent, reluctant to assert his rights in their fullest range.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">While the reasoning of this challenge to the customary net back pay remedy would appear to have equal applicability to all reinstatement orders, the union asks that this standard remedy be laid aside in favor of full back pay only in cases in which the employer\u2019s conduct has been \u201cparticularly egregious,\u201d as the union contends that the employer\u2019s conduct in this proceeding has been. The Trial Examiner, after careful consideration of the union\u2019s contentions, concluded that under the facts of this case the requested remedy was neither necessary nor appropriate to effectuate the Act\u2019s policies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In support of that conclusion he pointed out that there was no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>of record that the employer had such a history of violations that only a more drastic remedial measure could assure compliance with the Act. His decision was buttressed by his further conclusion that the proposal to eliminate the interim earning offset was more punitive than remedial, and that punitive remedies \u201chave not been considered authorized by the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The union readily agrees that the Board\u2019s powers are remedial in nature and that it \u201ccould not award gross back pay for the purpose of punishing the employer.\u201d <em>See </em>Republic Steel Corp. v. NLRB, 311 U.S. 7, 61 S.Ct. 77, 85 L.Ed. 6 (1940); Local 60, United Broth. of Carpenters and Joiners of America Local v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 651, 655, 81 S.Ct. 875, 6 L.Ed.2d 1 (1961). The union further concedes that full back pay is no more directly responsive to the sorts of collateral and intangible harms suffered by discharged employees than is net back pay; its claim is that the former provides \u201cmore complete compensation\u201d for the employees\u2019 losses. While the union persistently asserts that its proposed remedy falls well on the permissible side of the thin line between compensation and punishment, it makes no effort to place a dollar figure on the inadequacies of net back pay. Nor does it attempt to quantify the difference, as to these discharged employees, between net and gross. In light of the union\u2019s contention that the remedy should only obtain in cases of egregious employer conduct, we cannot fault the Board for viewing the <em>full </em>back pay alternative, at least based on the union\u2019s showing here, as essentially punitive. Contrarily, the <em>net </em>back pay order entered in this case cannot, on this record, be said to be \u201ca patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d NLRB v. J. H. Rutter-Rex Mfg. Co., 396 U.S. 258, 263, 90 S.Ct. 417, 420, 24 L.Ed.2d 405 (1969), quoting NLRB v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., 344 U.S. 344, 346-347, 73 S.Ct. 287 (1953).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The employer has attacked another facet of the Board\u2019s remedial order \u2014 the bargaining order. A brief recapitulation of the events of the months following the summer of 1966 is essential to an understanding of the employer\u2019s claim. Because of the numerous unfair labor practices engaged in by the employer prior to the election scheduled for late September of 1966, the election was postponed indefinitely by order of the Board\u2019s Regional Director. Shortly thereafter the unfair labor practice complaint was filed, and on December 22, 1966, pursuant to the terms of Section 10(j), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(j) (1964), the Regional Director filed a petition for a temporary injunction in the federal district court for Kansas. After a full hearing that court issued an injunction in April, 1967. Angle v. Sacks, 55 CCH Lab.Cas. \u00b6 11,865 (D.Kan.1967). With slight modification that decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 382 F.2d 655 (1967). Essentially the injunction ordered the employer to refrain from engaging in any further antiunion conduct and, pending resolution of the complaint on the merits, to reinstate four of the employees whose discharges were believed to be illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The employer\u2019s argument now is that, once the Board had obtained a Section 10(j) injunction, it could not thereafter seek a bargaining order in the complaint proceeding, but was restricted to seeking a cease and desist order. The employer\u2019s rationale proceed from the premise that the purpose of an injunction in cases of this sort is to preserve the status quo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>pending an election, <em>i. e., </em>to maintain the conditions necessary to assure that the election result reflects the true, undistorted view of the employees. On the other hand, because of the strong preference for free elections, bargaining orders are appropriate only when it is demonstrated that an atmosphere conducive to the untrammeled elective process does not exist. Therefore, so the argument goes, once an injunction has been obtained the conditions essential for a valid election are assured, and the Board is precluded from asserting that such conditions do not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The employer attempts to rest its case for the mutual exclusivity of injunctions and bargaining orders on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent discussion of bargaining orders in NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 610-615, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). We, contrarily, find in that opinion the refutation of so strict a limitation on the Board\u2019s expert discretion. The Court made clear that it was the Board\u2019s responsibility to ascertain on a case-by-case basis whether in fact conditions were not conducive to a \u201cfair and reliable election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614, 89 S.Ct. 1918. Certainly the Board may not ignore its function merely because an injunction against unfair labor practices has been obtained. Furthermore, this ease would appear to provide a particularly poor vehicle for raising this novel remedial limitation since the Board did in fact find violations of Sections 8(a) (3) and 8(a) (4) <em>after </em>the entry of the injunction. As the Court in <em>Gissel </em>made clear, \u201ca bargaining order is designed as much to remedy past election damage as it is to deter future misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1939. This being so, the scope and impact of the two remedies can rarely be expected to be coextensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The near converse of the employer\u2019s argument \u2014 that the pendency of a refusal to bargain complaint obviates the need for injunctive relief \u2014 was considered and rejected by the district court in the injunction proceedings in Kansas. <em>See </em>Sacks v. Angle, <em>supra </em>at 18,820-18,821. We reject its counterpart here.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">We have considered the other contentions pressed by the employer in its petitions for review in Nos. 23,750 and 23,751, and find them to be without merit. Consequently we deny the review petitions of both the union and the employer, and grant the Board\u2019s application for enforcement of its orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-13\">. A collateral issue relevant to the first Board order is whether the Examiner erred in failing to hear the testimony of one of the employees. Although employee Garrett was not called as a witness at the initial unfair labor practice hearing, after issuance of the Examiner\u2019s Preliminary Decision the Board granted the employer\u2019s request to reopen tire hearing to take his testimony. After remand to the Examiner, however, it was discovered that Garrett was suffering from serious mental and emotional difficulties and, based upon the testimony of two psychiatrists, the Examiner concluded \u201cthat Garrett was, and would continue to be, physically and emotionally unable to testify without substantial risk to his mental stability.\u201d AVeighing this along with the considerations that Garrett\u2019s testimony did not appear critical and, indeed, because of his protracted emotional disturbance, would be of doubtful credibility, the Examiner recommended that the Board rescind its order requiring the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>opening of the hearing. The Board complied. Since on this record we do not believe that the employer\u2019s case was seriously prejudiced, we find the Board\u2019s decision, based on the Examiner\u2019s evaluation of the matter, to be unobjectionable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">. We reserve to the third section of this opinion our examination of the several issues raised with regard to the remedies employed by the Board in this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b298-9\">. NLRB v. Security Guard Serv., Inc., 384 F.2d 143,145 (5th Cir. 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\">. The import of the distinction is made unmistakably clear in Section 14(a) of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-11\">\u201c * * * no employer subject to this Act shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors as employees for the purposes of any law, either national or local, relating to collective bargaining.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-18\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 164(a) (1964). Prior to 1947 the National Labor Relations Act appeared to treat all employees alike, drawing no lines between the rank and file employees and those more closely associated with management. The Board, however, had studiously avoided holding one way or the other on the question. When, in Packard Motor Car Co. v. NLRB, 330 U.S. 485, 67 S.Ct. 789, 91 L.Ed. 1040 (1947), the Supreme Court dissolved all doubts by definitively holding that supervisors were employees under the Act, Congress immediately responded with the amendments (known as the Taft-Hartley Act) which, among other things, clearly defined supervisors as non-employees. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947) ; H.R.Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\">. One of the notices indicated that senior operators were to approve the timecards of junior operators on their shifts. The employer cites this responsibility as further evidence of their superior status. The record shows, however, that no particular significance attached to the senior operator\u2019s signature since no card was valid until the plant manager had approved it. At any rate, the function of timecard approval does not convert an employee into a supervisor. <em>See, e. g., </em>NLRB v. Southern Bleachery &amp; Print Works, Inc., <em>supra, </em>257 F.2d at 238.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b302-5\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>International Union of United Brewery, Flour, Cereal, Soft Drink &amp; Distillery Workers v.

The employer has also sought to make much of the established interpretation of Section 2(11) which requires that its clauses be read disjunctively, <em>i. e., </em>that the existence of any one of the enumerated supervisory powers is conclusive of the status question. <em>See, e. g., </em>NLRB v. Fullerton Publishing Co., 283 F.2d 545, 548 (9th Cir. 1960) ; Ohio Power Co. v. NLRB, <em>supra </em>176 F.2d at 387. In its reply brief the employer characterized this interpretation as the \u201cmajority\u201d view and alleged that the Board had in this case rejected that approach and had instead referred to the clauses of the definition as if they constituted merely a \u201cguide\u201d rather than a \u201cchecksheet\u201d of pertinent indicia. In so doing it was charged by the employer with having followed the decidedly \u201cminority\u201d view of this jurisdiction. Food Store Employees Union, Local 347 v. NLRB, <em>supra </em>137 U.S.App.D.C. at 253, 422 F.2d at 690. This contention lacks merit. The Examiner at no point purported to reject the disjunctive operation of the statute. Indeed, since he found no one of the enumerated supervisory powers to exist, he was not called on to decide whether a finding of any one of them would have been sufficient. Apart from the Board\u2019s actions, we do not read our own decisions, which seek simply to eschew a wooden application of the statute, to be inconsistent with the practice elsewhere. For a valuable discussion of the statute, rationalizing its disjunctive and conjunctive aspects, see NLRB v. Security Guard Serv., Inc., 384 F.2d 143, 147-151 (5th Cir. 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b303-5\">. The union was joined by the Board\u2019s General Counsel in pressing this contention upon the Trial Examiner in the first unfair labor practice hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b303-6\">. The union contends that this case must be remanded to the Board for reconsideration in light of International Union of Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers v. NLRB, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 249, 253-259, 426 F.2d 1243, 1247-1253 (1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 950, 91 S.Ct. 239, 27 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971) (Tiidee Products), and UAW v. NLRB, Nos. 24,557, 24,715 (D.C.Cir. March 19, 1971) (Ex-Cell-O Corp.). <em>Tiidee </em>and <em>Ex-Cell-O </em>hold that the Board is authorized under Section 10 (e) to provide compensatory relief, over and above the customary cease-and-desist order, to make employees whole in cases characterized by the employer\u2019s brazen refusal to bargain. The unions in both cases claimed that compensation, for any period of protracted frivolous litigation designed by the employer to postpone the date on which the union would be recognized, should have been computed on the basis of an estimate of the benefits the employees would likely have derived from good faith bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The remedy sought in this proceeding and the Board\u2019s treatment of it are sufficiently different to take this case out of the <em>Tiidee-Ex-Cell-0 </em>context. First, while the union does claim that net back pay fails to effectuate the policies of the Act, it does not contend that the remedy has the effect of positively encouraging the employer to delay in offering reinstatement or to engage in other acts antithetical to the policies of the Act. <em>See </em>NLRB v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., 344 U.S. 344, 347-348, 73 S.Ct. 287, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1953). Nor does this case raise the spectre, present in the other cases, of a Board remedy which, in effect, encourages the employer to continue his refusal to bargain, thereby frustrating a central policy of the Act favoring collective bargaining. Second, the Board was not content in this case to reject the union\u2019s remedial argument on the ground that the relief it sought was not the customary one. On this record we cannot take seriously any claim that the Board refused to exercise its discretion in arriving at an effective remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">For these reasons we find it unnecessary to delay the finality of our judgment in this case in order to permit the union to petition this court for reconsideration in light of developments since this case was argued in November, 1970. <em>See </em>I. L. G. W. U. v. NLRB, 143 U.S.App.D.C. \u2014, 443 F.2d 667 (1970) (Marie Phillips, Inc.) ; United Steelworkers v. NLRB, 139 U.S.App.D.C. 146, 430 F.2d 519 (1970) (Quality Rubber Mfg. Co.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b304-5\">. <em>See </em>United Steelworkers v. NLRB, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 178, 436 F.2d 908 (1970). We also reject the union\u2019s claim that the one employee who was twice discrim-inatorily discharged should be given the option either to accept reinstatement, or to reject it and continue to receive back pay until he finds suitably equivalent employment elsewhere. The union\u2019s contention that employer animosity is so great that a responsible working relationship could not be re-established at this time is unpersuasive. At any rate we have not been shown that reinstatement coupled with net back pay is ineffective to effectuate the policies of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
