We are likewise in agreement with the conclusion of the District Court that the Ordinance under consideration is invalid and is not severable. It is our opinion that the Ordinance is in conflict with the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671 et seq. (see also Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717 et seq.). Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the terms of said Act, it appears that the Gas Pipe Line Company (appellee) has offered to comply with all conditions which the Parish Police Jury could reasonably require of it. We do not hold that the Parish Police Jury cannot enact a valid ordinance requiring permits with reasonable conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
