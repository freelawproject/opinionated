We find no reversible error and therefore affirm. An understanding of the reasons for our de-cisi\u00f3n requires a detailed discussion of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-14\">Jointly indicted with Crane were three codefendants, Brown, Murphy and Seitz. Brown and Murphy had pleaded guilty and were serving their sentences.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Seitz had confessed but had not been tried.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The crime was committed in the extreme northern part of Georgia close to the Tennessee line and near Chattanooga. At approximately 5:00 A.M. on September 21, 1969, Captain John Holt of the Sheriff\u2019s Department, Hamilton County, Chattanooga, Tennessee, received a telephone call from an unnamed person who asked to speak to Robert E. Cornish, Chief of Detectives. On being advised that Cornish was at his home, the caller left a telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-15\">Cornish promptly returned the call. The informant told him that the Flint-stone Post Office had been burglarized, and named three individuals as the burglars, one of whom was Seitz, already well known to Cornish.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cornish then called back to Captain Holt, asked him to check the Flintstone Post Office as to whether it had actually been burglarized, and to send Detective Nelson to the Ross-ville, Georgia, area where Cornish would meet him.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-16\">Captain Holt found the doors of the Post Office open and signs of the safe having been dragged across the floor to a dirt and gravel driveway which bore heavy tire marks. He advised Chief Cornish on the patrol radio.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-17\">Meanwhile Cornish had proceeded from his home in Tennessee to Rossville, Georgia. As he drove onto Chickamauga Avenue, he saw a 1963 Plymouth which he knew to be operated by Seitz. He could not then identify the other occu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>pant of the car but later did identify him as Brown. Cornish being afraid to follow the car too closely, it was lost from his view. Shortly thereafter he again saw the car, then following a truck. He followed both the car and the truck. They drove directly to a garage which was later identified as Crane\u2019s Garage. The truck turned into one of the bays of the garage. Seitz and Brown parked the Plymouth car, and entered the garage at the same time as the truck. The bay door was then closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In the garage door were three horizontally spaced small windows. After parking his ear, Cornish walked across to the edge of the garage and looked into the garage through one of the windows. Continuing, Cornish testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">\u201cQ. All right, did you see anything inside?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">\u201cA. Yes, sir. There was the truck in the first bay. They had the doors of the truck open. There was a heavy-set man with bushy hair who was pushing a group of tanks up they normally use for cutting torches and things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">\u201cQ. You mentioned Seitz. Do you know a man named Tommy Seitz?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">\u201cA. Ido.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-11\">\u201cQ. Did you know him previous to this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-12\">\u201cA. Well; yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-13\">\u201cQ. Was that man pushing that torch Mr. Seitz?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-14\">\u201cA. No; it wasn\u2019t, sir. Mr. Seitz has short hair, and this man had quite a bit of hair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-15\">\u201cQ. Do you know where any of the other people in the garage were ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-16\">\u201cA. Yes, sir. I could see over on the back side of the garage hear another person getting some \u2014 rummaging around in some tools or something there, and at that time I didn\u2019t know who he was, but I could later identify him as Murphy-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\">\"Q. All right. Well, do you know Mr. Brown ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-17\">\u201cA. I do now. I didn\u2019t at that time. I knew of him. I knew what he looked like, but I did not know a lot about him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-18\">\u201cQ. Was it light or dark in the garage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-19\">\u201cA. Oh, there was no lights on in the garage. There was \u2014 the lights were shining, you could see shadows and see people moving around. I doubt very seriously \u2014there wasn\u2019t a lot of light, but I could see these individuals easily enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-20\">* * * * # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-21\">\u201cQ. Have you subsequently come to know Mr. Brown?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-22\">\u201cA. Yes; I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-23\">-X- * * * -X- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-24\">\u201cQ. All right, state whether or not the man dragging that oxygen tank was Mr. Brown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-25\">-X- X- * X X- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-26\">\u201cA. (By the Witness) The man was a much larger man than Mr. Brown.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Tr. pp. 44, 45, 46.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-27\">About that time Detective Nelson arrived and took a position to see that no one escaped from the garage building. About the same time, Cornish received over his car radio the report from Captain Holt that, on checking, he found Flintstone Post Office had been burglarized. Cornish then called for the Ross-ville police and within minutes some of their officers arrived. In quick succession, a magistrate was summoned to the scene, and a telephone call to Crane\u2019s home brought his two sons, one 18 and the other 19 years old, with a key to the garage. Before the key was used to enter the garage, \u201cquite a crowd of people\u201d had gathered. Cornish testified that the entry was \u201cafter a search warrant had been issued.\u201d (Tr. 48) Similarly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Captain Holt testified, \u201cAfter they got the search warrant I went inside the building.\u201d (Tr. 35) Cornish signed the affidavit for the warrant. (Tr. 91) Crane\u2019s younger son testified that Officer Griffin gave the search warrant to his brother. (Tr. 342) The search warrant was not introduced in evidence. On objection by Crane\u2019s counsel that, \u201cif he had a search warrant, we say it would be the highest and best evidence\u201d (Tr. 49), the district court ruled: \u201cThe fact he may have made an entry into a building without a search warrant would not, in and of itself, be inadmissible. If I see any authority you can cite to the contrary I will be glad to change my ruling and instruct the jury likewise.\u201d (Tr. 50-51)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Seitz and Brown were found inside the truck with the unopened post office safe.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Officer Griffin found Crane in the garage bathroom sitting on the commode with its lid closed and bearing some lacerations on his head. Last of all, Murphy was found lying on the floor in a screened in area \u201cwhere there was a lot of stored tires and what-have-you.\u201d (Tr. 52, 53)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Crane\u2019s conviction or acquittal might well turn on the evidence of his physical and mental condition at the time of and shortly after he was discovered in the garage toilet. That is made clear by the evidence on the trial and the affidavits on the motion and amended motion for new trial. Seitz testified that he went with Murphy to Crane\u2019s garage for a repair to be made on a car which Murphy had bought from Crane, that Crane \u201cknew we were thieves\u201d (Tr. 139), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\u201cWhile we were there getting the dimmer switch put on, John Crane was talking to us about the Flintstone Post Office and the house across the street from it being empty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-13\">\u201cAnd he said that now would be the time to get the safe in it, and he took a piece of paper and wrote down his phone number on it and said, \u2018Call me when you get it,\u2019 and walked in the office and got the key to the big truck out of the cash register and gave us the key to this big GMC, V-6, Cab-over-engine truck with a lift tailgate and all on it, told us to get a key made for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-14\">\u201cI took the key, and they put the dimmer switch on, about that time they had completed putting it on, and so we left and went and got a key made for it and brought the other key back, gave it to John Crane, and I don\u2019t know if he put it back in the cash register or not. I just handed it to him. Anyway, we had a copy of the k\u00e9y made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-15\">\u201cThen the next day we came over there and got the truck and went and stole the safe out of the post office.\u201d (Tr. 141, 142)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-16\">In his own behalf Crane testified that he had been in the garage business in Rossville, Georgia, for 23 years and operated a lot for the sale of automobiles in connection with his garage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He had a heart condition and on May 4, 1968, he was in an automobile accident. His brother Ernest thereafter operated the garage for him. Ernest did a brake job on Seitz\u2019s automobile, and Crane had known Seitz for only two or three weeks. According to Crane\u2019s testimony, Seitz in the company of Brown had talked to Ernest about buying the truck. Crane had never before seen Brown. Crane admitted giving Seitz the paper on which appeared in his handwriting \u201c866-8042 Home J. Crane,\u201d introduced as Government Exhibit 11. Crane testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Ernest lives at Burning Bush, a long distance from the garage, while Crane lives within less than a mile, and further</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYv\">\u201cHe (Seitz) asked Ernest if they decided if they wanted it could they call him Sunday or some time when we was closed up, if they wanted to buy the truck, how could they get in contact, and he said, \u2018Well, John lives closer than I do.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">\u201cAnd I gave him \u2014 he said, \u2018It would be better if you gave them your telephone number because I live at Burning Bush.\u2019\u201d (Tr. 245)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">According to Crane\u2019s testimony, on this Sunday morning, September 21, at 6:10 o\u2019clock, Seitz telephoned to him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">\u201cThey [sic] said they wanted the truck, they had a job for it, and to come make a bill of sale on it. I said, \u2018It\u2019s not even daylight.\u2019 I said, \u2018Let\u2019s wait until it\u2019s daylight.\u2019 And they said, \u2018Now, we\u2019ve got a job for it, and we\u2019ve got the money, and, if you want to come over and make a bill of sale and sell it, we\u2019re interested in it.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, okay, I\u2019ll be over.\u2019 \u201d (Tr. 249)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">When Crane arrived at the garage \u201cit was dark and real foggy.\u201d As Crane unlocked the garage door he got hit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">\u201cA. I got hit in the head, on the back of the head, and I went down. And I remember enough that I tried to get up, and when I tried to get up they hit me again, and that\u2019s all I do remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">\u201cQ.. Now, from that point on do you remember what happened to you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aoq-dedup-0\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">\u201cQ. When did you regain consciousness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">\u201cA. I was in the bathroom, and, Mr. Griffin and my boys were in there, and I remember my boys was washing my head, the blood off of my head * * (Tr. 257, 258)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">The verdict might turn on whether the jurors believed that the blows to Crane\u2019s head were inflicted against Crane\u2019s will by others, presumably one or more of Crane\u2019s three codefendants, or were self-inflicted, as claimed by the Government.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The severity vel non of the blows is an important circumstance in that inquiry. Admittedly, the lacerations did not require stitches. Crane testified that with the help of his sons on either side he was taken from the bathroom to a chair in his office, some 28 or 30 feet distant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Cornish testified that there was nothing unusual in the way Crane walked from the bathroom to the outer office and sat down in a chair. It appears without dispute that Crane remained there for more than an hour until his brother Ernest arrived. Ernest testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-18\">\u201cWhen I walked in he was setting [sic] in the chair white as a ghost. He had two lacerations right here and one back here. I asked why he hadn\u2019t been to the hospital, and I started to take him to the hospital, and the deputy sheriff said he would take him, and he took him to the hospital.\u201d (Tr. 420)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-19\">According to the hospital records, Crane was brought to the Emergency Room at Hutcheson Memorial Hospital at 9:45 A.M. on September 21, 1969. The physician on duty at that time was Dr. Sheldon Wohl, then the hospital\u2019s Resident Physician and Surgeon. Dr. Wohl did not testify at Crane\u2019s trial. Instead, Crane\u2019s counsel introduced Dr. Thomas E. Atkins of Rossville, Georgia, Crane\u2019s family physician who had treated him for his injuries in the automobile accident of May 4, 1968. Dr. Atkins did not make a notation of the time of day that he first saw Crane but testified, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>\u201cAs I recall, it was late in the morning.\u201d (Tr. 372) Dr. Wohl\u2019s affidavit introduced on the amended motion for new trial included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\">\u201c(12) After remaining in the Emergency Room for about two (2) hours, during which time he was under Af-fiant\u2019s personal observation, Affiant ordered him confined to the hospital as a patient. Affiant understood from some source, now unknown to the Af-fiant, that MR. CRANE\u2019S personal physician was Dr. T. E. Adkins [sic], and it is Affiant\u2019s recollection that Dr. Adkins [sic] could not be located and did not see the patient for several hours thereafter.\u201d (Tr. 53)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The verdict of the jury was returned on March 18, 1970 (Tr. 554). The original motion for new trial was filed on April 9, 1970, within the time provided by an order entered pursuant to Rule 33, Rules of Criminal Procedure. The motion showed that before the trial Crane\u2019s counsel had learned that Dr. Wohl had admitted Crane and treated him but had been unable to locate Dr. Wohl, having been informed only that Dr. Wohl had gone to California. It was true that Dr. Wohl had gone to California, but before Crane\u2019s trial he had returned to Chattanooga and was on the staff of the Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga, different from the Hutcheson Memorial Hospital of Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, to which Crane had been admitted. Neither Crane nor his counsel knew where to locate Dr. Wohl until April 1, 1970 \u201cwhen his counsel was informed that Dr. Wohl had returned to Chattanooga.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The motion continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">\u201cMovant\u2019s counsel immediately contacted the said DR. WOHL by telephone in the emergency room at Memorial Hospital, Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he was on duty, and discussed his knowledge of the facts, and DR. WOHL stated to movant\u2019s counsel that he had been under subpoena, that he had talked to the government attorneys or agents, the names of whom were unknown to him, and that he had been instructed to stand by the telephone all day, waiting for a call to Rome, Georgia to testify, but that he was never called by the United States attorney\u2019s office as a witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-10\">\u201cMovant avers that the nondisclosure by the United States respecting the whereabouts of DR. WOHL entitles movant to a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-11\">\u201cMovant alleges that there was not only a duty on the part of the United States in such case to search for evidence, but a further duty to disclose all of its evidence, however insignificant, to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-12\">\u201cMovant alleges that the non-disclosure was not a negligent non-disclosure on the part of the United States attorney, but was a deliberate non-disclosure and that the prosecution knowingly suppressed such relevant, exculpatory evidence.\u201d (R. 9)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">At the time of the filing of the motion, Dr. Wohl had left Chattanooga by automobile and was en route to California. Counsel applied to the court for an order to take Dr. Wohl\u2019s deposition at Hollywood, California. The court denied that motion, and also denied the original motion for new trial, stating its reasons in an order from which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-14\">\u201cGrounds four and nine allege that the government suppressed and concealed the evidence of Dr. Shelton Wohl, who, it is contended, treated the defendant at Hutcheson Memorial Hospital shortly after the commission of the crime charged in the indictment. In ground ten, the defendant moves for a new trial because of newly dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>covered evidence, <em>i. e., </em>the testimony of Dr. Wohl, which the defendant contends would show that the defendant was unconscious when admitted to the emergency room of Hutcheson Memorial Hospital on September 21, 1969. From the evidence and various affidavits attached to the post-trial motions in this case, it is apparent that the defendant and his counsel knew of Dr. Wohl\u2019s treatment of the defendant in advance of the trial of the case. Furthermore, the affidavit of C. R. Netherton, Postal Inspector for the Post Office Department, attached to the brief of the Government\u2019s response to the motion for new trial, clearly states that he obtained from the administrative office of Hutcheson Memorial Hospital the address of Dr. Wohl in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in January, 1970, some 45 to 50 days prior to the trial of this case. According to Mr. Netherton\u2019s affidavit, the truth of which has not been contested by the defendant, defendant\u2019s counsel \u2018is on the Board of Hutcheson Memorial Hospital and has served in that capacity since the hospital was in the planning stage.\u2019 Thus, it appears to the court that defendant\u2019s counsel was in as good a position, if not better than Mr. Netherton, to determine the whereabouts of Dr. Wohl. Therefore, grounds four, nine and ten are likewise overruled and denied.\u201d (R. 112)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqf-dedup-0\">On the day that the court denied the original motion for new trial, counsel for Crane filed an amended motion to which was attached a lengthy affidavit of Dr. Wohl, from which we quote extensively :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">\u201c(9) MR. CRANE has [sic] been in the Emergency Room but a short time when Affiant personally made a physical examination of MR. CRANE. Affiant examined MR. CRANE carefully and found two (2) contusions and abrasions on his head which appeared to be the result of violent blows to the skull.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201c(10) That the patient could not talk coherently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">\u201c(11) Affiant made a thorough physical examination of MR. CRANE and he did not respond to pin-pricks and various other tests supplied to determine whether or not he was conscious, and in Affiant\u2019s opinion, JOHN LOUIS CRANE was unconscious when he arrived in the Emergency Room, and he remained unconscious for a period of two (2) hours after his arrival. While in the Emergency Room during said two-hour period, MR. CRANE did not respond to pain or pin-pricks and was in Affiant\u2019s opinion, completely insensible and unconscious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">\u201c(13) The seriousness of MR.

CRANE was insensibly unconscious for two (2) hours when he arrived in the Emergency Room at Hutcheson Memorial Hospital. Af-fiant was never called to testify in the case, although he remained by a telephone, as instructed by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, so that he could be called from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Rome, Georgia to testify as a witness if the United States Attorney decided to use his evidence.\u201d (R. 52, 53 and 54)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Notice of appeal was filed on June 29, 1970.

On the other hand, Dr. Wohl\u2019s testimony might have been so objectively based as to supply the added weight necessary to cause some or all of the jurors to entertain a reasonable doubt of Crane\u2019s guilt, and thus to prevent a verdict of guilty. We think that if the Government actually suppressed Dr. Wohl\u2019s evidence, then as a matter of law the district court should have granted a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-16\">The Supreme Court has announced the rule in positive language that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-17\">\u201cWe now hold that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-18\">Brady v. Maryland, 1963, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1197, 10 L.Ed.2d 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-19\">The principle has been progressively developed both in this Circuit<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and in other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> One of the most enlightening discussions of the extent of the prosecution\u2019s constitutional duty to reveal evidence to the defendant is contained in Levin v. Clark, 1967, 133 U.S. App.D.C. 6, 408 F.2d 1209.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>In the present case, a careful study of the evidence has convinced us that the district judge did not err as a matter of law in denying Crane\u2019s motion for new trial. Some of the reasons which influence us to so hold are:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">First, parts of Dr. Wohl\u2019s affidavit may be inconsistent with the evidence of Crane\u2019s mental and physical condition during the three or more hours after Crane claims to have been hit and before Dr. Wohl saw him.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Second, both the postal inspector, Mr. Netherton, and the prosecutor, Assistant United States Attorney Forrester, submitted affidavits to the effect that Dr. Wohl did not indicate to either that he would testify favorably to Crane or that Crane was unconscious or insensible and that there was no attempt to influence the issue of whether to call or not to call Dr. Wohl as a witness. Mr. Forrester also swore that \u201cNo one associated with the defense ever asked me any questions concerning his whereabouts.\u201d (R. 78) Indeed, there is no contention that Crane or his counsel requested any help from the Government in locating Dr. Wohl. That is hard to understand since they were charged with notice that the Government would also try to locate Dr. Wohl as a witness.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Third, the contrast between the diligence of the Government and that of the defendant is striking. Mr. Netherton, the Postal Inspector, as early as January 27, 1970, went to the Hutcheson Memorial Hospital in Walker County, Georgia, and interviewed the Records Custodian. Mr. Netherton was given the date that Crane was admitted and released and the names of the doctors who treated him. On the same date, he went to the office of the Hospital Administrator, where he talked to Mrs. Roxie E. Walker who told him that Dr. Shelton Wohl was employed at Chattanooga and gave him the name of the hospital where he was working. Mr. Netherton then attempted to contact Dr. Wohl by telephone and was told that he was off duty. Netherton\u2019s affidavit continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">\u201cI called Dr. Wohl again on February 2, 1970, and spoke with him concerning the admission of John Louis Crane to the Hutcheson Memorial Hospital. From my notes and memory, I recall that Dr. Wohl stated to me that he had examined Crane and that all that he could determine was that he had received some sort of a blow to [sic] head which had caused minor lacerations. He stated that he treated the minor lacerations. He stated fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ther that because of Crane\u2019s complaints of pain and dizziness he was admitted for observation. According to Dr. Wohl, \u2018TO ME HE WAS JUST ANOTHER PATIENT. THEREFORE, I HAD NO REASON TO DISBELIEVE ANYTHING THAT HE TOLD ME.\u2019 I asked Dr. Wohl if he could tell whether Crane received a blow sufficient to cause prolonged unconsciousness and Dr. Wohl stated to me that there was no way to determine this fact as he made no detailed inquiry, again reiterating that he had no reason at that time to disbelieve Crane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">\u201cAt no time did Dr. Wohl or anyone else state to me that John Louis Crane was unconscious when admitted to the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">\u201cMrs. Roxie Walker has stated to me that Frank Gleason, Crane\u2019s attorney, is on the Board of the Hutcheson Memorial Hospital and has served in that capacity since the hospital was in the planning stage.\u201d (R. 23, 24)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Crane\u2019s attorney, Mr. Gleason, deposed in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">\u201c(6) Affiant called the Hutcheson Memorial Hospital and talked to MARY NEAL, the Records Librarian, and Affiant\u2019s secretary also called the hospital and talked to the Records Librarian in an effort to locate the said DR. WOHL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">\u201c(7) Affiant was informed that DR. WOHL had terminated his services at the Hutcheson Memorial Hospital on October 29, 1969; that the records of the hospital did not disclose where he had gone, and that they did not know his whereabouts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">\u201c(8) Affiant was informed by MARY NEAL, the Records Librarian, that she had heard that he was somewhere in California, but where, she did not know and further that she did not know of any one who did know where DR. WOHL was then located. The effort to locate DR. WOHL began around March 1, 1970, and the case was to be tried on. March 16, 1970.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-13\">\u201c(9) Affiant did not know the whereabouts of DR. WOHL on or about March 1, 1970, and could not, with due diligence, locate him in California or any other place, and therefore, could not subpoena him as a witness for MR. CRANE in the trial of the aforesaid case.\u201d (R. 102, 103) <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVb\">Not surprisingly, Mr. Netherton\u2019s prompt personal visit to the Hospital proved more effective than Mr. Gleason\u2019s late telephone calls. Further, Mr. Gleason failed to follow up on the clear lead to Dr. Wohl\u2019s location given by Dr. Atkins in his testimony at Crane\u2019s trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay4\">\u201cQ. And is Dr. Wohl now on the staff of the hospital, or is he gone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWk\">\u201cA. He\u2019s gone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-14\">\u201cQ. How long has he been gone from the hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-15\">\u201cA. I would make an estimate of about four to four and a half months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-16\">\u201cQ. Do you know where he is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAX\">\u201cA. He\u2019s gone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-18\">\u201cQ. Do you know where he is presently practicing, where he is located ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-19\">\u201cA. His residence was initially in California. I had heard he was going back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-20\">\u201cQ. But you don\u2019t know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-21\">\u201cA. I heard later he was in Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga. But whether he\u2019s still there or not I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-22\">\u201cQ. I see.\" (Tr. 375) <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>In short, there is no sufficient evidence to prove that the Government suppressed or attempted to suppress the testimony of Dr. Wohl. The foregoing discussion, already too long, suffices also to demonstrate that the district judge did not abuse his judicial discretion. The rule is well stated in \u00a7 557, p. 515, of 2 Wright Federal Practice and Procedure, Criminal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">\u201cA motion based on newly discovered evidence must disclose (1) that the evidence is newly discovered and was unknown to the defendant at the time of trial; (2) that the evidence is material, not merely cumulative or impeaching; (3) that it will probably produce an acquittal; and (4) that failure to learn of the evidence was due to no lack of diligence on the part of the defendant.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A86\">We would agree that movant\u2019s evidence established (1) and (2). We are doubtful as to (3), but positive that (4) was not established. The district court correctly found that the failure of Mr. Gleason to learn of evidence of Dr. Wohl in time for it to be offered at Crane\u2019s trial was due to his own lack of diligence. It follows that the court properly denied Crane\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The district court exercised its discretion to entertain Crane\u2019s motion to suppress made at the trial.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> While the search warrant was available (Tr. 472), the district court held that the search of the garage was proper as incidental to the lawful arrest of one or all of the accused men (Tr. 474, et seq.). We agree that the validity of the search can be sustained on that ground. Information from an unidentified informant not known to be reliable, coupled with verification of that information in essential particulars, may form a basis for probable cause to arrest. Katz v. Peyton, 4 Cir. 1964, 334 F.2d 77, 78. Cornish\u2019s view through one of the garage windows of the activity in the garage did not violate Crane\u2019s fourth amendment rights. Gil v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1971, 440 F.2d 666. Before entering the garage, Cornish knew that the Flintstone Post Office- had actually been burglarizd during the night and that before daybreak a truck had been driven into Crane\u2019s garage followed by two men, one of whom was Seitz (named by the informant). Thus the information furnished by the informant was corroborated to an extent sufficient to constitute probable cause to enter the garage and arrest the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">However, since the garage was surrounded so that the accused could not escape, Cornish wisely waited until a search warrant could be issued. Crane did not sustain his burden to prove that search warrant defective. Eaton v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 408 F.2d 525, 529. It makes no difference that the search warrant was not formally introduced into evidence. As well said by Judge Thorn-berry for this Circuit in United States v. Thompson, 5 Cir. 1970, 421 F.2d 373, 377:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">\u201cThere was uncontradicted testimony at the hearing that a Louisiana criminal district judge issued a warrant for the search, and this testimony was sufficient to establish the issuance of the warrant. <em>See </em>Castle v. United States, 5th Cir. 1961, 287 F.2d 657; United States v. Burkhart, 6th Cir. 1965, 347 F.2d 772. Since the issuance of a warrant was effectively established, the burden of establishing that the search was illegal was on movant-defendant. Rogers v. United States, 5th Cir. 1964, 330 F.2d 535; Batten v. United States, 5th Cir. 1951, 188 F.2d 75; Chin Kay v. United States, 9th Cir. 1963, 311 F.2d 317. Defendant, however, completely failed to sustain his burden of proving that the warrant was illegally issued or executed. Defendant had access to the public records where the warrant was filed; he could have introduced the document into evidence in order to prove that it was illegally issued or executed. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>did not do so. In truth defendant\u2019s only complaint is that the prosecution did not introduce the warrant into evidence. We are aware of no rule of procedure, evidence or law that requires the prosecution to introduce a search warrant into evidence under such circumstances as are presented here. There was no error in the trial judge\u2019s allowance of testimony concerning the evidence seized at the house of defendant\u2019s mother.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The district court properly denied Crane\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In his closing argument to the jury, the Assistant United States Attorney said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">\u201cNow, what did John Crane do? Where did the aiding and abetting come in? I appreciate the fact he didn\u2019t go to the post office; he didn\u2019t break the locks off, and he didn\u2019t physically lift the safe out. He gave them the truck; he told them where to go; he let them in the garage; and he brought the cutting tools up there. And, Lord knows, what else he would have done except at that point they saw the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">\u201cThat is to counsel, command, to associate yourself with the venture as though it is something you want to bring about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">\u201cThis is your organized criminal. This is your criminal organizer. He doesn\u2019t do the dirty work. He goes out and finds men with hard times, men with families they can\u2019t support, or maybe drug addicts or maybe just really bad people \u2014 \u201d (Tr. 533)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">At this point, Crane\u2019s counsel objected and moved for a mistrial. The district court sustained the objection and instructed the jury that \u201cthey should not consider that remark by counsel.\u201d Counsel said, \u201cI withdraw it, and I apologize.\u201d The court declined to declare a mistrial. Clearly there was no reversible error. White v. United States, 9 Cir. 1968, 394 F.2d 49, 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">As said by Judge Brown in Blachly v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 380 F.2d 665, 675:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-13\">\u201cIn considering the motion for judgment of acquittal, F.R.Crim.P. 29(a), the District Judge must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, McFarland v. United States, 5 Cir., 1960, 273 F.2d 417; United States v. Carter, 6 Cir., 1963, 311 F.2d 934, together with all inferences which may reasonably be drawn from the facts, Cartwright v. United States, 10 Cir., 1964, 335 F.2d 919. The determining inquiry is whether there is substantial evidence upon which a jury might reasonably base a finding that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">The evidence, which we have stated at some length, clearly meets the standard which calls for denial of Crane\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. See 2 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure, Criminal, \u00a7 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-10\">. <em>In </em>violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2115.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-11\">.

The record does not show anything about the past reliability of the informant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b569-28\">. The court sustained objection to the witness\u2019 conclusionary statement that \u201cI thought it was Mr. Crane.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\">. When later opened, the safe was found to contain the property described in the indictment, viz.: \u201c$39.48 cash, $2544.29 stamps stock, 1445 blank money orders, one money order machine, money order validating and limitation stamps.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b570-17\">. Hospital records later introduced showed Crane\u2019s age as 49 years. His only previous criminal record was for larceny at the age of 15 or 16 years for which he served \u201csix months in the workhouse.\u201d (Tr. 277).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b571-13\">. We note, however, that Crane\u2019s testimony as to the opening of the garage door was not only in conflict with Seitz\u2019s testimony but it also was inconsistent with the more reliable testimony of Cornish about following the truck and car to Crane\u2019s garage and witnessing the entrance into the garage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b571-21\">. In this testimony he was corroborated by his sons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\">. The motion does not disclose the source of counsel\u2019s information.
