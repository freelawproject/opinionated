From the date of his apprehension until May 19, 1970, the first date assigned for his trial, Moher was represented by retained counsel who had filed certain motions on his behalf. When counsel failed to appear for the trial, the court was then advised that he was not admitted to practice before the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-23\">Appellant now contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel during the pre-trial motion stage because he was represented by an attorney not admitted to federal practice. In United States v. Bradford, 238 F.2d 395, 397 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 1002, 77 S.Ct. 558, 1 L.Ed.2d 546 (1959), we held that the inadvertent failure to comply with the rules governing the admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>sion to the bar of the district court \u201cin no way cause [s] any infringement of appellant\u2019s constitutional rights nor does it justify any inference that counsel was not in every way competent to represent the appellant * * Even if it were to be assumed that retained counsel\u2019s failure to appear rebutted this presumption of effective assistance, Moher\u2019s court-appointed counsel could, at any point during the four-month interval between his appointment and the trial, have requested an extension of the time allotted for the filing of pre-trial motions. Appellant has not, therefore, demonstrated that this turn of events exposed him to even \u201ca reasonable possibility of prejudice in fact.\u201d McGill v. United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 179, 348 F.2d 791, 793 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Moher also argues that the Government did not meet its burden of persuading the trial court either that he had knowingly and intelligently waived the presence of counsel at the police identification line-up or that the identification testimony offered was by witnesses who had independent bases for their courtroom identification of him. See United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 240, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 475, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); United States v. Ayers, 426 F. 2d 524, 527 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 842, 91 S.Ct. 85, 27 L.Ed.2d 78 (1970). Moher conceded at trial that he voluntarily signed a waiver of counsel\u2019s presence at the line-up and that he did so after conferring with his attorney. When appellant offered nothing to contradict the Government\u2019s evidence that his waiver \u201cwas not the result of an impetuous act * * * or the product of any physical or mental coercion\u201d but was in fact an intentional relinquishment of a known right, the trial court properly denied his motion to strike the testimony of identification witnesses. United States v. Drummond, 354 F.2d 132, 149 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1013, 86 S.Ct. 1968, 16 L.Ed.2d 1031 (1966); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Moher, in order to meet the charge that he had robbed the bank by threatening to bomb it, took the witness stand and testified that on the afternoon of the robbery he was at his mother\u2019s home and that he heard the local radio station\u2019s 3:00 p. m. news account of the telephoned bomb threat to the bank, followed by the robbery. In rebuttal the Government introduced the script of that broadcast which contained no reference whatever to a threat communicated by telephone. The appellant argues that this evidence was inadmissible under the federal business records statute because the script was prepared a few minutes before the broadcast and, therefore, was not made \u201cat the time of the act * * * or within a reasonable time thereafter.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732 (1964). A radio station employee testified, however, that scripts broadcast were filed in the ordinary course of business and that the penciled interlineations on the typewritten script demonstrated that it had been updated, rather than a new script written, as additional information was received. The script was properly admitted as a trustworthy record made substantially contemporaneously with the event it recorded. Bowman v. Kaufman, 387 F.2d 582 (2 Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">We have considered the other questions raised by appellant and find no error. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
