We hold there was no abuse of discretion. Petitioner\u2019s contention that the board was without authority to overrule the finding of the inquiry officer has been considered and found without merit in Kimm v. Rosenberg, 363 U.S. 405, 80 S.Ct. 1139, 4 L.Ed.2d 1299 (1960), rehearing denied 364 U.S. 854, 81 S.Ct. 30, 5 L.Ed.2d 77 (1960); Noverola-Bolaina v. I. N.
