On that day, at Exit No. 10 of the Ohio Turnpike in Cuyaho-ga County, Ohio, the Swarner automobile in which plaintiff was a passenger struck the rear end of another automobile, and plaintiff suffered the injuries which form the basis of the present litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-16\">Plaintiff was alleged to be at all times a resident of the State of New York. The defendants were residents of Florida, and the automobile in question was registered and insured for liability in Florida. A few days before the accident the Swarners had been on vacation in Wisconsin when they learned of the death of a relative in Buffalo, New York. After talking with other relatives in Buffalo, they agreed to pick up the plaintiff at her summer cottage in Ohio and take her to the funeral. The Swarners had planned to continue their vacation after the funeral and offered to return the plaintiff to Ohio. It was on this return trip that the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-17\">This action was commenced by plaintiff against her sister and brother-in-law in the New York Supreme Court, and, the defendants\u2019 insurer being sua-ble in New York, <em>quasi in rem </em>jurisdiction was accomplished by attachment of the insurance policy obligation to defend and indemnify running from defendants\u2019 insurer to defendants, under the doctrine set forth in Seider v. Roth, 17 N. Y.2d 111, 269 N.Y.S.2d 99, 216 N.E.2d 312 (1966). Defendants, setting forth the diversity of citizenship of the parties, petitioned for removal of the action to the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, and the ease was subsequently removed to that court. In their answer, the defendants raised several defenses, including the defense that the Ohio automobile guest statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> barred the present action inasmuch as plaintiff had not alleged wilful and wanton negligence by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>fendants. This affirmative defense was subsequently made the basis of a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. Following the argument on this motion, the district judge held that Ohio law applied to the facts of this case, and, as the complaint failed to state a cause of action under Ohio law, he dismissed the complaint. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment entered upon this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">It is evident that here we are faced with a classic law school examination question on conflict of laws. Plaintiff argues that New York, which does not have an automobile guest statute, would apply its own internal law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the question of whether allegation and proof of wilful and wanton negligence is required for recovery. Defendants argue that either Ohio or Florida law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is applicable, for both have automobile guest statutes which would bar plaintiff from recovering upon her present complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">The parties fully agree on the initial steps of the analysis to be made. Under the doctrine of Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941), the federal courts must apply the confliet-of-laws rules of the forum state, in this ease New York. On the specific issue before us, the duty of care of the driver of an automobile to a passenger, there also is no dispute that the decision in Tooker v. Lopez, 24 N.Y.2d 569, 301 N.Y.S.2d 519, 249 N.E.2d 394 (1969), which is the culmination of a series of cases before the New York Court of Appeals, is the most recent and authoritative decision by that court. However, the parties disagree as to how Tooker v. Lopez is to be applied to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-10\">In <em>Tooker </em>the New York Court of Appeals adopted an \u201cinterest analysis,\u201d see R. Cramton and D. Currie, Conflict of Laws, 208-334 (West 1968), in holding that New York internal law would be applied in determining the duty of a New York driver to a New York passenger where the automobile was registered and insured in New York, although the accident occurred in Michigan. This holding was premised on a finding that the purpose of automobile guest statutes is to protect insurers from collusive suits between .guests and hosts, or to protect local automobile owners, and that, inasmuch as New York does not grant New York motor vehicle liability insurers or owners such protection, a New York passenger should be allowed to recover against a New York insured, regardless of where the accident occurred, upon proof of no more than mere negligence on the part of the New York insured defendant, that standard of care being New York\u2019s standard of care. The majority opinion in <em>Tooker </em>outlined the series of previous cases in which attempts had been made to arrive at a coherent approach to the developing New York conflicts law, and concluded, at least insofar as the question of out-of-state guest statutes is concerned, that an \u201cinterest analysis\u201d provided the most \u201crational and just\u201d approach.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We therefore assume that the New York Court of Appeals would follow the Took-er v. Lopez approach if our case were presented for adjudication there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>We first eliminate some of the extraneous factors in the case. The Ohio accident was a two-car collision, and the second car involved was from Tennessee. However, there appear to have been no injuries suffered by the Tennessee residents who were occupants of the second car, and we have not been informed that any lawsuit has arisen out of the involvement of that vehicle. In <em>Tooker, </em>the court in discussing Macey v. Rozbicki, 18 N.Y.2d 289, 274 N.Y.S.2d 591, 221 N.E.2d 380 (1966), and in rejecting the rationale of Dym v. Gordon, 16 N.Y.2d 120, 262 N.Y.S.2d 463, 209 N.E.2d 792 (1965), concluded that the presence of third-party \u201cnon-guests\u201d was irrelevant to the application of a state\u2019s guest statute, at least where the guest statute allows recovery for gross negligence. 24 N.Y.2d at 574-575, 301 N.Y.S.2d at 523-524, 249 N.E.2d at 397-398. Likewise, we conclude that the residence of the passengers in the second car, or even the fact that there was a second car, is irrelevant to the choice of laws which the New York courts would make in this case. Thus, the only states with any \u201cinterest\u201d in applying their law to this case are New York, Ohio, and Florida. Inasmuch as Ohio and Florida have similar guest statutes, the sole question necessary for our decision is whether New York would apply its own internal law in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\">The <em>Tooker </em>court also concluded that the locus or origin of the guest-host relationship is irrelevant and reaffirmed its prior rejection of the relevancy of the fictional \u201cexpectation of the parties.\u201d 24 N.Y.2d at 577, 301 N.Y.S.2d at 525-526, 209 N.E.2d at 398-399. Thus, we assume that the New York Court of Appeals would consider the following factors to be most relevant in analyzing the interests of the various states in this case: the domicile of the parties, the place where the car is registered and insured, and the site of the accident. In <em>Tooker </em>all these factors, except for the site of the accident, pointed to New York. Here, on the other hand, the only connection with New York is that plaintiff Pryor is a New York resident. Therefore, we are faced with the prospect of considering the interests of New York, Ohio, and Florida under a combination of the above factors different from those in <em>Tooker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-7\">Chief Judge Fuld, in his concurring opinion in <em>Tooker, </em>sheds some light on the possible results New York would reach when some of the factors are varied from those in <em>Tooker. </em>Under his first principle, if the guest and host are domiciled in the same state and the car is registered there, too, the internal law of that state would apply to determine the standard of care which the host owes to his guest. Thus, if the Swar-ners had been New York residents and the car had been registered in New York (the actual facts in <em>Tooker), </em>New York law would apply. If plaintiff Pryor had been a Florida resident, New York would hold that Florida internal law would apply for Florida has chosen to protect its residents and their insurers at the expense of possible plaintiffs, and no other state would have an interest in giving recovery to a Florida plaintiff. Both of the hypothetical covered by Judge Fuld\u2019s first principle relate to what has been termed \u201cfalse conflicts,\u201d see Cramton &amp; Currie <em>supra, </em>at 236 et seq., as there is no real conflict between states with reference to the policy to be applied on sets of facts like these. And although the majority opinion in <em>Tooker </em>does not deal with the second hypothetical under Judge Fuld\u2019s first principle, we entertain little doubt that, under the principles the majority enunciated in that opinion, the New York Court of Appeals would apply Florida law if plaintiff Pryor had been a Florida domiciliary. 24 N.Y.2d at 580-583, 301 N.Y.S.2d at 528-531, 249 N.E.2d at 400-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-8\">Judge Fuld\u2019s second principle sets forth a resolution of two more difficult hypotheticals. Under this second principle if \u201cthe driver\u2019s conduct occurred in the state of his domicile and that state does not cast him in liability for that conduct, he [would] not be held liable by reason of the fact that liability would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>imposed upon him under the tort law of the state of the victim\u2019s domicile.\u201d Under this formulation, New York would apply Florida law if the present accident had occurred in Florida, even though plaintiff Pryor is a New York domiciliary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>Conversely, \u201cwhen the guest was injured in the state of his own domicile and its law permits recovery, the driver who has come into the state [would] not \u2014in the absence of special circumstances \u2014 be permitted to interpose the law of his state as a defense.\u201d Thus, if the present accident had occurred in New York, Judge Fuld would hold that the plaintiff Pryor had stated a cause of action. This last hypothetical intimates that the place where the car is registered and insured may not always be controlling, and that the site of the accident may, in some instances, be determinative.\u00ae In essence, in order to resolve these two cases of \u201ctrue conflicts,\u201d Judge Fuld has adopted \u201cprinciples of preference\u201d similar to those advocated by Professor David Cavers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Whether the majority of the New York Court of Appeals would follow Judge Fuld\u2019s approach is not indicated by the majority opinion in <em>Tooker, </em>and we must treat the suggested results of the Chief Judge\u2019s hypotheticals only as a slender indication of what that court might do when confronted with actual cases falling within the scope of his \u201cinterest analyses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">Judge Fuld\u2019s last category encompasses all those hypotheticals not included within his first two principles. For these cases \u201cthe applicable rule of decision will be that of the state where the accident occurred but not if it can be shown that displacing that normally applicable rule will advance the relevant substantive law purposes without impairing the smooth working of the mul-ti-state system or producing great uncertainty for litigants.\u201d The defendants in this case have, of course, seized upon the main clause in the above formulation, whereas the plaintiff has seized upon the qualifying, \u201cbut not if,\u201d clause. Nevertheless, we again note that Judge Fuld did not write the majority opinion in <em>Tooker, </em>and although the <em>Tooker </em>court was given the opportunity to pass on the result which might be reached if the second passenger in the Lopez car, a Michigan resident, had sued in the New York courts, the court majority declined to do so. Despite prodding by the dissenters, the majority opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-9\">Under the reasoning adopted here, it is not at all clear that Michigan law would govern (Gaither v. Myers, [131 U.S.App.D.C. 216], 404 F.2d 216, 224). We do not, however, find it necessary or desirable to conclusively resolve a question which is not now before-us. 24 N.Y.2d at 580, 301 N.Y.S.2d at 528, 249 N.E.2d at 400.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1334-10\">Thus, we are left to speculate as to the result the New York Court of Appeals might reach in still another hypothetical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-11\">Therefore, we turn to basic doctrines and apply afresh the \u201cinterest analysis\u201d espoused by the court in <em>Took-er, </em>and, in so doing, we look at the interests of New York, Ohio, and Florida in the instant accident. New York has adopted a policy of allowing its resid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>ent<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> plaintiff-guests to recover against their hosts on the basis of mere negligence, at least where the defendant-host carries mandatory motor-vehicle liability insurance whose premiums are calculated with this potential risk taken into account.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 24 N.Y.2d at 576, 578, 301 N.Y.S.2d at 525, 526, 249 N.E.2d at 398, 399. Florida has made the opposite policy decision and has granted driver-hosts (and derivatively their insurers) protection from suit by passengers except for the gross negligence of defendant-hosts. As emphasized in <em>Tooker, </em>one of the major purposes of such a state policy is the protection of the insurers against collusive suits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, the role in this area played by automobile liability insurance corporations is highlighted in this case by the fact that the plaintiff here obtained New York State jurisdiction by attachment of this insurance company\u2019s obligation to defend and indemnify the Swarners to the extent of their coverage. We think that we can safely assume that the Swarners\u2019 insurance premiums were calculated with Florida\u2019s guest statute in mind. Thus, Florida has a strong interest in protecting its insurer in the present case. Finally, Ohio, the situs of the accident, has adopted the same policy as Florida. While none of the parties or the insurer are within the class of persons whom Ohio seeks to protect, the invitation was extended in Ohio, this accident occurred there, and Ohio\u2019s restrictive policy rests not merely on protecting its insurers but on a theory that it is \u201cungrateful\u201d for a guest to seek recovery for mere negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">If the New York Court of Appeals should adopt Chief Judge Fuld\u2019s third principle, and the qualifying clause therein is given a restrictive interpretation, it may well be that that court would apply the law of Ohio here even if the defendants came from a third state Without a guest statute. But that is a question we are not required to decide.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here the application of New York internal law would also violate Florida\u2019s policy of protecting its residents and their insurers. Inasmuch as Ohio and Florida law coincide, we are not obliged to determine what New York would do if its law conflicted with only one. We only need to decide that the New York courts would not apply New York\u2019s own internal law to allow recovery by the plaintiff against the common policy of the <em>lex loci </em>and the state where the defendants reside and obtained insurance. In light of the foregoing discussion, we are quite sure that they would not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">The judgment dismissing the action is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1331-19\">.

This is in contrast to the \u201cwhole\u201d law of a state which is referred to when the doctrine of renvoi is employed.

Auten, 308 N.Y. 155, 124 N.E.2d 99 (1954). With reference to the divers positions taken since <em>Auten, </em>it has been said that \u201cthe [New York] Court of Appeals has hopped frenetically from one theory to another like an overheated jumping bean.\u201d Cramton &amp; Cur-rie, <em>supra, </em>at 258-259.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1334-5\">. Indeed, this is the very result reached in Hancock v. Holland, 63 Misc.2d 811, 313 N.Y.S.2d 455 (1970), where the accident occurred in Georgia, the driver-host was a Georgia resident, and the car was registered and insured in Georgia. Plaintiff was a New York resident who urged that the Georgia guest statute should not be applied. The New York trial judge applied Judge Fuld\u2019s second principle in barring recovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1334-6\">.

Inasmuch as the court in <em>Tooker </em>left open the possibility of recovery by the Michigan passenger in the same accident, it may also be that New York\u2019s state policy would allow recovery by a nonresident plaintiff from a New York host who was only guilty of non-gross negligence in the case of an accident occurring in the state of the plaintiff\u2019s residence although that state had a \u201cguest statute.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1335-9\">. While it may well be that the New York Court of Appeals would have reached the same decision in <em>Tooker </em>even if New York did not require mandatory insurance of New York drivers, we cannot ignore the fact that New York does require such insurance and that the <em>Tooker </em>court deemed this fact important enough to mention it in the court\u2019s analysis. We should not prophesy the future course of New York law in this area and so we leave to the New York Court of Appeals for future determination its position when confronted with a situation in which a defendant-driver may not be covered by insurance; we do no more than note that Chief Judge Fuld\u2019s second principle does not depend upon the existence of state-imposed mandatory insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1335-13\">.
