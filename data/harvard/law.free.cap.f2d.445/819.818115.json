App. \u00a7 462. The issue presented on this appeal is whether Bray\u2019s local draft board acted contrary to Selective Service Regulations in refusing to reopen his I-A classification for the purpose of considering his claim to a I-S deferment. We conclude that Bray\u2019s local board acted improperly, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-13\">In September, 1968, Bray enrolled at the Green River Community College for the fall quarter of the 1968-1969 academic year. He did not enroll for the winter quarter. On December 19, 1968, Bray\u2019s local board classified him I-A. On February 21, 1969, the Registrar of Green River Community College mailed Bray\u2019s local board an SSS Form 109, showing that Bray had been accepted in a full-time course of instruction for the spring quarter, 1969, to commence on or about March 28, 1969. On March 17, 1969, Bray was ordered to report for induction on April 16, 1969. On April 11, 1969, Bray wrote his local board, advising that he was then engaged in a full-time course of instruction pursuant to his earlier enrollment. Bray reported to his induction center on April 16 but refused to take the symbolic step forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-14\">The outcome of this case is controlled by 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.3(b), founded upon 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(i), which provides: \u201cThe local board shall reopen and consider anew the classification of a registrant to whom it has mailed an Order to Report for Induction (SSS Form No. 252) whenever facts are presented to the local board which establish the registrant\u2019s eligibility for classification into Class I-S because he is satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college, university, or similar institution of learning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-15\">32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.15(b), founded upon 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(i), sets forth the prerequisites to eligibility for I-S classification. It provides in relevant part: \u201cIn Class I-S shall be placed any regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>trant who while satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college, university or similar institution of learning and during his academic year at such institution is ordered to report for induction * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The Government argues that \u201cpursuit\u201d of a full-time course of instruction does not begin until a registrant is actually attending classes. The Selective Service Regulations provide no direct support for this contention, and the Government\u2019s primary concern seems to be to deny I-S deferments to registrants who receive a notice of induction and then seek to evade the draft by subsequently registering in a full-time course of college studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Bray does not fall within the class of registrants that trouble the Government. Before he received any notice to report for induction, Bray had in good faith enrolled in a full-time course of study at a college which he had previously attended for the next available academic period. The college had accepted Bray\u2019s enrollment, and Bray had paid his tuition fees before he received his notice of induction. Under these circumstances, we think that Bray, on the date that his induction order was mailed, was \u201csatisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction,\u201d even though his classes had not yet started. <em>Cf. </em>Keibler v. Selective Service Local Board No. 170, 3 S.S.L.R. 3294 (N.D.N.Y. March 4, 1970); United States v. Dale, 304 F.Supp. 1278 (D.N.H. 1969). We feel that the Government\u2019s interest will be adequately protected if pursuit of a course of instruction, for purposes of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1622.15(b), 1625.3(b), is deemed to commence with enrollment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>Keibler v. Selective Service Local Board No. 170, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">We conclude that the information Bray provided to his local board on April 11, 1969, satisfied the criteria of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.15(b), and, therefore, that reopening was mandatory under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-9\">. We reject the Government\u2019s contention that reopening was barred by 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2, which generally prohibits reopening after the mailing of an induction notice unless there has been a post-induction order change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstanees beyond his control. The language of 32 G.F.R. \u00a7 1625.3(b), which requires reopening in this case, makes it clear that it is a specific exception to the general rule announced by 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
