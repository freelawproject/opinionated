Smith not guilty on amended Criminal Complaint No. 1307-1967 which charged Smith \u201cdid wilfully and unlawfully fail to file reports and pay gross receipts taxes for the period January 1966 up to and including June 1968\u201d, in violation of 33 V.I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 43, 44 and 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-13\">In acquitting Smith, the trial judge specifically ruled in a Judgment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> entered January 17, 1969, that Smith was subject to the provisions of the tax stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>utes but that the evidence failed to establish wilful and unlawful failure to comply with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">On May 21, 1960 \u2014 some nine months following his acquittal \u2014 Smith was again brought to trial on Criminal Case No. 661-1969 which charged him with wilful and unlawful failure \u201cto file reports and pay Gross Receipts Taxes for the period January 1968 up to &amp; including February 1969\u201d in violation of 33 V.I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 43, 44 and 53. The case was tried, by stipulation of counsel, on the record adduced at the September 4, 1968 trial. Smith was found guilty on this second trial of \u201cwilful and unlawful\u201d failure to report and pay gross receipts taxes for the period January 1968 to February 1969 as charged in Criminal Case No. 661-1969 and fined $50.00 in a Judgment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> entered by the Municipal Court on May 21, 1969. On June 5, 1969 Smith appealed this Judgment to the District Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Thomas and St. John. That Court affirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s Judgment of May 21, 1969 in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>Order<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> dated and entered July 28, 1970. The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">Smith contends here, singly and solely, as he did in the Virgin Islands courts, that the mechanical and rental business which he conducts derives its income from services and skills performed by him on a personal and individual basis, and accordingly he is not subject to the Virgin Islands gross receipts tax under the exemption clause of 33 V.I.C. \u00a7 43(a) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which provides that the gross receipts tax which the Section imposes \u201cshall not apply to artisans, fishermen, tradesmen, or professionals * * * selling their skills or services on an individual and personal basis. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">The evidence adduced at the trial established that Smith, in the conduct of \u201cSmitty\u2019s Mechanical and Rental\u201d business, (1) engaged in performing excavation, drilling and blasting operations in private and public road work, excavating cisterns, and clearing housing construction sites of rocks and debris; (2) in performing these tasks he employed no less than 13 men at any time and they included engineers, bulldozer and backhoe operators, mechanics, welders, foremen and unskilled labor; (3) he simultaneously worked on several separate jobs at any given time; and (4) he rented to others his bulldozers and other mechanical equipment and supplied their operating personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">The recited evidence supports (1) the Municipal Court\u2019s rejection of Smith\u2019s contention that he sold his \u201cskills or services on an individual and personal basis\u201d within the exemption clause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>Section 43(a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; and (2) its challenged finding that Smith was guilty of wilful and unlawful failure to report and pay the Gross Receipts Tax as charged in Criminal Case No. 661-1969, here involved. It may be noted, parenthetically, it is apparent that the Municipal Court in finding Smith guilty on May 21, 1969 of wilful and unlawful failure as charged in the cited Criminal Complaint, had in mind that in disposing of Criminal No. 1307-1967, on September 4, 1968, it had ruled that Smith was subject to the Gross Receipts Tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">Despite our stated conclusions, we are however, constrained to set aside the District Court\u2019s Judgment of July 28, 1970 affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s Judgment of conviction on May 21, 1969 on Criminal Case No. 661-1969, for these reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">On September 4, 1968, the Municipal Court, following trial, found Smith not guilty of violation of the Gross Receipts taxes \u201cfor the period from January 1966 up to and including June 1968\u201d, as charged in Criminal No. 1307-1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">On May 21, 1969, the Municipal Court found Smith guilty of violation of the Gross Receipts Tax \u201cfor the period January 1968 up to &amp; including February 1969\u201d, as charged in Criminal Case No. 661-1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-8\">The sum of the foregoing is that after Smith was acquitted at his first trial of wilful and unlawful failure to comply with the Virgin Islands Gross Receipts Tax statutes \u201cup to and including June 1968\u201d, he was convicted at his second trial of wilful and unlawful failure to comply with the stated taxes <em>up to and including June 1968, </em>inasmuch as the period of violation covered by the second trial extended from January 1968 to February 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-14\">In light of these circumstances, we are of the opinion that Smith\u2019s constitutional guarantees under the double jeopardy provisions of \u00a7 3 of the Virgin Islands Bill of Rights,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, were violated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-15\">In Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 443, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1194, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970) it was specifically held that the Fifth Amendment embodies collateral es-toppel as a constitutional requirement and that collateral estoppel \u201c* * * means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-16\">In discussing the sweep of the Double Jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment the Court said at pages 445-446, 90 S.Ct. at page 1195:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-17\">\u201cFor whatever else that constitutional guarantee may embrace, North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717 [89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656], it surely protects a man who has been acquitted from having to \u2018run the gantlet\u2019 a second time. Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 190 [78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1151-18\">Here, Smith was required to \u201crun the gantlet\u201d a second time when, after he was acquitted of violation of the Virgin Islands Gross Receipts statutes, \u201cfor the period January 1966 <em>up to and including </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number><em>June 1968\u201d, </em>he was brought to trial and found guilty of violation of these statutes \u201cfor the period January 1968 up to and including February 1969\u201d, which, of course, embraced the period from January 1968 to the end of June 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">Smith\u2019s counsel inexplicably failed to assert as a bar against his second trial his patently available constitutional guarantees under the double jeopardy provisions of the Virgin Islands Bill of Rights, and the Fifth Amendment. He has further failed to do so on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">This Court, however <em>sua sponte, </em>can take notice of obvious errors of constitutional dimension to which no exception has been taken below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-6\">Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P. provides: \u201cPlain error. Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may. be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the Court\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">In Silber v. United States, 370 U.S. 717, 82 S.Ct. 1287, 8 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962) the Court said (p. 718, 82 S.Ct. at p. 1288):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-8\">\u201c \u2018In exceptional circumstances, especially in criminal cases, appellate courts, in the public interest, may, <em>of their own motion, </em>notice errors to which no exception has been taken, if the errors are obvious, or if they otherwise seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160 [56 S.Ct. 391, 392, 80 L.Ed. 555], Our own rules provide that \u2018the court, at its option, may notice a plain error not presented.\u2019 Revised Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States, Rule 40(1) (d) (2). <em>See also </em>Fed. Rules Crim.Proc. 52(b).\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1152-9\">In United States v. Indiviglio, 352 F.2d 276 (2 Cir. 1965), cert. den. 383 U.S. 907, 86 S.Ct. 887, 15 L.Ed.2d 663 (1966), it was said at page 280:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-10\">\u201cExercise of our power to notice even \u2018plain error,\u2019 in spite of the lack of proper objection below, is discretionary. On Lee v. United States, 343 U. S. 747, 750 n.3, 72 S.Ct. 967, 96 L.Ed. 1270 (1952); see Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427, 436-437, 83 S.Ct. 1381, 10 L.Ed.2d 462 (1963); Silber v. [United] States, 370 U.S. 717, 82 S.Ct. 1287, 8 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962). For example, even without the explicit permission of Rule 52(b), it is within our \u2018inherent power\u2019 to notice errors without objection \u2018if the errors are obvious, or if they otherwise seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 United States v. O\u2019Connor, 237 F.2d 466, 472 (2d Cir. 1956), quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936).\u201d (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1152-12\">We must note at this juncture that we are aware, of course, that courts of appeals of several other circuits have ruled that a defendant does not have the right to assert, on appeal, violation of a constitutional guarantee, where he had failed to do so at the trial level. In doing so, however, these courts have, nevertheless, proceeded to consider and decide the asserted constitutional guarantee claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-13\">Thus, in Estrella v. United States, 429 F.2d 397 (9 Cir. 1970), the Court, after ruling that consideration of the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim was foreclosed when it was raised on appeal for the first time, nevertheless proceeded to consider and decide the claim, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 52(b), stating (p. 399):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-14\">\u201cWhere the error is plain, however, the issue could be reached on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtT\">To the same effect see Ferina v. United States, 340 F.2d 837, 838-839 (8 Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-15\">What has been said brings us to our disposition of the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-16\">Since the record conclusively establishes that a plea of double jeopardy would operate to bar further trial, the judicial economy will be more effectively served by our setting aside the Order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>the District Court of the Virgin Islands entered July 28, 1970, affirming the Judgment of the Municipal Court of the Virgin Islands in Criminal Case No. 661-1969, entered May 21, 1969, and remanding the cause to the District Court with directions to enter a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-4\">We are authorized to make this disposition by Section 2106, 28 U.S.C.A., which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-5\">\u201c2106. Determination</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2oc\">\u201cThe Supreme Court <em>or any other court of appellate jurisdiction </em>may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment decree, or order of a court lawfully brought before it for review, and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances. June 25,1948, c. 646, 62 Stat. 963.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">The record in the instant case establishes that such disposition is \u201cjust under the circumstances\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">On this score, we direct attention to Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968) where the Court gave effect to Section 2106 and set aside a conviction. In doing so the Court said in relevant part at pages 71-72, 88 S.Ct. at page 715:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-8\">\u201cUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 we have power to dispose of this case \u2018as may be just under the circumstances.\u2019 See <em>Yates v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 298, 327-331 [77 S.Ct. 1064, 1 L.Ed.2d 1356], Since * * * reversal of the conviction would be inevitable * * *, we consider that the entire case should now be finally disposed of at this level. In the special circumstances presented, this course seems to us to be dictated by considerations of sound judicial administration, in order to obviate further and entirely unnecessary proceedings below. Cf. <em>Yates v. United States, supra.\u201d </em>(footnotes omitted) .<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1153-11\">There remains this to be said.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-12\">The docket entry of the Clerk of the District Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Thomas and St. John, with respect to the Judgment of the Municipal Court rendered by that Court on May 21, 1969 in Criminal Case No. 661-1969, and affirmed by the Order of the District Court of the Virgin Islands of July 28,1970, is patently erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-13\">The May 21, 1969 Judgment of the Municipal Court held the defendant Smith to be \u201cGUILTY of the crime charged\u201d in Criminal Case No. 661-1969, and the Order of the District Court dated July 28, 1970, affirmed that Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-14\">The Clerk of the District Court, however, made the following entry on the Docket with respect to the District Court\u2019s Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-15\">\u201cJuly 28 \u2014 Order affirming judgment of the Municipal Court, to wit, defendant is not guilty of wilfully and unlawfully failing to file and pay Gross Receipts taxes for the period January 1966 up to and including June, 1968, but defendant is liable to pay Gross Receipts taxes under 33 V.I.C. 43(a) for the period January 1966, up to and including June, 1968, signed by Judge Almeric L.
