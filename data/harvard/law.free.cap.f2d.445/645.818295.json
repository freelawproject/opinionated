Real, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>TRASK, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The United States District Court for the Southern District of California, 320 F.Supp. 1047, denied the application for habeas corpus of William Edwin Rastin, an enlisted man in the United States Navy. Rastin had filed a request for discharge as a conscientious objector stating his reasons therefor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appropriate hearings and interviews were held and the necessary reports filed. They were uniform to the effect that Rastin\u2019s beliefs were sincerely held and recommended discharge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The application and recommendations of the officers were then referred to the Chief of Naval Personnel (C.N.P.) who disapproved the application upon the basis that the brevity of the asserted beliefs of the applicant did not permit the reviewing board to conclude that the applicant\u2019s affirmed conviction was deeply held.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The applicant brings the matter here for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Jurisdiction of the district court is predicated upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The petitioner is in \u201ccustody\u201d within the meaning of the section when he is held contrary to a valid claim of conscientious objection. Johnson v. Laird, 435 F.2d 493, 496 (9th Cir. 1970). Jurisdiction here is pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AX4\"> On appeal it is the function of the reviewing court to determine whether there was a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for the determination of the C.N.P. Negre v. Larsen, 418 F.2d 908, 909 (9th Cir. 1969), aff\u2019d sub nom., Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168 (1971). The reason given for disapproval was that the applicant\u2019s belief was stated \u201cin three short sentences rather than \u2018describing the nature of (your) belief,\u2019 which is required by [Department of Defense] Directive 1300.6.\u201d We find nothing of substance in a requirement that a belief be \u201cdescribed\u201d rather than \u201cstated.\u201d The disapproval' then continues by saying that the \u201cpaucity of information\u201d does not enable the reviewing board to determine that the claim is a deeply held conviction. As the district court holds, and the government contends, this explanation appears to declare that the C.N.P. equates \u201cdeeply held\u201d with \u201csincere\u201d, and that unless the belief is expounded at some length and documented, it must be found insufficient. Granted that affirmations of sincerity may be belied by inconsistent actions, writings and statements, it is doubtful if the proof of the fact may be greatly fortified by lengthy self-serving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>statements which may be only copy-book declarations. A history of consistent actions, of course, may support the written declarations. Some were set out in other answers contained in the application.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The unanimity of corroboration of sincerity and deeply held conviction contained in the separate written reports of the 0-3 officers plus the lack of negative and contra-indicated actions, writings or statements supports the view that whatever \u201cpaucity of information\u201d was presented was consistent with the application. We have reviewed the facts set out by the district court in support of C.N.P. disapproval. They were not mentioned in the C.N.P. order. We do not find them to be persuasive. They are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u201c1-. Petitioner\u2019s descriptive statements could be interpreted to not show the deep motivation which ordinarily is anticipated.\u201d C.T. 41.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">They .also \u201ccould be\u201d interpreted to show deep motivation. That three naval officers after personal interviews <em>did </em>so interpret them in the 0-3 proceedings lends strong credence to this point of view. There is no finding of conduct or expression which actually does indicate the contrary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">\u201c2. There is an inconsistency in the record as to when he began to feel he could no longer participate in war.\u201d C.T. 41.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The court\u2019s footnote documents the statement by pointing to the uncertainty in point of time at which the feelings of conscientious objection materialized. Again, so long as they developed during his period of service (and his statements do not show the contrary), the exact <em>time </em>at which they fully developed do not prove a lack of sincerity or deep conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">\u201c3. There is an inconsistency in the record as to the source of his feelings.\u201d C.T. 41.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">The explanation for this asserted inconsistency is explained by reference to the applicant\u2019s statement on his application that: \u201cMy beliefs come from books, friends, talking and listening * * * and from the death of a life-long friend that died for his country.\u201d The trial court suggests that this is inconsistent with his statement to the chaplain to whom he stated that \u201cHis beliefs are the result of his own reading, association with college friends and professors.\u201d And is likewise inconsistent with his statements to the hearing officer to whom he reported that his convictions \u201cevolved through self study and thought * * -X- <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">We fail to find any such basic inconsistency which would bespeak a contra-indication of sincerity and deep conviction. This is particularly true when we remember that the statements of the chaplain and the hearing officer do not purport to be quotes but rather their own summarization of the interview.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-15\">\u201c4. The person upon whom the petitioner relies most for religious guidance in matters of conviction relating to his claim appears to be a student.\u201d C.T. 41.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-16\">Again, \u201ca student and life-long friend\u201d could as well be the person upon whom the petitioner relies most for religious guidance, as an ordained minister. There is no suggestion in the record that this statement is untrue or unworthy of belief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-17\">\u201c5. The petitioner appears to be naive and immature; and terminated his college education on two occasions due to lack of interest prior to enlisting in the Navy.\u201d C.T. 41.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-18\">None of these facts appears to us to be necessarily inconsistent with a deep conviction or lack of sincerity. A person may be both naive and immature and still be very sincere and hold deep convictions. These may change upon attaining maturity and sophistication, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>they may not. Likewise, a lack of interest in college cannot be said to contradict a sincerity of feeling and belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">If the record is to be examined, this court should also note the statements of the chaplain after his \u201cthree extensive interviews\u201d with applicant. He reports that Rastin\u2019s conviction on armed conflict \u201cis a general conviction, against all use of force, not just a certain war or action.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the issue of discharge from the armed services is to be determined on the basis of sincerity and deep convictions under Section 6(j),'<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it appears that greater weight should be given to the 0-3 hearing and interviews than to a formal written statement be it brief or extended. Sincerity and convictions projected in interviews and the hearing before officers experienced in psychiatry, religion and the armed services, as well as experienced in dealing with men, may not be easily contrived. The officers are concerned not only with a formal written application but with the man himself seated before them and face to face dialogue. If there be dissembling, they are best able to discover it. The specific written answer which the government and the C.N.P. refer to, is succinct. Supplemented by the other answers and the interviews, we deem it sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We therefore conclude that the decision of the district court should be reversed and the case remanded so that the Navy may grant a discharge pursuant to the applicable regulations of the Department of Defense. In the event the discharge is not granted within thirty days from the filing of the mandate, the writ should issue forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The Clerk is directed to issue the mandate forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\">. \u201cFirst of all, though my application is based on moral reasons, I do believe that human life was created by a supreme being; i. e., GOD, to kill a human being is ggainst [sic] my belief that all being [sic] have the right to live a full and natural life.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">\u201cWhy is it wrong for me to kill? Each and every person on this planet has feeling and thoughts, I <em>won\u2019t </em>censor anyone with death.\u201d C.T. 7-8, Ex. A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-10\">. The applicant is afforded an opportunity to appear in person (with counsel if he so desires) before an officer in the grade of 0-3 or higher; he is also interviewed by a chaplain who files a report with comments on the sincerity of the applicant in his belief and an opinion as to its source; and a report is filed by a psychiatrist or medical officer based upon an interview. D.O.D. 1300.6 VI 4-8. In this case the record discloses that Rastin was interviewed by a Commander, by a chaplain who was a Lt. Commander (3 occasions) and a psychiatrist who was a Lt. Commander.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b705-15\">. \u201cYour request for discharge by reason of conscientious objection was reviewed in the Bureau of Naval Personnel by an established Board which recommended that you not be discharged by reason of conscientious objection.
