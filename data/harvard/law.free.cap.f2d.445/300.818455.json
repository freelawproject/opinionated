App. \u00a7 462 by refusing to complete an armed forces physical examination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-25\">Zaugh\u2019s contention that the Selective Service System is unconstitutional under the Ninth Amendment is without merit. United States v. Uhl, 436 F.2d 773 (9th Cir.1970). The same is true as to his contention that the System is unconstitutional under the equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Smith v. United States, 424 F.2d 267 (9th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Zaugh\u2019s remaining contention is that his conviction cannot stand because he was unaware of the specific penalties which could be imposed for his failure to comply with the law. His argument as to this is frivolous and does not warrant comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
