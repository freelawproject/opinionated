United States, 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625, the Supreme Court held that under current interpretations of the applicable statutes and regulations a registrant\u2019s local board is not required to consider claims of conscientious objection alleged to have arisen after an order to report has issued. Such claims may be heard by, and must be presented to, the agencies charged with processing in-service applications for relief. The failure of the defendant\u2019s local board to reopen his classification after he was ordered to report, therefore, is unavailable as a defense to a prosecution for refusing induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b712-13\"> Several claims of procedural irregularity in the local hoard\u2019s issuance of the order and in the defendant\u2019s processing at the induction station are also raised. We find no substance in any of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
