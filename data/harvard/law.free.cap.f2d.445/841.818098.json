He brought suit in the court below under claimed diversity jurisdiction against Papillion, the driver of the truck, the other vehicle involved in the accident, and his insurer (under an om<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>nibus clause, not as the named insured which was the owner, Export Cartage, Inc.). It developed from the Marshal\u2019s return of service that the defendant driver had become a citizen of Orange, Texas, at the time suit was filed, almost a year after the accident. The plaintiff Anderson dismissed as to Papillion.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">After the one year Louisiana prescription period had run, Anderson sought to amend his complaint under Rule 15(c), F.R.Civ.P.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and named as defendants the driver\u2019s employer, Export Cartage, Inc., a Louisiana corporation, (Export), and the insurance carrier, Phoenix Insurance Company, a Connecticut corporation, (Phoenix.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">We are convinced that the \u201crelation back\u201d of amendments under Rule 15(c) has no applicability to this case. The rule simply may not be interpreted so as to deny the protection of a limitations statute to an entirely new defendant, added after the prescription has run. In diversity cases, state statutes of limitation, not the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, govern the determination of whether actions are brought timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">\u201cPure diversity\u201d must exist between plaintiff and all defendants at the time suit is filed to support federal jurisdiction. Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 1806, 3 Cranch 267, 2 L.Ed. 435. Since \u201cpure\u201d diversity did not exist at the time suit was brought, between Anderson, a Texas citizen, and Papillion, also a Texas citizen, the district court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had no jurisdiction, and therefore was (as held by the trial judge) an \u201cincompetent court\u201d within the meaning of Louisiana Revised Statutes 9:5801 as the term is defined by the Louisiana courts. Knight v. Louisiana Power and Light Co., La.App.1964, 160 So.2d 832; Con-kling v. Louisiana Power and Light Co., La.App.1964, 166 So.2d 68, and Venterel-la v. Pace, La.App.1966, 180 So.2d 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">Ragan v. Merchants Transfer and Warehouse Company, 1945, 337 U.S. 530, 69 S.Ct. 1233, 93 L.Ed. 1520, prohibits a federal court in a diversity case from giving a cause of action a longer life than it would have had in the state court, Rule 3, F.R.Civ.P., providing that a civil action is \u201ccommenced by filing a complaint with the court\u201d must yield to a state statute such as L.R.S. 9:5801, because a federal court cannot do more in a diversity case than the state court down the street can do. Anderson would fare no better of course if he had filed his action originally in an <em>incompetent state court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">We think <em>Ragan, </em>then, controls this case. Conceding as we do, that it has its critics, it remains viable. See for instance, the discussion by Chief Judge Lumbard in Sylvestri v. Warner &amp; Swasey Co., 2 Cir. 1968, 398 F.2d 598, of the effect on Ragan of Hanna v. Plumer, 1965, 380 U.S. 460, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-13\">\u201c * * * The Supreme Court not only did not specifically state in <em>Hanna </em>that it was overruling <em>Ragan, </em>but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>the Court several times cited <em>Eagan </em>by way of distinction. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">See further, Wright, Law of Federal Courts, 2d Ed., pp. 244, 245, 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The judgment of the lower court is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-29\">. Article 3536 of the Louisiana Civil Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-30\">\u201cThe following actions are also prescribed by one year:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-32\">\u201cThat for injurious words, whether verbal or written, and that for damages caused by animals, or resulting from offenses or quasi offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b900-7\">. Anderson contends that since his original suit was filed within one year, prescription was interrupted, even though the court below had no jurisdiction because of the inclusion of a non-diverse defendant (later dismissed) and that the subsequent inclusion of another defendant by amended complaint filed more than a year after the accident \u201crelates back\u201d to the date of the original filing under Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b900-8\">. It should be noted that for diversity purposes, under the terms of Title 28, U.S.C., Sec. 1332(c), Phoenix was deemed a citizen of Texas when sued directly with Papillion, ns the suit was originally cast, but was deemed a citizen of Louisiana when sued ns the insurer of its direct insured, Export. Phoenix was served through the Louisiana Secretary of State, more than a year after the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b900-15\">. Indeed, see footnote 3, under the terms of Title 28, Section 1332(c), Phoenix was also deemed a citizen of Texas, so diversity did not exist between Anderson and either original defendant. Our basis of decision makes it unnecessary to consider the implications of this.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
