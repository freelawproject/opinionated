The Board further found that the company violated Section 8(a) (2), (3) and (1) of the Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (2), (3) and (1) (1964)) by including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>and maintaining a union security clause in the Local 355 contract and found Local 355 in violation of Section 8(b) (1) (A) and (2) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b) (1) (A) and (2) (1964)) for using company assistance to obtain both recognition and a contract and for agreeing to and enforcing the union security clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The issues in the case are purely factual. An issue as to the supervisory status of Winter presents only the question of the extent to which the other employees considered Winter a part of management. The findings of the Board in this respect are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In reviewing the testimony of employee Anzalone, the Board found that \u201ca decision by the Board in this proceeding should not be based on the testimony of Michael Anzalone where it is not corroborated by other credited testimony.\u201d 173 N.L.R.B. No. 199 (1968). Anzalone testified that the employees considered Winter a supervisor. From this, respondents argue that the holding with respect to the supervisory status of Winter cannot stand. We disagree. There was clearly sufficient credited corroborative testimony to support this finding. Several other employees testified to the same effect,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and there is other evidence in the record regarding Winter\u2019s various functions which establishes his supervisory status.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The remedies imposed by the Board were all fully within its power. The Board ordered reimbursement of those employees who signed cards authorizing deduction of dues and initiation fees under supervisory influence or coercion. All employees who signed subsequent to the execution of the contract are included among those to be reimbursed. Such an order is based on the premise that employees who sign cards after a contract containing a compulsory union membership clause has been executed have been coerced into doing so. Requiring reimbursement in this situation is entirely proper. See NLRB v. Revere Metal Art Co., 280 F.2d 96, 100-101 (2d Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">We therefore1 enforce the Board\u2019s order in its entirety.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-18\">. For example, employee Shea testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-19\">\u201cQ.- Did you observe what Mr. Winter does in the shop? A. He is more or less the shop foreman, you know, write-up man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-20\">Q. When you say he is more or less the shop foreman, what does he do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1m\">A. Well, he more or less runs the shop in John\u2019s absence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-21\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-22\">Q. Now when you say that during Mr. Cifelli\u2019s absence, Mr. Winter runs the shop, what do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"acr-dedup-0\">A. Well, he is more or less in charge. He is the man to see if you have any problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
