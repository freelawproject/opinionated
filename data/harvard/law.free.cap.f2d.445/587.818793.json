McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418. We now find reversible error in the use of a 1932 felony conviction for impeachment purposes in a 1970 trial. We must also decide whether defendant\u2019s retrial shall be limited to Count II, or may also encompass Count III which was reinstated after remand from the Supreme Court and after the statute of limitations had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">Defendant was born in 1900. In 1932 he was convicted of robbery and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for from 1 to 20 years. After serving one year, he was paroled, and thereafter received a full pardon from the Governor of Illinois.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He thereafter was employed in the printing business and, as far as the record discloses, encountered no difficulties with the law until this litigation arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-15\">On April 1, 1966, he was indicted for violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. He originally pleaded not guilty to all three counts, but on July 15, 1966, his counsel advised the court that he desired to change his plea on Count II. The Government then moved to dismiss Counts I and III, and the court stated: \u201cNot until the plea is accepted and there is a judgment thereon.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-16\">After the plea was accepted the Government renewed its motion to dismiss Counts I and III and also requested the court \u201cto ask whether or not any promise or threat has been made.\u201d Both the defendant and his attorney responded that no promise had been made \u201cfor entering a plea of guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court then dismissed Counts I and III and ordered a pre-sentence investigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-17\">On September 14, 1966, the court imposed a sentence of imprisonment of one year and a fine of $2,500. At that hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ing the Government made reference to the dismissal of Counts I and III, explaining that the \u201cprime consideration of that was an understanding between the parties that all taxes, penalties and interest would be paid.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It appears that the court was also advised of the 1932 robbery conviction and considered it irrelevant on the issue of punishment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Nine days after sentencing, defendant appealed his conviction. The Government did not take a cross-appeal and made no motion to reinstate Counts I and III at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">This court affirmed but, as already noted, the Supreme Court reversed and remanded with directions that defendant be afforded the opportunity to plead anew. The Supreme Court\u2019s mandate was received in the district court on May 1, 1969. In the meantime, the six-year statute of limitations on the offenses charged in the dismissed counts had expired. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6531.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">On October 1, 1969, the Government filed a motion to vacate the order dismissing Counts I and III. On November 10, 1969, the court reinstated the dismissed counts, defendant was arraigned, and the trial commenced. Defendant testified in his own behalf, but the Government made no attempt to use the 1932 robbery conviction for impeachment. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on Count I and was unable to reach a verdict on the other two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-19\">Before the second trial commenced, Government counsel advised his opponent that he proposed to use the 1932 conviction to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility if he again took the stand. Pretrial objections to the use of the conviction were then argued and overruled. The district court expressed the view that with the exception of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, whose decisions he declined to follow, it is universally held that a prior felony conviction is admissible for the purpose of impeaching a witness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The matter was reargued during the course of the trial; at that time the judge indicated that admissibility might be a matter of discretion for the trial court, but found no guidelines relevant to the exercise of his discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-20\">The conviction was admitted, and Government counsel referred to it extensively during oral argument.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>found defendant guilty on both counts, and the court reimposed a one year sentence and a fine of $2,500 on Count II; concurrent sentences of one year were imposed on Count III and on lesser included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The use of defendant\u2019s 1932 felony conviction may have been the decisive factor in persuading the jury to find him guilty on Counts II and III. His defense was predicated primarily on evidence of good character and poor health, which was designed to fortify his position that he had not \u201cwilfully\u201d attempted to evade his tax liabilities. The defense was partially successful at his first trial, and might well have succeeded at the second if his robbery conviction had been excluded. We are satisfied that if this evidence was improperly received, the error was sufficiently prejudicial to require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The Government correctly points out that this court has sustained the use of prior convictions in several recent decisions in which reliance was placed on the Draft of Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States District Courts and Magistrates which was prepared under the direction of the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States. See United States v. Morefield, 411 F.2d 1186, 1188 (7th Cir. 1969); United States v. Cox, 428 F.2d 683, 689 (7th Cir. 1970); United States v. Escobedo, 430 F.2d 14, 18-20 (7th Cir. 1970); United States v. Gornick, No. 18671 (7th Cir. June 9, 1971) pp. 7-8. Both the Draft of Proposed Rules as promulgated in March, 1969, and the Revised Draft promulgated in March, 1971, contain guidelines which we consider controlling on the precise question presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">Proposed Rule 609(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-16\">\u201cTime Limit. Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period of more than 10 years has elapsed since the date of conviction or of the release of the witness from confinement, whichever is the later date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"auz-dedup-0\">Moreover, Proposed Rule 609(c) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-17\">\u201cEffect of Pardon, Annulment, or Certificate of Rehabilitation. Evidence of a conviction is not admissible under this rule if (1) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure, and (2) the procedure under which the same was granted or issued required a substantial showing of rehabilitation or was based on innocence.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Either subparagraph (b) or subpara-graph (c) of Proposed Rule 609 would have required the exclusion of defendant\u2019s 1932 conviction. It was 38 years old at the time of trial and he had received a full pardon which recited complete rehabilitation. For the reasons set forth in the Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes to the Proposed Rules, we believe this is a case in which the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused substantially outweighs the probative value of the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We also believe, as suggested by the frequent reference to the Proposed Rules in our recent opinions, that these proposals should be used by the district courts as guidelines and at least given consideration in the exercise of their discretion in making evidentiary rulings. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There may, of course, be cases in which a proposed rule should not be followed. We have concluded, however, that this is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Unless defendant enters into a new plea bargain with the Government, he must stand trial again. The question which remains is whether the trial shall be limited to Count II, or shall also, by reason of his breach of the 1966 plea bargain, also include Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">As we appraise the facts, defendant seeks to retain the benefit of his bargain with the Government while avoiding its principal burden. Although not fully stated on the record, it is evident that the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Counts I and III was filed pursuant to an understanding with the defendant that he would plead guilty to Count II and make full payment of all taxes, penalties and interest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is also reasonable to infer that the defendant did not anticipate the jail sentence which the court imposed. When he filed his appeal, nine days later, he in effect rescinded his bargain with the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">We have no doubt that the Government then had the right to make the rescission complete and promptly to reinstate the dismissed counts. See United States v. Liguori, 430 F.2d 842, 851 (2nd Cir. 1970) (Lumbard, C. J., concurring). The question is not so easily answered, however, when the Government postpones its request for reinstatement for a period of three years and until after the statute of limitations has run.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">We find no controlling authority on the precise point and recognize a reasonable basis for either position. The Government views the dismissal of Counts I and III as conditioned on the final acceptance of the guilty plea on Count II. This view finds support in the district court\u2019s comment at the time the motion to dismiss was originally filed. Under this interpretation until the status of Count II was finally determined, the dismissal of Counts I and III was only tentative or conditional. It would have been inappropriate to reinstate these counts while the Government anticipated (albeit incorrectly) ultimate affirmance of the conviction on Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>On the other hand, from defendant\u2019s point of view, the contractual element of the plea is subordinate to the legal effect of the unequivocal dismissals. The Government identified defendant\u2019s agreement to make restitution as a prime consideration for the dismissals, and unless the prosecutor was willing to disclose on the record that there was a further consideration for the guilty plea, which disclosure might have influenced the pending appeal, he should be held to his limited description of the understanding between the parties. Moreover, having failed to reinstate Counts I and III before the statute of limitations ran, the prosecution of these counts must be regarded as having terminated within the meaning of Rule 48(a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">In balance, we find the defendant\u2019s argument more persuasive. We agree with the implication in Chief Judge Lumbard\u2019s opinion that in a situation of this kind the Government must proceed with diligence, and that the right to prosecute will be lost unless the record is protected by filing a timely motion to reinstate the dismissed counts. Moreover, in view of the age of this litigation, and the fact that a retrial on Count III is unlikely to have a significant practical effect on its ultimate disposition,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (although it might be a predicate for still another appeal) we believe the scales should be tipped in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Defendant has assigned a number of other errors which we have considered and found to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial on Count II.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\">. The pardon stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">\u201c * * * At the time of his incarceration he was married and the father of four children. Prior to the difficulty which resulted in his conviction, he had enjoyed a good reputation and had a steady employment record. It has been represented to me that he joined the Marines in April, 1917, served overseas, and was honorably discharged in July, 1919. After his release on parole May 29, 1933 he resided with and supported his wife and children. II.e was steadily employed as a salesman and during his three year parole period made a thoroughly satisfactory adjustment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">\u201cSince his discharge from parole which occurred July 7, 1936, he has continued as a law abiding citizen and there is every evidence he is thoroughly rehabilitated. He requests a pardon so that he may again enjoy all the rights of a citizen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-20\">\u201cI have carefully reviewed the entire record in this case and believe I am warranted in granting a full and complete pardon to William J.

Our conclusion is based partly on the sequence of events and partly on the prosecutor\u2019s explanation that the dismissal was primarily motivated by the understanding that defendant would discharge his tax obligations.
