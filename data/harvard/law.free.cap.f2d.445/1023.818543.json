Rule 12(b) (6), Fed.R.Civ.P. In plaintiff\u2019s third cause of action for false arrest and malicious prosecution against the County of Nassau (69-C-1562), defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted since there were no material issues of fact and defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56, Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-21\">We affirm on Judge Travia\u2019s well reasoned opinion, 329 F.Supp. 497 (E.D.N.Y.1970).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1081-22\">IRVING R. KAUFMAN,</author>\n<p id=\"au2-dedup-0\">Circuit Judge (concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-23\">I agree that the dismissals of each of the actions brought by-appellant Dorak should be affirmed, but I would not do so for all of the reasons stated by Judge Travia below. It is sufficient that with respect to none of his complaints did Dorak comply with New York County Law \u00a7 52 and New York General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-e, requiring that Dorak serve notices of claim upon defendants within ninety days after each cause of action arose.
