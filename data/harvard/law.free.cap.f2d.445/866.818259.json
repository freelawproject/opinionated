A United States Treasury check payable to Edwin Sieffert was delivered to appellant\u2019s residence. Appellant\u2019s wife forged Sieffert\u2019s endorsement on the check with a designation that the cheek was to be paid to appellant\u2019s order. Appellant endorsed his own signature on the check and cashed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\"> Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he intended to defraud the United States when he uttered and published the check. At most, he says, the evidence proved that he may have intended to defraud Sieffert. There was evidence that appellant knew that his wife had forged Sieffert\u2019s endorsement before he negotiated the check and that he also knew that neither his wife nor he had any authority to endorse or to negotiate it. In establishing appellant\u2019s \u201cintent to defraud the United States,\u201d the Government was not obliged to prove that appellant intended to cause monetary loss to the Government. It was enough, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495, that the Government prove that appellant intended to interfere with a governmental function, such as paying its employees. (Leonard v. United States (9th Cir. 1963) 324 F.2d 911; Pina v. United States (9th Cir. 1948) 165 F.2d 890. The evidence amply supported the implied finding that appellant harbored the requisite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">Appellant also attacks the intent element by arguing that the facts showed a misrepresented agency akin to that in Gilbert v. United States (1962) 370 U.S. 650, 82 S.Ct. 1399, 8 L.Ed.2d 750. There was no indication that appellant purported to act as anyone\u2019s agent; <em>Gilbert, </em>accordingly, is not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">We have examined appellant\u2019s remaining arguments. None of them has sufficient merit to warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
