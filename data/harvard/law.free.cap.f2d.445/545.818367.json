(1959).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-15\">In this action against the Grand Lodge of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (Union) appellant Sewell, who was employed as a Grand Lodge Representative of the defendant Union, alleges that he was wrongfully discharged from his office by the president of the Union. He asserts that he was discharged because he exercised the rights of free speech and assembly and guaranteed to him by the Act in sections 101(a) (1) and (2), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a) (1) and (2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and enforced through section 609, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 529 which makes it unlawful to discipline a member for the exercise of these statutory rights. He seeks (a) reinstatement of his employment as Grand Lodge Representative, (b) compensatory damages for losses sustained, (c) exemplary damages, and (d) other appropriate relief. The Union answered by filing a motion to dismiss contending, first, that the complaint did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and second, that the complaint was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>barred by the applicable Alabama statute of limitations of one year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court granted the Union\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that Sewell\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm the result reached, albeit for reasons not identical with those assigned by the district court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-17\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>(2) Freedom of speech and assembly.\u2014 Every member of any labor organization shall have the right to meet and assemble freely with other members; and to express any views, arguments, or opinions; and to express at meetings of the labor organization his views, upon candidates in an election of the labor organization or upon any business properly before the meeting, subject to the organization\u2019s established and reasonable rules pertaining to the conduct of meetings: <em>Provided, </em>That nothing herein shall be construed to impair the right of a labor organization to adopt and enforce reasonable rules as to the responsibility of every member toward the organization as an institution and to his refraining from conduct that would interfere with its performance of its legal or contractual obligations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>The basic facts underlying the allegations of the complaint have been subject to lengthy inquiry and extensive review prior to this appeal. Concerning these facts no dispute appears to exist since they are discussed without contradiction by the parties; moreover, these facts as argued correspond essentially with the facts found by this court in the companion case, Nix v. N. L. R. B.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>to be undisputed that Sewell was employed by the Union for more than fifteen years in various capacities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At all times he has been a member of the union in good standing. During the particular time involved in this litigation, from 1966 until January 6, 1967, Sewell was employed by the Union in the position of Grand Lodge Representative. In this capacity it was his responsibility to perform the usual functions of the union in the field; he organized and serviced problems of the local unions, handled their grievances, and negotiated their contracts. Beyond these duties it was Sewell\u2019s primary responsibility to promote and execute the policies of the Union\u2019s Executive Council and its International President, P. L. Siemiller.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">On December 22, 1966, Sewell received a letter from President Siemiller which made reference to reports that he (Sew-. ell) was actively opposing a proposal of the executive council of the Union.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since a referendum on the proposal in question was to be held in January 1967, President Siemiller in his letter requested Sewell \u201cto report to this office if you have been advising local lodges to vote against the proposition in January; and if you have been opposing the Referendum, give the reasons for such position.\u201d Appellant responded to President Sie-miller\u2019s letter that he had discussed the referendum with \u201cmany individuals in an opposing approach, not with local lodges.\u201d Following this response, on January 4, President Siemiller discharged Sewell for actively supporting the referendum and thereby refusing to carry out the decision of the Executive Council.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Sewell\u2019s membership in the Union was not disturbed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">\n<em>Statute of Limitations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">In view of the foregoing facts we consider first, the Union\u2019s contention that Sewell\u2019s claim is barred by the applicable Alabama statute of limitations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Initially, we note that the Act upon which the appellant relies does not contain a statute of limitations. In such circumstances federal courts must rely on the limitations period prescribed by the state in which the litigation arose; in this case, Alabama. The applicable period of limitation is that which Alabama would have enforced had an action seeking similar relief been brought in the Alabama state courts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To resolve this question, we must first determine the \u201cessential nature\u201d of the claim under the federal law and then decide what statute of limitations the state courts of Alabama would hold applicable to this type or class of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The Union insists that Sewell\u2019s action is <em>ex delicto, </em>an action for injury to personal rights guaranteed by law, and, therefore, subject to the one year Alabama statute of limitations for tort actions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Sewell, on the other hand, contends that his action is <em>ex contractu </em>and that the Alabama statute of limitations of six years should apply.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In examining these contentions we must rely on Sewell\u2019s complaint<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the undisputed facts, while adverting to the guide line of the Alabama Supreme Court in Adler v. Miller<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for testing whether a cause of action is <em>ex contractu </em>or <em>ex de-licto </em>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">If the cause of action given expression in the complaint (1) arises from a breach of promise, the action is <em>ex contractu, </em>or (2) if that cause of action arise from a breach of duty * * * it is in form, <em>ex delicto </em>and case<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">Examining Sewell\u2019s complaint we note at the outset that no mention is made of a contract.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> He alleges membership in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the Union and employment by it in various capacities from time to time over a period of fifteen years. However, none of the terms, conditions, or provisions of the employment arrangement are set forth<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and there does not appear to be any reliance on the terms of any particular contract. He does not allege whether the employment arrangements were oral or in writing; nor does he specify the period of employment, the specific duties to be performed, the authority of the employer, his own rights as an employee, or any other pertinent factors necessary to support an action based on contract.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Additionally, from the facts set forth above in this opinion, which are without any material dispute, it is quite clear that the basis of Sewell\u2019s alleged grievance is the claimed denial of rights protected by federal law. In view of the undisputed facts and the allegations in Sewell\u2019s complaint, it is our conclusion that his claim is essentially in the nature of a tort for the alleged violation of rights claimed under the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. Accordingly, we conclude that his cause of action is governed and barred by the Alabama Statute of Limitations of one year.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">\n<em>Insubordination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">Even if Sewell\u2019s complaint was not barred by the statute of limitations, we are of the opinion that he should be denied relief. We fully concur with his contention that each member of a labor union is guaranteed the right of free expression as well as the right to participate freely in the union\u2019s democratic processes. Disciplinary action for the exercise of such rights offends the terms of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. Moreover, the rights of free expression, and assembly as well as other rights protected by the statute may be exercised fully and freely by any member of the union; the mere fact that a member is an appointed or elected official of the union does not destroy his statutory rights.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>conclusion, however, does not permit an employee who accepts employment for the performance of certain specified duties to take the largesse and pay of the union, on the one hand, and, on the other, to completely subvert the purposes of his employment by engaging in activities diametrically opposed to the performance of his specified duties.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As Judge Bell observed in Airline Maintenance Lodge 702, etc. v. Loudermilk: <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMg\">The rights of a union member under this statute, must be balanced against the right preserved to the union to make rules as to the responsibility of the member toward the union as an institution. And this balancing process must rest on the facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">To permit an individual to accept union employment, to receive union pay, and to enjoy the prestige of a union position, while spending his employer\u2019s time opposing the plans and policies he was employed to execute, would in our judgment, be unreasonable. All employees, whether they work for a union or a large commercial company, may be required at times to subordinate personal expression to the responsibilities of their employment. An essential and elemental ingredient of all employment is basic loyalty by employees to the employer in performing the duties of the job for which they were hired.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If a conflict of interest arises between an individual\u2019s desire to oppose the plans and policies of his employer and the discharge of the duties of the position in which he is employed, fundamental considerations of fair play would require him to remove himself from such a position.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">To hold that a union has no right to discharge an employee for insubordination under the facts of his case would, we believe, seriously detract from effective, cohesive union leadership. The result might well be weak, ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>and fragmented unions which would be paralyzed in bargaining for the rights and welfare of union members against the monolithic front of large commercial corporations in the modern commercial world. For this very reason it has long been the philosophy of collective bargaining and other vital union activities that the union representing the employees should be able to bargain on equal terms with employers whose economic interests are often diametrically opposed.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Considering all the facts involved, it is our conclusion, limited to the particular facts and circumstances of this case, that the Union had the right to terminate the appellant\u2019s employment for insubordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-10\">. The appellant states the issue for review in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether or not it is unlawful for a labor organization to discipline a member by discharging him as its employee for exercising his political rights of free speech, guaranteed by 29 U.S.C. Section 411(a) (2), where the Union does not suspend or expel such member from his membership in the union.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-12\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a) (1) and (2) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-13\">(a) (1) Equal rights. \u2014 Every member of a labor organization shall have equal rights and privileges within such organization to nominate candidates, to vote in elections or referendums of the labor organization, to attend membership meetings, and to participate in the deliberations and voting upon the business of sucli meetings, subject to reasonable rules and regulations in such organization\u2019s constitution and bylaws.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b605-5\">. The statute upon which the Union relies is set forth in Title 7, Ala.Code \u00a7 26 (1958) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">Section 26. Limitation of one year.\u2014 The following must be commenced within one year:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">Actions for any injury to the person or rights of another, not arising from contract, and not herein specifically enumerated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Alternatively, the Union contended that the action was barred by the federal policy of limitations stated in other federal statutes of limitations applicable to other federally created rights of action involving personal rights and employment rights. The federal statutes relied upon are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">The National Labor Relations Act as amended, Section 10(b) [29 U.S.C. 160 (b)] providing for a limitation of six months upon complaints based upon unfair labor practices, including wrongful discharge; the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act (29 U.S.C., Section 255) providing a limitation of two years for ordinary wage and hour and overtime claims, and three years for wilful violations ; and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C., Section 2000e-5 (d)] providing a limitation of ninety days for filing of charges of discrimination in employment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b605-10\">. The reasoning of the district court is summarized by the following excerpt from the order dismissing the cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">Section 101 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (29 U.S. C. \u00a7 411) protects the rights of members of labor unions to equal rights of membership. This includes the right to nominate candidates, to vote in elections, to attend meetings, to participate in and vote upon the business of the organization, to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, and, generally, to be free from any improper disciplinary action that might affect the members\u2019 <em>right of membership. </em>Nothing in this law is designed to protect the right of a member to hold office in a union. This being true, when there is a removal from office such as the office plaintiff held, that of Grand Lodge Representative, Section 101 of the Act does not protect the right to hold the office as such. In a case such as the one now before the Court, a plaintiff must, in order to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, make appropriate allegations that he has been subjected to some disciplinary action that affects his <em>membership </em>in the labor organization. Here, it is un-controverted that Sewell was discharged as an employee for insubordination and was not discharged because of his union activity as a member, and the disciplinary action taken against him did not in any way affect his union membership. Thus plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, (emphasis in original)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b605-13\">. 418 F.2d 1001 (5th Cir. 1969). In <em>Nix </em>the court found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-14\">The factual background of Sewell\u2019s discharge can be summarized as follows. Sewell received a reprimand from Sie-miller on December 13, 1966, because of the brevity of his weekly reports, and was discharged on January 4, 1967, for refusing to carry out the IAM Executive Council\u2019s decision to secure elimination of IAM\u2019s post convention referendum. In October and November of 1966 the staff representatives of IAM (including Sewell) were informed of the necessity of eliminating the post-convention referendum and the support required of all staff representatives in working for its defeat. Siemiller, in a letter to Sewell on December 22, 1966, stated that he had received reports that Sewell was opposing the elimination of the referendum and requested him \u201cto report to this office if you have been advising local lodges to vote against the proposition in January; and if you have been opposing the [elimination of the] referendum, give reasons for such position.\u201d Sewell replied that he had not discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the referendum with local lodges, but had done so with many individual members, urging that the referendum not be eliminated. On January 4, Siemiller discharged Sewell for actively supporting the referendum and thereby refusing to carry out the decision of the Executive Council. (Footnote omitted) 418 F.2d at 1004-1005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Dealing specifically with Sewell\u2019s discharge, the court further found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">The record clearly shows that Sewell liad knowledge of the IAM\u2019s desire to have the amendment passed and its dependence upon Grand Lodge representatives (including Sewell) to support actively the amendment\u2019s passage among IAM members. With this knowledge, Sewell actively opposed the amendment. For his opposition Sewell was discharged for insubordination. 418 F.2d at 1008-1009.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b606-9\">. Sewell has served as a special union representative, as an aide to the general vice president of the southern territory, as acting general vice president in charge of the union\u2019s southern territory and as Grand Lodge Representative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b606-10\">. The proposal in question sought to eliminate from the Union\u2019s constitution the requirement that all proposed amendments to the constitution must be submitted to the rank and file of the local unions for approval.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b606-15\">. In his January 4th letter President Sie-miller wrote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-16\">Your position, as stated in your December 27, 1966, letter, together with admitted actions, is insubordination. Therefore, for this reason, your employment with the International Union is terminated immediately upon receipt of this letter.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b606-17\">. In paragraph 2 of his complaint Sewell alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-18\">Plaintiff is a member of the Internation-tional Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, and has been such at all times relevant herein, holding membership card No. X-83333.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b606-19\">. In its motion to dismiss, the Union relied upon and pled the Alabama Statute of Limitations of one year. Sewell did not amend or seek to amend his complaint to meet this defense.

Stein et al., 445 F.2d 431 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-20\">The nature of Sewell\u2019s cause of action is succinctly stated in his complaint as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-21\">4.

Sections 411(a) (1) and (2)) of said Act. 73 Stat. 522.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">10. Plaintiff claims that said action of the defendant in so disciplining plaintiff was malicious, wanton, and in reckless disregard of the right secured to plaintiff as a member of said union by Section 101(a) (1) (29 U.S.C.

Section 411 (a) (2)) of said Act, to meet and assemble freely with other members and to express any views, arguments, or opinions; and that the action of defendant in disciplining plaintiff by depriving him of said employment for exercising his statutory rights is and was unlawful as being in violation of Section 609 (29 U.S.C.

In N.L.R.B. v. Local Union No. 1229, 346 U.S. 464, 472, 74 S.Ct. 172, 176, 98 L.Ed. 195 (1953) Mr. Justice Burton speaking for the Court observed: \u201cThere is no more elemental cause for discharge of an employee than disloyalty to his employer.\u201d See also, e. <em>g., </em>Goldwasser v. Brown, 135 U.S.App.D.C. 222, 417 F.2d 1169, 1176 (1969) ; Gulickson v. Forest, 290 F.Supp. 457, 464 (E.D.N.Y.1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b609-11\">. In Nix v. N.L.R.B., 418 F.2d 1001 (5th Cir. 1969) this court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-12\">Petitioners contend that, even assuming Sewell was discharged because of his opposition to the amendment, his discharge still violates sections 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3) for three reasons. They first contend that Sewell was exercising his membership rights as a member of IAM and cannot be discharged for exercising these rights. Under their contention, Sewell could oppose the amendment as an individual member of the IAM, even though as an employee of that union his duty was to support actively its passage. This contention seems to be without adequate foundation. Actual conflicts of interest arising from an individual\u2019s dual status as union member and employee may properly be resolved in favor of the employer\u2019s right to operate its business and to discharge employees for cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">The Union argues vigorously in this court that the issues presented in the instant case have already been adjudicated in our <em>Nix </em>decision. It relies on the principle of collateral estoppel and res judicata. See Blonder-Tongue Laboratories v. Univ. of Illinois Fd., 402 U.S. 313, 91 S.Ct. 1434, 28 L.Ed.2d 788 (1971) ; Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970) ; Tampa Phosphate RR Co. v. Seaboard Coast Line RR Co., 418 F.2d 387 (5th Cir. 1969) ; Seguros Tepeyac, S. A., etc. v. Jernigan, 410 F.2d 718 (5th Cir. 1969) ; 1B Moore 633 \u00b6 0.405 [3]. The record does not disclose that this issue was presented in the district court and therefore we decline to consider it here.
