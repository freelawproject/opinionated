Citizens Casualty Co. of New York, et al., 5th Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b711-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">This is an appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of the appellant\u2019s motion to vacate his conviction and sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">The appellant was convicted by a jury of transporting a stolen automobile in interstate commerce, a violation of the Dyer Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312, and this Court affirmed the judgment of conviction upon his direct appeal, United States v. Lawrence, 5th Cir. 1970, 427 F.2d 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">The appellant now seeks to have his conviction set aside on the ground that the Government failed to prove he was guilty of an offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312 because no evidence was offered to show that his transportation of the stolen motor vehicle from Georgia to Florida had an effect on interstate commerce. The appellant argues that interstate \u201cjoyriding\u201d in a stolen car does not come within the purview of \u00a7 2312.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-15\">We find no merit to the appellant\u2019s contention, having specifically rejected the identical argument in Mayzak v. United States, 5th Cir. 1968, 402 F.2d 152, 154:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-17\">\u201c-x- * * Defendant\u2019s allegation that a \u2018joy ride\u2019 is not transportation in interstate commerce seems to be premised on the notion that the Dyer Act reaches only the theft of motor vehicles which are subsequently sold for profit across state lines. But a ride does not have to be unjoyous or business oriented to be within the Dyer Act\u2019s confines. It has long been the law that the transportation of a motor vehicle from one state to another is sufficient in itself to constitute transportation in interstate commerce. Whitaker v. United States, 9th Cir. 1925, 5 F.2d 546. No intent to sell or sale is required. Kelly v. United States, 4th Cir. 1921, 277 F. 405.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACU\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2255 relief is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
