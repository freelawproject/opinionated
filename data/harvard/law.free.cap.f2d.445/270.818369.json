We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">This recognizes that factually it was a classic ease for jury resolution of the claim that Franklin was knocked off a railroad car on the industrial siding of his employer when another car supposedly slammed into it by reason of a third car \u2014 spotted a couple of weeks previously \u2014 rolling down the track of its own momentum presumably because of the railroad\u2019s failure to set the brakes properly, and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">Only two contentions warrant discussion. The first is that the Court failed to charge that the burden of proof was on the railroad to establish the three separate defenses of the Plaintiff\u2019s own negligence, avoidable consequences and the Plaintiff\u2019s negligence exceeded that of the railroad for purposes of Georgia\u2019s comparative fault doctrine. We have serious doubts that the efforts to bridge an exception made to another portion of the charge over to this phase was sufficient under F.R.Civ.P. 46 and 51. But in any case we think the charge as a whole spelled out in understandable terms what would be the consequences of indicated possible findings on these issues and no harm resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-17\">The second is a reference to the Georgia compensation law and the liability of Franklin\u2019s employer to him under it. This entered the case \u2014 improperly, we may assume \u2014 out of an effort to clarify identification of some medical reports referred to in the testimony of one of the doctors. We find this harmless for at least two reasons. First, while objection was first asserted, in the running colloquy counsel for the Plaintiff acquiesced and the effort to revive it in the formal objections was unavailing. Next, the charge made clear that the reference did not have any bearing on the liability issues or damages for that matter \u2014 except for possible subrogation. The verdict was a general one for the railroad, and with the serious injuries involved it is difficult even with intricate metaphysical variations of Georgia\u2019s comparative fault theory to work up an explanation of why an element going really only to damages could result, not in a finding of no damages, but one which completely exonerated the railroad. Obviously this analysis bears on this case only and in no sense excuses the improper introduction of these collateral matters in other situations. See Tipton v. Socony Mobil Oil Co., 5 Cir., 1963, 315 F.2d 660 (dissenting opinion), vacated and remanded, 375 U.S. 34, 84 S. Ct. 1, 11 L.Ed.2d 4, reh. den., 375 U.S. 936, 84 S.Ct. 328, 11 L.Ed.2d 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
