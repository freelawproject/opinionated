We affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-25\">The basis of the Millers\u2019 complaints is an article which appeared in <em>The New York Daily News </em>on June 20, 1964. The article described the arrest of five persons including Miller on an indictment which alleged their participation in \u201cthe largest and most profitable heroin smuggling syndicate in the world.\u201d It asserted that Miller had legally changed his name which formerly was Frank Coppola <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>and that he was an ex-eonviet who \u201cmasqueraded as a legitimate businessman in the swank Connecticut suburbs\u201d where he operated a string of beauty salons. According to the article, he lived on a plot of 25 acres in a rambling ranch-style home which was set \u201cidyllically\u201d on a tree-shaded hill in Orange, Connecticut, and was \u201cwell known to Connecticut State Police\u201d although to outward appearances he was \u201ca pillar of the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Miller\u2019s complaint alleged that <em>The Daily News\u2019 </em>article contained material concerning him which was \u201cfalse, malicious, and defamatory.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further alleged that on May 19, 1965 he had demanded that the <em>News </em>retract the article, but that they refused to do so. Compensatory and punitive damages of $2,000,000 were claimed for the alleged libels and an additional $1,000,000 was sought on the theory that publication of the article violated his right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The district court found that under the Connecticut Retraction Statute a plaintiff in a libel suit, who is unable to prove that he requested a retraction within a reasonable time, cannot recover damages unless he can prove that the article was published maliciously or he is able to allege and prove special damages as a result of the publication. Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 52-237 (1949).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Blumenfeld held that appellant\u2019s request for retraction more than eleven months after the article appeared was unreasonably late as a matter of law, and his inability to prove malicious publication and failure to allege and prove special damages prevented any recovery. He then went on to find that the article in question was conditionally privileged because it was \u201ca fair and accurate report of judicial and official proceedings\u201d and \u201cfair comment on a matter of public interest.\u201d He also found that the article did not violate plaintiffs\u2019 right to privacy because it was protected by the defense of \u201cnewsworthiness.\u201d Having found that plaintiffs could not prevail on any of their claims, the district court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">Appellants argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the appellee because there were disputed issues of fact which should have been resolved by the jury rather than the judge. According to appellants, those disputed issues primarily concerned how much of what was printed was privileged \u2014i. e., how much of it came from legitimate official sources and how much was the product of the <em>News\u2019 </em>reporters\u2019 allegedly malicious imaginations.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\"> We reject this contention. On the record before us, which consisted of extensive interrogatories, depositions, and affidavits, it is clear that the <em>News\u2019 </em>article was privileged as a fair comment on official proceedings, and hence that there was no genuine issue of material fact.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>News\u2019 </em>reporters based their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>story on reliable sources \u2014 national wire services and personal interviews with Customs officials \u2014 so they can hardly be accused of gross negligence, much less actual malice. Appellants\u2019 suggestion that the <em>News </em>should have stopped the presses when it learned that the Miller home rested on a plot of less than 25 acres is fatuous. The only item in the story open to possible dispute as to whether it came from an official source was that Miller was an \u201cex-convict,\u201d \u201cwell known to Connecticut State Police.\u201d There is no dispute as to the truth of these statements, however, and the <em>News </em>did invoke the defense of truth with respect to them. The term \u201cmasquerade\u201d in describing Miller\u2019s beauty parlor business was a fair comment because it is a logical sequela of Miller\u2019s dual role as an above-board beautician and underground dope smuggler. On the whole, the event was newsworthy, there was no lack of checking of official sources, and any deviations from or embellishments upon the information obtained from those sources was minuscule \u2014 due, as Judge Blumen-feld found, to \u201ca little touch of [the reporter\u2019s] piquant pen.\u201d Accordingly, the district court was perfectly justified in granting summary judgment on the ground that the <em>News </em>article was fair comment and therefore privileged, and that there was no showing of any facts from which a finding of malice could be made, much less a showing of \u201cclear and convincing proof that the defamatory falsehood was published with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., 403 U.S. 29, 91 S.Ct. 1811, 28 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">We find it unnecessary to reach the alternative ground for granting summary judgment relied upon below, based upon the Connecticut Retraction Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Appellants\u2019 allegation charging invasion of privacy is frivolous in view of the legitimate newsworthiness of the arrest of alleged smugglers responsible for importing major quantities of heroin into this country. We have examined the appellants\u2019 remaining contentions and find them to be wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AVF\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-7\">. We take judicial notice of the fact that appellant James Miller has been acquitted of the charge of conspiring to import heroin in violation of 21 TJ.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 173-174. At his first trial before the United States District Court of Connecticut he was convicted and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. His conviction was affirmed by us on June 26, 1967. United States v. Miller, 381 F.2d 529 (2 Cir. 1967). However, on March 14, 1969, we reversed the denial of Miller\u2019s motion for a new trial. United States v. Miller, 411 F.2d 825 (2 Cir. 1969). The new trial resulted in an acquittal by the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\">.
