He also applied for and received Social Security disability benefits under the provisions of Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i) and 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">In 1964 he was elected to the office of County Tax Assessor and assumed the duties of that office. Thereafter, an order was entered by the Secretary terminating his disability benefits on the ground that because of his employment as, and performance of the duties of County Tax Assessor, he was no longer disabled within the meaning of the applicable statute. An appeal was taken to the District Court from the order terminating the disability benefits, and by order of the District Court the claim was remanded for further consideration. The appeal from the Secretary\u2019s order terminating Social Security benefits, effective August 31, 1965, was ultimately dismissed by the District Court by an order entered March 26, 1968, and no appeal was taken from that order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">While the appeal was pending in the District Court, the appellant was awarded Social Security disability benefits based upon an application dated February 1, 1967, subject to proportionate deduction as set forth above. It is from this order that the present appeal is taken. We are of the opinion that the decision of the Secretary terminating disability benefits in 1965, the appeal from which was finally dismissed on review by the District Court, is res judicata and final. Sangster v. Gardner, 374 F.2d 498 (6th Cir. 1967), Domozik v. Cohen, 413 F.2d 5 (3rd Cir. 1969). The appellant\u2019s right to Social Security disability benefits must be limited to those awarded pursuant to the application filed on February 1, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
