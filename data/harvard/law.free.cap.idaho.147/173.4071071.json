Heartland, LLC, acting on behalf of Powder-horn Communities, LLC, (collectively referred to as Powderhorn), filed an application requesting that the Board amend the Plan, which the Board approved. Respondent Neighbors for Responsible Growth (Neighbors) filed a petition seeking judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. The district court granted review, vacated the Board\u2019s decision, and remanded the matter for further proceedings. Powderhorn, along with Coeur d\u2019Alene Land Company and H.F. Magnuson (Magnuson), (collectively referred to as Appellants) intervened below and now appeal the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">On December 16, 2005, Powderhorn filed an application on behalf of all landowners in the geographic area known as the Powder-horn Peninsula requesting that the Plan be amended to designate the peninsula as a rural residential area. The Kootenai County Planning Commission (the Commission) prepared a staff report and held a public hearing on the matter on April 27, 2006. The Commission recommended denial of the application. Powderhorn subsequently amended its application and requested that the peninsula be designated as rural, rather than rural residential. On September 14, 2006, the Board conducted a public hearing on the application, and on September 25, 2006, the Board visited the peninsula. Neighbors alleged that a member of the Board had improper contact with a Powderhorn representative during the visit, and as a result the Board re-opened public testimony and held another public hearing on the matter on October 4, 2006. On November 9, 2006, the Board entered an initial order granting the request for an amendment to the Plan, which it subsequently revised into a final order approving the amendment. The Board\u2019s final order was issued November 16, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">On November 15, 2006 \u2014 subsequent to the Board\u2019s initial order but prior to its final order \u2014 Neighbors filed a petition for review of the Board\u2019s decision with the district court. Neighbors later filed a motion to stay proceedings related to requests for zoning changes made by the peninsula landowners, and the district court set a hearing on the motion for December 18, 2006. Powderhorn intervened in the proceedings and opposed the motion to stay; however, the motion was granted by the district court without imposition of terms or a bond. Powderhorn then filed a motion to dismiss Neighbors\u2019 petition for judicial review, based in part on the fact that Neighbors had not timely appealed the Board\u2019s final order. Neighbors subsequently filed an amended petition seeking review of the Board\u2019s final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The amended petition also added a claim for declaratory relief based upon alleged improper <em>ex parte </em>communications and conflicts of interest during the proceedings before the Board. The district court denied Powder-horn\u2019s motion to dismiss the initial petition, and Powderhorn then moved to strike the amended petition on the basis of alleged improper procedure. At this point, Magnuson intervened and joined Powderhorn in objecting to Neighbors\u2019 amended petition. In response, Neighbors filed an alternative motion to amend its petition. At a hearing on May 31, 2007, the district court indicated that it would allow Neighbors to go forward with its petition for review of the Board\u2019s final order and would not dismiss Neighbors\u2019 claim for declaratory relief, but that it would not hear argument on the claim for declaratory relief at a hearing on the merits of the Board\u2019s decision scheduled for June 5, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">At the June 5 hearing, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>raised the issue of the applicability of I.C. \u00a7 67-6509(b) and <em>Price v. Payette County Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>131 Idaho 426, 958 P.2d 583 (1998), to the facts of this case. The district court postponed a decision in order to allow the parties to submit briefing on the issue of whether the Board complied with public hearing requirements, as set out in I.C. \u00a7 67-6509(b) and explained in <em>Price. </em>Finally, on July 25, 2007, the district court vacated and remanded the Board\u2019s decision, based on the fact that the Board failed to hold a public hearing in violation of I.C. \u00a7 67-6509(b) after announcing that it would amend the Plan despite the recommendation of the Commission that the Plan should not be amended. The district court awarded costs to Neighbors. Appellants timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">On March 27, 2008, we published <em>Giltner Dairy, LLC v. Jerome County, </em>145 Idaho 630, 181 P.3d 1238 (2008), holding that Giltner was not entitled to judicial review of Jerome County\u2019s decision to amend its comprehensive plan map and that Giltner must pay the attorney fees of both the county and a third-party intervenor in the case. Upon reading <em>Giltner, </em>counsel for Neighbors decided that the decision is \u201ctotally dispositive\u201d of the instant case and therefore, on April 22, 2008, asked this Court to suspend this appeal, pursuant to LA.it. 13.2, and remand the matter to the district court, under I.A.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>13.3, with instructions to the district court to dismiss Neighbors\u2019 petition for review with prejudice. Neighbors asserted that no costs or attorney fees should be awarded to any party in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Initially, we ordered that Neighbors be dismissed from the case and that Appellants alone be allowed to proceed on the sole issue of attorney fees. After Neighbors moved for reconsideration and requested oral argument, we withdrew our initial order and allowed all parties to present oral argument on the issue of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u201cThe Supreme Court in its decision on appeal shall include its determination of a claimed right to attorney fees.... \u201d I.A.R. Rule 41(c). When an award of attorney fees depends on the interpretation of a statute, the standard of review for statutory interpretation applies. <em>BECO Const. Co., Inc. v. J-U-B Engr\u2019s, Inc., </em>145 Idaho 719, 726, 184 P.3d 844, 851 (2008). The interpretation of a statute is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review. <em>State v. Hart, </em>135 Idaho 827, 829, 25 P.3d 850, 852 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">A. The district court\u2019s judgment must be vacated and this matter remanded with instructions to dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Neighbors has conceded that it has no right to petition for review of the Board\u2019s decision in light of this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Giltner Dairy v. Jerome County, </em>145 Idaho 630, 181 P.3d 1238 (2008). Appellants agree that <em>Giltner, </em>which was released after Appellants brought this appeal, is \u201ctotally dispositive\u201d of the substantive issues in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">In <em>Giltner, </em>Giltner Dairy sought judicial review of the county commission\u2019s decision to amend its comprehensive plan map to reflect that the land belonging to Giltner\u2019s neighbor, Golf Ranch, is an area transitioning from agricultural to urban use, rather than an area of strictly agricultural use. <em>Id. </em>at 631, 181 P.3d at 1239. Giltner argued that the district court had jurisdiction to review the commission\u2019s decision under I.C. \u00a7 67-6521, which grants the right to judicial review in accordance with the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act to \u201c[a]n affected person aggrieved by a decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632, 181 P.3d at 1240. This Court noted that I.C. \u00a7 67-6521(l)(a) defines \u201caffected person\u201d as \u201cone having an interest in real property which may be adversely affected by the issuance or denial of a permit authorizing the development.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that because the county\u2019s amendment to its comprehensive plan map was not a permit authorizing development, Giltner was not an \u201caffected person\u201d and was therefore not authorized by I.C. \u00a7 67-6521 to file a petition for review of the amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 634, 181 P.3d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">Neighbors, like Giltner, petitioned for review pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 67-6521. The Board\u2019s amendment to the Plan designating the peninsula as a rural area, like the amendment by the Jerome County commissioners, is not a permit authorizing development. Neighbors, like Giltner, is thus not an \u201caffected person\u201d and is not entitled to judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision under I.C. \u00a7 67-6521. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss the petition for review. We turn now to the question of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">B. Appellants are not entitled to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">Appellants did not address the issue of attorney fees below in their opening briefs, and thus we decline to address the same. <em>McVicker v. City of Lewiston, </em>134 Idaho 34, 38, 995 P.2d 804, 808 (2000) (citing I.A.R. 35(a)(6)). Appellants also failed to ask for attorney fees on appeal under I.C. \u00a7 12-121 in their opening briefs, and thus we decline to address this issue as well.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Appellants did, however, request attorney fees on appeal pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117 in their opening briefs, and we now examine whether they are entitled to the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117 states in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">Unless otherwise provided by statute, in any administrative or civil judicial proceeding involving as adverse parties a state agency, a city, a county or other taxing district and a person, the court shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, witness fees and reasonable expenses, if the court finds that the party against whom the judgment is rendered acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdF\">The dispositive phrase is \u201cinvolving as adverse parties ... a county ... and a person.\u201d We read this phrase to mean that in order for Appellants to receive an award under I.C. \u00a7 12-117, they must be adverse to Kootenai County. This interpretation is in keeping with our recent decision in <em>Galli v. Idaho County, </em>146 Idaho 155, 191 P.3d 233 (2008). In <em>Galli </em>we held that because the Gallis were not adverse to the county they were not entitled to an award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117. <em>Id. </em>at 161, 191 P.3d at 239. The county\u2019s only involvement in <em>Galli </em>was to object to attorney fees; it did not participate in the merits of the appeal. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, the county in this case is not adverse to either party. The county\u2019s only involvement in this appeal was to waive any objection to Neighbors\u2019 motion to dismiss and to waive any claim to attorney fees. Furthermore, Appellants are intervenors on the side of the county \u2014 perhaps the most obvious indicator that the two are not adverse. Thus, because Appellants are not adverse to the county, they are not entitled to an award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">This holding may appear to conflict with our decision in <em>Rural Kootenai Org., Inc. v. Bd. of Commr\u2019s, </em>133 Idaho 833, 845, 993 P.2d 596, 608 (1999). In that ease, a developer intervened on the side of the county, and the county lost on appeal. We stated that, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117, \u201c[the intervenor] shall share the burden of appellate costs with the County.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 846, 993 P.2d at 609. This holding suggests that, since we levied costs against an intervenor who was not adverse to the county under I.C. \u00a7 12-117, we may also logically make an award of attorney fees to Appellants under that same provision. In <em>Rural Kootenai, </em>this Court was explicit, however, that it was only awarding costs and not attorney fees against the intervenor pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117. Because costs are awarded to a prevailing party on appeal as a matter of course pursuant to I.A.R. 40, our reference to I.C. \u00a7 12-117 as a basis for the award of costs is mere dicta. Thus, we conclude that our decision in <em>Rural Kootenai </em>does not control our decision regarding Appellants\u2019 request for attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Furthermore, our holding today is in line with the legislative evolution of I.C. \u00a7 12-117. When initially enacted in 1984, I.C. \u00a7 12-117 allowed only for an award of attorney fees to be levied against a state agency in favor of a person. 1984 Idaho Sess. Laws, ch. 204, \u00a7 1, p. 501. Ten years later, the statute was expanded to include cities, counties and taxing districts. 1994 Idaho Sess. Laws, ch. 36, \u00a7 1, p. 55. However, the statute continued to provide that only the person, not the governmental entity, was entitled to an award of attorney fees. In 2000, the statute was amended to create a \u201ctwo-way street,\u201d authorizing an award of attorney fees to either the governmental entity or to the person in the event \u201cthat the party against whom the judgment is rendered acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.\u201d 2000 Idaho Sess. Laws, ch. 241, \u00a7 1, p. 675. The statute has never been amended, however, to provide for an award to a person who is not adverse to the governmental entity. We decline to infer that the Legislature intended that one person might recover from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>another person under I.C. \u00a7 12-117 solely because of the presence of a governmental entity in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Appellants\u2019 request for an award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117 fails because they are not adverse to the county.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants are the prevailing party, however, and as such they are entitled to costs on appeal pursuant to I.A.R. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Our decision in <em>Giltner </em>is dispositive of this appeal, and thus we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss Neighbors\u2019 petition for judicial review. Appellants are awarded costs but not attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b210-7\">Justices BURDICK, J. JONES, W. JONES and Justice Pro Tem TROUT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-11\">. Appellants did ask for attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121 in their reply briefs. This belated request appears to be in response to the release of <em>Giltner Dairy, </em>in which we awarded attorney fees to intervenor Golf Ranch under that provision. <em>Giltner Dairy, </em>145 Idaho at 634, 181 P.3d at 1242. We take this opportunity to observe that the award to Golf Ranch was improvidently granted. Idaho Code \u00a7 12-121 states in relevant part that: <em>\u201cIn any civil action, </em>the judge may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party....\" (Emphasis added). <em>Giltner </em>came before us on appeal from a petition to review county action. In <em>Lowery v. Bd. of County Commr\u2019s for Ada County, </em>117 Idaho 1079, 1082, 793 P.2d 1251, 1254 (1990), we held that where a case is before an appellate court on petition for judicial review of county action, such a matter is not a civil action because it does not commence with the filing of a complaint as required by I.R.C.P. 3(a). Thus, we held that it was error to award attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-121 in connection with a petition for judicial review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-19\">. In <em>Galli, </em>this Court stated two reasons for not awarding attorney fees to the Gallis under I.C. \u00a7 12-117: that the county and the -Gallis were not adverse and that \"no judgment [had] been rendered.\u201d 146 Idaho at 161, 191 P.3d at 239. The latter statement is dicta. A \"judgment\u201d is \"[a] court's final determination of the rights and obligations of the parties in a case. The term <em>judgment </em>includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies.\u201d Black's Law Dictionary 846 (7th ed. 1999). Clearly, a court\u2019s decision regarding a petition for judicial review may be a \"judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
