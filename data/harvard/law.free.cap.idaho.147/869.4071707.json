We vacate the decision of the district court affirming the decision of the magistrate court and remand for consideration of the request under Idaho Court Administrative Rule (I.C.A.R.) 32(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">I.FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">The material facts of this case are not in dispute. Turp\u00e9n is a licensed dentist. In January of 2004, he was charged with the misdemeanor offense of sexual exploitation by a medical care provider in violation of I.C. \u00a7 18-919. Turp\u00e9n entered a plea of not guilty and the case went to trial before a jury in June of 2004. Turp\u00e9n was acquitted of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">In July of 2006, Turp\u00e9n filed a motion with the trial court seeking \u201cto expunge the 2003-2004 criminal records ... reflecting the arrest, filing and acquittal by jury\u201d of the charge. In support of his motion, Turp\u00e9n submitted his affidavit, in which he alleged that the \u201ccontinued existence of those records constitutes a personal and professional embarrassment\u201d and suggested that the records have damaged his dentistry practice and reputation. The magistrate judge denied Turpen\u2019s motion. Turp\u00e9n appealed. The district court, acting in its appellate capacity, affirmed the decision. Turp\u00e9n timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">II.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">When reviewing a decision of the district court acting in its appellate capacity, this Court reviews the trial court\u2019s record to determine whether there is substantial and competent evidence to support the magistrate court\u2019s findings of fact and whether the magistrate court\u2019s conclusions of law follow from those findings. <em>Losser v. Bradstreet, </em>145 Idaho 670, 672, 183 P.3d 758, 760 (2008) (quoting <em>Nicholls v. Blaser, </em>102 Idaho 559, 561, 633 P.2d 1137, 1139 (1981)). If the district court affirmed the magistrate court\u2019s decision because the magistrate court\u2019s findings are so supported and its conclusions follow therefrom, then, as a matter of procedure, this Court affirms the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>This Court exercises free review over questions of law. <em>Horkley v. Horkley, </em>144 Idaho 879, 880, 173 P.3d 1138, 1139 (2007) (quoting <em>Chapin v. Linden, </em>144 Idaho 393, 396, 162 P.3d 772, 775 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">III.ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b902-15\">Turp\u00e9n asked the magistrate \u201cto expunge his criminal records as held by the Fourth District Court, the Boise City Police Department, the Ada County Sheriffs Office, and the Ada County Prosecutors Office.\u201d However, during oral argument before this Court, Turp\u00e9n substantially narrowed the relief that he seeks, indicating that he seeks relief only as to court records and that he no longer seeks expungement of records maintained by the county or the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-16\">As a preliminary matter, we find it appropriate to define the manner in which we use the words \u201cexpunge\u201d and \u201cexpungement.\u201d Our use of these words is not literal. \u201cExpunge\u201d is defined as follows: \u201cTo destroy; blot out; obliterate; erase; efface designedly; strike out wholly. The act of physically destroying information \u2014 including criminal records \u2014 in files, computers, or other depositories.\u201d BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 522 (5th ed.1979). We do not contemplate the destruction of public records. Whether such records are physical or stored electronically; rather, when we refer to ex-pungement, we mean the issuance of a court order requiring physical or electronic sequestration of such records from public access or inspection. Thus, when we refer to \u201cex-pungement\u201d we do so in the narrower sense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>of \u201cexpungement of record\u201d which is defined as the \u201c[p]rocess by which [a] record of criminal conviction is destroyed or sealed.... \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">We turn to the question whether Turp\u00e9n is entitled to expungement of the court records relating to the dismissed charge. Turp\u00e9n relies upon the courts\u2019 \u201cinherent power to order expungement of criminal records\u201d and has identified approaches to ex-pungement requests employed by state and federal courts. The approaches favored by Turp\u00e9n range from automatic expungement upon acquittal, as is the rule in Pennsylvania, see <em>Commonwealth v. D.M., </em>548 Pa. 131, 695 A.2d 770 (1997), to a balancing of the individual\u2019s privacy interest or the danger of \u201cunwarranted adverse consequences\u201d against the recognized public interest in maintaining such records. <em>See e.g. Davidson v. Dill, </em>180 Colo. 123, 503 P.2d 157, 161 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">We need not address the scope of the inherent powers of the courts to order ex-pungement, because there is currently a court rule in place that grants the trial courts the authority to grant relief of the type that Turp\u00e9n seeks. That rule is I.C.A.R. 32(1). Without deciding whether expungement is appropriate in the instant case, we find it appropriate to remand this case for further proceedings under I.C.A.R. 32(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">We acknowledge that our decision to remand this case is an unusual remedy. Neither party raised I.C.A.R. 32(i) below or in the briefing presented to this Court. Rather, a Justice of this Court first raised the potential application of I.C.A.R. 32(i) during oral argument. Normally, this Court does not address issues that the parties did not raise below and which have not been preserved for appeal. <em>Commercial Ventures, Inc. v. Rex M. &amp; Lynn Lea Family Trust, </em>145 Idaho 208, 216, 177 P.3d 955, 963 (2008) (quoting <em>Fairway Dev. Co. v. Petersen, Moss, Olsen, Meacham &amp; Carr, </em>124 Idaho 866, 870, 865 P.2d 957, 961 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">However, requests for expungement are seen with some frequency by the trial and appellate courts of this state. <em>See State ex rel. City of Sandpoint v. Whitt, </em>146 Idaho 292, 293, 192 P.3d 1116, 1117 (Ct.App.2008) (denial of request for expungement of record of conviction for injury to child not appealed); <em>State v. Parkinson, </em>144 Idaho 825, 172 P.3d 1100 (2007) (affirming denial of request for expungement of record of dismissed conviction from NCIC database); <em>State v. Knapp, </em>139 Idaho 381, 79 P.3d 740 (Ct.App.2003), overruled by <em>State v. Kimball, </em>145 Idaho 542, 181 P.3d 468 (2008) (petitioner sought relief including expungement of the record of his case). As no reported Idaho decision addresses expungement of court records under I.C.A.R. 32(i), and as it is unnecessary to define standards relating to the exercise of the inherent powers of the courts when such standards are already prescribed by court rule, we find it appropriate to give guidance to the courts of this State in dealing with requests for expungement of court records.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\"> Idaho Court Administrative Rule 32 governs the records maintained by the judicial department. The rule recognizes the public\u2019s \u201cright to examine and copy the judicial department\u2019s declarations of law and public policy and to examine and copy the records of all proceedings open to the public.\u201d I.C.A.R. 32(a). However, I.C.A.R. 32(i) authorizes the trial court to seal or redact court records on a ease-by-case basis. The rule requires the custodian judge to hold a hearing and make a factual finding as to whether the individual\u2019s interest in privacy or whether the interest in public disclosure predominates. \u201cIf the court redacts or seals records to protect predominating privacy interests, it must fashion the least restrictive exception from disclosure consistent with privacy interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Before entering an order redacting or sealing records, the court must make one or more of the following determinations in writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-11\">(1) That the documents or materials contain highly intimate facts or statements, the publication of which would be highly objectionable to a reasonable person, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-12\">(2) That the documents or materials contain facts or statements that the court finds might be libelous, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-13\">(3) That the documents or materials contain facts or statements, the dissemination or publication of which would reasonably result in economic or financial loss or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>harm to a person having an interest in the documents or materials, or compromise the security of personnel, records or public property of or used by the judicial department, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-4\">(4) That the documents or materials contain facts or statements that might threaten or endanger the life or safety of individuals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">In determining whether to grant a request to seal or redact records, trial courts are expected to apply \u201cthe traditional legal concepts in the law of invasion of privacy, defamation, and invasion of proprietary business records as well as common sense respect for shielding highly intimate material about persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The decisions of the trial courts will be subject to review for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">This case will be remanded to permit the magistrate judge to conduct a hearing under I.C.A.R. 32(i) and make the factual determination whether Turpen\u2019s privacy interest or the public interest in disclosure predominates. If the magistrate judge finds that Turpen\u2019s privacy interest predominates, then the court must make written findings and may redact or seal Turpen\u2019s court records to the least restrictive extent necessary to protect Turpen\u2019s privacy interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">We vacate the decision of the district court affirming the decision of the magistrate court and remand for consideration of Turpen\u2019s motion under I.C.A.R. 32(i).</p>\n<judges id=\"b904-9\">Justices BURDICK, J.
