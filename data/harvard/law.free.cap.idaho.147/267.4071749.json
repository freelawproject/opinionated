Both cases involved the Board\u2019s denial of variance requests for decks built on waterfront property. The cases of Respondents James and Penny Wohrle and Respondent Jerry Judd (collectively Respondents) involve identical legal issues and nearly identical factual situations and, while not consolidated, have been dealt with in conjunction with one another from the initiation of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-27\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b301-28\">Respondents constructed decks on their respective properties on Coeur d\u2019Alene Lake without having first obtained either a variance or building permit from Kootenai Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ty. The waterfront parcels each have 100 feet of frontage that can only be accessed via the water due to the steep and rocky terrain of the properties. Judd constructed three decks at the shoreline of his property to provide a flat area for recreational use of the land. When Judd purchased his parcel in 2002, it had existing docks and pilings permitted by the Idaho Department of Lands and existing stairways used to access a power pole on the property. The Wohrles constructed two small decks on the shoreline. Before building the decks, the Wohrles inquired with the Idaho Department of Lands to determine if any permits were necessary, and the Department informed them that no building permits were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">In June 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers sent letters to Respondents regarding concrete pilings placed below the high water line. The Corps also sent copies of the letters to the County, which issued a code violation notice for the construction of the decks without building permits. The Corps then sent letters on November 22, 2005 to Respondents, stating no further action would be taken because the concrete pilings were not causing any discernable adverse effects on the aquatic environment. However, those letters also advised Respondents that the rock fill and concrete footings were not authorized and \u201cmay not be maintained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">On September 16, 2005, Respondents applied to the Board for variances from the County\u2019s twenty-five foot front setback requirement. The requested variances would have allowed for a front setback of zero at the property line for the existing decks. Judd also requested a variance of seven feet from the ten foot side setback requirement for one of his decks.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The variance requests were first heard by a Kootenai County hearing examiner on March 16, 2006. On March 21, the hearing examiner issued a recommendation that the requests be denied. In his report, the hearing examiner determined that an undue hardship would result from literal enforcement of the setback requirement but that the requested variances would be in conflict with the public interest. Respondents then requested a public hearing before the Board and the Board granted the request on March 30, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">On June 1, 2006, the Board held a public hearing on the variance applications, at which Respondents testified and responded to questions from the Board. The Board also received comment sheets. There were no written comments or public testimony in opposition to the variance applications. During the course of proceedings, the Board raised questions regarding whether the properties were assessed as buildable or nonbuildable and documentation was presented regarding the valuation of the properties. Respondents were offered an opportunity to examine that documentation and respond. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the Board voted to deny Respondents\u2019 variance requests. The decision of the Board was issued June 15, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">On July 13, 2006, Respondents timely filed petitions for judicial review in the district court. Respondents also filed motions to augment the record to include an affidavit with exhibits consisting of records from a variance application submitted by other Kootenai County residents, which the Board approved on June 22, 2006. That variance was for a staircase built without a building permit and in violation of the five foot side setback requirements. The district court granted the motions and entered a written Order Granting Motion to Augment Record on December 5, 2006. The district court heard oral argument on the petitions on February 20, 2007, and concluded that Respondents would suffer an undue hardship from a literal enforcement of the setback requirement and that the decision of the Board was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. The district court awarded attorney fees and costs to Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">While Kootenai County raises five issues on appeal, those issues can be condensed into two main issues: (1) whether the district court erred in ordering that the record be augmented to include information pertaining to a separate variance request; and (2) whether the Board\u2019s decision was valid pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>suant to I.C. \u00a7 67-5279. We vacate the district court\u2019s order and affirm the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">A. Standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In order to obtain judicial review of the decision of a county board of commissioners under the Idaho Administrative Procedures Act (IDAPA), I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 67-5201, <em>et seq., </em>there must be a statute granting the right of judicial review. <em>Highlands Dev. Corp. v. City of Boise, </em>145 Idaho 958, 960-61, 188 P.3d 900, 902-03 (2008). The Local Land Use Planning Act (LLUPA) provides that \u201c[a]n applicant denied a permit or aggrieved by a decision\u201d of a governing board may seek judicial review under the provisions of IDA-PA. <em>Euclid Ave. Trust v. City of Boise, </em>146 Idaho 306, 308, 193 P.3d 853, 855 (2008); I.C. \u00a7 67-6519(4). Variance permits fall under LLUPA pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 67-6516. Therefore, an applicant denied a variance permit by a county board of commissioners, or aggrieved by the decision of the board, may seek judicial review under IDAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">B. The district court\u2019s augmentation of the record was in error, and was prejudicial to Kootenai County.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Kootenai County argues that the district court erred in granting Respondents\u2019 motion to augment the record because the evidence was not material or relevant to a review of the Board\u2019s decision, and the evidence did not constitute proof of irregularities in procedure before the Board. We agree and further find that the augmentation was prejudicial to the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">1. The district court abused its discretion in permitting the augmentation of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The decision to grant or deny a motion for augmentation of the record on appeal is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Crown Point Dev., Inc. v. City of Sun Valley, </em>144 Idaho 72, 75-76, 156 P.3d 573, 576-77 (2007). A decision within the discretion of the district court will not be disturbed on appeal if the court correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion, acted within the outer boundaries of its discretion and consistently with the legal standards applicable to the specific choices available to it, and reached its decision by an exercise of reason. <em>Id. </em>at 76, 156 P.3d at 577. Judicial review of a county board of commissioners\u2019 decision is generally confined to the board record unless the party requesting the additional evidence can demonstrate that the evidence falls within the statutory exceptions provided for in I.C. \u00a7 67-5276. <em>Id. </em>Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5276 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">(1) If, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material, relates to the validity of the agency action, and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-12\">(a) there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the agency, the court may remand the matter to the agency with directions that the agency receive additional evidence and conduct additional factfinding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-13\">(b) there were alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency, the court may take proof on the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-14\">(2) The agency may modify its action by reason of the additional evidence and shall file any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the reviewing court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">In <em>Crown Point, </em>this Court found that the record failed to show that the request for augmentation of the record was accompanied by either good reasons for failure to present the evidence at the agency hearing or a showing of irregularities in the procedure before the agency. 144 Idaho at 76, 156 P.3d at 577. Similarly, in <em>Urrutia v. Blaine County, </em>134 Idaho 353, 2 P.3d 738 (2000), this Court found that no good reasons for the failure to present evidence or procedural irregularities were established that would authorize the district court to augment the record. This Court also stated that even if good reasons had been established, the district court should have remanded the matter to the county board of commissioners for additional fact finding pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 67-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>5276(1)(a). <em>Urrutia, </em>134 Idaho at 361, 2 P.3d at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Procedural irregularities were found in an Idaho Court of Appeals ease in which an application was \u201cvoided\u201d without a hearing or any findings of fact or conclusions of law entered with respect to the application. <em>Soloaga v. Bannock County, </em>119 Idaho 678, 683, 809 P.2d 1157, 1162 (Ct.App.1990). The Court of Appeals determined that the suspension of the application was a procedural irregularity and the district court had properly remanded the case to the agency for a final determination on the merits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">First, in the ease presently before us, Respondents did not show that the additional evidence was material. Idaho Code \u00a7 67-6516 focuses on the \u201ccharacteristics of the site\u201d and the statute\u2019s consideration of conflict with the public interest and undue hardship is inherently restricted to a case-by-case analysis. Therefore, evidence regarding the Board\u2019s granting of a variance permit in another case is not material to the Board\u2019s decision based upon the unique characteristics of Respondents\u2019 properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In addition, Respondents did not present any evidence that the other application should be admitted because of irregularities in procedure before the Board pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 67-5276(l)(b). A final decision was entered following a public hearing on the matter, unlike in <em>Soloaga. </em>Similarly to <em>Crown Point </em>and <em>Urrutia, </em>Respondents here presented no evidence in support of their motion to augment the record that would support a finding that there were irregularities in procedure before the agency. Instead, counsel\u2019s affidavit in support of the motion simply stated that \u201c[t]he attached documents support the Petitioners\u2019 claims that the decision by Kootenai County to deny their variance application was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and not supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Similarly, no proof of irregularities in procedure was provided at the hearing on the motion to augment the record that occurred on November 29, 2006. The district court recognized that it is only allowed to consider the record pursuant to Idaho case law. However, the court then based its decision to allow the evidence on not \u201cknowing] of any other way to prove at least arbitrary behavior than by close comparison with different outcomes,\u201d indicating that the record was augmented to factually support Respondents\u2019 appeal. This is not an exception that is provided for by I.C. \u00a7 67-5276.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Furthermore, even if not having \u201cany other way to prove at least arbitrary behavior\u201d constituted good reason within the meaning of I.C. \u00a7 67 \u2014 5276(1)(a), the district court was required to \u201cremand the matter to the agency with directions that the agency receive additional evidence and conduct additional factfinding.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-5276(1)(a). Therefore, the district court did not act consistently with the applicable legal standards, nor did it reach its decision by an exercise of reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">2. The error was prejudicial to Kootenai County.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Even if the district court abused its discretion in allowing the additional evidence, it must also be shown that the court\u2019s error in including the additional evidence is prejudicial. <em>Crown Point Dev., Inc. v. City of Sun Valley, </em>144 Idaho 72, 77, 156 P.3d 573, 578 (2007). \u201cAn error is prejudicial only if it <em>could have affected or did affect </em>the outcome of a proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In <em>Crown Point, </em>this Court found that since the district court had relied on improperly admitted evidence in reaching its decision, the erroneous inclusion of additional evidence was prejudicial and an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">In contrast, in <em>Urrutia v. Blaine County, </em>134 Idaho 353, 2 P.3d 738 (2000), this Court found that the appellant was not prejudiced as a result of the district court\u2019s inclusion of additional evidence. The district court\u2019s final opinion in <em>Urrutia </em>did not mention the additional evidence and instead focused on the appellant county board of commissioners\u2019 misinterpretation of law. 134 Idaho at 361, 2 P.3d at 746. Therefore, the inclusion of the additional evidence constituted harmless error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">Here, it is difficult to determine the basis for the district court\u2019s decision given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the short written finding by the court that the denial of the variance requests was \u201carbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion.\u201d The district court did not directly mention the additional evidence in its final opinion. Instead, in its oral decision, the district court focused on the showing of undue hardship and the lack of evidence that the variance was in conflict with the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">However, given the district court\u2019s reasoning for allowing the other application in the first place \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t know of any other way to prove at least arbitrary behavior than by close comparison with different outcomes\u201d \u2014 it is highly likely that the district court considered the application in determining that the Board\u2019s decision had been arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. When granting the motion to augment the record the court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">[T]he commissioners can still be wrong, and so I don\u2019t know how much relevance this is going to bring to the situation, but on the other hand, I don\u2019t know how else any petitioner could really prove at least the arbitrary nature of someone\u2019s action without proof such as this, so I realize what the case law has restricted me to on my review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Thus, while the court acknowledged that it was restricted in its consideration of the additional evidence, it also recognized that it would have difficulty finding the Board\u2019s decision to be arbitrary without considering the other application. Given the district court\u2019s final finding that the Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, we find that the district court\u2019s inclusion of the evidence was prejudicial because it affected the outcome of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">C. The Board\u2019s decision was valid under I.C. \u00a7 67-5279 because it was supported by substantial evidence and it did not prejudice a substantial right of Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Kootenai County argues that the district court erred in finding the decision of the Board to be arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion because there was substantial and undisputed evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s finding that Respondents failed to establish that the granting of the variances would not be in conflict with the public interest. Kootenai County further contends that no substantial rights were prejudiced as a result of the Board\u2019s decision. In addition, Kootenai County points to error at the district court level in substituting the court\u2019s judgment for that of the Board, ordering that the variances be granted and only remanding for a determination of extent, and awarding attorney fees to Respondents. However, Respondents contend that not only did the district court not err on any of these issues, but the decision of the Board was also made upon unlawful procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">All of these issues are addressed under I.C. \u00a7 67-5279, and will thus be discussed in context of that statute. A party appealing a county board of commissioners\u2019 decision must first show that the board \u201cerred in a manner specified in Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5279(3), and then it must show that a substantial right has been prejudiced.\u201d <em>Lane Ranch P\u2019ship v. City of Sun Valley, </em>144 Idaho 584, 590, 166 P.3d 374, 380 (2007). In light of this analysis, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and affirm the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">1. The Board\u2019s decision was based on substantial evidence and was within its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">In reviewing the district court, this Court examines the county board of commissioners\u2019 record independently of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Marcia T. Turner, L.L.C. v. City of Twin Falls, </em>144 Idaho 203, 207, 159 P.3d 840, 844 (2007). A reviewing court must affirm the county board of commissioners\u2019 action unless the board\u2019s decision (a) violates statutory or constitutional provisions; (b) exceeds the statutory authority of the board; (c) is made upon unlawful procedure; (d) is not supported by substantial evidence in the record; or (e) is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 208, 159 P.3d at 845; I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">The approval or denial of a variance request is within the discretion of the county board of commissioners, subject to the requirements of I.C. \u00a7 67-5279. <em>See </em>I.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 67-6516, 6519. The applicant must prove to the board that he will suffer \u201cundue hardship because of characteristics of the site and that the variance is not in conflict with the public interest.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-6516. There is a strong presumption in favor of the validity of the actions of county boards of commissioners in interpreting and applying their own ordinances. <em>Sanders Orchard v. Gem County, </em>137 Idaho 695, 698, 52 P.3d 840, 843 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Furthermore, when analyzing a county board of commissioners\u2019 decision to determine if it was supported by substantial evidence pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3)(d), this Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the board regarding the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. <em>Id. </em>The county board of commissioners\u2019 factual determinations are binding on the reviewing court, even where there is conflicting evidence, so long as the determinations are supported by substantial and competent evidence. <em>Lane Ranch P\u2019ship v. City of Sun Valley, </em>144 Idaho 584, 590, 166 P.3d 374, 380 (2007). Substantial and competent evidence is \u201crelevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Lamar Corp. v. City of Twin Falls, </em>133 Idaho 36, 43, 981 P.2d 1146, 1153 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In <em>Lane Ranch, </em>this Court found that the evidence did not support the city\u2019s finding that \u201cchang[ing] the Zoning District designation for the Subject Property from OR-1 to RA would require amending the Annexation Agreement,\u201d because the Agreement did not require amendment. 144 Idaho at 590-91, 166 P.3d at 380-81. The Court found that it was impossible to tell how much the city had relied on that mistaken interpretation in its denial of the zoning applications. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>Sanders Orchard v. Gem County, </em>137 Idaho 695, 52 P.3d 840 (2002), this Court found that a county board of commissioners\u2019 finding that sewer and water lines would likely be extended to the area of a proposed subdivision in the foreseeable future was unsupported by substantial evidence in the record. In <em>Sanders, </em>there was no oral testimony or evidence submitted indicating that the sewer and water lines would be extended to that area. <em>Id. </em>at 702-03, 52 P.3d at 846-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The Board\u2019s findings here were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">5.01 The granting of the variance requested in this application would not be in conformance with Kootenai County Zoning Ordinance No. 348, Section 30.03, Section 30.02 and Idaho Code \u00a7 67-6516. The evidence presented regarding the Applicants\u2019 inability to construct structures on the steep topography of the subject parcel does show that an undue hardship exists. However, this request fails to meet the requirement of public interest and the intent of the zoning ordinance, specifically Section 30.03(d). The issuance of variances that not only encroach into the required setback but also the lakebed is not in the public interest and would allow a benefit that is not afforded to other property owners fronting Coeur d\u2019Alene Lake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">5.02 The granting of the variance requested in this application does not meet the requirements of Idaho Code \u00a7 67-6516 because it would serve to legitimize the Applicants\u2019 construction of decks without required building permits, which would be considered a special privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">5.03 The requested variance does not conform to Kootenai County Zoning Ordinance No. 348 and Idaho Code \u00a7 67-6516 because the requested variance is not necessary to accommodate the recreational use of the property and would be detrimental to surrounding properties and the public welfare if zero setbacks and lake encroachments were to be allowed, even by special permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Unlike in <em>Sanders </em>and <em>Lane Ranch, </em>the Board here was faced with granting variances to individuals who had already violated the county ordinances by building without first getting approval. In addition, <em>Sanders </em>and <em>Lane Ranch </em>dealt with factual findings by the agencies on which no oral testimony or evidence was submitted. The Board\u2019s findings here were based upon substantial evidence in the record, and therefore must be upheld on review under I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">Pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 67-6516, the burden is on Respondents to show that the variance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>would not be in conflict with the public interest. The Board focused its questioning of Respondents on why Respondents had believed they could build the decks in violation of the existing county ordinances requiring setbacks and building permits. In issuing its decision, the Board emphasized the fact that Respondents had not first gotten permission for the decks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">Commissioner Brodie: It\u2019s ugly. I mean, the bottom line is, I, I feel very, very sorry for each and every one of you for being allowed to believe, number one, it was a buildable lot, that you could do something other than enjoy a dock lot, which is, I think exactly what you have. Regardless of that, the requirement is, you build within setbacks and you get a permit first.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Commissioner Currie then reiterated that Respondents \u201cshould have done your ... due diligence and your homework and your process.\u201d This was the Board\u2019s focus throughout the proceedings: \u201cI guess the concern, of course, is no permit. Here they are, I mean, it set a precedent, more or less, and, um, it\u2019s easier to beg forgiveness than to get permission, so it puts us in a pretty tough spot.\u201d The Board was clearly concerned with legitimizing the construction of structures that are in clear violation of county ordinances, and Respondents offered little to alleviate this concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Respondents did submit comment sheets from the public that were either in support of the variances, or neutral. In addition, Respondents testified that the concerns that the Department of Lands and the Army Corps of Engineers had expressed with the structures had been complied with; therefore, there was no longer any other agency interests in the matter. However, the November 22, 2005 letter from the Army Corps of Engineers indicated that, while the concrete footings were \u201cnot causing any discernable adverse effects on the aquatic environment,\u201d the rock fill and concrete footings were \u201cnot authorized and may not be maintained.\u201d The Board heard this evidence and determined that granting the variances on these preexisting structures would not be in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The Board acted well within its authority and discretion in refusing to grant variance requests after Respondents had violated Zoning Ordinances \u00a7\u00a7 8.09 and 28.02 by building within the required setback areas without building permits. Kootenai County Zoning Ordinance No. 348, Section 30.03 requires the Board to find that the \u201cgranting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Zoning Ordinance, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.\u201d This ordinance is focused on ensuring that variances do not conflict with the public welfare, while making reasonable use of the land, and it gives the Board the discretion to determine what is in the public interest. It is well within the Board\u2019s discretion to determine that allowing individuals to violate county ordinances by constructing structures that \u201cencroach not only into the required setback but also the lakebed\u201d would be detrimental to the public welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">In addition, the Board was clearly concerned that Respondents were not making reasonable use of their land. Commissioner Johnson stated that allowing individuals to construct decks that protrude over the water on properties that were purchased as dock lots was problematic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">When you purchased the property, so you purchased a piece of property that was at a value that would be much less, knowing that it was a dock lot.... History provides us with the properties on that lake, on that side of the lake, they ,are non-aceessible. Everybody knew it for years and years and years. When folks were buying them for a dock lot. They knew they could put a dock in, tie their boat up, and still have, be on the water. That is why the values are a lot less.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">In addition, Commissioner Brodie commented on the fact that Respondents focused a great deal in their testimony on the topography of the properties and how steep the land was, but all of this was known to Respondents when they originally purchased the properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Finally, the Board\u2019s decision was made upon lawful procedure. When the Board had questions concerning whether the properties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>were classified as buildable or non-buildable, it reopened the proceedings to allow Respondents to view the exhibits regarding the tax assessments and then offer rebuttal. There is no indication that the Board based its decision on this additional information. Instead, it focused on its concern that granting variances for structures built in violation of existing zoning ordinances was not in the public interest. Therefore, we find that the Board\u2019s decision was valid pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3), and thus the district court\u2019s remand was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">2. The Board\u2019s decision did not prejudice a substantial right of Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Finally, even if the Board\u2019s decision had not been based on substantial evidence or was otherwise invalid under I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3), I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(4) states that \u201cMot-withstanding the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, agency action shall be affirmed unless substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced.\u201d If the applicant has been deprived of a \u201cfull and fair evaluation of its applications\u201d remand is appropriate. <em>Lane Ranch P\u2019ship v. City of Sun Valley, </em>144 Idaho 584, 591, 166 P.3d 374, 381 (2007); <em>see also Sanders Orchard v. Gem County, </em>137 Idaho 695, 52 P.3d 840 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Denial of Respondents\u2019 variance requests in this case does not deprive them of any substantial right. Respondents were not making lawful use of their properties when they built within the setback areas without first receiving a variance or building permit. In addition, even with the denial of the variance requests, Respondents are still able to use their property as permitted under state laws and regulations and county ordinances \u2014 all of which were in effect when Respondents purchased their properties. Respondents are not entitled to the granting of variances; instead, variances are issued upon the discretion of the Board. They are still able to put their property to reasonable use by using and enjoying a dock on Coeur d\u2019Alene Lake, so no substantial rights have been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">D. Attorney fees were not properly awarded to Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117 allows the court to award attorney fees and other expenses when a party acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law. <em>Euclid Ave. Trust v. City of Boise, </em>146 Idaho 306, 310, 193 P.3d 853, 857 (2008). Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">Unless otherwise provided by statute, in any administrative or civil judicial proceeding involving as adverse parties a state agency, a city, a county or other taxing district and a person, the court shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, witness fees and reasonable expenses, if the court finds that the party against whom the judgment is rendered acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiW\">\u201cTypically, in analyzing an award of fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117, this Court has looked to determine whether there was no authority at all for the agency\u2019s actions....\u201d <em>Ralph Naylor Farms, L.L.C. v. Latah County, </em>144 Idaho 806, 809, 172 P.3d 1081, 1084 (2007); <em>see also Fischer v. City of Ketchum, </em>141 Idaho 349, 356, 109 P.3d 1091, 1098 (2005) (\u201cWhere an agency has no authority to take a particular action, it acts without a reasonable basis in fact or law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">The Board was not acting outside the scope of its authority when it denied Respondents\u2019 variance requests. In addition, Respondents are no longer the prevailing parties. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">We vacate the district court\u2019s order reversing and remanding this matter to the Kootenai County Board of Commissioners, and affirm the Board\u2019s decision. We also reverse the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Respondents.</p>\n<judges id=\"b308-13\">Justices J. JONES, W.
