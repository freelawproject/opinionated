Jerome County, </em>145 Idaho 630, 181 P.3d 1238 (2008), and <em>Highlands Development Corp. v. City of Boise, </em>145 Idaho 958, 188 P.3d 900 (2008): (1) amendment to a repealed county comprehensive plan map, (2) <em>sua sponte </em>amendment to a county comprehensive plan map through \u201cjudicial notice,\u201d and/or (3) approval of a conditional rezone and corresponding development agreement. Appellants Kirby and Cheryl Vickers, husband and wife (collectively the Vickers), appeal from the district court\u2019s order affirming various land use decisions rendered by Respondent Canyon County Board of Commissioners (Board) in response to Intervenor/Respondent Edward Savala\u2019s application for a comprehensive plan map change, a conditional rezone, and a development agreement for his property. We vacate that part of the district court\u2019s order affirming the Board\u2019s amendments to the 1995 Comprehensive Plan Map and the 2010 Comprehensive Plan Map, holding that the Vickers failed to provide a statutory basis for judicial review of either amendment. We affirm that part of the district court\u2019s order affirming the Board\u2019s order for a conditional rezone of Savala\u2019s property, holding that the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone and corresponding Development Agreement was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-15\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b460-16\">Savala is the owner of a parcel of property approximately 8.09 acres in size located in Canyon County in an \u201cA\u201d (Agricultural) zone. Savala seeks to locate a medical and dental clinic on his property, as well as to promote other commercial uses such as building a service station/convenience store, a restau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>rant, and a wine store/wine tasting room. In April of 2005, Savala submitted an application with the P <em>&amp; </em>Z Commission requesting: (1) a comprehensive plan map change, (2) a conditional rezone of his property from an \u201cA\u201d (Agricultural) zone to a \u201cC-2\u201d (Community Commercial) zone, and (3) approval of a development agreement. A public hearing was held on the application on May 19, 2005. On June 8, 2005, the P &amp; Z Commission recommended that the Board deny Savala\u2019s application in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Savala then requested the Board to review his application. The Board scheduled public hearings on the application for October 25 and October 27, 2005. The October 27 hearing was scheduled in anticipation of the Board\u2019s approval of Savala\u2019s request to amend the comprehensive plan map. The approval would constitute a \u201cmaterial change\u201d from the P &amp; Z Commission\u2019s recommendation, and, therefore require a second hearing on the amendment under Idaho Code \u00a7 67-6509. The Board sent notice of the hearings to property owners within three-fourths of a mile of the Savala property and provided notice to the rest of the public through posting and publication. The notice provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN, that the Canyon County Board of Commissioners is scheduled to hold a public hearing on a request by Edward Savala for a Comprehensive Plan Map Change from an Agricultural designation to a Community Commercial designation and a Conditional Rezone of approximately 8.09 acres from \u201cA\u201d (Agricultural) zone to a \u201cC-2\u201d (Community Commercial) zone. Also requested is approval of a Development Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">On October 20, 2005, in a separate action, the Commissioners adopted Resolution No. 05-229. The resolution repealed all prior comprehensive plans, including the 1995 Canyon County Comprehensive Plan (1995 Plan) that was in place at the time Savala filed his application, and adopted the 2010 Canyon County Comprehensive Plan (2010 Plan). The resolution contained no savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The first public hearing on Savala\u2019s application was held on October 25, 2005. During this hearing, questions were raised by both Savala\u2019s counsel and the Vickers\u2019 counsel as to whether the 1995 Plan or the 2010 Plan applied to the application. The Board ultimately decided that the 1995 Plan was the plan to be applied since it was the plan in place at the time Savala filed his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Due to the volume of public comment, the first public hearing was continued to October 27, 2005, which was the date previously scheduled for the second public hearing on the amendment. At the close of the October 27 hearing, the Board, by a 2-1 vote, granted Savala\u2019s request to amend the 1995 Plan. Commissioner Robert Vasquez, the no vote in the split decision, chose to recuse himself from any further deliberations on Savala\u2019s application, explaining he could not impose something that he disagreed with. Because the Board\u2019s decision to amend the 1995 Plan constituted a material change from the P &amp; Z Commission\u2019s recommendation, the Board was required to hold a second public hearing on the amendment pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 67-6509. Hearings were scheduled for March 14 and March 31, 2006, and notice was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">The second public hearing on Savala\u2019s application was commenced on March 14, 2006. Again, due to the volume of public comments, the hearing was continued to March 31, 2006. At the close of the second hearing, the two remaining commissioners approved a motion to amend the repealed 1995 Plan. The two commissioners also approved Savala\u2019s request for a conditional rezone of his property. Because the commissioners\u2019 approval of the conditional rezone once again overturned a recommendation of the P &amp; Z Commission, thus constituting a material change, a second public hearing on the conditional rezone was required under I.C. \u00a7 67-6509.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">The third and final public hearing on Savala\u2019s application was commenced immediately following the continuation of the second on March 31, 2006. At the close of the third hearing, the two commissioners approved the conditional rezone, along with a corresponding Development Agreement as required by section 07-06-07(2) of Canyon County Ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>nance No. 05-002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 4, 2006, the Board issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law, signed the zoning ordinance, and executed the Development Agreement. Although Savala did not request an amendment to the 2010 Plan, the Board took \u201cjudicial notice\u201d that one was necessary and amended the 2010 Plan without providing notice or a public hearing as required by I.C. \u00a7 67-6509.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">On June 1, 2006, the Vickers, who are neighboring landowners to Savala\u2019s property,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed a petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s orders. The district court issued an order affirming the Board\u2019s decisions in all respects. The Vickers then appealed to this Court. In response, the Board filed a motion to dismiss based on this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Giltner Dairy, LLC v. Jerome County (Giltner Dairy), </em>145 Idaho 630, 181 P.3d 1238 (2008), and <em>Highlands Development Corp. v. City of Boise (Highlands), </em>145 Idaho 958, 188 P.3d 900 (2008), which were released after the district court issued it\u2019s decision. In Giltner Dairy we held that there is no statutory right to judicial review of a county board of commissioners\u2019 decision whether or not to amend a comprehensive plan map, 145 Idaho at 633, 181 P.3d at 1241; and in Highlands we held that there is not statutory right to judicial review of a county board of commissioners\u2019 decision whether or not to approve a request for an annexation/initial zoning of land. 145 Idaho at 962, 188 P.3d at 904. The Board argued that Giltner Dairy is dispositive of the issue regarding the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s amendments to the 1995 Plan and the 2010 Plan. The Board also argued that the Court has no jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone under Highlands since a conditional rezone is not a \u201cpermit authorizing the development,\u201d which is a prerequisite for judicial review under the statute. Savala also filed a motion for fees and costs should the appeal be dismissed, arguing the Vickers had pursued the appeal without a reasonable basis in fact or law based on this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Giltner Dairy </em>and <em>Highlands. </em>The Vickers filed a response brief, arguing that this case is distinguishable from the actions disposed of in <em>Giltner Dairy </em>and <em>Highlands </em>since Savala was seeking affirmative approval of a course of development in the form of a conditional rezone and development agreement that would allow him to begin development on his project immediately upon approval. On September 3, 2008, this Court issued an order denying the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss and Savala\u2019s motion for attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">This appeal involves land use decisions rendered by a county board of commissioners, which are local government actions. Rule 84(a)(1) of the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure sets forth that the \u201cactions of a local government, its officers or its units are not subject to judicial review unless expressly authorized by statute.\u201d Although the Idaho Administrative Procedures Act (IAPA) provides for judicial review of agency actions, this Court has held that a county board of commissioners does not fall within the definition of \u201cagency\u201d for purposes of applying IAPA. <em>Petersen v. Franklin County, </em>130 Idaho 176, 182, 938 P.2d 1214, 1220 (1997). \u201cAbsent a statute invoking the IAPA\u2019s judicial review provisions, [the Board\u2019s] actions may not be reviewed under the IAPA.\u201d <em>Gibson v. Ada County Sheriff\u2019s Dept., </em>139 Idaho 5, 7-8, 72 P.3d 845, 847-48 (2003). The Local Land Use and Planning Act (LLUPA) authorizes judicial review under the standard set forth in IAPA for some county-level land use decisions; I.C. \u00a7 67-6521(1)(d); however, judicial review is limited to situations in which a permit authorizing the development is at issue. <em>Giltner Dairy, </em>145 Idaho at 632-33, 181 P.3d at 1240-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">In cases where LLUPA authorizes judicial review of a county-level land use decision, we follow the standard of review set forth in IAPA. In a subsequent appeal from the district court\u2019s decision where the district court was acting in its appellate capacity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>under IAPA, this Court reviews the district court directly. <em>See Galli v. Idaho County, </em>146 Idaho 155, 158, 191 P.3d 233, 236 (2008). In reviewing the district court, we examine the county board of commissioners\u2019 findings to determine if they are supported by substantial and competent evidence. <em>See id. </em>\u201cThe court will not substitute its judgment for that of the [board] on questions of fact.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(1). The district court must affirm the board\u2019s action unless the court determines that the board\u2019s findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: \u201c(a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (c) made upon unlawful procedure; (d) not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole; or (e) arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3). Regardless of whether the county board of commissioners\u2019 action meets the standard set forth in Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5279(3), the district court must affirm the board\u2019s action \u201cunless substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(4). It is the burden of the party contesting the board\u2019s action, here the Vickers, to first illustrate how the board erred in a manner specified under I.C. \u00a7 67-5279, and then establish that a substantial right has been prejudiced. <em>See Druffel v. State, Dept. of Transp., </em>136 Idaho 853, 855, 41 P.3d 739, 741 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">A. The Board\u2019s Amendment to the Repealed 1995 Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">First, the Vickers argue that the Board erred in amending the 1995 Plan Map since the Board had previously repealed the 1995 Plan. The Vickers argue that amending a repealed act is a legal nullity and, therefore, the Board exceeded its legal authority when it amended the repealed 1995 Plan. The respondents, however, argue there is no statutory right to judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision to amend the 1995 Plan under this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Giltner Dairy, </em>and even if there was, the Vickers did not question the Board\u2019s legal authority to amend a repealed plan during the hearings, thus failing to preserve the issue for appeal. We agree with the respondents that the Vickers have failed to provide a statutory basis for judicial review of the Board\u2019s amendment to the 1995 Plan Map under the repealed 1995 Plan. As such, there is no need for us to go on to consider whether the Vickers preserved the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">In <em>Giltner Dairy, </em>145 Idaho 630, 181 P.3d 1238 (2008), this Court recently addressed whether a party is entitled to judicial review of a county board of commissioners\u2019 decision regarding an amendment to a county comprehensive plan map. We held that since a county board of commissioners does not fall under the definition of \u201cagency,\u201d IAPA does not apply. 145 Idaho at 632, 181 P.3d at 1240. This Court further held that a request to change the comprehensive plan map does not authorize development and, therefore, is not an application for \u201ca permit authorizing the development\u201d under I.C. \u00a7 67-6521(1)(a). <em>See id. </em>at 633, 181 P.3d at 1241. Thus, we determined that section 67-6521(1)(d) of LLUPA, which provides the statutory right to judicial review for an \u201caffected person\u201d defined as \u201cone having an interest in real property which may be adversely affected by the issuance or denial of a permit authorizing the development,\u201d does not provide a basis for judicial review of a county\u2019s amendment to its comprehensive plan. <em>Id. </em>(quoting I.C. \u00a7 67-6521(1)(a)). Therefore, this Court held that there is no statutory right to judicial review of a county\u2019s decision to amend its comprehensive plan map. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Likewise, the Vickers do not have a statutory right to judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision to amend the 1995 Plan Map. The Vickers filed their appeal for judicial review based on I.C. \u00a7 67-6521 (LLU-PA), I.C. \u00a7 67-5270 <em>et seq. </em>(IAPA), and I.R.C.P. 84. As set forth by this Court in <em>Giltner Dairy, </em>there is no statutory right to review a county\u2019s decision to amend its comprehensive plan map under LLUPA. 145 Idaho at 633, 181 P.3d at 1241. As such, the Vickers have failed to provide an independent statutory basis that would enable us to review the Board\u2019s decision under the standard set forth in IAPA. <em>See Gibson v. Ada County Sheriff's Dept., </em>139 Idaho 5, 7-8, 72 P.3d 845, 847-48 (2003). Because the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>court did not have jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s amendment to the repealed 1995 Plan Map, we vacate that part of the district court\u2019s order affirming the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">B. The Boards Amendment to the 2010 Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Next, the Vickers argue that the Board violated their due process rights by taking \u201cjudicial notice\u201d that an amendment to the 2010 Plan Map was necessary, and in doing so bypassed the notice and hearing requirements under I.C. \u00a7 67-6509. The Board, however, argues that the amendment to the 2010 Plan Map was merely an administrative act designed to appropriately reflect the consequences of the change to the 1995 Plan Map and, therefore, should not be overturned. We hold that the Vickers have failed to point to a statute authorizing judicial review of the of the Board\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>amendment to the 2010 Plan Map. Consequently, we are without jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Idaho Code \u00a7 67-6509, which governs adoption, amendment, and repeal of a county comprehensive plan, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">(a) The planning or planning and zoning commission, prior to recommending the plan, amendment, or repeal of the plan to the governing board, shall conduct at least one (1) public hearing in which interested persons shall have an opportunity to be heard.... Following the commission hearing, if the commission recommends a material change to the proposed amendment to the plan which was considered at the hearing, it shall give notice of its proposed recommendation and conduct another public hearing concerning the matter if the governing board will not conduct a subsequent public hearing concerning the proposed amendment. If the governing board will conduct a subsequent public hearing, notice of the planning and zoning commission recommendation shall be included in the notice of public hearing provided by the governing board....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">(b) The governing board, as provided by local ordinance, prior to adoption, amendment, or repeal of the plan, may conduct at least one (1) public hearing, in addition to the public hearing(s) conducted by the commission, using the same notice and hearing procedures as the commission. The governing board shall not hold a public hearing, give notice of a proposed hearing, nor take action upon the plan, amendments, or repeal until recommendations have been received from the commission. Following consideration by the governing board, if the governing board makes a material change in the recommendation or alternative options contained in the recommendation by the commission concerning adoption, amendment or repeal of a plan, further notice and hearing shall be provided before the governing board adopts, amends or repeals the plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\">(d) Any person may petition the commission or, in absence of a commission, the governing board, for a plan amendment at any time. The commission may recommend amendments to the land use map component of the comprehensive plan to the governing board not more frequently than once every six (6) months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">The statute first directs the P &amp; Z Commission to provide notice and a public hearing on the applicant\u2019s request for an amendment to the county comprehensive plan map. After the P &amp; Z Commission issues its recommendation, the statute then requires that the Board provide notice and a second public hearing on the amendment. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 67-6509(a)-(b). If the Board declines to follow the P &amp; Z Commission\u2019s recommendation, the Board is required to provide notice of and hold a third and final hearing on the amendment. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 67-6509(b). The statute also imposes a limitation that the P &amp; Z Commission may only recommend amendments to the county comprehensive plan map only once every six months. I.C. \u00a7 67-6509(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">Although the Vickers are correct that the Board bypassed at least two stages of due process requirements under I.C. \u00a7 67-6509 in amending the 2010 Plan Map through self-imposed \u201cjudicial notice,\u201d they have failed to point to a statute authorizing judicial review of the Board\u2019s amendment. The Vickers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>filed their appeal under I.C. \u00a7 67-6521 (LLUPA), I.C. \u00a7 67-5270 (IAPA), and I.R.C.P. 84. Because LLUPA does not provide an independent statutory basis for the Court to review the Board\u2019s amendment, we may not review the Vickers\u2019 procedural due process violation claim related to the same. Likewise, the district court did not have jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s amendment to the 2010 Plan. Therefore, we vacate that part of the district court\u2019s order affirming the Board\u2019s amendment to the 2010 Plan Map.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">C. The Board\u2019s Approval of Savala\u2019s Request for a Conditional Rezone and Corresponding Development Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Finally, the Vickers attribute error to the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone of Savala\u2019s property. First, the Vickers argue that the Board committed an illegal type two spot zoning. Alternatively, the Vickers argue that the Board committed an arbitrary abuse of discretion by finding the proposed use (1) was harmonious with the 1995 Plan, (2) would not be injurious to other property in the immediate vicinity, and (3) would not change the essential character of the area. The respondents argue that there is no statutory right to judicial review of the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone under this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Highlands, </em>and even if there was, the Board\u2019s decision is well-supported by evidence in the record and should not be overturned. We hold the Vickers have a statutory right to judicial review of the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone and corresponding development agreement, but nevertheless uphold the Board\u2019s approval because it was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">1. <em>The Vickers have a statutory right to judicial review of the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone of Savala\u2019s property and corresponding Development Agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Before considering the Vickers\u2019 arguments, the Court must determine whether it is free to review the Board\u2019s decision to approve the conditional rezone of Savala\u2019s property. As aforementioned, the Vickers filed their appeal for judicial review based on I.C. \u00a7 67-6521 (LLUPA), I.C. \u00a7 67-5270 <em>et seq. </em>(IAPA), and I.R.C.P. 84. Under I.R.C.P. 84(a)(1), there must be a statute authoring judicial review of county actions. Absent a statute invoking IAPA\u2019s judicial review provisions, local government actions may not be reviewed under IAPA. <em>Gibson v. Ada County Sheriff's Dept., </em>139 Idaho 5, 7-8, 72 P.3d 845, 847-48 (2003). Although LLU-PA provides the right to judicial review, the person must be an \u201caffected person aggrieved by a decision.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-6521(1)(d). The statute defines an \u201caffected person\u201d as \u201cone having an interest in real property which may be adversely affected by the issuance or denial of a permit authorizing the development.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-6521(1)(a). Thus, this Court must determine whether the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone constitutes a \u201cpermit authorizing the development\u201d under I.C. \u00a7 67-6521(1)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">Section 07-06-07 of Canyon County Ordinance (CCO) No. 05-002 governs conditional rezones. The term \u201cconditional rezone\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he rezoning of land with conditions imposed so that if the conditions are not complied with, the rezone may be withdrawn and the land revert back to its former zoning classification.\u201d CCO No. 05-002, section 07-02-03. Under section 07-06-07, any conditions imposed on the property in accordance with the conditional rezone must be incorporated into a development agreement. <em>Id. </em>at section 07-06-07(2). The ordinance requires that the applicant execute a written development agreement to implement and be bound by any such condition, and no final conditional rezone action will be taken until such development agreement is recorded in the office of the county recorder. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the development agreement is an integral part of a conditional rezone in Canyon County.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Once the applicant meets the conditions set forth in the development agreement, the preliminary conditional rezoning approval becomes final and the property is rezoned on the county rezoning map. <em>Id. </em>at section 07-06-07(5). Even though the developer must still obtain the necessary permits from various agencies in order to begin any physical changes, there is no further action required by the Board before development may commence. In other words, the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone and corresponding development agreement is a green light for development to begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Canyon County Ordinance No. 05-002 also provides for conditional use permits. The term \u201cconditional use\u201d is defined under section 07-02-03 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">A use that would not be appropriate generally or without restriction throughout the zoning district but which, if regulated, would not be detrimental to public health, safety, or general welfare. The term \u201cconditional use\u201d shall mean a use or occupancy of a structure, or use of land, permitted only upon the issuance of a conditional use permit and subject to the limitations and conditions specified therein. Conditional uses require a permit as provided for in Idaho Code \u201967-6512 and this ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2v\">Although there are notable differences for why an applicant would pursue a conditional use permit versus a conditional rezone \u2014 i.e., a conditional use permit is tailored more toward specific uses as compared to a conditional rezone and a conditional use permit expires within three years if not commenced or five years if not completed whereas there is no set expiration for a conditional rezone\u2014 the two are functionally equivalent. Both ultimately allow nonconforming uses to occur on the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">We find it necessary to clarify two statements listed above. First, although a conditional use permit and a conditional rezone are generally not functional equivalents, they are in this case. The appeal concerns the Board\u2019s approval of a conditional rezone and corresponding development agreement in accordance with Canyon County Ordinance 05-002. As set forth above, if the Board determines th\u00e1t conditions are necessary to restrict the use of the rezoned property less than the full use allowed under the requested rezone, then the applicant must execute a written development agreement to implement and be bound by such conditions. CCO 05-002, section 07-06-07. Here, there were conditions attached to the conditional rezone; accordingly, the Development Agreement is integrally tied to our analysis of whether the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone constitutes a \u201cpermit authorizing the development\u201d under LLUPA. I.C. \u00a7 67-6521(1)(a). In other words, the issue presented on appeal is whether the end result of the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone and corresponding Development Agreement is a permit authorizing the development. Because the end result of the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone and corresponding Development Agreement is to authorize the development without further approval from the Board, the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone and corresponding Development Agreement is the functional equivalent of an approval of a conditional use permit, which as set forth below is a \u201cpermit authorizing the development.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-6521(1)(a). In fact, counsel for the Board admitted during oral argument that based on the end results, a conditional use permit and a conditional rezone are functionally equivalent in Canyon County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In sum, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the statement that a conditional use permit and a conditional rezone are functional equivalents may be incorrect in the general sense, it is correct under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We also seek to clarify our statement that both a conditional use permit and a conditional rezone ultimately allow nonconforming uses to occur on the subject property. Technically, a conditional rezone does not allow nonconforming uses to occur on the subject property since the land classification changes. This technicality aside, the point we are trying to make is that both a conditional use permit and a conditional rezone coupled with a corresponding development agreement ultimately allow the applicant to use the subject property in a manner that would have not been permitted before the issuance of the conditional use permit or before the approval of the conditional rezone, and in a manner differently than the surrounding property owners are currently permitted to use their property, assuming that no conditional use permits or conditional rezones have been approved in respect to their property as well. Thus, the end result of a conditional use permit as well as a conditional rezone coupled with a development agreement is to allow land to be used in a way that was both nonconforming and unpermitted before the Board\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Returning to the facts at hand, Savala requested a conditional rezone from an A (Agricultural) zone to a C-2 (Community Commercial) zone. The Board preliminarily approved Savalas request and imposed various conditions on his property, which included the installation of drinking water and community waste systems; the improvement and paving of a private access road; landscaping, featuring a mix of trees and shrubs; the creation of natural material fence or similar barrier no less than four feet tall on the southern border of the property; and the paving of a parking lot. These conditions were incorporated into the Development Agreement, under which Savala agreed to comply with the conditions of the conditional rezone. The Development Agreement did not contain any standards under which the Board was to determine whether or not the conditions had been met. Once Savala fully complied with these conditions, the preliminary conditional rezone would become final and his property would be rezoned to C-2. At such time, without further approval from the Board, Savala could begin construction of the medical and dental clinics and begin promoting other commercial uses of his property once obtaining the necessary permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Therefore, we hold that the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone of Savala\u2019s property and corresponding Development Agreement is \u201ca permit authorizing the development\u201d under LLUPA that is subject to review by this Court pursuant to the standard set forth in IAPA. Although the word \u201cpermit\u201d is not defined under LLUPA, the Act does make other references to the term. For example, I.C. \u00a7 67-6517 refers to \u201ca permit as defined by this chapter,\u201d which acknowledges that what constitutes a permit is defined by the Act. Chapter 65 mentions various permits, including subdivision permits (I.C. \u00a7 67-6513), planned unit development permits (I.C. \u00a7 67-6515), variance permits (I.C. \u00a7 67-6516), building permits (I.C. \u00a7 67-6517), and \u2014 most importantly to this case \u2014 special use permits (I.C. \u00a7 67-6512). <em>See Giltner Dairy, LLC v. Jerome County, </em>145 Idaho 630, 633, 181 P.3d 1238, 1241 (2008). Although Canyon County employs the term \u201cconditional use permit\u201d rather than \u201cspecial use permit,\u201d the two can be used synonymously. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1434 (8th ed.2004). In fact, Canyon County requires that a permit be issued for a conditional use as provided by I.C. \u00a7 67-6512, which is the statutory provision governing special use permits. CCO No. 05-002, section 07-02-03. Idaho Code \u00a7 67-6512(a) also uses \u201cconditional use permit\u201d and \u201cspecial use permit\u201d interchangeably since the provision applies to \u201cspecial or conditional use permits.\u201d (Emphasis added). As set forth above, a conditional rezone and corresponding development agreement is the functional equivalent of a conditional use permit in Canyon County. Thus, it reasonably follows that since the Board\u2019s approval of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>conditional rezone and corresponding Development Agreement is the functional equivalent of a conditional use permit, which is in essence a special use permit, the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone and corresponding Development Agreement is \u201ca permit authorizing development\u201d under LLUPA. As such, we are statutorily authorized to review the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone and corresponding Development Agreement under LLUPA pursuant to the standard set forth in IAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">2. <em>The Board did not commit illegal type two spot zoning.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The Vickers argue that the Board committed an illegal type two spot zoning by singling out Savala\u2019s property for commercial use in the midst of an agricultural zoning district merely for Savala\u2019s private gain. However, the Board argues that we need not address the Vickers\u2019 claim of type two spot zoning because only type one spot zoning occurred in this case, which is valid. We find that the Board\u2019s factual determination that Savala\u2019s application for a conditional rezone complied with the 1995 Plan is supported by substantial, competent evidence and, therefore, agree with the Respondents that there is no need to address the Vickers\u2019 claim of type two spot zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u201cA claim of \u2018spot zoning\u2019 is essentially an argument the change in zoning is not in accord with the comprehensive plan.\u201d <em>Evans v. Teton County, </em>139 Idaho 71, 76, 73 P.3d 84, 89 (2003). In <em>Evans, </em>this Court clarified that there are two types of spot zoning. The first type, referred to as type one spot zoning, \u201cmay simply refer to a rezoning of property for a use prohibited by the original zoning classification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe test for whether [type one spot zoning] is valid is whether the zone change is in accord with the comprehensive plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77, 73 P.3d at 90. \u201c[T]he question of whether a zoning ordinance is \u2018in accordance with\u2019 the comprehensive plan is a factual question which can be overturned only where the factual findings are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Friends of Farm to Market v. Valley County, </em>137 Idaho 192, 200, 46 P.3d 9, 17 (2002). The second type, referred to as type two spot zoning, \u201crefers to a zone change that singles out a parcel of land for use inconsistent with the permitted use in the rest of the zoning district for the benefit of an individual property owner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">Thus, the first step in our analysis is to decide whether the conditional rezone is in accordance with the county comprehensive plan. In order to answer this question, we must determine which comprehensive plan applies. The Vickers argue that because it is a legal nullity to amend a repealed plan, the Board was required to apply the 1995 Plan without its amendment to the 1995 Plan Map. Generally, courts hold that a repealed act cannot be amended since an amendatory act alters, modifies, or adds to a prior statute. 1A Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 22:3 (6th ed.2000).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Without an act in place, there is nothing to amend. However, this principle is inapplicable when dealing with local land use decisions in this state as \u201cIdaho law is well established that an applicant\u2019s rights are determined by the ordinance in existence at the time of filing an application for the permit.\u201d <em>South Fork Coalition v. Bd. of Com\u2019rs of Bonneville County, </em>117 Idaho 857, 860-61, 792 P.2d 882, 885-86 (1990); <em>Cooper v. Bd. of County Comrs. of Ada County, </em>101 Idaho 407, 412, 614 P.2d 947, 952 (1980). The Court adopted this minority rule to prevent local authorities from delaying or withholding action on an application in order to change or enact a law to defeat the application. <em>See South Fork Coalition, </em>117 Idaho at 861, 792 P.2d at 886. In other words, this rule ensures that local authorities do not engage in arbitrary action <em>before </em>they render their decision on an application. The policy behind this rule is independent of whether the local authorities ultimately grant an applicants request(s).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">Here, the 1995 Plan was in effect at the time Savala filed his application. Pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>to section 07-06-01(b) of CCO No. 05-002, Savala was entitled to apply for an amendment to the county comprehensive plan map. Thus, in applying our rule from <em>South Fork Coalition </em>to section 07-06-01(b), Savala had the right to have his request reviewed under the 1995 Plan, and hence the 1995 Plan Map. Savalas rights were set under the 1995 Plan. <em>See id. </em>We find no reason to alter this well-settled rule of law just because the Board later repealed the 1995 Plan in an unrelated action before granting Savalas request to amend the 1995 Plan Map. Therefore, we hold that the 1995 Plan with the 1995 Plan Map amendment applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">From the evidence in the record, we uphold the Board\u2019s determination that Savala\u2019s request for a conditional rezone of his property from an \u201cA\u201d (Agricultural) zone to a \u201cC-2\u201d (Community Commercial) zone is in accordance with the 1995 Plan as amended. The record reflects that the Board approved Savala\u2019s conditional rezone application based on the testimony of experts and citizens, both in favor and in opposition to Savala\u2019s request. The Board conducted a thorough analysis of the relevant components of the 1995 Plan,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> finding factors in favor, neutral, and in opposition to Savala\u2019s request. Ultimately, the Board determined the weight of the evidence supported the finding that the conditional rezone is in accordance with the 1995 Plan. This finding is supported by substantial, competent, although conflicting, evidence in the record and, therefore, must be affirmed. <em>See Friends of Farm to Market v. Valley County, </em>137 Idaho 192, 196, 46 P.3d 9, 13 (2002). Consequently, the Vickers\u2019 claim of spot zoning need not be addressed since the type one spot zoning that occurred in this ease is valid. <em>See Evans v. Teton County, </em>139 Idaho 71, 77, 73 P.3d 84, 90 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">3. <em>The Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone and corresponding Development Agreement was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">The Vickers also argue the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, and therefore should be overturned. In support of their argument, the Vickers point to three alleged errors surrounding the Board\u2019s approval. First, the Vickers argue that the rezone is not harmonious or in accordance with the 1995 Plan. Section 07-06-05 of CCO 05-002, which mirrors I.C. \u00a7 67-6511, sets forth the criteria the Board must evaluate when considering a zoning amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> One criterion is whether the zoning amendment will be harmonious and in accordance with the applicable comprehensive plan. CCO 05-002, section 07-06-05(A). The Vickers\u2019 argument regarding this criterion centers on the thirteen red dots marked on the 1995 Plan Map, which represent rural or commercial centers where community development is appropriate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, the Vickers argue that the Board stretched the meaning of the red dot immediately across Highway 55 from Savala\u2019s property as being a planning designation rather than recognizing preexisting community development. In support of their assertion, the Vickers cite to Ryan Cutler\u2019s testimony, an employee of the Canyon County Development Services Department. Mr. Cutler testified at the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>hearing that the red dot across the highway, nearly one-half mile away from Savala\u2019s property, designated and was related to the Huston Post Office. The Vickers also cite to their counsel\u2019s testimony that the purpose of the red dot likely corresponded to \u201cconditions that existed at the time that the map was prepared and that was the location of the post office,\u201d and that the Assistant Director of Canyon County Development Services Department had visited the area and confirmed that the red dot signified the Huston Post Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Before addressing this issue, we find it necessary to distinguish between a county comprehensive plan and a land use map, and to clarify what effect the Board\u2019s amendment to the 1995 Plan Map has on our determination of whether the rezone is harmonious and in accordance with the comprehensive plan. Under I.C. \u00a7 67-6508, the planning and zoning commission is required to prepare, implement, and review and update a county comprehensive plan. The plan is required to have the following fourteen components unless the plan specifies why a particular component is unnecessary: (1) property rights; (2) population; (3) school facilities and transportation; (4) economic development; (5) land use (including a land use map); (6) natural resources; (7) hazardous areas; (8) public services; facilities, and utilities; (9) transportation; (10) recreation; (11) special areas or sites; (12) housing; (13) community design; and (14) implementation. I.C. \u00a7 67-6508. Therefore, the land use map is merely one subpart of a component of the county comprehensive plan. <em>See Bone v. City of Lewiston, </em>107 Idaho 844, 849, n. 7, 693 P.2d 1046, 1051, n. 7 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In this case, Savala made a request to rezone his property in conjunction with his request to amend the 1995 Plan Map. When presented with a rezone request, the governing board must first determine whether the rezone would be \u201cin accordance\u201d with the policies set forth in the comprehensive plan. I.C. \u00a7 67-6511. In other words, it is not a requirement that the zoning ordinance mirror the comprehensive plan. <em>See Love v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Bingham County, </em>108 Idaho 728, 730, 701 P.2d 1293, 1295 (1985). In <em>Bone v. City of Lewiston, </em>107 Idaho 844, 693 P.2d 1046 (1984), we explained what a governing board must first do when reviewing a request for a rezone. We stated that the board must \u201cmake a factual inquiry into whether the requested zoning ordinance or amendment reflects the goals of, and takes into account those factors in, the comprehensive plan in light of the present factual circumstances surrounding the request.\u201d 107 Idaho at 850, 693 P.2d at 1052. This includes, in part, whether the applicant\u2019s request is in accordance with the land use map component of the plan. However, as set forth in Idaho Code \u00a7 67-6508(e), the land use map merely displays <em>\u201csuitable projected </em>land uses for the jurisdiction.\u201d (Emphasis added). \u201c[T]he land use map, in essence, is a goal or forecast of future development.\u201d <em>Bone, </em>107 Idaho at 850, 693 P.2d at 1052. \u201c[A][ ] land use map does not require a particular piece of property, as a matter of law, to be zoned exactly as it appears on the land use map.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Board\u2019s amendment to the 1995 Plan Map was not a necessary predicate to its approval of the conditional rezone even though Savala\u2019s property was zoned \u201cA\u201d (Agricultural) on the land use map. The Board could have found that the rezone was harmonious and in accordance with the 1995 Plan without it. The fact that the Board amended the 1995 Plan Map is evidence the Board determined that the conditional rezone was not in accordance with the 1995 Plan without the amendment to the land use map component. Therefore, we will pay more credence to the Vickers\u2019 contention that the Board misinterpreted the meaning of the red dot on the 1995 Plan Map.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">After reviewing the evidence in the record, we find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in determining that the conditional rezone is harmonious and in accordance with the amended 1995 Plan. Although the Vickers cite to testimony in their brief that supports their interpretation of the red dot at issue, there is also evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s interpretation of the red dot. Savala\u2019s counsel testified that the red dot indicates a \u201cC-2\u201d (Community Commercial) designation. In addition, Steve Fultz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>with the Caldwell Economic Development Council testified that the subject property is adjacent to land that was identified for commercial development in the 1995 Plan Map. Furthermore, the purpose of the county comprehensive plan map is to indicate \u201csuitable projected land uses for the jurisdiction.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-6508(e). In fact, the 1995 Plan, by its own language, states that the county plan map \u201cdesignates land use areas\u201d and that these designations \u201care general and are to be used for planning purposes.\u201d Thus, in light of these provisions and the testimony cited above, it was reasonable for the Board to interpret the red dot as being a planning designation. Therefore, we find that the Board\u2019s determination that the conditional rezone is harmonious and in accordance with the 1995 Plan as amended was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Second, the Vickers argue that the rezone will create a commercial strip mall in the midst of agricultural land, thereby injuring neighboring properties and changing the essential character of the area. Section 07-06-05(B) of CCO 05-002 requires that Board consider whether the proposed use will be injurious to other property in the immediate vicinity and/or will negatively change the essential character of the area. The Vickers claim the Board failed to give adequate weight to testimony in the record that the proposal will injure neighboring properties by negatively impacting the ability of neighboring agricultural properties to manage their crops through aerial spraying and by increasing traffic in the area, thus leading to additional safety concerns. The Vickers also contend that the Board approved the conditional rezone in spite of policies contained in the 1995 Plan stating that development activity should only be encouraged in incorporated cities and/or areas of city impact, and that agricultural land with \u201cbest suited\u201d or \u201cmoderately suited\u201d soil, such as Savala\u2019s property, should be protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">However, we are unable to find that the Board abused its discretion in determining that the conditional rezone will not be injurious to other property in the immediate vicinity and/or will not negatively change the essential character of the area. Charles Robinson, a licensed agronomist and crop advisor living approximately three miles from the subject property, testified that \u201ca development of this type will not have any adverse affects on surrounding agriculture.\u201d Mr. Robinson also testified that Savala\u2019s proposal would fit in well in the area and would not take agricultural ground out of production. In regard to traffic concerns, Mr. Robinson testified that the proposal would have little impact on agricultural traffic since nearby farmers use Pride Lane and the back roads and seldom use Highway 55. Furthermore, Savala testified that his proposal would include extensive landscaping as well as some fencing to buffer other uses, including agricultural uses. The Board gave weight to the fact that Savala agreed to exclude certain types of businesses from the development in an effort to lessen any adverse impact on the adjacent land owners. The Board also concluded that the proposal would not negatively change the essential character of the area since there was already commercial activity in the area, specifically that across Highway 55 from Savala\u2019s property, to the east of his property, and to the south around the corner from his property; and that due to its small size, the subject property is not considered economically viable agricultural land. Therefore, we find that the Board\u2019s determination was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The Vickers also attribute error to the Board\u2019s conclusion that the proposal created convenience. The Vickers argue that a standard of convenience will make any area with people living in it, despite its rural character and lifestyle, a future site for a strip mall. Although the Board found Savala\u2019s proposal would provide retail, food, and agricultural services more readily available and convenient to the surrounding agricultural industry, this was but one basis for the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone. The Board also determined that the proposal would bring 25 to 45 additional jobs to the area with estimated combined annual salary totaling approximately $1,000,000.00, and that development would include improvements to Highway 55 at the access point, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>such as a left turn bay and a right turn. Because the Vickers placed undue weight on the Board\u2019s finding of convenience, we find it unnecessary to address their policy argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Finally, the Vickers argue that the conditional rezone violates the purpose behind LLUPA to protect and preserve agricultural land against overdevelopment and incompatible uses. In support of their argument, the Vickers cite to I.C. \u00a7 67-6502, which states that the purposes behind LLU-PA include: \u201c(e) to encourage the protection of prime agricultural, forestry, and mining lands for the production of food, fiber and minerals; (f) to encourage urban and urban-type development within incorporated cities; and (g) to avoid undue concentration of population and overcrowding of land.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-6502(e)-(g). The Vickers argue that these purposes speak directly to the fears expressed in their testimony as well as in the testimony of others, including Doug Houston, who testified that the properties in the area \u201chave some of the best vineyards and orchards in the State of Idaho and it\u2019s something that we need to be proud of and we need to preserve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">However, LLUPA seeks to protect <em>prime </em>agricultural land. Although LLUPA does not define \u201cprime agricultural land,\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-6529 sets forth that \u201cagricultural land\u201d is to be defined by local ordinance or resolution. Section 07-02-03 of CCO 05-002 defines \u201cagriculture\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">Tilling of soil, pasturage, sod/turf farms, horticulture, aquaculture, viticulture, floriculture, raising crops directly from the soil, raising livestock, poultry, poultry products, dairy animals and dairy products, bee keeping or bee keeping products, fur animals, trees grown in row crop fashion, fruits of all kinds and their products, floral and ornamental and greenhouse products, including all uses customarily accessory and incidental thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\"><em>Webster\u2019s Dictionary </em>defines \u201cprime\u201d as \u201cfirst in excellence or importance: having the highest quality or value.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary </em>1801 (3d ed.1969). Here, the property at issue is not \u201cprime agriculture land.\u201d Mr. Robinson testified that the subject property has been planted with onion seed crop and a sweet corn seed crop but that yields were poor due to the alkaline soil. Mr. Robinson also testified that the proposal would \u201cnot take prime agricultural ground out of production.\u201d His testimony in no way indicates that Savala\u2019s property has high value for agricultural purposes, as that term is defined by Section 07-02-03 of CCO 05-002. Contrary to the Vickers\u2019 assertion, the fact that some crops are sustainable in the area does not make it prime agricultural land. We hold that the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone was in compliance with the purpose of LLU-PA to protect prime agricultural land and, therefore, was not arbitrary, capricious, or constitute an abuse of its discretion. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">In regard to the Vickers\u2019 argument that the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone frustrates the purposes listed under I.C. \u00a7 67 \u2014 6502(f) and (g), the Vickers do not provide support for how the rezone discourages urban and urban-type development within incorporated cities, or how it fails to promote the avoidance of undue concentration of population and overcrowding of land. The burden is on the Vickers to show how the Board erred in a manner specified under I.C. \u00a7 67-5279. <em>See Druffel v. State, Dept. of Transp., </em>136 Idaho 853, 855, 41 P.3d 739, 741 (2002). Because the Vickers have failed to meet this burden, we decline to consider their argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Based upon our analysis set forth above, we hold that the Board\u2019s approval of Savala\u2019s request for a conditional rezone of his property was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(2). The record demonstrates that the Board followed the criteria set forth in section 07-06-05 of CCO 05-002 and I.C. \u00a7 67-6511, and found adequate evidence to support the relevant questions set forth in these provisions. The Board thoroughly analyzed Savala\u2019s application throughout four days of hearings, which spanned over five months, and issued 158-pages of findings of facts, conclusions of law, and orders regarding the proposal. Based on its findings, the Board determined the conditional rezone conformed to the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>prehensive plan, the rezone did not injure neighboring property owners or change the essential character of the area, and Savala\u2019s proposal had met the other criteria set forth in section 07-06-05 of CCO 05-002. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s order upholding the Board\u2019s decision to approve the conditional rezone.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">B. Attorney Fees on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">All parties request attorney fees on appeal. First, the Vickers request attorney fees on appeal under I.C. \u00a7 12-117. Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117(1) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">Unless otherwise provided by statute, in any administrative or civil judicial proceeding involving as adverse parties a state agency, a city, a county or other taxing district and a person, <em>the court shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, </em>witness fees and reasonable expenses, if the court finds that the party against whom the judgment is rendered acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">(Emphasis added). Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117(1) only provides a statutory basis for attorney fees to a prevailing party. In this case, the Vickers are not a prevailing party. Therefore, we deny the Vickers\u2019 request for attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The Board also requests attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117. As aforementioned, I.C. \u00a7 12-117(1) awards attorney fees to the prevailing party if the court finds that the party against whom the judgment is rendered acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law. Although the Board is the prevailing party in this case, we are unable to find that the Vickers acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law. We have previously found that parties acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law for purposes of awarding attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117 when there was no statute authorizing judicial review, but have only done so in cases where this Court was barred from reviewing all claims. <em>See Giltner Dairy, LLC v. Jerome County, </em>145 Idaho 630, 633-34, 181 P.3d 1238, 1241-42 (2008); <em>Highlands Development Corp. v. City of Boise, </em>145 Idaho 958, 962, 188 P.3d 900, 904 (2008). In this case, we determined that the Vickers had a statutory right to judicial review of the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone and corresponding Development Agreement. Therefore, we deny the Board\u2019s request for attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Finally, Savala requests attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12-117 and 12-121. Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117 sets forth that attorney fees are awardable when the adverse parties are a county and a person. Assuming, without deciding, Savala is entitled to attorney fees as an intervenor under I.C. \u00a7 12-117, an award is not proper in this case. As set forth above, the Vickers had a statutory right to judicial review of the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone and corresponding Development agreement. Thus, the Vickers did not pursue this appeal without a reasonable basis in fact or law. In regard to Savala\u2019s request for attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121, attorney fees are awardable only if the appeal was brought \u201cfrivolously, unreasonably, and without foundation.\u201d <em>Gustaves v. Gustaves, </em>138 Idaho 64, 71, 57 P.3d 775, 782 (2002). Here, we are unable to find that the Vickers pursued this appeal frivolously, unreasonably, and without foundation, especially in light of the unique issues that were presented in this case. As such, we deny Savala\u2019s requests for attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12-117 and 12-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">We vacate that part of the district court\u2019s order affirming the Board\u2019s amendments to the 1995 and 2010 Plan Maps because the Vickers failed to provide a statutory basis for judicial review of the Board\u2019s amendments to the comprehensive plan maps. We affirm that part of the district court\u2019s order upholding the Board\u2019s order approving the conditional rezone of Savala\u2019s property, holding that although the Vickers have a statutory right to judicial review of the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone and corresponding Development Agreement, we are unable to find that the Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of disere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>tion. We deny all parties\u2019 requests for attorney fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b474-4\">Justices J. JONES and W. JONES, Concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-5\">.

The fact that Canyon County requires an applicant enter into a development agreement with the county binding him or her to the development conditions imposed in accordance with the conditional rezone is evidence that the development agreement is integrally tied to the conditional rezone under the ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\">.

However, I cannot agree entirely with the majority\u2019s analysis of the substantive issues presented by this appeal. Specifically, I do not read the LLUPA as authorizing our review of any part of the Vickers\u2019 petition for review, including the portion addressed to the Board\u2019s approval of Savala\u2019s application for a conditional rezone based upon the development agreement. Thus, I would remand with instructions to the district court to dismiss the Vickers\u2019 petition in its entirety. In addition, I would award attorney fees to the Board but not Savala.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The majority correctly states that in order for a court to review the Board\u2019s action in approving the conditional rezone and accompanying development agreement, there must be a statute authorizing such review. Idaho Const. art. V, \u00a7 13; I.R.C.P. 84(a)(1). The majority further recognizes that I.C. \u00a7 67-6521 would authorize judicial review of the Board\u2019s approval, as long as that approval amounts to an issuance of a \u201cpermit authorizing development.\u201d The majority then reasons that \u201csince the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone and corresponding Development Agreement is the functional equivalent of a conditional use permit, which is in essence a special use permit, the Board\u2019s approval of the conditional rezone and corresponding Development Agreement is ... \u2018a permit authorizing development\u2019 under LLU-PA.\u201d In my view, this conclusion stretches the statutory language too far.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Although the word \u201cpermit\u201d is not contained in the definitions section of LLUPA, I.C. \u00a7 67-6517 refers to \u201ca permit as defined in this chapter.\u201d Thus we know, as the majority points out, that \u201cwhat constitutes a permit is defined by the Act.\u201d The act refers to special use permits (I.C. \u00a7 67-6512), subdivision permits (I.C. \u00a7 67-6513), planned unit development permits (I.C. \u00a7 67-6515), variance permits (I.C. \u00a7 67-6516), building permits (I.C. \u00a7 67-6517), and conditional use permits (I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 67-6512, 67-6532). There is no provision in the LLUPA that refers to a permit for a \u201cconditional rezone based upon a development agreement.\u201d We are therefore not authorized to review the Board\u2019s action in granting a conditional rezone based upon a development agreement pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 67-6521 \u2014 such action is not the issuance or denial of a <em>permit. </em>If the legislature had intended to allow for judicial review of such action, it would have included a conditional rezone based upon a development agreement within the act\u2019s delineation of the different kinds of permits or otherwise so stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">The majority contends that approval of a conditional rezone based upon a development agreement is the functional equivalent of an issuance of a special use permit, as mentioned in I.C. \u00a7 67-6512, and that thus we are authorized to review the Board\u2019s action pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 67-6521. I disagree. A special use permit is a different animal than a conditional rezone and accompanying development agreement. The LLUPA addresses the former in I.C. \u00a7 67-6512, while the latter is governed by I.C. \u00a7 67-6511A. A special use permit may be granted in cases where the \u201cuse is conditionally permitted by the terms of the ordinance, subject to conditions pursuant to specific provisions of the ordinance .... \u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-6512(a). In applying for a special use permit, an owner avers that his use is one permitted by the ordinance and that if given the permit he will abide by the conditions set out in the ordinance. In contrast, with a conditional rezone and corresponding development agreement, a county may \u201crequire or permit as a condition of rezoning that an owner or developer make a written commitment concerning the use or development of the subject parcel.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-6511A. In applying for a conditional rezone based upon a development agreement, an owner seeks a new classification of his property that will be conditioned upon terms to which he and the county agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">The majority reasons that a grant of either of these things \u201cultimately allow[s] noncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>forming uses to occur on the subject property\u201d and that thus they are functionally the same. This is incorrect. A special use permit does not change the zoning of the subject property. By contrast, once a conditional rezone and corresponding development agreement has been approved, the subject property is rezoned so that the use conforms. In short, the granting of a special use permit allows a nonconforming use if that use is one enumerated in the ordinance and the owner abides by the conditions set out in the ordinance. The zoning classification of the land does not change. Conversely, approval of a conditional rezone based upon a development agreement changes the zoning classification of the land, subject to the owner\u2019s compliance with agreed upon conditions. The differences between these two grants, though perhaps subtle, are important enough that the legislature dealt with each of them in separate provisions, subjecting only one of them to judicial review by terming it a \u201cpermit.\u201d Savala requested and received a rezone of his property conditioned upon his compliance with a development agreement in which the Board requires him to make various installations and improvements on his property. This is the very process described by I.C. \u00a7 67-6511A, which is not a process by which a county issues a \u201cpermit\u201d as that word is defined by Idaho Code, title 67, chapter 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Because a conditional rezone based upon a development agreement is not a permit as defined by the LLUPA, I would conclude that there is no statutory authority for review of any portion of the Vickers\u2019 petition for review. This conclusion renders irrelevant the question of whether a conditional rezone based upon a development agreement \u201cauthorizes development\u201d for purposes of I.C. \u00a7 67 \u2014 6521(l)(a), and thus I would decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Furthermore, because there is no statute authorizing review of the Vickers\u2019 petition, I would conclude that not only are they not the prevailing party, but that they acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law in bringing their petition. <em>Giltner Dairy, LLC v. Jerome County, </em>145 Idaho 630, 633-34, 181 P.3d 1238, 1241-42 (2008). I would thus award the Board attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">We have previously awarded attorney fees to a party in Savala\u2019s position \u2014 an intervenor on the side of the county who prevails when a petition for review is dismissed for lack of statutory authority \u2014 under I.C. \u00a7 12-121. <em>Id. </em>Although I joined in the decision in <em>Giltner Dairy, </em>I am convinced that our award in that case was in error. Idaho Code \u00a7 12-121 states in relevant part that \u201c[i]n any <em>civil action, </em>the judge may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party....\u201d (Emphasis added). In <em>Lowery v. Board of County Commrs. for Ada County, </em>117 Idaho 1079, 1082, 793 P.2d 1251, 1254 (1990), this Court held that an appeal from an administrative proceeding is not a civil action. Pursuant to <em>Lowery, </em>Savala is not entitled to attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Savala also asks for an award of attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117. That statute states, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">Unless otherwise provided by statute, in any administrative or civil judicial proceeding involving as adverse parties a state agency, a city, a county or other taxing district and a person, the court shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, witness fees and reasonable expenses, if the court finds that the party against whom the judgment is rendered acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-u\">The dispositive language is involving as adverse parties ... a county ... and a person. It is true that this case involves the county and the Vickers as adverse parties. However, I do not interpret the adversity between the county and the Vickers as satisfying the adversity requirement as between the county and Savala. The county and Savala are not adverse, and thus the legislature did not intend for a party in Savalas position to receive an award under I.C. \u00a7 12-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117 initially allowed for an award of attorney fees to an adverse person and against a county. 1994 Idaho Sess. Laws, ch. 36, p. 55. It was later amended to allow for an award to a county from an adverse person. 2000 Idaho Sess. Laws, ch. 241, p. 675. It has never been amended, however, to allow for an award to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>person who is not adverse to the county in a case in which a county happens to be involved, and I would decline to infer that this was the intent of the Legislature. Thus I would hold that Savala is not entitled to an award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Such a holding might seem to conflict with our decision in <em>Rural Kootenai Org., Inc. v. Bd. of Commrs., </em>133 Idaho 833, 845, 993 P.2d 596, 608 (1999). In that case, a developer intervened on the side of the county, and the county lost on appeal. We stated that, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117, \u201c[the intervenor] shall share the burden of appellate costs with the County.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 846, 993 P.2d at 609. This holding may suggest that, since we levied costs against an intervenor who was not adverse to the county under I.C. \u00a7 12-117, we may also logically make an award of attorney fees to Savala under that same provision. The Court in <em>Rural Kootenai </em>was explicit, however, that it was only awarding costs and not attorney fees against the intervenor pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117. And because costs are awarded to a prevailing party on appeal as a matter of course pursuant to I.A.R. Rule 40, it follows that the Court\u2019s citation to I.C. \u00a7 12-117 for the award of costs is dicta. Thus, I would hold that our decision in <em>Rural Kootenai </em>does not conflict with a denial of Savala\u2019s request for attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In sum, I find that there is no statutory basis for any portion of the Vickers petition for review and thus that they acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law in bringing it. I would accordingly remand with instructions to the district court to dismiss the petition and would award attorney fees to the Board but not Savala.</p>\n<judges id=\"b476-6\">Justice TROUT, J., pro tern, Concurs.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
