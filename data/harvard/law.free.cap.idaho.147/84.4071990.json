Idaho Counties Risk Management Program Underwriters (ICRMP) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of ICRMP\u2019s insurer, Northland Insurance Companies (Northland), holding that Northland had no duty to reimburse ICRMP for costs it incurred on behalf of its insureds in the defense and settlement of a lawsuit filed by Donald M. Paradis. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">On June 22, 1980, the bodies of Kimberly Palmer and Scott Currier were discovered in the woods outside of Post Falls, Idaho. Detective George Elliott transported Ms. Palmer\u2019s and Mr. Currier\u2019s bodies to Portland, Oregon, where the Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Oregon, William Brady, M.D., performed autopsies. The following day, June 24, 1980, a meeting was held with members from the Spokane County Sheriffs Office and the Kootenai County Sheriffs Office to discuss investigation of the killings. Kootenai County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney D. Marc Haws also attended the meeting; his supervisor at the time, the prosecuting attorney, was Glen Walker. During the course of the meeting, Haws took notes that reflected his understanding of the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-15\">In late 1980, Paradis was arrested and charged with the murder of Ms. Palmer, and the State presented its theory, based on the opinion of Dr. Brady and conveyed to the court through Haws, that Ms. Palmer had aspirated water from the creek near Post Falls in which her body was found partially submerged, suggesting that she had been alive when she went into the creek and was thus killed in Idaho. On December 10, 1981, following a trial conducted by Haws and another deputy Kootenai County prosecutor, Peter Erbland, Paradis was found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-16\">Paradis sought review of his conviction by appeal, post-conviction relief, and federal habeas corpus. While one of his habeas petitions was pending in January 1996, Paradis\u2019 counsel obtained copies of the notes Haws had made during the June 24, 1980 meeting, which revealed significant inconsistencies in Dr. Brady\u2019s opinions the day after the autopsy as to the cause and location of Ms. Palmer\u2019s death and the opinions Dr. Brady offered at trial. While Paradis was awaiting trial in Kootenai County in 1980-1981, Paradis\u2019 attorney had made a routine request for disclosure, but the prosecutor did not reveal Haws\u2019 notes or any of the potentially exculpatory information in or related to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-17\">Eventually, Paradis\u2019 case went before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which held that the non-disclosure of this exculpatory evidence amounted to a violation of the prosecution\u2019s duty under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and remanded Paradis\u2019 case. The federal district court granted Paradis\u2019 habeas petition and ordered the State to initiate a new trial against Paradis or release him. Paradis pled guilty to a lesser charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>of accessory to a felony and was released on April 10, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Following Paradis\u2019 release from custody, he filed a notice of tort claim with Kootenai County on October 9, 2001. On April 9, 2003, Paradis filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, naming Dr. Brady, Kootenai County, Walker, Haws, Erbland, and Elliott as defendants, alleging violations of his civil rights, negligence, false arrest, malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and defamation. The defendants filed a number of motions to dismiss, and the federal district court did dismiss a number of claims, but permitted Paradis to file an amended complaint and held that Paradis had alleged at least some continuing torts that were not barred by statutes of limitation. Paradis filed an amended complaint, naming the same defendants and adding claims for false light and invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">ICRMP was formed in 1985 and sold insurance to its members, including Kootenai County. Beginning in 1986 and continuing through 2001, ICRMP purchased insurance from Northland. Upon receiving a copy of Paradis\u2019 initial complaint from Kootenai County in 2003, ICRMP forwarded a copy to Northland. ICRMP also analyzed the initial complaint and, based on the allegations of continuing torts, decided that it had a duty to defend Kootenai County and the individual defendants, subject to exclusions and limitations in ICRMP\u2019s policy. ICRMP retained separate counsel for Kootenai County, Haws, Erbland, and Elliott, and Northland did not object. ICRMP managed the Paradis litigation for the next two years, keeping North-land informed of the proceedings, until a settlement was finally reached.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 13, 2006, Northland first informed ICRMP of its position that coverage did not exist for any of the claims alleged in the Paradis complaints. Northland definitively denied ICRMP\u2019s claim for reimbursement of defense and settlement costs on July 20, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">ICRMP filed a complaint and demand for jury trial against Northland on September 14, 2006. The complaint alleged damages for breach of contract based upon Northland\u2019s refusal to reimburse ICRMP. ICRMP moved the district court for partial summary judgment asking that the court hold that ICRMP had a duty to defend its Kootenai County insureds; the court granted the motion on May 29, 2007. On March 1, 2007, Northland filed a motion seeking summary judgment that it had no obligation to reimburse ICRMP, which the district court granted on June 11, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">When reviewing an order for summary judgment, the standard of review for this Court is the same standard used by the district court in ruling on the motion. <em>Watson v. Weick, </em>141 Idaho 500, 504, 112 P.3d 788, 792 (2005). Summary judgment is proper when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Idaho R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">A court must first decide, when construing a contract, whether it is ambiguous, which is a question of law. <em>Lovey v. Regence BlueShield of Idaho, </em>139 Idaho 37, 46, 72 P.3d 877, 886 (2003). A contractual provision is ambiguous if it is reasonably subject to conflicting interpretations. <em>Id. </em>If the policy at issue does not appear ambiguous on its face, and if neither party asserts that it contains an ambiguity, then this Court exercises free review over its interpretation. <em>Id. </em>The meaning of the contract and the intent of the parties must be determined from the plain meaning of the words used. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">A. Northland is not ICRMP\u2019s reinsurer and is liable to ICRMP only according to the terms of Northland\u2019s own policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">ICRMP urges that its decision to extend coverage to the Kootenai County in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>sureds was taken in good faith, as evidenced by the district court\u2019s summary judgment holding that ICRMP had a duty to defend against that lawsuit,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that therefore Northland, as ICRMP\u2019s reinsurer, must extend corresponding coverage. Northland argues that the policy it sold ICRMP is a reimbursement policy, which does not bind Northland to extend coverage beyond the terms of that policy. The district court, while recognizing that the parties thoroughly discussed this issue of reinsurance versus reimbursement insurance, declined to rule on it, stating that Northland did not request a decision on this issue in its motion for summary judgment. The parties have renewed the discussion before this Court, however, and because the question is a question of law that is before this Court on a motion for summary judgment, it is appropriate for the Court to address it now. <em>Bakker v. Thunder Spring-Wareham, LLC, </em>141 Idaho 185, 189, 108 P.3d 332, 336 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">A reinsurer, in the strict sense of the term, is liable only according to the terms and conditions of the reinsurance contract, and only if the reinsured is liable. 44A Am. Jur.2d Insurance \u00a7 1819. However, \u201c[a] \u2018following form\u2019 clause in a policy of reinsurance incorporates by reference all the terms and conditions of the reinsured policy, except to the extent that the reinsurance contract by its own terms specifically defines the scope of coverage differently, i.e., via an exclusion.\u201d <em>Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co. v. Home Ins. Co., </em>882 F.Supp. 1328, 1345 (S.D.N.Y.1995). ICRMP argues that the Northland policy is a reinsurance policy that incorporates ICRMP\u2019s policy with Kootenai County, and as such, where ICRMP is bound by the terms of its policy, so too is Northland, as a reinsurer, bound to reimburse ICRMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">ICRMP further argues that Northland, as ICRMP\u2019s reinsurer, is also bound by the \u201cfollow the fortunes\u201d doctrine, which requires a reinsurer to indemnify the insured for payments reasonably within the terms of the original policy, even if not technically covered by it. <em>Int\u2019l Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Certain Underwriters and Underwriting Syndicates at Lloyd\u2019s of London, </em>868 F.Supp. 917, 920 (S.D.Ohio 1994). ICRMP argues that even if the defense and settlement costs related to the Paradis litigation were not technically covered by ICRMP\u2019s policy, Northland, as a reinsurer, is nonetheless bound to reimburse ICRMP for those costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">The problem with these arguments is that both the \u201cfollow the forms\u201d and \u201cfollow the fortunes\u201d rules apply only to reinsurers. Northland is not ICRMP\u2019s reinsurer. It is true, as ICRMP points out, that in one instance the Northland policy refers to ICRMP as Northland\u2019s \u201cNamed Reinsured.\u201d However:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">In construing an insurance policy, the Court must look to the plain meaning of the words to determine if there are any ambiguities. This determination is a question of law. In resolving this question of law, the Court must construe the policy <em>\u201cas a whole, not by an isolated phrase.\u2019\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-11\"><em>Cascade Auto Glass, Inc. v. Idaho Farm Bureau Ins. Co., </em>141 Idaho 660, 663, 115 P.3d 751, 754 (2005) (quoting <em>Selkirk Seed Co. v. State Ins. Fund, </em>135 Idaho 434, 437, 18 P.3d 956, 959 (2000)) (emphasis added). Aside from this single, isolated appearance of the word \u201creinsured,\u201d there is nothing in the Northland policy to indicate that it is a reinsurance contract. There is no \u201cfollow the forms\u201d clause in the Northland policy. There is no other language incorporating the language of the ICRMP policy into the Northland policy. In short, the policies are discrete, and if Northland is at all liable to ICRMP, it can only be by the terms of Northland\u2019s own policy. A single instance of the word \u201creinsurance\u201d will not lead us to import the rules of reinsurance contracts at the expense of the agreement for which the parties bargained. Instead, we look to the express terms of that agreement to determine Northland\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>B. Northland is not liable to reimburse ICRMP because the Paradis complaints do not allege an occurrence under the North-land insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The express terms of the contract make clear that Northland agreed to reimburse ICRMP if an \u201coccurrence\u201d took place during the period ICRMP was covered by the policy. The Northland policy states under Section II that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">This Section applies only to bodily injury, personal injury or property damage which occur during the policy period and arise out of an occurrence which takes place within the territorial scope of the Policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">A \u2014 COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL LIABILITY: Underwriters hereby agree, subject to the limitations, terms and conditions hereunder mentioned, to indemnify the Assured for all sums, including expenses, all as more fully defined by the term ultimate net loss, which the Assured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages imposed by law because of bodily injury, property damage, personal injury, advertising injury, products liability and or completed operations, host/liquor liability or incidental malpractice which result from an occurrence and which occur during the policy period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">C \u2014 LAW ENFORCEMENT LIABILITY: Underwriters hereby agree, subject to the limitations, terms and conditions hereunder mentioned, to indemnify the Assured for all sums which the Assured shall be obligated to pay by reason of errors, omissions or negligent acts arising out of the performance of the Assured\u2019s duties while acting as a law enforcement official or officer in the regular course of public employment as hereinafter defined, arising out of any occurrence from any cause on account of Personal Injury, Bodily Injury, Property Damage, Violation of Civil Rights or First Aid, happening during the period of this insurance except as covered under Section II A and B.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The Northland policy defines the term occurrence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-10\">For Section II, \u201coccurrence\u201d means an accident or happening or event or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in personal injury or damage to property during the policy period. All personal injuries to one or more persons and/or property damage arising out of an accident or a happening or event or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions shall be deemed to be one occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Thus, we must decide whether the Paradis complaints alleged an occurrence as defined by the Northland policy that triggers North-land\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">ICRMP advances several arguments as to why Northland\u2019s liability under its own policy is triggered by the allegations of tortious conduct contained in the Paradis complaints. ICRMP first contends that the district court, when determining if the Paradis complaints alleged what amounted to an occurrence under the Northland policy, erred by reading the complaints too narrowly. Read broadly, ICRMP argues, the complaints allege at least one potential occurrence under the Northland policy. And Northland, ICRMP urges, is liable for the cost to defend and settle even potentially covered, in addition to actually covered, claims because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-13\">Under Idaho law and consistent with other states, an insurer\u2019s duties to defend and indemnify are separate duties. The duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. The duty to defend is triggered if the third-party\u2019s complaint reveals a potential for liability that would be covered by the insured\u2019s policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-14\"><em>Hoyle v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>137 Idaho 367, 375, 48 P.3d 1256, 1264 (2002) (citations omitted). It is ICRMP\u2019s position that, even if the complaints do not allege at least one actual occurrence, they do allege at least one potential occurrence, and such a potential occurrence triggers Northland\u2019s duty to defend and thus its liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">The fault in this first argument is that Northland did not owe a duty to defend. There is no language in the contract that provides that Northland was obligated to un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>dertake to defend and settle the claims against ICRMP\u2019s Kootenai County insureds. It is true that Northland is liable to reimburse defense costs as specified in the net loss provisions of the policy; however, such liability must first be triggered by an actual occurrence, and then Northland\u2019s duty is to pay for ICRMP\u2019s defense costs, not to defend ICRMP\u2019s insureds. The fact that Northland could be liable to ICRMP for defense costs resulting from an actual occurrence under the policy does not create in Northland a duty to defend. Thus, the district court correctly focused on the Paradis complaints to ascertain whether they alleged an actual occurrence under the policy that would trigger Northland\u2019s duty to reimburse.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">ICRMP next argues that the Paradis complaints do in fact allege at least one actual occurrence that took place during the policy period. The district court, however, relied on <em>Appalachian Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>676 F.2d 56 (3rd Cir.1982), to determine that they do not. <em>Appalachian </em>involved the question of whether a liability insurer had to provide coverage for losses its insured incurred in the settlement of class action litigation involving sex discrimination in employment where the insured\u2019s discriminatory conduct originated before the effective date of coverage but had an impact on class members both before and after that date. The policy at issue defined an occurrence as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">[A]n accident or a happening or event or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly and unintentionally results in personal injury, property damage or advertising liability during the policy period ... [a]ll such exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from one premises location shall be deemed one occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The <em>Appalachian </em>court stated that in order to determine whether there had been an occurrence within the policy period, it had to 1) identify the occurrence and 2) decide when it took place. <em>Id. </em>at 61. The court then employed the theory of proximate cause to identify the occurrence, asking if there was but one proximate, uninterrupted, and continuing cause that resulted in all of the injuries and damage. The Court concluded that the occurrence was the company\u2019s adoption of discriminatory employment policies. <em>Id. </em>The court emphasized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">The fact that there were multiple injuries and that they were of different magnitudes and that injuries extended over a period of time does not alter our conclusion that there was a single occurrence. As long as the injuries stem from one proximate cause there is a single occurrence. <em>Champion Int'l. Corp. v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>546 F.2d 502, 505-06 (2d Cir.1976), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 819, 98 S.Ct. 59, 54 L.Ed.2d 75 (1977). Indeed, the definition of the term \u201coccurrence\u201d in the Appalachian policy contemplates that one occurrence may have multiple and disparate impacts on individuals and that injuries may extend over a period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcV\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Certain of its identification of the single occurrence, the <em>Appalachian </em>court next noted that the aspect of the occurrence that must have taken place within the policy period was the result or injury. <em>Id. </em>at 61-62. The court observed that the difficulty in the case was that the \u201cinjurious effects of [the insured\u2019s] ... employment policies began immediately upon their adoption and continued at least to some extent into the period of coverage provided by the [insurer\u2019s] policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62. The court held that \u201cin this type of a case the occurrence takes place when the injuries first manifest themselves\u201d and concluded that the time of the occurrence was immediately after the discriminatory policies were promulgated, and thus before the insurance policy at issue had taken effect. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">The district court in the instant case found that the Kootenai County insureds\u2019 alleged failure to disclose exculpatory evidence and to properly train their employees regarding such disclosure was the sole proximate cause of all the damage alleged by Paradis in his complaints. The district court held that, in accordance with both <em>Appalachian </em>and <em>Kootenai County v. Western Cas. and Sur. Co., </em>113 Idaho 908, 750 P.2d 87 (1988), the occurrence took place when the resulting injury first manifested itself, which occurred in 1980 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>when proceedings against Paradis first began in Idaho. In <em>Kootenai, </em>the county argued that even though a sheriff conducted an improper execution sale prior to the date the county purchased an occurrence liability policy from Lloyd\u2019s of London, the insurer should still cover the county\u2019s damages resulting from that sale because some of those damages accrued after the policy took effect. 113 Idaho at 915, 750 P.2d at 94. Relying in part on the lower court\u2019s decision in <em>Appalachian, </em>this Court held that, to the contrary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1x\">The improper execution sale is not an event covered by the Lloyd\u2019s policy since it occurred almost six months prior to the effective date of the policy. An insurer is not liable \u201cfor claims arising out of an event or accident which occurred prior to the effective date of the insurance coverage, even though damages and claims continued to accrue from this cause during the later period of coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Appalachian Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Corp., </em>507 F.Supp. 59, 62 (W.D.Pa.1981) (aff'd, 676 F.2d 56 (3d Cir.1982))).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">ICRMP urges that the district court\u2019s conclusion is illogical in light of the fact that the federal district court found that Paradis had alleged continuing torts. The federal court\u2019s decision, however, was made in response to a motion to dismiss that was predicated upon statutes of limitations for those torts. And as the district court noted, \u201cit is irrelevant to the analysis whether a claim is preserved for purposes of pursuing the claim.\u201d This is because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">Reliance on the commencement of the statute of limitation is not dispositive in determining when a tort occurs for insurance purposes. Statutes of limitation and triggering dates for insurance purposes serve distinct functions and reflect different policy concerns. Statutes of limitation function to expedite litigation and discourage stale claims. But when determining when a tort occurs for insurance purposes, courts have generally sought to protect the reasonable expectations of the parties to the insurance contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">Because of this fundamental difference in purpose, courts have consistently rejected the idea they are bound by the statutes of limitation when seeking to determine when a tort occurs for insurance purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKD\"><em>City of Erie, Pa. v. Guar. Nat. Ins. Co., </em>109 F.3d 156, 161 (3rd Cir.1997) (citations omitted). The relevant point of focus for determining whether Paradis alleged an occurrence under the policy is the policy itself, and the definition of occurrence in the policy makes clear that continuing torts are considered to be a single occurrence. <em>Accord Kootenai, </em>113 Idaho at 915, 750 P.2d at 94. The policy also makes clear that an occurrence requires a resultant injury, so we consider the time of an occurrence as being when the injurious effect first manifests itself. <em>Accord Appalachian, </em>676 F.2d at 61-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">ICRMP argues that the Paradis complaints allege both independent and continuing torts that constitute occurrences during the time ICRMP was covered under the Northland policy. ICRMP began purchasing insurance from Northland in 1986, so any occurrence prior to that would not trigger Northland\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">We begin by examining the allegations in Paradis\u2019 first complaint. Paradis\u2019 first claim alleged that Kootenai County and then Kootenai County Prosecutor Walker failed to train their staff regarding <em>Brady </em>disclosure requirements by the time when, in 1981, Paradis became the subject of a criminal investigation and then prosecution by Kootenai County in violation of his constitutional civil rights. The injury from this alleged failure to train manifested itself when Paradis was initially prosecuted in 1980-1981, which occurred prior to the Northland policy period. Allegedly, the initial failure led to the continued withholding of exculpatory evidence and thus continued injury; however, such continued action and ongoing injury arose out of a single occurrence. Thus, under the policy, this claim alleged a single occurrence that took place prior to the policy period, and Northland is not liable for it</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">In his second claim, Paradis alleged that Kootenai County and Walker failed to train their staff regarding constitutional requirements for probable cause determinations by 1981 when Paradis was arrested, charged, and prosecuted, again in violation of his constitutional rights. This alleged failure and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>any resulting injury also occurred prior to the Northland policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Paradis\u2019 third, fourth, and fifth claims alleged that Kootenai County, the Kootenai County Prosecutor, Walker, Haws, Erbland, Elliott, and Brady were liable for negligence, false arrest, malicious prosecution, and false imprisonment when they \u201cinstigated, pursued and prosecuted first degree murder charges against Paradis,\u201d and that Walker was negligent in his failure to train his staff regarding <em>Brady </em>disclosure requirements and constitutional requirements for probable cause. Paradis\u2019 sixth claim alleged that Haws, Elliott, Brady, and perhaps Walker and Erbland conspired to concoct evidence against Paradis and present it as fact in violation of Paradis\u2019 civil rights. Paradis alleged in count seven that Brady\u2019s conduct that contributed to the conviction against Paradis amounted to negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress. Again, both the initial event and the resulting injury alleged in these claims occurred, for purposes of the policy, prior to Paradis\u2019 conviction in 1981 \u2014 five years prior to the beginning of the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Paradis\u2019 eighth claim alleged that Brady defamed Paradis \u201crepeatedly\u201d by \u201cperpetuat[ing] the contrived and unsupportable theories\u201d upon which Paradis was convicted, thereby \u201cproviding] cover for [Brady\u2019s] own transgressions at the continued expense and punishment of Paradis.\u201d Again, albeit continuous, this alleged conduct with its resulting injury occurred prior to Paradis conviction. Even if this claim could be read as alleging an occurrence, however, because ICRMP did not defend Brady, Northland would still not be liable for his alleged conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Paradis\u2019 ninth, tenth, and eleventh claims alleged that conduct by Haws amounted to negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress and defamation. Specifically, these claims alleged that Haws assisted in suppressing Paradis\u2019 subpoena of Haws\u2019 1980-1981 prosecution notes, which Paradis was attempting to obtain for his 1986 habeas corpus petition, and that Haws made false statements about Paradis\u2019 guilt throughout his involvement in Paradis\u2019 case. The alleged suppression of Paradis\u2019 subpoena in 1986 would have been a continuation of Haws\u2019 conduct begun in 1980: but for Haws\u2019 alleged non-disclosure and subsequent fabrication in 1980, there would have been nothing for Paradis to later subpoena. Similarly, Paradis\u2019 complaint specifically alleged that Haws\u2019 false statements occurred <em>\u201cthroughout </em>[Haw\u2019s] involvement\u201d in Paradis\u2019 case. (Emphasis added). Thus, even those statements alleged to have been made after commencement of the policy period would have been a continuation of those made prior to it. More importantly, even if these claims alleged an occurrence during the policy period, North-land would still not be liable. Haws left the employ of Kootenai County in 1983, two years prior to the start of the policy period, and Northland is not liable for any actions he took after that departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The first and second claims of Paradis\u2019 amended complaint were the same as those in the original complaint. The third claim of the amended complaint alleged that Walker and Kootenai County failed to train then-staff not to fabricate and present fabricated evidence against a defendant, which their staff did, with immediate resulting injury, in 1980-1981. The fourth amended claim alleged Brady and Elliott maliciously prosecuted Paradis in violation of his civil rights. The fifth amended claim alleged all defendants engaged in a pre-arrest conspiracy to fabricate jurisdiction and probable cause. Count six of the amended complaint alleged Elliott violated Paradis\u2019 constitutional rights by falsely procuring an arrest warrant. Count seven alleged that Walker and Kootenai County were negligent in training and supervising their staff thereby permitting the wrongful seizure, arrest, and conviction of Paradis. The eighth amended claim alleged that Brady intentionally inflicted emotional distress on Paradis \u201cduring the investigatory phase and after his conviction.\u201d While the conduct and resulting injury alleged in these claims may have continued for many years, it all occurred, for purposes of the policy, prior to the time Northland began insuring ICRMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">The ninth claim in the amended complaint alleged that Brady and Haws portrayed Paradis in a false light and invaded his privacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>by comments they made after Paradis\u2019 conviction. Specifically, the claim alleged that Brady made statements that corroborated his false testimony at trial and that Haws made statements in 1986 and 1987 that Paradis was guilty of murder. Even though this alleged conduct took place after Paradis\u2019 conviction and after the start of the policy period, it was the \u201cproduct of a malicious fiction\u201d that was initially created with immediate resultant injury in 1980. Thus, the conduct was a continuation of an occurrence that took place prior to the policy period. More importantly, as discussed above, ICRMP did not defend Brady, and Haws left the employ of Kootenai County prior to the policy period. Northland is thus not liable for acts alleged in this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Count ten of the amended complaint alleged that Haws\u2019 conduct amounted to negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress \u2014 beginning with his conduct during the \u201cinvestigatory phase.\u201d Count eleven alleged that Elliott and Brady conspired to withhold evidence prior to, during, and after Paradis\u2019 trial in violation of his civil rights. Once again, these claims alleged conduct that occurred prior to the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In short, ICRMP points to both the original and amended complaints for support of its claim against Northland. The complaints, however, failed to allege any action by the Kootenai County insureds with resulting injury that occurred during the period of coverage under the Northland policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">C. Northland is entitled to an award of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Northland has requested an award of costs on appeal pursuant to I.A.R. 40. That rule provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[cjosts shall be allowed as a matter of course to the prevailing party unless otherwise provided by law or order of the Court.\u201d As the prevailing party in this appeal, costs are awarded to Northland.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment because the Paradis complaints did not allege an occurrence under the Northland policy. Costs to Northland.</p>\n<judges id=\"b124-12\">Justice BURDICK and Justices Pro Tem TROUT and KIDWELL Concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\">. No finding was made in the litigation that Haws, Erbland or any of the other defendants had engaged in wrongful conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\">. There has been no appeal from the district court's determination that ICRMP had a duty to defend its Kootenai County insureds. Rather, this appeal stems only from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment holding that North-land is not liable to ICRMP, and our obligation is to decide whether to affirm or reverse that judgment. We do not have the authority to say whether the former ruling was correct as it is not before us for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">.

Were the situation otherwise, I would not have participated in the case because, having worked with both Marc Haws and Peter Erbland, I have full confidence in their honesty, ethics and integrity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
