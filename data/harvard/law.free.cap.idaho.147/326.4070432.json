Doe appeals the district court\u2019s decision affirming the magistrate\u2019s order. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">When he was seventeen years old, Doe was charged under the Juvenile Corrections Act (J.C.A.) and admitted to committing battery of an unspecified sexual nature. He was placed on intensive probation on August 13, 2003. On June 6, 2006, the magistrate amended the order of probation, ordering formal probation for a period not to exceed Doe\u2019s twenty-first birthday. The conditions of Doe\u2019s probation prohibited him from having contact with sexually explicit material or pornography and contact with alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">On October 4, 2006, Doe admitted to his probation officer that on September 26, 2006, while at his mother\u2019s house, he looked at pornography on the internet and consumed alcohol. On October 13, 2006, the State filed a petition alleging that Doe had violated the terms of his probation. Doe turned twenty-one on November 4, 2006. On November 14, 2006, the magistrate court issued a summons ordering Doe to appear for an admit/deny hearing. On November 20, 2006, Doe appeared at the hearing and denied the allegations of probation violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">On January 19, 2007, Doe filed a motion to dismiss the petition, arguing that I.C. \u00a7 20-507 terminated the court\u2019s jurisdiction when he turned twenty-one years of age. At a January 31, 2007 hearing, the magistrate orally denied Doe\u2019s motion to dismiss, and on March 19, 2007, the magistrate issued a written order denying Doe\u2019s motion to dismiss. On February 5, 2007, Doe moved for permission to appeal the order denying his motion to dismiss. On March 19, 2007, the magistrate entered an order permitting Doe to appeal. Doe filed his notice of appeal that same day. On September 4, 2007, the district court affirmed the decision of the magistrate court. Doe timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-18\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b359-19\">When reviewing a decision of the district court acting in its appellate capacity, this Court reviews the trial court\u2019s record to determine whether there is substantial and competent evidence to support the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact and whether the magistrate\u2019s conclusions of law follow from those findings. <em>Losser v. Bradstreet, </em>145 Idaho 670, 672, 183 P.3d 758, 760 (2008) (quoting <em>Nicholls v. Blaser, </em>102 Idaho 559, 561, 633 P.2d 1137, 1139 (1981)). If the district court affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision because the magistrate\u2019s findings are so supported and its conclusions follow therefrom, then, as a matter of procedure, this Court affirms the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>This Court exercises free review over the interpretation of a statute and its application to the facts. <em>State v. Yzaguirre, </em>144 Idaho 471, 474, 163 P.3d 1183, 1186 (2007) (citing <em>VFP VC v. Dakota Co., </em>141 Idaho 326, 331, 109 P.3d 714, 719 (2005)). Whether a court lacks jurisdiction is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review. <em>State v. Jones, </em>140 Idaho 755, 757, 101 P.3d 699, 701 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The object of statutory interpretation is to give effect to legislative intent. <em>Yzaguirre, </em>144 Idaho at 475, 163 P.3d at 1187 (citing <em>Robison v. Bateman-Hall Inc., </em>139 Idaho 207, 210, 76 P.3d 951, 954 (2003)). The literal words of the statute provide the best guide to legislative intent, and therefore, the interpretation of a statute must begin with the literal words of the statute. <em>Id. </em>The plain meaning of a statute will prevail unless clearly expressed legislative intent is contrary or unless the plain meaning leads to absurd results. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Gillihan v. Gump, </em>140 Idaho 264, 266, 92 P.3d 514, 516 (2004)). This Court gives the words of a statute their plain, usual, and ordinary meaning. <em>State v. Hart, </em>135 Idaho 827, 829, 25 P.3d 850, 852 (2001) (citing <em>Hoskins v. Howard, </em>132 Idaho 311, 315, 971 P.2d 1135, 1139 (1998)). Moreover, this Court must consider all sections of applicable statutes together to determine the intent of the legislature. <em>Davaz v. Priest River Glass Co., Inc., </em>125 Idaho 333, 336, 870 P.2d 1292, 1295 (1994) (citing <em>Magnuson v. Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>97 Idaho 917, 920, 556 P.2d 1197, 1200 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">If the language of a statute is capable of more than one reasonable construction it is ambiguous. <em>Carrier v. Lake Pend Oreille Sch. Dist. No. 84, </em>142 Idaho 804, 807, 134 P.3d 655, 658 (2006). \u201cWhen a statute is ambiguous, \u2018it must be construed to mean what the legislature intended it to mean. To determine that intent, we examine not only the literal words of the statute, but also the reasonableness of proposed constructions, the public policy behind the statute, and its legislative history.\u2019\u201d <em>Hayden Lake Fire Protection Dist. v. Alcorn, </em>141 Idaho 388, 398-99, 111 P.3d 73, 83-84 (2005) (quoting <em>State v. Schwartz, </em>139 Idaho 360, 362, 79 P.3d 719, 721 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">By operation of I.C. \u00a7 20-505, the trial court had \u201cexclusive, original jurisdiction\u201d over Doe when he was charged with committing a battery while under the age of eighteen. I.C. \u00a7 20-505(2). Neither party contests the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over Doe while he was a minor; rather, the parties disagree whether the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over Doe terminated when he turned twenty-one years of age by operation of I.C. \u00a7 20-507.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Idaho Code \u00a7 20-507 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[jurisdiction obtained by the court in the case of a juvenile shall be retained by it for the purposes of this act until he becomes twenty-one (21) years of age, unless terminated prior thereto.\u201d Based upon this provision, Doe asserts that the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction terminated when he became twenty-one and thus, the petition for probation violation must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">The State responds that this case should be decided by analogy to the reasoning in <em>State v. Harvey, </em>142 Idaho 727, 132 P.3d 1255 (Ct.App.2006). The State further argues that Doe\u2019s interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 20-507 is inconsistent with other provisions of the J.C.A. that authorize juvenile courts to exercise jurisdiction over adults. Finally, the State asserts that Doe\u2019s interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 20-507 leads to a \u201cpalpably absurd result\u201d because no court would have jurisdiction to adjudicate Doe\u2019s alleged probation violation and Doe would go unpunished, despite the fact that he violated his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">In <em>Harvey, </em>the Court of Appeals considered the case of a probationer who appeared determined not to submit to supervision. In 1986, following a period of retained jurisdiction, Harvey was placed on probation. For purposes of analysis, the Court of Appeals applied the version of I.C. \u00a7 20-222 in effect at the time of Harvey\u2019s original sentencing. This statute provided that the maximum period of probation, including extensions, was five years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In September 1989, the district court issued a warrant for Harvey\u2019s arrest based upon the State\u2019s petition alleging probation violations. Harvey was arrested in another state in December 1989. After Harvey admitted violating the terms of probation, the district court continued probation and ordered Harvey to serve ninety days in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>jail. In March 1990, the district court issued another warrant upon the State\u2019s petition alleging that Harvey had violated probation by escaping from jail. Harvey was arrested out of state in October 1991. In December 1991, Harvey was again placed on probation. In March 1992, the district court issued another warrant following the State\u2019s third petition for probation violation. Harvey was not arrested until April 1997, when he was again found in another state. This time the district court revoked Harvey\u2019s probation and in June 1997 the court ordered Harvey to serve a twenty year prison term, with five years fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In 2002, Harvey filed an I.C.R. 35 motion to correct an illegal sentence. He argued that when the district court revoked his probation, it lacked jurisdiction to do so. Interpreting I.C. \u00a7 20-222, the Court of Appeals determined that a probationary period is tolled \u201cfrom the date probation revocation proceedings are commenced until probation is continued or revoked.\u201d 142 Idaho at 731, 132 P.3d at 1259. The Court of Appeals reasoned that not applying the tolling rule would lead to a patently absurd result \u201cnullify[ing] legislative intent that probation rehabilitate the defendant while protecting society\u201d and that \u201cthe Idaho legislature could not have intended for a probationer to avoid the conditions of probation entirely by absconding from supervision until the probationary period expired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 731, 132 P.3d at 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The <em>Harvey </em>decision reflects one salient fact: I.C. \u00a7 20-222 does not contain language that explicitly defines the duration of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. Thus, the Court of Appeals appropriately fulfilled its \u201cduty to ascertain the legislative intent and give effect to that intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730, 132 P.3d at 1258 (citing <em>State v. Rhode, </em>133 Idaho 459, 462, 988 P.2d 685, 688 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Although there is superficial appeal in the State\u2019s invitation to apply <em>Harvey </em>because the State filed the petition prior to the termination of Doe\u2019s probation, this approach is inconsistent with our approach to statutory interpretation. As previously observed, our interpretation of a statute begins with the literal words of the statute. Idaho Code \u00a7 20-507 provides that the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction \u201cshall be retained by it for the purposes of this act until he becomes twenty-one (21) years of age, unless terminated prior thereto.\u201d The plain language of the statute indicates that a juvenile court ceases to retain jurisdiction, i.e., jurisdiction is terminated, once the juvenile reaches twenty-one years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">The State argues that Doe\u2019s interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 20-507 is inconsistent with other provisions of the J.C.A. that permit the juvenile court to exercise jurisdiction over adults, those over the age of eighteen. I.C. \u00a7 20-502(1). Specifically, the State argues that Doe\u2019s interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 20-507 is inconsistent with I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 20 \u2014 508(l)(c), 20-508(1)(d), and 20-508(9). The first two provisions relate to the waiver of the exclusive, original jurisdiction of the juvenile court and the latter relates to the transfer of cases to courts in the offenders\u2019 home counties. The use of the word \u201cadult\u201d in these provisions is not inconsistent with the operation of I.C. \u00a7 20-507 to terminate the jurisdiction of a juvenile court once the adult reaches twenty-one years of age. This Court harmoniously construes statutes relating to the same subject whenever possible. <em>Edwards v. Indus. Comm\u2019n of State, </em>130 Idaho 457, 461, 943 P.2d 47, 51 (1997). These statutes may be read together as conferring juvenile court jurisdiction over an adult until the adult reaches twenty-one years of age or until another terminating event delineated in I.C. \u00a7 20-507 occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Finally, the State argues that Doe\u2019s interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 20-507 leads to an absurd result because Doe will go unpunished for any violation of the terms of his probation. While it is true that Doe will escape punishment for his alleged probation violation, this is a policy consideration we are unable to consider in the instant case. The language of the statute is unambiguous. We are not free to rewrite a statute under the guise of statutory construction. <em>State v. Lindquist, </em>99 Idaho 766, 770, 589 P.2d 101, 105 (1979). The State\u2019s policy arguments are best directed to the legislature, which has the power to amend I.C. \u00a7 20-507.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>We conclude that under the plain language of I.C. \u00a7 20-507, the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction terminated when Doe reached twenty-one years of age. This conclusion is consistent with that reached by another supreme court addressing a similar issue. In the case <em>In re Jaime P., </em>223 Ill.2d 526, 308 Ill.Dec. 393, 861 N.E.2d 958, 960 (2006), the juvenile court placed a seventeen year old child on probation after she admitted committing aggravated arson. The statute governing the jurisdiction of the juvenile court provided in relevant part: \u201cThe period of probation or conditional discharge shall not exceed 5 years or until the minor has attained the age of 21 years, whichever is less ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>308 Ill.Dec. 393, 861 N.E.2d at 962. The State filed four petitions to revoke Jamie P.\u2019s probation between January 6 and October 2, 2003. <em>Id. </em>308 Ill.Dec. 393, 861 N.E.2d at 961. Jamie P. turned twenty-one years of age on October 3, 2003, and subsequently asked the court to terminate her probation and to dismiss the pending petitions to revoke her probation because the jurisdiction of the juvenile court expired when she turned twenty-one years of age. <em>Id. </em>The Illinois Supreme Court interpreted the plain language of the statute and held that Jamie P.\u2019s probationary period automatically terminated on her twenty-first birthday. <em>Id. </em>308 Ill.Dec. 393, 861 N.E.2d at 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">By operation of I.C. \u00a7 20-507, the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction terminated when Doe reached twenty-one years of age. We reverse the district court\u2019s decision affirming the magistrate\u2019s order denying Doe\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-6\">Justices BURDICK, J. JONES, W.
