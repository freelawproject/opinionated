We reverse the order of the district court holding that Idaho Code \u00a7 39-1392e grants immunity from a claim for negligent credentialing.

We affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the emergency room physician. Finally, we decline to award the emergency room physician attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">On November 14, 2003, at about 11:35 p.m., H. Ray Harrison arrived at the emergency room (ER) of Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center (Hospital). His symptoms included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, imbalance, and speech impediment. According to his family, Harrison\u2019s condition had been deteriorating over the preceding seven weeks, with episodes of vomiting and diarrhea occurring three or four times a day. Julie Anderson, his significant other whom he later married, reported that for the prior three days he had not consumed anything other than alcoholic beverages. A nurse drew blood from Harrison for necessary chemistry panels, including a basic metabolic panel of blood tests called a Chem 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Dr. Binnion was working in the ER that night. At about 1:00 a.m. she began her assessment of Harrison. About forty minutes later, she received lab results from the Chem 7 showing that Harrison\u2019s blood sodium level was 96 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L), a low level of sodium that was life-threatening. The lab results also showed that Harrison\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.13. Dr. Binnion ordered that Harrison be given an intravenous (IV) saline solution at the rate of 200 cc\u2019s per hour. The saline IV was started at 1:50 a.m. and was replaced at 2:20 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Dr. Binnion could not admit Harrison into the hospital. At about 2:25 a.m. she telephoned Dr. Hartford, who was the on-call physician for Harrison\u2019s treating physician. Dr. Hartford agreed to admit Harrison into the hospital. Dr. Binnion suggested that Harrison be admitted to the telemetry unit, but Dr. Hartford thought that it would be too stimulating in light of Harrison\u2019s alcohol abuse and that he should be admitted to the medical floor. Dr. Binnion wrote the admission orders for Dr. Hartford. Those orders included that Harrison be given IV sodium at 200 cc\u2019s per hour and that Harrison have blood draws every six hours for a Chem 7 test. Apparently because of the lack of available beds in the medical unit, Harrison was admitted to the orthopedic unit at 3:26 a.m. At that point, Dr. Binnion was no longer responsible for Harrison\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Dr. Hartford first saw Harrison at 11:17 a.m. on November 15, 2003. By that time, results of the second Chem 7 test done at 6:00 a.m. showed a sodium level of 105 mEq/L. After reviewing the medical records and examining Harrison, Dr. Hartford wrote his treatment plan. It included IV sodium at 200 cc\u2019s per hour and a <em>Chem </em>7 test done every six hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">Dr. Hartford continued the saline IV until 10:00 a.m. on November 17, 2003. During that period, Harrison\u2019s sodium levels continued to increase to 110 mEq/L at 12:27 p.m. on November 15, 2003; to 114 mEq/L at 5:58 p.m. on November 15, 2003; to 124 mEq/L at 3:57 a.m. on November 16, 2003; and to 126 mEq/L at 10:10 a.m. on November 16, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">Harrison\u2019s condition continued to deteriorate under Dr. Hartford\u2019s care. On November 22, 2003, another physician diagnosed Harrison as suffering from central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), a condition in which the myelin sheath covering brainstem nerve cells is destroyed which prevents nerve signals being transmitted properly. CPM is caused by a too rapid change in sodium levels in the body. Harrison contends that his CPM was caused by his sodium level rising too rapidly.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">On April 28, 2004, Harrison and Anderson (Plaintiffs) filed this action against Drs. Hartford and Binnion and the Hospital alleging that they were negligent in their treatment of Harrison and that they also committed the torts of negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress. On November 15, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>amend their complaint to allege that the Hospital was negligent in credentialing Dr. Hartford. After the motion was briefed and argued, the district court denied the motion to amend. It held that there was no cause of action in Idaho for negligent credentialing because Idaho Code \u00a7 39-1392e granted the Hospital immunity from such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">During the litigation, the Plaintiffs served interrogatories and requests for production upon Dr. Hartford seeking information regarding any substance abuse treatment he had received and whether he had been disciplined by the Idaho Board of Medicine. Dr. Hartford objected to this discovery, and on May 26, 2005, the Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel discovery. The district court held that under Idaho Rule of Evidence 503, Dr. Hartford had a privilege to refuse to disclose communications made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment of alcohol or drug addiction and that Dr. Hartford had not waived that privilege by disclosing the information to the Idaho Board of Medicine. The court also held that under Idaho Code \u00a7 39-308, the fact of whether Dr. Hartford had obtained treatment through a certified substance abuse treatment program was also privileged. The court therefore denied the motion to compel to the extent that it sought discovery of such privileged information.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The Plaintiffs then sought to obtain from the Idaho Board of Medicine documents that had been entered as exhibits during an administrative disciplinary hearing regarding Dr. Hartford. On April 3, 2006, Dr. Hartford filed a motion for a protective order seeking to prevent disclosure of those documents to the extent that they consist of records relating to substance abuse treatment. He also sought redaction of any references to substance abuse treatment in letters from his former attorney to the Board of Medicine. The district court granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The Plaintiffs ultimately settled their claims against Dr. Hartford. Pursuant to stipulation, on August 29, 2006, the district court entered an order dismissing with prejudice the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Dr. Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">On April 27, 2007, Dr. Binnion moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the Plaintiffs\u2019 expert did not show that he was familiar with the applicable standard of care and there was no evidence that any alleged negligence by Dr. Binnion was a proximate cause of any harm to Harrison. After briefing and argument, the district court granted the motion on the ground that there was no evidence of causation with respect to the alleged negligence of Dr. Binnion. The district court also held that the Plaintiffs\u2019 expert had not familiarized himself with the applicable standard of care. On Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for rehearing, the court modified its order granting summary judgment by reserving until trial any ruling on whether Plaintiffs\u2019 expert had adequately familiarized himself with the applicable standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Pursuant to stipulation, on September 18, 2007, the district court entered an order dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims against the Hospital. Harrison then timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">II. ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-10\">1. Did the district court err in holding that Idaho Code \u00a7 39-1392c granted the Hospital immunity from a claim of negligent credentialing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-11\">2. Did the district court err in holding that Dr. Hartford did not waive any privilege when he presented documents regarding his substance abuse treatment to the Idaho Board of Medicine in connection with a disciplinary hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-12\">3. Did the district court err in granting Dr. Binnion\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of causation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-13\">4. Is Dr. Binnion entitled to an award of attorney fees on appeal pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 12-121?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">A. Did the District Court Err in Holding that Idaho Code \u00a7 39-1392c Granted the Hospital Immunity from a Claim of Negligent Credentialing?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">The Plaintiffs sought to amend their complaint to add a claim against the Hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>for negligent credentialing in granting hospital privileges to Dr. Hartford. The district court held that such claim was barred by Idaho Code \u00a7 39-1392C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The applicable portion of that statute provides, \u201cThe furnishing of information or provision of opinions to any health care organization or the receiving and use of such information and opinions shall not subject any health care organization or other person to any liability or action for money damages or other legal or equitable relief.\u201d The information furnished and opinions provided are to be used by the health care organization \u201cin conducting peer review,\u201d <em>id., </em>which includes \u201c[c]redentialing, privileging or affiliating of health care providers as members of, or providers for, a health care organization,\u201d I.C. \u00a7 39-1392a(11)(a). The district court reasoned that if a health care organization has immunity for using information and opinions when making a credentialing decision, then it must also have immunity for the credentialing decision ultimately made. In so holding, the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">\u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law over which we exercise free review.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson, </em>140 Idaho 796, 798, 102 P.3d 1115, 1117 (2004). \u201cIt must begin with the literal words of the statute; those words must be given their plain, usual, and ordinary meaning; and the statute must be construed as a whole. If the statute is not ambiguous, this Court does not construe it, but simply follows the law as written.\u201d <em>McLean v. Maverik Country Stores, Inc., </em>142 Idaho 810, 813, 135 P.3d 756, 759 (2006). (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">There is nothing in the wording of the statute that purports to grant immunity to a health care organization for making a eredentialing decision. The statute grants immunity for \u201c[t]he furnishing of information or provision of opinions to any health care organization\u201d and for \u201cthe receiving and use of such information and opinions.\u201d The obvious purpose of the statute is to encourage the free exchange of information and opinions regarding peer review activities, which includes credentialing. A person who provides such information or opinions need not fear a subsequent lawsuit alleging claims such as slander, defamation, tortious interference with contract or prospective economic advantage, or intentional infliction of emotional distress. The statute grants immunity from <em>\u201cliability or action </em>for money damages or other legal or equitable relief.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 39-1392c. (Emphasis added.) The broad grant of immunity may also form a basis for the recovery of attorney fees under Idaho Code \u00a7 12-121 and/or Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 11(a)(1). The health care organization that receives or relies upon such information or opinions is likewise immune from any claim or action for damages or other legal or equitable relief for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">The district court held that immunity for using the information or opinions must also include immunity for the decision ultimately made. Had the legislature so intended, it would have drafted the statute to provide for such immunity. Although the gathering and consideration of information are preliminary steps in making a decision, they are separate from the making of the decision. This is illustrated by the fact that it is common for experts to arrive at conflicting opinions after considering the same information. Holding that Idaho Code \u00a7 39-1392c grants immunity for credentialing decisions would be an expansion of that statute beyond its wording. The district court therefore erred in holding that the statute granted such immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>B. Did the district court err in holding that Dr. Hartford did not waive any privilege when he presented documents regarding his substance abuse treatment to the Idaho Board of Medicine in connection with a disciplinary hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Dr. Hartford objected to the disclosure of records relating to his substance abuse treatment that he provided to the Idaho Board of Medicine. He claimed that such records were privileged pursuant to Idaho Rule of Evidence 503(b)(1). That Rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">A patient has a privilege in a civil action to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing confidential communications made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment of the patient\u2019s physical, mental or emotional condition, including alcohol or drug addiction, among the patient, the patient\u2019s physician or psychotherapist, and persons who are participating in the diagnosis or treatment under the direction of the physician or psychotherapist, including members of the patient\u2019s family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The district court held that such records were privileged under Rule 503(b)(1) and that Dr. Hartford had not waived that privilege by disclosing the information to the Idaho Board of Medicine. Relying upon Idaho Rule of Evidence 510,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Harrison contends that the district court erred in holding that Dr. Hartford had not waived the physician privilege provided by Rule 503(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Harrison did not name Dr. Hartford as a respondent in the notice of appeal. The notice of appeal was directed to: \u201cTHE ABOVE NAMED RESPONDENTS, D. LEE BINNION, M.D. AND SAINT AL-PHONSUS REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER, INC.\u201d We long ago held, \u201cWhere a notice of appeal is addressed to certain parties, naming them, its legal effect is limited to such parties only.\u201d <em>Williams v. Sherman, </em>34 Idaho 63, 66, 199 P. 646, 647 (1921). During oral argument, counsel for Harrison stated that a copy of the notice of appeal was mailed to Dr. Hartford\u2019s counsel. The certificate of service on the notice of appeal does not so indicate. Even if a copy of the notice of appeal was mailed to Dr. Hartford\u2019s counsel, we held in <em>Mahaffey v. Pattee, </em>46 Idaho 16, 18, 266 P. 430, 431 (1928), \u201cWhere a notice of appeal is directed to one party alone, its service upon another party would not have the effect of bringing such other party before the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">Dr. Hartford is the one who would have a privilege to prevent the disclosure of confidential communications in his medical records. Because Harrison did not name Dr. Hartford as a respondent, he is not a party to the appeal. This Court cannot decide his rights without him having an opportunity to be heard. Therefore, Harrison has failed to perfect an appeal regarding the issue of whether the district court was correct in holding that Dr. Hartford had not waived his physician privilege. We will not consider that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">C. Did the District Court Err in Granting Dr. Binnion\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on the Issue of Causation?</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">In an appeal from an order of summary judgment, this Court\u2019s standard of review is the same as the standard used by the trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Infanger v. City of Salmon, </em>137 Idaho 45, 44 P.3d 1100 (2002). All disputed facts are to be construed liberally in favor of the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the record are to be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>If the evidence reveals no disputed issues of material fact, then only a question of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>remains, over which this Court exercises free review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In this case, expert testimony of causation is required. In <em>Swallow v. Emergency Medicine of Idaho, P.A. </em>138 Idaho 589, 597-98, 67 P.3d 68, 76-77 (2003), we held that expert testimony is required unless it is a matter within the usual and ordinary experience of a lay person. We stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">We have previously held that a lay person was not qualified to give an opinion about the cause of a medical condition or disease. <em>Bloching v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc., </em>129 Idaho 844, 934 P.2d 17 (1997) (lay person was not qualified to testify that the seizure he suffered immediately after using a blend of pork and beef insulin was caused by the insulin); <em>Evans v. Twin Falls County, </em>118 Idaho 210, 796 P.2d 87 (1990) (husband was not qualified to testify that conduct by sheriffs deputies on April 15, 1987, in grabbing and shaking his wife was a cause of her cardiac arrest and death over eleven months later); <em>Flowerdew v. Warner, </em>90 Idaho 164, 409 P.2d 110 (1965) (patient was not qualified to testify that his injury was caused by physician\u2019s treatment). In support of the holding in <em>Evans v. Twin Falls County, </em>we quoted from 31A Am.Jur.2d, <em>Expert &amp; Opinion Evidence </em>\u00a7 207 as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">Where the subject matter regarding the cause of disease, injury, or death of a person is wholly scientific or so far removed from the usual and ordinary experience of the average person that expert knowledge is essential to the formation of an intelligent opinion, only an expert can competently give opinion evidence as to the cause of death, disease or physical condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-14\">118 Idaho at 214, 796 P.2d at 91.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">Whether a rise in sodium levels in a specified amount over a specified period of time would cause CPM in Harrison is not a matter within the usual and ordinary experience of lay people. Likewise, whether the conduct of Dr. Binnion could be a cause of Harrison\u2019s CPM is likewise not a matter within the usual and ordinary experience of lay people. Therefore, Harrison was required to produce expert testimony that Dr. Binnion\u2019s conduct was a proximate cause of Harrison\u2019s CPM.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-16\">Dr. Binnion was Harrison\u2019s treating physician from 1:00 a.m. to 3:26 a.m. on November 15, 2003, while he was in the emergency room. During that time, she ordered that he be given an IV saline solution to raise his sodium level. She also called Dr. Hartford to arrange for Harrison to be admitted into the Hospital and wrote the physician\u2019s orders for Dr. Hartford so that he would not have to come to the Hospital that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-17\">The only expert testimony that Dr. Binnion\u2019s conduct was a cause of any harm to Harrison came from his expert witness Dr. Navar. He testified that Dr. Binnion\u2019s alleged malpractice was: (1) her failure to communicate to Dr. Hartford the seriousness of Harrison\u2019s condition; (2) her failure to include in her orders appropriate instructions to the nurses that they immediately tell the treating physician, Dr. Hartford, all of Harrison\u2019s laboratory sodium values; and (3) her failure to admit Harrison to ICU.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>testified that in his opinion each of these instances of negligence was a cause of Harrison\u2019s CPM.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Proximate cause contains two components: actual cause, which is a factual question of whether a person\u2019s conduct produced a particular harm, and legal cause, which is a legal question of whether legal liability attaches to the conduct. <em>Newberry v. Martens, </em>142 Idaho 284, 288, 127 P.3d 187, 191 (2005). Where an expert testifies regarding the factual basis for his or her opinion regarding causation, we will examine those facts to see if they support the opinion. Each of Dr. Navar\u2019s allegations of negligence by Dr. Binnion will be discussed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">1. Dr. Binnion\u2019s alleged failure to communicate to Dr. Hartford the seriousness of Harrison\u2019s condition. Dr. Binnion first saw Harrison at about 1:00 a.m. on November 15, 2003. At about 2:25 a.m., she telephoned Dr. Hartford, who was the on-call physician for Harrison\u2019s treating physician. Dr. Hartford agreed to admit Harrison into the hospital, but Dr. Hartford did not come into the hospital to see Harrison until about 11:00 a.m. Dr. Navar thought that if Dr. Binnion had given Dr. Hartford more information when they talked on the telephone, then Dr. Hartford would have seen Harrison sooner than 11:00 a.m.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For Dr. Binnion to be liable for this alleged negligence, there must be expert testimony supporting a conclusion that Dr. Hartford\u2019s failure to see Harrison prior to 11:00 a.m. was a cause of Harrison\u2019s CPM.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Dr. Binnion was responsible for Harrison\u2019s care from 1:00 a.m. to 3:26 a.m. on November 15, 2003. During that period, she ordered that Harrison be given IV sodium at the rate of 200 ee\u2019s per hour, which was started at 1:50 a.m. She also wrote the physician orders for Dr. Hartford that were in effect from 3:26 a.m. until 11:00 a.m. when Dr. Hartford saw Harrison in the Hospital.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Those physician orders also directed that Harrison be given IV sodium at the rate of 200 cc\u2019s per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-16\">Harrison\u2019s first lab results on November 15, 2003, showed a sodium level of 96 mEq/L at 12:49 a.m., a life threateningly low level of sodium. After reviewing those lab results at 1:00 a.m., Dr. Binnion began sodium replacement by ordering that Harrison have a saline IV at the rate of 200 cc\u2019s per hour. The second lab results at 6:00 a.m. showed that Harrison\u2019s sodium level had increased to 105 mEq/L. According to Dr. Navar, at that point the rate of sodium replacement should have been slowed significantly or stopped. Dr. Hartford did not become aware of the 6:00 a.m. lab results until he examined Harrison at 11:00 a.m. Thus, there was evidence supporting Dr. Binnion\u2019s liability if that five-hour delay in Dr. Hartford learning of the 6:00 a.m. lab results was a cause of any harm to Harrison. There was no factual basis for concluding that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-17\">First, after Dr. Hartford examined Harrison and reviewed the medical records showing the 9 mEq/L increase in Harrison\u2019s sodium levels from 12:49 a.m. to 6:00 a.m., Dr. Hartford decided to give Harrison IV saline at 200 ec\u2019s per hour. He testified that in his opinion he could not slow the rate of sodium replacement because of Harrison\u2019s vomiting, dehydration, and hypokalemia. In fact, Dr. Hartford did not alter the rate of sodium <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>replacement until 10:00 a.m. on November 16, 2003, when he stopped the saline IV. There is no evidence that Dr. Hartford would have done anything different had he come into the hospital and seen Harrison earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Second, assuming that Dr. Hartford would have altered the rate of sodium replacement had he been at the hospital at 6:00 a.m. rather than at 11:00 a.m., there was no evidence that the failure to alter the rate of sodium replacement between 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. was a cause of any harm to Harrison. During the period from 12:49 a.m. to 12:27 p.m., Harrison\u2019s sodium level increased from 96 mEq/L to 110 mEq/L, an increase of 14 mEq/L during a twelve-hour period. Although that rate of increase would support a finding of negligence, in order for Dr. Binnion to be liable there must also be evidence that her negligence was a proximate cause of harm to Harrison. He did not produce any expert testimony supporting a finding that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Dr. Navar testified that he did not know whether the 14 mEq/L increase in Harrison\u2019s sodium level during that initial 12-hour period was a cause of harm to Harrison. Dr. Navar\u2019s deposition testimony on this issue was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">A I don\u2019t know whether that initial increase from 96 to 110 over a 12-hour period would have been enough to result in the insult just by itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">Q And that was 14 milliequivalents in approximately a 12-hour period of time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">A Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">Q Okay. How about the 9 milliequivalent increase in the approximate six-hour period of time from 0049 to 6 a.m., would that in and of itself have been enough to cause CPM in Mr. Harrison?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">AI don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">Dr. Binnion started Harrison\u2019s sodium replacement when he was in the ER. Once Harrison was admitted into the Hospital, Dr. Binnion no longer had any responsibility for his care. Dr. Hartford became Harrison\u2019s treating physician. It was his obligation to monitor the change in Harrison\u2019s sodium levels and to adjust the rate of sodium replacement accordingly. This is not a situation in which Dr. Binnion began a negligent course of treatment that continued because Dr. Hartford negligently failed to detect it. Dr. Navar twice testified that he had no criticism of Dr. Binnion for ordering the saline IV\u2019s that Harrison received in the ER.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">Dr. Binnion also wrote the initial physician\u2019s orders for Dr. Hartford, and those orders remained in effect until he wrote his own after examining Harrison at 11:00 a.m. In those initial physician\u2019s orders, Dr. Binnion wrote that Harrison was to be given IV sodium at the rate of 200 cc\u2019s per hour. There was no testimony, however, that she was negligent for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">There was one statement by Dr. Navar that could be interpreted as being critical of Dr. Binnion\u2019s treatment while Harrison was in the ER. After testifying that he was not critical of Dr. Binnion for ordering the TV saline in the ER to begin sodium replacement, Dr. Navar stated that Dr. Binnion should have slowed the rate of administration significantly after receiving the lab test results showing a sodium level of 96 mEq/L. His testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-15\">A But at the time that the sodium value became available again, at that point, I would think that the sodium level or the rate of administration of fluid would need to be closely monitored from that standpoint. It probably should have been slowed down significantly from the time that it was \u2014 and I guess that\u2019s not listed in this opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-16\">Q When did you form that opinion, that the rate of administration should have been slowed down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-17\">A I\u2019ve had that opinion from the beginning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-18\">Q When should the administration of normal saline have been slowed down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-19\">A When Dr. Binnion got the lab report back that the sodium level was 96.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-20\">It is obvious that Dr. Navar misspoke when stating that Dr. Binnion should have slowed the rate of sodium replacement after receiving the lab results showing a sodium level of 96 mEq/L. Dr. Navar began by saying that \u201cat the time that the sodium value became available <em>again.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>The use of the word \u201cagain\u201d indicates that he thought there had been a prior lab test showing an earlier sodium level. There had not been. The 96 mEq/L sodium level was from the first lab test. It was the results of the second lab that showed an increase in Harrison\u2019s sodium level. Dr. Navar also stated that when the lab report showing the 96 mEq/L sodium level was received, the rate of administration of fluid should have been <em>\u201cslowed down </em>significantly.\u201d (Emphasis added.) At the time Dr. Binnion saw the lab results showing a sodium level of 96 mEq/L, the saline infusion had not even been started. She did not order the saline IV until after receiving those lab results. It is apparent that Dr. Navar misspoke and was referring to the second lab results that showed an increase in Harrison\u2019s sodium level to 105 mEq/L. Both before and after making the statement quoted above, Dr. Navar testified that he was not critical of Dr. Binnion for the saline IVs she ordered while Harrison was in the ER.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Even accepting Dr. Navar\u2019s testimony at face value that Dr. Binnion should have slowed the rate of saline replacement that she had not yet begun after what were the first lab results were again available, there was no testimony that her failure to do so was a cause of any harm to Harrison. As pointed out above, Harrison did not produce any expert testimony stating that the rate of sodium replacement during the first twelve hours was a cause of any harm to him. He also did not produce any expert testimony stating that the increase in Harrison\u2019s sodium level during the first twelve hour period combined with the subsequent increases while under Dr. Hartford\u2019s care caused Harrison\u2019s CPM.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">There is no evidence supporting Dr. Na-var\u2019s opinion that Dr. Binnion\u2019s alleged negligence in failing to give Dr. Hartford more details so he would come to the hospital sooner than he did was a cause of any harm to Harrison. The district court did not err in dismissing this claim of alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">2. Dr. Binnion\u2019s failure to include in her orders appropriate instructions to the nurses that they immediately tell Dr. Hartford all of Harrison\u2019s laboratory sodium values. Dr. Navar also testified that in his opinion Dr. Binnion was negligent for failing to include in the physician\u2019s orders a direction to the nurses to immediately tell Dr. Hartford of Harrison\u2019s laboratory sodium values and that such negligence was a cause of Harrison\u2019s CPM. The physician\u2019s orders written by Dr. Binnion were in effect from 3:26 a.m. until 11:00 a.m., when Dr. Hartford examined Harrison and wrote his own physician\u2019s orders. The only lab results received during that period of time were those obtained at 6:00 a.m. Had Dr. Binnion done as Dr. Navar suggests, Dr. Hartford would have learned of those lab results at around 6:00 a.m. rather than at 11:00 a.m. For the reasons stated above regarding the alleged negligence in not making Dr. Hartford aware of the need to come into the hospital as soon as possible to see Harrison, there is no evidence that Dr. Hartford\u2019s failure to learn of the 6:00 a.m. lab results earlier was a cause of any harm to Harrison. Thus, there is no evidence supporting Dr. Navar\u2019s opinion that Dr. Binnion\u2019s failure to order the nurses to immediately advise Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Hartford of the lab results was a cause of any harm to Harrison. The district court did not err in dismissing this claim of alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">3. Dr. Binnion\u2019s failure to admit Harrison to the ICU. Dr. Navar testified that Dr. Binnion was negligent for not admitting Harrison to the ICU, where he would have had blood draws more frequently than every six hours to more closely monitor his sodium levels. It is uncontradicted that Dr. Binnion did not have authority either to admit Harrison to the Hospital or to decide whether he would be admitted to ICU rather than to some other part of the Hospital. Where Dr. Binnion did not have any authority to admit Harrison to the Hospital, her alleged failure to admit him to the ICU in the Hospital cannot legally be a proximate cause of his CPM. She cannot be held liable for failing to do something she had no authority to do. The district court did not err in dismissing this claim of alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">D. Is Dr. Binnion Entitled to an Award of Attorney Fees on Appeal Pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 12-121?</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Dr. Binnion seeks an award of attorney fees under Idaho Code \u00a7 12-121. That statute authorizes an award of attorney fees on appeal to Dr. Binnion, as the prevailing party, if Harrison brought or pursued the appeal frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation. <em>Nampa &amp; Meridian Irr. Dist. v. Mussell, </em>139 Idaho 28, 37, 72 P.3d 868, 877 (2003). We do not find that Harrison brought or pursued the appeal against Dr. Binnion frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation. We therefore decline to award attorney fees under Idaho Code \u00a7 12-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">We vacate the judgment dismissing this action as to the Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center, Inc., (Hospital) and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We award Harrison costs on appeal against the Hospital. We affirm the judgment dismissing this action against Dr. Binnion and award her costs on appeal against Harrison,</p>\n<judges id=\"AD3\">Justices BURDICK and J.

JONES, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">I respectfully dissent as to part III C of the majority opinion. I agree with the majority in so much as Harrison was required to produce expert testimony on the issue of whether Dr. Binnion was the proximate cause of Harrison\u2019s resulting CPM. However, I would hold that Harrison effectively met his burden at the summary judgment phase; therefore, I would reverse the district court\u2019s decision and remand this case for further proceedings. For purposes of summary judgment Harrison was only required to show that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether Dr. Binnion\u2019s alleged negligence was a substantial factor in causing Harrison\u2019s resulting CPM. I take issue with the majority requiring a higher standard of proof than what our current case law dictates.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">Proximate cause consists of actual cause and true proximate cause. <em>Newberry v. Martens, </em>142 Idaho 284, 288, 127 P.3d 187, 191 (2005). Actual cause determines whether the actor\u2019s conduct produced the harm and true proximate cause, or legal cause, determines whether liability for that conduct should attach. <em>Id. </em>\u201cActual cause is the factual question of whether a particular event produced a particular consequence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf reasonable people might reach a different conclusion from conflicting inferences based on the evidence then the [summary judgment] motion must be denied.\u201d <em>Cramer v. Slater, </em>146 Idaho 868, 873, 204 P.3d 508, 513 (2009). In Idaho, the standard for applying proximate cause in medical malpractice actions containing multiple causes is the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test. <em>Fussell v. St. Clair, </em>120 Idaho 591, 602, 818 P.2d 295, 306 (1991). \u201cBy making the \u2018substantial factor\u2019 test the standard for all proximate cause instructions [in multiple cause medical malpractice actions] [and] by removing the \u2018but for\u2019 test we will have simplified proximate cause by eliminating the unnecessary search for single or multiple eauses[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Restatement (Second) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Torts \u00a7 431 (1965)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> states that an \u201cactor\u2019s negligent conduct is a legal cause of harm to another if [] his conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm[.]\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\">The following considerations are in themselves or in combination with one another important in determining whether the actor\u2019s conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">(a) the number of other factors which contribute in producing the harm and the extent of the effect which they have in producing it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">(b) whether the actor\u2019s conduct has <em>created a force or series of forces which are in continuous and active operation </em>up to the time of the harm, or has created a situation harmless unless acted upon by other forces for which the actor is not responsible;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">(c) lapse of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 433 (1965) (emphasis added). As to subsection (b) of \u00a7 433 the comments reference the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMvu\">If the effects of the actor\u2019s negligent conduct <em>actively and continuously operate to bring about harm </em>to another, the fact that the active and substantially simultaneous operation of the effects of a third person\u2019s ... tortious ... act is also a substantial factor in bringing about the harm does not protect the actor from liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhpN\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 439 (1965) (emphasis added);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 433 cmt. e.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">Where the negligent conduct of the actor creates or increases the risk of a particular harm and is a substantial factor in causing that harm, <em>the fact that the harm is brought about through the intervention of another force does not relieve the actor of liability, </em>except where the harm is intentionally caused by a third person and is not within the scope of the risk created by the actor\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 442B (1965) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">In the present case, regardless whether it was alleged that Dr. Hartford committed greater acts of negligence than Dr. Binnion, Dr. Binnion\u2019s actions must be evaluated solely on whether her negligence was sufficient, when paired with any foreseeable subsequent negligence, to substantially contribute to the final outcome. Therefore, Dr. Binnion\u2019s alleged negligence must be evaluated in light of Harrison\u2019s ultimate injury and not solely with respect to any subsequent actions on the part of Dr. Hartford. Other jurisdictions have looked at multiple causation injuries and evaluated whether the \u201cactor\u2019s negligent conduct <em>actively and continuously operate to bring about harm </em>to another[.]\u201d <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 439; <em>Osborn v.

Wright, </em>218 Mont. 41, 709 P.2d 621, 627 (1985) (holding that a doctor is not relieved from liability for his negligent act of leaving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>a lap mat in patient following surgery because his negligence \u201cactively and continuously act[ed] to cause harm to his patient\u201d along with the \u201cactive and substantially simultaneous negligent act of the nurses\u201d in failing to account for the lap mat); <em>Wilson v.

Dr. Binnion failed to fully and completely communicate Harrison\u2019s history, physical exam, symptoms and test results to Dr. Hartford prior to Harrison\u2019s admission to the orthopedic floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">2. Dr. Binnion failed to communicate within her physician\u2019s orders at the time they were written[ ] her concerns about rapid elevation of sodium[ ] and that all laboratory values be immediately communicated to Dr. Hartford upon receipt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">3. Dr. Binnion violated the local standard of care by \u201cadmitting\u201d Harrison to the orthopedic floor rather than the Intensive Care Unit (even though he also testified she had no admitting privileges), and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-11\">4.Dr. Binnion failed to slow the rate [at which] Harrison\u2019s sodium levels were corrected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">Thus, the inquiry of this Court on review is whether there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether any of the presumed breaches was a substantial factor in bringing about Harrison\u2019s CPM.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">In his deposition Dr. Navar states that in his opinion Dr. Binnion\u2019s breach of the local standard of care was a substantial factor in causing the condition of CPM in Harrison. The district court\u2019s opinion states that plaintiff \u201cfailed to produce admissible expert testimony that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Dr. Binnion caused Harrison\u2019s CPM by failing to slow the correction of his sodium levels before 3:25 a.m. when her care transferred to Dr. Hartford.\u201d The district court and the majority rely on the following testimony of Dr. Navar to support this contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-14\">A: I don\u2019t know whether the initial increase from 96 to 110 over a 12-hour period <em>would have been enough to result in the insult just by itself.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-15\">Q: Okay. How about the 9 milliequivalent increase in the approximate six-hour period of time from 0049 to 6 a.m., <em>would that in and of itself have been enough </em>to cause CPM in Mr. Harrison?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-16\">A: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-17\">(emphasis added). It is clear from the language \u201cjust by itself\u2019 and \u201cin and of itself\u2019 that this portion of Dr. Navar\u2019s deposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>addressed whether but-for Dr. Binnion\u2019s presumed negligence the injury to Harrison would not have occurred. This inquiry misses the point. The important question is: whether Dr. Binnion\u2019s presumed negligence was a substantial factor in contributing to Harrison\u2019s injury, not whether it was the sole cause. Dr. Navar specifically addressed this question stating in his opinion that \u201cDr. Binnion\u2019s breach of the prevailing local standard of care as identified above was a substantial factor in causing the condition of [CPM] in Mr. Harrison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The majority takes issue with the fact that Dr. Navar\u2019s testimony is not supported sufficiently with evidence in the record. However, it was not sufficiently contested either. The only testimony regarding the cause of Harrison\u2019s CPM addressed whether Dr. Binnion\u2019s actions were sufficient standing alone. As previously stated, the evidence should have addressed whether Dr. Binnion\u2019s actions were a substantial factor in causing the injury rather than the sole cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Further, Dr. Laureno stated that he would be able to provide the following opinions at trial and that these opinions were developed to a reasonable degree of medical certainty: <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">6. The rapid elevation of sodium was a substantial factor in causing the condition of CPM, resulting in \u201cLocked-in Syndrome\u201d and neurological injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">7. Had Mr. Harrison\u2019s sodium been raised at a reasonably conservative rate, more likely than not, Mr. Harrison would not have suffered from the condition of CPM.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">8. The rapid elevation of sodium, and resulting CPM, were substantial factors in requiring further hospitalization, care, treatment and medical expenses to Mr. Harrison.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">This Court recently adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 457 (1965) which \u201cgenerally applies to any subsequent medical negligence which is necessary to correct an original act of medical negligence, thereby making acts of subsequent medical negligence generally foreseeable.\u201d <em>Cramer </em>at 874, 204 P.3d at 514. We also held that concurring acts of negligence would then be analyzed and weighted by the jury pursuant to Idaho\u2019s comparative fault statute. Id; <em>See also </em>I.C. \u00a7 6-801.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">In <em>Manning, </em>this Court held that a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d instruction was properly given to the jury in a multiple cause medical malpractice action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Manning v. Turin Falls Clinic &amp; Hosp., Inc., </em>122 Idaho 47, 51, 830 P.2d 1185, 1189 (1992). On April 17, 1987, Daryl Manning was admitted for the final time to the Twin Falls Clinic &amp; Hospital. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 830 P.2d at 1187. His chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with marked hypoxemia and increased C02 retention had deteriorated to the point where \u201chis death was imminent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On April 20, Daryl\u2019s physician informed the family that he had 24 hours to live; an arterial blood gas test was taken which confirmed that his \u201ccondition had deteriorated to a point nearly incompatible with the sustaining of life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49-50, 830 P.2d at 1187-88. Immediately following the arterial blood gas test, but pri- or to the results, the nursing staff temporarily disconnected Daryl\u2019s supplemental oxygen in order to move him to a private room. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 830 P.2d at 1187. Daryl had been moved less than fifteen feet from his bed when he suffered from extreme respiratory distress; he died shortly thereafter. <em>Id. </em>at 50, 830 P.2d at 1188. Despite the imminence of his death, the jury concluded, and this Court affirmed, that the nurses who moved Daryl without the use of supplemental oxygen were a proximate cause of Daryl\u2019s death under the substantial factor test. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 830 P.2d at 1189. The <em>Manning </em>decision is similar to this case in that the question posed to the jury is not whether the removal of Daryl\u2019s oxygen was the sole cause of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>death, but rather whether it substantially contributed to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Similarly, the question here should be posed as to whether Dr. Binnion\u2019s negligence substantially caused Harrison\u2019s resulting CPM, not whether Dr. Binnion was the sole cause. It is then for the jury to apportion fault among all the allegedly negligent actors. As in <em>Cramer, </em>the alleged negligence in this case of Dr. Binnion should be compared to the alleged negligence of Dr. Hartford pursuant to Idaho\u2019s comparative fault statute. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 6-801.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">There is no doubt that the evidence in the record is conflicting. However, it is improper for this Court or the district court to weigh that conflicting evidence once the plaintiff sufficiently rebuts the defendant\u2019s contention that no genuine issue of material fact exists. I find the expert testimony of Dr. Navar sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Dr. Binnion, the initiator in this unfortunate stream of events, was a substantial factor in causing Harrison\u2019s CPM. It may well be that the evidence is weak compared to the competing evidence, but the weight of the evidence is not the issue at the summary judgment stage. There is at least a triable issue of fact as to causation that should survive summary dismissal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b688-10\">.

The following are cases citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 431 and discussing whether alleged negligence was the proximate cause of the injury pursuant to the substantial factor test. <em>Daniels v. Hadley Mem'l Hosp., </em>566 F.2d 749, 760 (D.C.Cir.1977) (finding that a hospital's failure to administer forced oxygen to patient in aniphilactic shock was a substantial factor leading to his death not because it decreased circulation and distribution of sus-phrine injection, but because patient\u2019s lack of respiration lead to cardiac arrest and neurological death); <em>Duarte v. Zachariah, </em>22 Cal.App.4th 1652, 28 Cal.Rprt.2d 88, 91 (1994) (holding that injury to bone marrow allegedly caused by an over-prescription of medication is actionable regardless whether plaintiff can show that it caused reoccurrence of plaintiff's cancer); <em>Kaiser Found. Health Plan v. Sharp, </em>741 P.2d 714, 720 (Colo.1987) (finding a triable issue of fact exists even if the doctor \"could not say 'in terms of probability\u2019 whether hospitalization would have stabilized [plaintiff\u2019s] condition\u201d because \"[t]he plaintiffs were not required to prove their case before the trial court on a motion for summary judgment\u201d); <em>Kastler v. Iowa Methodist Hosp., </em>193 N.W.2d 98, 103 (Iowa 1971) (finding that the defendant hospital was a substantial factor in bringing about plaintiff patient\u2019s injury by allowing patient with known fainting spells to shower unsupervised); <em>NKC Hosp., Inc. v. Anthony, </em>849 S.W.2d 564, 565-68 (Ky.Ct.App.1993) (the hospital\u2019s negligence in prematurely discharging pregnant patient suffering from an undiagnosed perforated appendix was a substantial factor in causing her death and not excused by the treating physician\u2019s failure to timely diagnose and treat the condition).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b690-10\">.

It is sufficient if it is a substantial factor in bringing about the injury, loss or damage.\u201d <em>Manning, </em>122 Idaho at 51, 830 P.2d at 1189.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b691-6\">HORTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">I join in the Court\u2019s decision except for Part 111(A), from which I respectfully dissent. I am unable to conclude that the district court erred by denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their complaint to add a claim against the Hospital for negligent credentialing by granting hospital privileges to Dr. Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Setting aside the pivotal question whether I.C. \u00a7 39-1392e affords the Hospital immunity from a claim of negligent credentialing, it is evident that the district court applied the appropriate legal standards governing the motion to amend. The district court correctly observed that the decision whether to grant Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint was a matter committed to its discretion. <em>See e.g. Youngblood v. Higbee, </em>145 Idaho 665, 667, 182 P.3d 1199, 1201 (2008) (citing <em>Hines v. Hines, </em>129 Idaho 847, 853, 934 P.2d 20, 26 (1997)). The district court also correctly noted that I.R.C.P. 15(a) provides that such \u201cleave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Finally, the district court properly recognized that in reaching its decision whether to grant leave to amend, it was appropriate to consider whether the amended pleading set forth a valid claim. <em>See e.g. Spur Products Corp. v. Stoel Rives LLP, </em>142 Idaho 41, 44, 122 P.3d 300, 303 (2005) (citing <em>Black Canyon Racquetball Club, Inc. v. Idaho First Nat\u2019l Bank, N.A., </em>119 Idaho 171, 175, 804 P.2d 900, 904 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">Turning to the question whether I.C. \u00a7 39-1392c provides immunity to the Hospital for its credentialing decision, the district court found the statute to be unambiguous. The district court then summarized its analysis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">The Harrisons\u2019 logic would place this Court in the untenable position of granting St. Alphonsus immunity for reading the material but simultaneously holding St. Alphonsus liable for using the contents read by the committee in the material when granting or denying credentials. As St. Alphonsus contends, the act of issuing the credential is <em>the ultimate use of credentialing material.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">(emphasis original).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">I agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion. The statute in question, I.C. \u00a7 39-1392c, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-14\">The furnishing of information or provision of opinions to any health care organization or the receiving and use of such information and opinions shall not subject any health care organization or other person to any liability or action for money damages or other legal or equitable relief. Custodians of such records and persons becoming aware of such data and opinions shall not disclose the same except as authorized by rules adopted by the board of medicine or as otherwise authorized by law. Any health care organization may receive such disclosures, subject to an obligation to preserve the confidential privileged character thereof and subject further to the requirement that such requests shall be made and such use shall be limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>aid the health care organization in conducting peer review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The first sentence defines a broad grant of immunity for both \u201c[t]he furnishing of information or provision of opinions to any health care organization\u201d and \u201cthe receiving and use of such information and opinions.\u201d This begs the question: What is the intended scope of conduct for which immunity is granted? I believe that the final sentence of the statute answers this question: \u201cSuch use shall be limited to aid the health care organization in conducting peer review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">In my view, in addition to providing for the confidentiality of peer review materials, <em>see </em>I.C. \u00a7 39-1392b, by its adoption of I.C. \u00a7 39-1392c, the legislature expressly and unambiguously provided a broad grant of immunity for peer review activities conducted by health care organizations. This grant of immunity is extended beyond those who simply provide information; rather, the grant of immunity is extended to those who act on peer review information. The statutory definition of \u201cpeer review\u201d activities by a health care organization expressly includes credentialing decisions. I.C. \u00a7 39-1392a(ll)(a). The Hospital clearly is a \u201chealth care organization\u201d as defined by I.C. \u00a7 39 \u2014 1392a(3). As the legislature has unambiguously provided that a credentialing decision is a peer review activity, I would affirm the district court\u2019s decision denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
