Rosenberg, owner of land and building in the city of Yew York; and George Graf also filed a lien against Louis Zaun and. Andrew Schappel, the contractors for the construction of the building.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">The contract between the owner and the contractors contained the following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-7\">\u201cIt is further agreed between the within named parties, that the parties of the second part shall finish the work on date above written, and progress as herein stipulated and directed by the architect, and any default or neglect on the part of the parties of the second part to comply with any and all the within conditions and finish the. work as above stated, shall be sufficient cause for the party of the first part to claim damages at the rate of ten dollars for each and every day\u2019s detention so caused, and such damage money shall be retained out of any money due or to grow due under this contract.\u201d .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-8\">On February 12, 1869, George Graf filed his notice of lien, claiming nine hundred and eighty-eight dollars and forty-five cents.

Talmage, 9 <em>N. Y. </em>(5 <em>Seld.), </em>551; Lampman <em>v. </em>Cochran, 16 <em>N. Y., 275</em>; Esmond <em>v. </em>Van Benschoten, 12 <em>Barb., 367</em>; Pearson v. Williams, <em>26 Wend., </em>630; Mundy <em>v. </em>Culver, 18 <em>Barb. </em>336; Brinkerhoff <em>v. </em>Olp, <em>35 Barb., </em>28; Clement <em>v. </em>Cash, 21 <em>N.

The sum is not fixed to avoid any statute, and is reasonable and less than the actual damage. In Colwell <em>v. </em>Lawrence, 38 <em>Barb., </em>643, affirmed 38 <em>N. Y., </em>71, the word \u201cforfeiture\u201d was used to designate the payment, the sum fixed was excessive, and the damage, which was slight, could have been remedied by the defendant. The work had been accepted by the defendants at the beginning of the period for which damage was claimed. This case sustains the rule contended for by the appellant. Even if the contract had not provided for liquidated damages, damage was proved, amounting to eight hundred dollars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-7\">II. The fact that a lien has been renewed is matter of affirmative proof on the part of -the lienor. The law states that the lien shall in all cases cease one year after filing, unless continued by the court, and there can be no presumption that the court has ordered the continuance of the lien. The proceeding, therefore, had become discontinued, as far as the claim of Graf was concerned, before the making of the referee\u2019s report.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>For the same reason, the judgment in favor of O\u2019Donnell is erroneous (Grant v. Vandercook, 8 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S., </em>455; S. C., 57 <em>Barb., </em>165-175).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-5\"><em>Dennis McMahon, </em>for respondents</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b76-6\">By the Court.\u2014Robinson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGc\">The referee, in the absence of any proof that the liens of O\u2019Donnell and Graf, filed in February, 1869, had been renewed, was not authorized by his report and decision, dated April 36, 1870, and after the expiration of one year, to render any judgment for the foreclosure of either, as a subsisting lien, and order a sale of the owner\u2019s interest in the property. The liens ceased after the year, without order being made for their continuance, and a new docket made stating the fact <em>(Laws of </em>1863, p. 859, ch. 500, \u00a7 11. Ho decree could be made, continuing what the law enacted should cease ; and,\u2014as in the case of liens by judgment which terminate at the end of ten years,\u2014the actual sale must occur, and the acquisition of a title by a purchaser be effected before the expiration of the lien (Dickerson <em>v. </em>Gilliland, 1 <em>Cow., </em>481; Roe <em>v. </em>Swart, 5 <em>Cow., </em>294).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">From the case it would seem that the claimants relied upon such matter of cessation or expiration of lien as the subject of defense to be set up and proved by the owner; while on the contrary its continuance was the only basis of any judgment <em>in rem </em>of foreclosure and sale, which they are sub-contractors could have originally recovered affecting the owner. Any such judgment was abortive as to the claimant Graf, as on examination I have caused to be made of the records in the county clerk\u2019s office, I find there was no renewal of this lien, and an order for new trial as to him would be of no avail or benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">As to the claimant O\u2019Donnell, he equally failed to establish any renewal of his lien, and the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>must therefore be also, for this cause, reversed as to him, but a new trial ordered to enable him if possible to show such a continuance of his lien as entitles Mm to any judgment in Ms favor, either <em>'in rein </em>or <em>in personam, </em>notwithstanding any lapse of the lien. I find on the examination of the record, it was continued on February 15, 1870, and as to him a new trial should be ordered, with costs to abide the event, in order to enable him, if he chooses, to endeavor to maintain that his lien continues.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">I am also of the opinion that the ten dollars a day named in the contract was intended as, and was in law, stipulated damages for each day\u2019s delay by the contractor in the completion of the work; and that the owner should be allowed at that rate for each day\u2019s delay that should be found to have occurred without liis contributory negligence or without his express consent (Pettis <em>v. </em>Bloomer, 21 <em>How. Pr., </em>317), and that the referee erred in not giving effect to this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
