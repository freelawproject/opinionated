That she came to her death on March 16, 1869, by the malpractice of the defendant, who then unlawfully procured an abortion upon her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-5\">Wherefore, plaintiff alleged that \u201che had been deprived of the comfort and services of his said wife, and that the shock occasioned Mm by the brutal treatment of his wife by defendant, and her death under said circumstances, has been and still is severe,\u201d to the plaintiff\u2019 s damage fifty thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-6\">At the trial, before a justice of the court and a jury.! the action was dismissed, upon defendant\u2019s motion, on the ground that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.' The learned judge was of opinion that the sole cause of action alleged in this complaint was the wrongful killing of the wife, and upon the authority of the reported cases the action could not, therefore, be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-7\">Plaintiff appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-8\"><em>Phillip T. </em>Smith, for the plaintiff, appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"At\">I. Insisted that under the allegations of the complaint plaintiff was already entitled to recover'for the loss of the services and comfort of Ms wife, during the time that she survived after the commission of the acts of malpractice (Lynch <em>v. </em>Davis, 12 <em>How. Pr., </em>323 ; Green <em>v. </em>Hudson River R. R. Co., 16 <em>Id., </em>230; Same v.

The action might be maintained as founded on a breach of the obligation implied in the employment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the defendant as a physician, and the right of action was vested in the plaintiff as the husband of his wife.' The contract to perform his professional duty in a skillful manner was made with the husband, and not the wife, and the husband was certainly bound to pay the defendant for the services rendered, or which ought to have been rendered by him. In an action founded on this breach of duty the husband can recover the damages sustained by reason of the loss of the society and aid of his wife (Lynch <em>v. </em>Davis, <em>12 How. Pr., 323).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-6\">III.

The plaintiff\u2019s right of action depends upon the right of deceased, if living, to bring the action for the injury <em>{L. </em>1847, above cited). 2. Assuming that an injury was done by negligence or tort of the defendant, the assent of th\u00f3 deceased would deprive her of any right of action (Nellis <em>v. </em>Clark, 4 <em>Hill, </em>424 ; Mosely <em>v. </em>Mosely, 15 <em>N. Y., </em>334 ; Gray v. Hoop, 4 <em>Id., </em>449 ; De Groot <em>v. </em>Van Duyer, 20 <em>Wend., </em>390 ; Leavitt <em>v. </em>Palmer, 3 <em>N.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">[After briefly referring-to the pleadings.]\u2014There can be no doubt as to the rule, both in the courts of England and this country, that a husband cannot maintain an action for killing his wife, where the death is immediate, whether such killing arises from wilfullness or negligence. The case of Green <em>v. </em>Hudson River R. R. Co. (2 <em>Abb. Ct. App. Dec., </em>272), is an authority on this point, and refers to various cases establishing the same.</p>\n<p id=\"AmR\">I think it is equally clear, that where a cause of action would exist if the wife had lived, then if she survives after the injury even for a few days, the husband may maintain an action for the loss of the society and services of the wife during that time. This was stated in Lynch <em>v. </em>Davis (12 <em>How. Pr., </em>323), although in that case the action was by the administrator under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The justice says : The common law gave the husband a right to recover the pecuniary injury he had sustained by reason of the killing of his wife.\u2019\u2019 In that case the husband had recovered his damages besides what he could recover under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">The consent of the wife to the treatment was not a consent to be ignorantly or negligently treated, nor would it deprive the husband of his claim for damages occasioned thereby. As stated in the complaint, the act was not only one of wrong, but of crime. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>criminal under our statute, the right of action for damages was not merged.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">I see no reason why the plaintiff should not recover the damages which he is entitled to for the period of time which his wife lived after the drugs were administered. They may be small, but nevertheless are recoverable under the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Brady, JY, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
