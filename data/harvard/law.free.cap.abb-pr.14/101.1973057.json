That there was no legal evidence by record or otherwise that any writ of <em>fieri facias </em>had been issued to the sheriff upon the judgment under which the premises purported to have been sold. 2. That the sheriff\u2019s deed to Harriet M.

That the sheriff acted without authority of law in executing the deed of the premises to her, inasmuch as it appeared by certificates of sale that he sold the premises to Daniel Robert- and Isaac H.

This deed contained full recitals of the <em>fi.fa. </em>in the suit above mentioned ; of the sale of February 25,1833, the purchase by Robert and Underhill, respectively, the assignment by Robert and Underhill, severally, of their right, title and interest in the several lots and in the certificates of sale to Enoch Wiswall and Francis Price, and the assignment by Enoch Wiswall to Francis Price ; and by Price to Harriet M.

Y., </em>368; 1 <em>Lans., </em>405; Bank of Vergennes <em>v. </em>Warner, 7 <em>Hill, </em>91; Canfield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>v<em>. </em>Westcott, 5 <em>Cow., </em>269; Chautauque Bank <em>v. </em>Risley, 4 <em>Den., </em>484; People <em>v. </em>Ransom, <em>Id., </em>147). We do not consder the case of People v. Ransom (2 <em>Comst., </em>490), to hold any different rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">That case substantially holds that a sheriff cannot be compelled to. convey without compliance on the part of any assignee with the statute of 1835, but it does not decide that a conveyance by the sheriff without such compliance would not convey a good title.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We are of opinion that the substantial contents of the several asssignments were sufficiently and properly proved by the recitals of the sheriff\u2019s deed (Wood v. Morehouse, 45 <em>N. Y., </em>368), and that their execution and existence at and before the execution of the deed, and their loss or destruction, were satisfactorily shown by the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The findings of the r\u00e9fere'e were therefore sustained by competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b119-12\"> Present, Ingraham, P.
