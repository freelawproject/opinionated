They also cited decisions from <em>Bump on </em>Bankruptcy, to show that this being a confession of a judgment for money converted by defendants, which they held in a fiduciary capacity, was excepted from the operation of a discharge in bankruptcy, which the defendants had obtained.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-6\"><em>Amos G. </em>Hull, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhM\">The motion cannot prevail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-7\">Section 382 of the Code is in these words, and allows no confession of a judgment for a tort:</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-8\">\u201c A judgment by confession may be entered without action, either for money due or to become due, or to secure any person against contingent liability in behalf of the defendant, or both, in the manner prescribed by this chapter\u201d (Boutel <em>v. </em>Owens, <em>2 Sandf., 655 </em>; 23 <em>How. </em>Pr., <em>507 </em>; 2 <em>Wend., </em>243 ; 1 <em>Caines, </em>511 ; Malory <em>v. </em>Leach, <em>7 T.
