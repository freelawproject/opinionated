Dusenbury, executor, &amp;c., of Catherine Corwith, sued Mark Hoyt, in this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-12\">The complaint set up the making of a promissory note for five thousand dollars in Hovember, 1865, and stated that in May, 1867, five thousand four- hundred and ninety-five dollars and eighty-three cents, was due thereon, and the defendant then paid three thousand dollars upon it, and in April, 1871, the further sum of one hundred dollars, leaving then unpaid upon the note the sum of three thousand and eighty-two dollars seventy-six cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-13\">The answer admitted the making of the note, and the payment in May, 1867, but denied the alleged payment of one hundred dollars in 1871 upon the note, and . set up as a further defense, the fact that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>was in September, 1868, duly discharged from all debts and claims against him by a decree of a United States court in a certain voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. There was no replication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-5\">Upon the trial, the defendant proved his discharge in bankruptcy, and rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-6\">The plaintiff then offered evidence to prove that subsequent to the decree in bankruptcy the defendant had both orally and in writing, promised to pay the sum remaining unpaid upon the note; which was excluded by the court upon the ground that the action was founded upon the note itself, and not upon any new promise or undertaking subsequent to the discharge in bankruptcy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-7\">There being no further evidence, the court directed a verdict for the defendant, and he had judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-8\">The plaintiff moved at special term for a new trial, which was denied, the following opinion being rendered :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXq\">Feeedman, J. J.\u2014It It seems to be well settled that different principles apply to cases of defenses of the statute of limitations and of a discharge under the bankrupt act. The former statute operates upon the remedy merely, and does not extinguish the debt; a discharge in bankruptcy absolutely releases and extinguishes the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-10\">Under the statute of limitations, where no statutory provision, to the contrary intervenes, a new promise may be implied, but after a discharge, it must be so express, clear and unequivocal, as to show that the promisor intended absolutely to waive the protection of his discharge and to rebind himself, legally, to pay the old debt (Depuy <em>v. </em>Swart, 3 <em>Wend., </em>139 ; Lynburg <em>v. </em>Wightman, 5 <em>Esp., </em>198 ; Horner <em>v. </em>Speed, <em>2 P. </em>&amp; H. [Va.], 616 ; Evans <em>v. </em>Carey, 29 <em>Ala., </em>99 ; Fleming <em>v. </em>Haynes, 1 <em>Stark., </em>370 ; Musklan <em>v. </em>St. John, <em>4 Tenn., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>513; Beach v. Wood, 13 <em>Price, </em>667 ; Cambridge <em>v. </em>Littlefield, 6 <em>Cush., </em>213, per Dewey, J).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-4\">Thus, while in section 110 of the New York Code it it is enacted, that the effect of any payment of principal or interest shall not be altered by the provision, that no acknowledgment or promise shall be sufficient evidence of a new or continuing contract, whereby to take the case out of the operation of the statute of limitation, unless the same be contained in some writing, signed by the party to be charged thereby ; it has been held in cases which arose under the bankrupt law, that partial payments are not a new promise, nor the equivalent of a new promise (Stark <em>v. </em>Stimson, 3 <em>Fost., </em>259 ; Viele <em>v. </em>Ogilvie, 2 <em>Greene, </em>326) ; and that payment of interest by the maker, on a note from which he had been discharged, did not revive the liability to pay the note (Cambridge, &amp;c. <em>v. </em>Littlefield, 6 <em>Cush:, </em>210).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-5\">Upon the question, however, whether a new promise, after the discharge, creates a new and substantial cause of action, or operates merely as a waiver by the promisor of a defense with which the law has furnished him against an action on the old promise or demand, there is a marked conflict of authority. But, upon the principles decided in Depuy <em>v. </em>Swart, 3 <em>Wend., </em>125, and Stafford <em>v. </em>Bacon, 1 <em>Hill, </em>533, under the old practice of this State, and in Stearns <em>v. </em>Tappin, 5 <em>Duer, </em>294, 299, under the Code, and the reasoning of Corson v. Osborn, 10 <em>B. Mon., </em>115 ; Field\u2019s Case, <em>2 Rawle, </em>351, and Graham <em>v. </em>Hunt, 8 <em>B. Mon., </em>7, I feel constrained to hold, that in every case the action must be founded upon the precise and positive new promise made after the discharge, and that the original debt is to be considered merely as the consideration that gives validity to the new promise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-6\">From this it follows that, inasmuch as under the Code the plaintiff is required to set out the facts con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>stituting Ms cause of action, and notMng else, the said new promise must be specially pleaded as the basis of the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-5\">\u25a0 This not having been done in th\u00e9 case now before me, the rulings made at the trial must be affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-6\">As to the admissibility and effect of defendant\u2019s discharge, I need only point out that the court of appeals, in Ocean National Bank <em>v. </em>Olcott, 46 <em>N. Y., 15, </em>expressly held that, pursuant to the provisions of the bankrupt act of 1867, the certificate is conclusive evidence, in favor of the bankrupt, of the fact and the regularity of the discharge, and that the same cannot be questioned on the ground that it was improperly granted, in any other mode, nor in any other court, than prescribed in the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-7\">Motion for a new trial denied, with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-8\">Judgment having been entered, the plaintiff appealed, both from the judgment and the order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-9\"><em>D. M. Porter, </em>for the plaintiff, appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arg\">I. The case of an accord and satisfaction has the same legal effect as if the debt had been released under seal, or paid, and a new promise will not constitute a cause of action. But where the discharge is not the voluntary act of the creditor, but is a discharge by provision of positive law, enough remains to support the new promise (Stafford <em>v. </em>Bacon, 1 <em>Hill, </em>532; 2 <em>Greenl. Ev., </em>\u00a7 107; <em>Chitty on Cont., </em>10, 12, 13, <em>215; Story on Cont., </em>\u00a7 142, 185).</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-10\">II. In Stafford v. Bacon, above cited, this dintinction is stated on page 538, and this case and Stearns v. Tappen (5 <em>Duer, </em>594), and Depuy <em>v. </em>Swart (3 <em>Wend., </em>135) are only decisions where the debt sued upon had been voluntarily released and an action afterwards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>brought by a person to whom no promise had been made, and the court properly held that no recovery could be had in such case; that the moral obligation was gone. All these cases as to the question under consideration are <em>obiter dicta. </em>But in the case of Depuy v. Swart, the court mentioning this question, decides it in favor of the appellant. A bankrupt discharge makes the contract voidable not void (Woodward v. Newhall, 1 <em>Pick., </em>500; Hartness v. Thompson, 5 <em>Johns., </em>160; Minor v. Mechanics\u2019 Bank, 1 <em>Pet., </em>46; Salmon v. Smith, 1 <em>Saund., </em>207).</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-5\">III. In the only cases where the question in this case has been actually decided by the courts of this State, and where it was the question decided, and consequently not <em>obiter dictum, </em>it was decided in all of them, that the original cause of action must be declared upon, and not the new promise (Shippey v. Henderson, 14 <em>Johns., </em>178; Stebbins v. Sherman, 1 <em>Sandf., </em>510; Wait v. Morris, 6 <em>Wend., </em>394; Fitzgerald v. Alexander, 19 <em>Wend., </em>402; Clark v. Atkinson, 2 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>112; Gerry v. Buckner, 4 <em>N. Y. Legal Obs., </em>344; note; 1 <em>Abb. Forms, </em>212; McNair v. Gilbert, 3 <em>Wend., </em>344; Ross v. Hamilton, 3 <em>Barb., </em>609; Watkins v. Stevens, 4 <em>Id., </em>168; Wakeman v. Sherman, 5 <em>Seld., </em>85). In all these cases the old cause of action was declared upon, the discharge in bankruptcy was set up, and the new promise was replied. See also Williams v. Dyde, <em>Peake N. P. C., </em>68; Leaper v. Tatton, 16 <em>East, </em>420; <em>Chitty Plead., </em>40; 1 <em>Selw. N. P., </em>219; Maxim v. Morse, 8 <em>Mass., </em>127; 3 <em>Bos. &amp; P., </em>250; Trueman v. Fenton, 5 <em>Cowp., </em>548; Lynbury v. Mightman, 15 <em>Esp., </em>198; Roberts v. Morgan, 2 <em>Esp., </em>736. The authorities are numerous, uniform, and not conflicting in this State, and all against those, foreign authorities, and are all in the appellant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-6\">IY. The averment that so much was due on April 20, 1871, and that on that day (being after the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>charge) <em>the defendant paid thereon </em>one hundred dollars, leaving unpaid upon said note the sum of three thousand and eighty-two dollars and seventy-six cents ; \u201cthat the same remains unpaid; also that the <em>payments </em>made thereon <em>were made to the plaintiff as such executor by the </em>defendant,\u201d is equivalent to averring a new promise (Miller v. Potter, 34 <em>Barb., </em>358; Winchell v. Bowman, 21 <em>Id., </em>448; Hawley <em>v. </em>Griswold, 42 <em>Id., </em>18).
