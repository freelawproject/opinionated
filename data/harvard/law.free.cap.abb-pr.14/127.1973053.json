Morgan sued Henry Whittaker, Jr., in the supreme court, to recover moneys alleged to have been paid to the defendant by one Moore for the use of, and to be paid over to, the plaintiff. The action was commenced by the service of a summons. Before serving a complaint, the plaintiff applied to the court upon an affidavit, for an order requiring defendant to appear for examination as a witness in the cause under sections 390 and 391 of the Code..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, on which the application was made, stated that Moore, more than ten years previously, entered into an agreement with plaintiff, to pay to her, for a period which had not yet expired, a monthly sum of one hundred dollars per month. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>defendant had continuously acted as Moore\u2019s attorney and agent in receiving from him and paying over to the plaintiff the monthly allowance. That for about seven years he had withheld a percentage of the monthly sums, claiming it as a commission, such commission increasing, as time passed on, from five per cent, to fifteen per cent.; and that on recent occasions defendant had paid her only fifty dollars a month, stating that Moore was unable to pay more than that. That plaintiff had kept no accounts, and could not state the particular times or amounts of moneys so withheld ; and could not, otherwise than by defendant\u2019s testimony, prove what sums he had received from Moore for plaintiff\u2019s use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-5\">Deponent further swore to merits, on advice of counsel, and stated that the testimony of the defendant as a witness on her behalf, was material and necessary; that without its benefit she could not safely proceed with the trial of the action, and could not properly frame a complaint and state the particulars thereof, with such accuracy and certainty as are proper and requisite in the premises.' That plaintiff,, expected to prove all the foregoing facts by defendant\u2019s examination, and the particulars, dates and amounts, of all moneys so received and paid over or withheld, and that her application was made in good faith, and solely for eliciting proof as aforesaid of matters which she had no other means of proving.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-6\">Pursuant to the order issued on this application, defendant appeared, and objected to the examination, on the grounds, among others, \u201cthat the affidavit of the plaintiff shows no cause for such examination,\u201d and \u201cthat no issue has been joined in the action, and such examination cannot be had before issue joined.\u201d These objections were overruled, and the defendant ordered to submit to an examination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-7\">Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>Henry Whittaker, </em>for the defendant, appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGa\">Insisted that as a witness can only be examined <em>de bene </em>esse, unless issue has been joined, a party is subject to the same restriction,\u2014citing Bell <em>v. </em>Richmond ; and that even if the change in rule 21 allowed the court the power, it could only be with propriety exercised in case of necessity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-5\"><em>A.

The party may be compelled to attend, as a party to be examined <em>conditionally,\u2014\u201cid est,\u201d </em>by summons (\u00a7 392.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-8\">IY. Rule 21 clearly contemplates an examination to enable the party to frame his complaint, &amp;c. This was long subsequent to the decision in 50 <em>Barb., </em>referred to by defendant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-9\">V. The superior court and common pleas have both given this construction to the Code and rule (Hadley <em>v. </em>Fowler, 12 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S., </em>244).</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b141-11\"> Compare the preceding case, Winston <em>v. </em>English. In Havemeyer <em>v. </em>Ingersoll, 12 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S., </em>301, the supreme court at special term held that the court had power to order an examination before issue, and in that case ordered the examination at the instance' of the plaintiff, to enable him to prepare his complaint.
